A failure to include women\u2019s livelihoods in programming to mitigate the impact of HIV and AIDS risks negating important gains that have been made in increased access to ART and health care, jeopardizing the achievement of the Universal Access and Millennium Development Goals. There is a clear need for action to support livelihood activities and address the socio- economic impact of HIV and AIDS on women and their families, and a strong call from people living with HIV for action to address the situation. Activities have been undertaken in the region since the early 1990s but few of these specifically targeted women living with HIV.

Documentation of these activities and their results is sparse, but is sufficient to provide a picture of the diversity in settings, beneficiaries and approaches that have been undertaken in the Asian region, if not their effectiveness. A total of 10 initiatives, including the WWP, are reviewed, covering those in Cambodia, China, India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The range of approaches found include microfinance, vocational training, livelihoods and social enterprises. The settings of these activities include rural, urban, and border areas, and beneficiaries have included women and men living with HIV and their families, key affected populations, displaced persons, survivors of trafficking and other vulnerable populations, and members of the general population. While few activities have directly involved women living with HIV, positive women have been included in more general approaches to socio-economic support. However, few activities have addressed the needs of young people, or of women living with HIV in the community not involved in self-help groups or similar organizations. All approaches reviewed resulted in increased financial well-being of beneficiaries; however, the greatest benefit for all people living with HIV involved, especially women, has been their personal empowerment. The increased self-confidence and self-esteem resulting from involvement in socio-economic support activities has led to significant improvements in the quality of other areas of their lives, in particular health, access to services, and social acceptance. 2 The most common approach in the region is one based on support for livelihoods and income generation through microfinance, supplemented by vocational or other training in specific skills. Social enterprises, as distinct from micro-enterprises supported under microfinance, have been few in number. Apart from the WWP, only two other examples were identified in the region, although it is likely that many other undocumented examples exist. Most socio-economic support activities have been implemented in rural areas, with a focus on agriculture, or related occupations, or small enterprises that cater for the needs of rural communities. Within these activities the needs of women living with HIV are addressed in several different ways. These include a direct focus on women living with HIV, as in WWP\u2019s Chennai and Phnom Penh sites, inclusion of women under a broader focus on people living with HIV in general, as in the activities supported by Population and Community Development Association (PDA) in Thailand, Khmer HIV/AIDS NGO Alliance (KHANA) in Cambodia, and Pact in Myanmar and China, and support for women living with HIV under a broad focus on vulnerable populations, as in the Weaving Destination (WD) project under WWP in Assam India, and the Pattanarak Foundation project in Thailand. While women living with HIV are not specifically targeted in all of these activities, they constitute a high proportion of the beneficiaries. Changes in the nature of the HIV epidemic in the region means that, in future, the needs of key affected populations (men who have sex with men; transgender persons; sex workers, people who inject drugs, and people living with HIV and their households) will have to feature much more prominently in the response. Findings of this review suggest that, with appropriate support, economic empowerment initiatives such as microfinance and social enterprises can be successfully employed with people living with HIV and members of key affected populations. With greater access to HIV treatment (anti-retroviral treatment), workplace interventions can also be expected to become increasingly important in addressing the socio-economic impact of HIV, as health challenges diminish and the issue of stigma and discrimination becomes the main reason why people living with HIV do not participate in the workforce. Promotion of workers\u2019 rights and conditions, that would increase understanding of HIV and AIDS and allow more flexibility in regard to working hours and medical leave for regular health check-ups and replenishment of HIV medicines, may prove to be a more effective use of resources. A comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the different approaches described would be important in assessing the merits of workplace interventions relative to direct support for socio-economic activities such as social enterprises that are based on groups. There is considerable variation across the region in terms of the types of partnerships established to support socio-economic activities among people living with HIV and vulnerable groups.

Available information suggests that, whatever the approach selected, the chances of success and sustainability are improved considerably through continuous support from a strong local partner with community development experience. This can be seen in several of the initiatives reviewed, including the Sunflower Support Groups in Viet Nam, the Economic Livelihoods Programme in Cambodia supported by KHANA, the Positive Partnership Project (PPP) in Thailand supported by PDA, the Pattanarak Foundation\u2019s activities in Sangkhlaburi, Thailand, and the NEDAN Foundation\u2019s support for Weaving Destination in Assam, India under the WWP. However, for successful development of socio-economic activities, the enterprise must eventually become independent of the supporting organization. This is particularly important with social enterprises. Lessons learned from this comparison of approaches to socio-economic support for women and other populations living with and affected by HIV in the Asian region include: \u2022\ufffd Given opportunities to participate, people living with HIV, in particular women, can derive important benefits from socio-economic support activities, including generation of increased income, personal empowerment and improved quality of life, and increased social acceptance; 3 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia \u2022\ufffd Without systematic documentation of activities and results, comparison of different approaches and assessment of effectiveness is challenging; \u2022\ufffd Social enterprise approaches may not be suitable for addressing the needs of women living with HIV in all situations, and selection of an exclusively female, or even an exclusively HIV positive approach, depends on the setting; \u2022\ufffd Socio-economic support activities can successfully address the needs of key affected populations and, with changes in the nature of the epidemic in the Asian region, will become increasingly important; \u2022\ufffd Identification of a strong local partner with strong experience in social enterprise and community development that can provide on-going support to beneficiaries is crucial in the success of social enterprise and other socio-economic support activities for women living with HIV and vulnerable populations. It is clear that there remains an important need for action to address the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and their families in the Asian region and support for microfinance, livelihoods and social enterprises can make an important difference to the quality of women\u2019s lives, empower and increase acceptance by society. A failure to address this issue puts at risk the important gains that have been made through increased access to ART and health services for women living with HIV. For this reason, the main recommendation of this report is that support for activities to address the socio-economic impact of HIV continue, combined with efforts to identify the approaches that are most effective with due considerations to the contexts, appropriate capacity assessment and strong local support. General recommendations for future support of activities to address the socio-economic situation of women living with HIV (and people living with HIV in general) in the Asian region are as follows: \u2022\ufffd In future programming, governments and donors should consider support for activities under a three-pronged strategy that includes: i. targeting of activities at members of key populations (e.g. sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgendered persons, people who inject drugs, and people living with HIV) and their partners; ii. ensuring that broad-based socio-economic support activities targeted at populations made vulnerable by poverty, displacement or other causes are designed to be HIV-sensitive (i.e. HIV-sensitive social protection); and iii. supporting HIV workplace policy with strong anti-discrimination clauses and legal redress mechanisms for HIV-related discriminations, to ensure that women and people living with HIV can enter the workforce and retain their jobs as equals with other workers. This would include the abolishment of HIV tests as a prerequisite for obtaining or renewing a work contract or visa. \u2022\ufffd Programme design for socio-economic support activities should be based on a long-term commitment that includes: i. planning for a learning process among beneficiaries, with provision for documentation and sharing of the results of activities and lessons learned from implementation; and ii. a clear definition of objectives and indicators to measure progress against these. \u2022\ufffd Social enterprises should be considered as one of a range of available options for socio-economic support, depending on the specific context. \u2022\ufffd Implementation of social enterprises should be undertaken only where a strong local NGO or equivalent local partner organization with experience in social enterprise and community development is available for close, on-going support, not only periodic technical assistance. 4 Specific recommendations for people living with HIV networks and CBOs considering the social enterprise approach include the following: \u2022\ufffd In identification of potential business models, where possible social enterprises that involve", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dc327804-4372-4871-976d-d5a681f177dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "dc327804-4372-4871-976d-d5a681f177dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daed8360a3ca9d1124f2b794952adc8746cdf2233291ff16a944e00959f15655"}}, "hash": "daed8360a3ca9d1124f2b794952adc8746cdf2233291ff16a944e00959f15655", "text": "highly competitive markets should be avoided, unless there is a low cost of overheads, such as raw materials and rent, and existence of a strong funding reserve that can ameliorate delays in cash flow, ensure regular maintenance and replacement of equipment and ensure recruitment and retention of staff with essential specialized skills. \u2022\ufffd In assessing the feasibility of proposed business models, consideration should be given to who the main beneficiaries of the activity will be, their number, the ways in which the social enterprise will benefit them, and the mechanism by which this will be achieved. There should be full involvement of beneficiaries with support from those with skills and experience in this process in order to ensure understanding, commitment and robust business plans. \u2022\ufffd If possible, the proposed business model should build on an existing skills base among beneficiaries, rather than relying on training to meet gaps in expertise in areas essential to success of the venture. While on-going skills training is essential, resources are most effectively used on improving existing skills and learning additional specific skills that will add value to the products and services, rather than on provision of basic training. \u2022\ufffd In appraisal of the potential business model, the main implementing organization should conduct a rigorous self-appraisal to assess whether it has sufficient capacity to manage, on a long-term basis, the challenge of the additional activities of implementation of the social enterprise, without minimum negative impact on the core activities of the organization. It is also important to identify the local resource availability where beneficiaries\u2019 adoptability and acceptability is at stake, before considering an appropriate business model. \u2022\ufffd In order to help ensure smooth implementation and operation of the social enterprise, a clear management plan should be put in place from inception, including establishment of a management board or steering committee with the strong local patronage and the engagement of relevant experts, a staff organogram indicating reporting responsibilities and accountability, detailed job descriptions for all positions, and a monitoring and evaluation framework. It should also clearly indicate how internal conflicts should be handled in a professional and fair manner, with minimum disturbances to business operations. The management plan should be reviewed regularly and revised accordingly. \u2022\ufffd Initial planning should include a provision for eventual separation of the NGO/CBO and the business component of the enterprise. It is essential that this be reflected in the management structure and that, among both partners and beneficiaries, there is a recognition of, and commitment to, adoption of a business-like approach in operation of the enterprise. \u2022\ufffd It is critical to secure support from those with strong business experiences from the onset, as well as long-term support to develop and grow a social enterprise as it takes time, particularly when capacity concerns exist. 5 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia This review of socio-economic empowerment initiatives for women living with HIV in Asia complements the assessment of the Women and Wealth Project, supported by the United Nations Development Programme Asia-Pacific Regional Centre and implemented by the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand. The purpose of this review is to compare the approach used in the WWP with those employed in other similar initiatives in the region and make general recommendations based upon the findings of the WWP assessment and the review. For purposes of comparison with the assessment of the Women and Wealth Project, this review focuses on several key areas, including the type of approach employed, beneficiaries, setting, partnerships and, where information permits, results in three main areas corresponding to the objectives of the WWP: 1. The financial benefits of the respective approaches to the beneficiaries; 2. Individual empowerment of women living with HIV in terms of increased self- confidence, self-respect and general well-being; 3. Impact of activities on the socio-cultural environment in relation to increasing the understanding and acceptance of society of people living with HIV. The review is largely based on information obtained from a desk review of available documentation on activities in this area in the Asian region, supplemented by information obtained from interviews.1 As noted later in the narrative, the documentation is sketchy at best and, in many cases only broad descriptions of activities are available, with very little information on results of implementation. The scope of the assignment did not permit the additional allocation of time and resources that would be needed to undertake a more systematic and comprehensive review. For this reason, the detailed information necessary to fully address the three specific results areas mentioned above was not available.

Microfinance (often synonymous with \u201cmicro-credit\u201d) generally refers to the provision of credit, usually in the form of funds that can be borrowed at low interest rates, with a view to 1 See people met or contacted during the assessment, Annex, The Women and Wealth Project: Results Assessment. introduCtion 1 6 enabling beneficiaries to break the cycle of indebtedness to moneylenders, and establish activities that will enable them to generate sustainable incomes. Microfinance can be based on funds derived from donors or from the beneficiaries themselves, through savings fund schemes. In either case, in most schemes the money borrowed is repaid together with interest, and made available to other beneficiaries in the form of \u201crevolving funds\u201d. Savings groups are usually designed to help beneficiaries manage their income through regular contribution of a fixed minimal amount of money to a fund that is run by a group or collective. From the accumulated capital the group makes loans to members, based on agreed guidelines, at low interest rates. From the profits generated through repayment of funds plus interest, a dividend is often paid to members. Savings groups are usually operated in conjunction with vocational training and technical support to enable members to establish and sustain income generation activities and better manage their financial returns. Sustainable livelihood approaches employ a broader strategy to help beneficiaries find safe, productive employment by building their capacity and providing resources and opportunities to develop workplace skills, confidence and health. Sustainable livelihood programmes seek to create long-term lasting solutions to poverty by empowering their target population and addressing their overall well-being.2 Globally there is a wide range of livelihood initiatives, and while each needs to be adapted to the specific context where it is implemented, there seems to be general agreement that the most successful are those that are family-centered and self-supporting.3 The term \u201csocial enterprise\u201d usually refers to business ventures that engage in trade for social purposes, with the profits generated being reinvested in the business to sustain it, or used for social purposes, rather than maximizing profits to shareholders.4 5 While they may incorporate microfinance and livelihood components, social enterprises are usually focused on the benefits that result from the success of the business as a whole, rather than those that come directly to the individuals operating it through their involvement. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) generally refers to the incorporation of responsibility for a company\u2019s actions and encouragement of a positive impact into its business model. CSR-focused businesses engage in support for community growth and development, and voluntarily avoid practices that harm the public interest.6 Thus, while they share some features in common, CSR differs from social enterprise fundamentally in terms of purpose: whereas social enterprises are established primarily for social ends, businesses that adopt a CSR approach are still primarily focused on profit-making, but want to conduct business in a more socially responsible way. As will be seen in the following review, all these different approaches are reflected in the activities that have been undertaken in the Asian region to address the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and other people affected by or vulnerable to HIV. 2 Fact Sheet on Youth Reproductive Health Policy: Sustainable Livelihood Programs and HIV/AIDS, USAID Health Policy Initiative, 2009. 3 \u201cIncome generation and sustainable livelihoods for people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS\u201d, Global Jobs Pact Policy Brief No. 16, ILO, n.d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "91f153e1-0a7d-42e3-88ce-bef580e48f30": {"__data__": {"id_": "91f153e1-0a7d-42e3-88ce-bef580e48f30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ed9e7df6f280ff7c7efd80557971e5cfb61cc825429d97ef1b6cebba5ad9048"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd20a949-538e-4c47-8bf4-34ab2cfd9caa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "466a17b3e64a90f3a6e060554a90b64d02e9bc81162948bce0f06d57e8f4b1ed"}}, "hash": "fdad2c73c41cc36c18b4a158ddeeddc36a2f99a6cee834f85d59184ac70d2b2c", "text": "16, ILO, n.d. 4 http://www.socialenterprise.org.uk 5 http://www.enterprisingnonprofits.ca/about_social_enterprise/definitions 6 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_social_responsibility 7 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia Of the estimated 4.9 million people living with HIV in Asia, over 35 percent (around 1.7 million) are women.7 However, although they bear a disproportionate share of the impact of the HIV epidemic, the impact of HIV on women in Asia has for the most part been overlooked and under-estimated.

As well, they are confronted by the challenges of gender inequality and poverty that make them more vulnerable to its impact. The need for financial support and a livelihood is important for all women; however, a positive HIV diagnosis compounds the problems women face in finding and keeping work.8 Women living with HIV are often unable, or unwilling, to continue working or to seek work. This can be for a range of reasons, including health concerns, stigma and discrimination, self-stigmatization, compulsory blood testing, insurance conditions, and lack of flexibility in working hours that prevents taking leave for medical appointments and the amount of work required at home such as caring for a sick husband. Loss of livelihood can make women highly vulnerable to rapid impoverishment, affect their health, and lead them into transactional sex, unsafe migration and human trafficking for survival. The lack of income- earning opportunities for women living with HIV also increases the vulnerability of their families, increasing the pressure on children to leave the education system to work. In broader perspective, a failure to include attention to women\u2019s livelihoods in programming to mitigate the impact of HIV runs the risk of negating the important gains that have been made recently in increased access to HIV treatment or ART and health care, and also jeopardizes the achievement of the Universal Access goals as well as the Millennium Development Goals 1 (poverty and hunger), 2 (universal education), 3 (women\u2019s empowerment), 5 (maternal mortality), and 6 (HIV/AIDS). The importance of socio- economic support for women living with HIV is also reflected in the recommendations of the 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia (see Box 1). The issue of insufficient economic security, coupled with stigma and discrimination associated with HIV has been a major concern among people living with HIV in the region. In 2004 the International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (ICW) recognized the importance of addressing the economic situation of women living with HIV, as well as its close links to the issues of empowerment and gender equality, calling for increased support for activities that empower women living with HIV and provide them with livelihood opportunities. These activities include: support for self-help groups, participation in which can help women discover livelihood opportunities; research to identify effective income generating activities and the specific factors that make them successful; support for strategies that increase women\u2019s financial independence, such as micro-credit schemes; and support for training of women in areas such as management and marketing, as well 7 Global Report: UNAIDS report on the global AIDS epidemic 2010, UNAIDS, 2010. 8 ICW Vision Paper 3: HIV Positive Women, Poverty and Gender Inequality, The International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS (ICW), 2004. bACkground 2 8 as the basic skills necessary for the occupational areas identified. The need for supporting women\u2019s economic independence as part of HIV response is also strongly reflected in the 2011 UN Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS.9 A study of women\u2019s access to HIV services in Asia, which surveyed 1,306 positive women from six countries in Asia and was published in 2009 by the women\u2019s working group of the Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV (APN+)10, found that most women living with HIV (78.7 percent) do not have adequate financial resources to access HIV services, including transport, with 60 percent of women lacking sufficient income to maintain their health needs. Women living in rural areas are significantly more disadvantaged than those in urban areas. Over 54 percent of women included in the study said they needed income generation support, a need that was significantly greater for women 30 years and older. The report expressed a strong and urgent need for livelihood opportunities for women living with HIV in Asia. 9 See full texts at http://www.un.org/en/ga/aidsmeeting2011/ 10 A long walk \u2013 Challenges to women\u2019s access to HIV services in Asia, Women\u2019s Working Group of APN+, APN+, 2009.

Source: Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an Effective Response, Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008. 9 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia Translation into effective programming of the clear and urgent need for socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS on women, and their families, presents an important challenge. While there is a substantial body of experience in the Asian region on the empowerment of women through microfinance, livelihood, skills training and other approaches11, it is not simply a matter of adapting these activities for use with women living with HIV. As in implementation of activities with women in general in the region, there are important challenges related to the extreme heterogeneity of the beneficiary group, which includes women from a range of backgrounds and social contexts, so that activities appropriate to a rural context differ considerably from those in urban settings, and those that address the needs of educated women will differ considerably from those with limited education. However, in addition to these factors, issues such as confidentiality, stigma and discrimination, health status, laws, religion and gender issues determine the type and scope of activities implemented to promote the socio-economic empowerment of women living with HIV. Activities to address the socio-economic situation of people living with HIV have been undertaken in the region since the full impact of the epidemic became apparent in the early 1990s. While few of these specifically targeted women living with HIV, in many cases most of the beneficiaries were women and the activities were designed to address their needs.12 In Thailand at the height of the HIV epidemic many community-level programmes included a component that attempted to address this issue. Using funding available from government income promotion schemes, activities such as artificial flower and basket making were supported in conjunction with community or hospital-based self-help groups for people living with HIV. These activities were generally undertaken on an ad hoc basis, with no consideration for marketing, design or quality control, and as a result office storerooms quickly filled with unsold goods. The best that can be said of these initiatives is that they served as a type of occupational therapy, in a context where ARVs were unavailable and there were high levels of community stigma and discrimination against people living with HIV.13 Even where more effective activities were attempted, these were still done on an ad hoc basis and mostly failed through lack of provision for additional technical support. For example, raising of chickens provided free of charge by agricultural extension offices by families affected by HIV in rural villages in Northern Thailand failed when the chickens died due to lack of vaccinations and advice on feeding. In the late 1990s, a number of attempts were made to synthesize the lessons that had been learned from the various approaches that had been taken in response to the socio-economic impact of HIV and AIDS in Thailand and other countries in the region. Some of the results of these efforts were published by UNDP under its South East Asia HIV and Development 11 See, for example, Albee (1994); UNESCO (2003). 12 In some areas the gender balance was so skewed that the members of one self-help group in Northern Thailand chose to call themselves \u201cthe Doi Saket Widows Group\u201d (see Seri, 1996). 13 Some activities, while more feasible, were felt to be inappropriate, for example the proposal by members of the New Life Friends group to establish a \u201cmoranakit\u201d (\u201ddeath industries\u201d) business enterprise that would produce funeral goods. ApproAChes to soCio-eConomiC empowerment of women living with hiv in the AsiAn region 3 10 Project. Among them were a number of innovative approaches that linked community development and governance. These aimed at strengthening communities\u2019 resilience and capacity to prevent HIV as well as provide care and treatment for their members affected by HIV, such as provision of health coverage through village savings groups.14 The major breakthroughs in effectiveness and cost reduction of ARVs at the end of the 1990\u2019s, followed by an increased international donor focus on access to care and treatment after the UNGASS meeting in June 2001, seems to have been the impetus for development of some important livelihood and impact mitigation programmes for people living with HIV in the region. These included programmes by the EU/EC, ILO, the World Bank, the Ford Foundation, the Clinton Foundation, USAID and UNDP APRC and country offices, as well as a host of initiatives", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67760295-786d-4416-aeea-bd05d125ff74": {"__data__": {"id_": "67760295-786d-4416-aeea-bd05d125ff74", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76ac1f36a967d2ce91d9c06a39e515d72678ef89d508928c5d98a1f46d196711"}}, "hash": "76ac1f36a967d2ce91d9c06a39e515d72678ef89d508928c5d98a1f46d196711", "text": "supported by INGOs, foundations and other bodies. Unfortunately the documentation of these activities, especially their results, tends to be sparse, but the selection here of several sufficiently diverse examples will, it is hoped, serve the purpose of providing a basis for discussion of the strategies that have been most effective in addressing the needs of women living with HIV. 3.1 sunflower support groups, vietnam The Sun Flower Groups in North Viet Nam are an example of socio-economic support activities that are based on self-help groups for women living with HIV. There are six groups, in four provinces, the first being established in Hanoi in 2004 under the auspices of the Vietnam Red Cross. There are now over 750 members. Key project partners include the Medical Committee Netherlands Vietnam (MCNV), and a network of organizations including the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union (national, provincial and district levels), the Red Cross, hospitals, and other health service organizations. The key project intervention of the Sunflower Support Groups is to assist members to organize themselves and to improve access to existing social, health and economic services including ARV treatment and microfinance loans. To qualify for a loan, each woman has to formulate a personal development plan describing and prioritizing her social, medical and economic needs. Women who prioritize increasing their income receive assistance to apply for a job or vocational training. Those planning to start a business can apply for an interest-free loan of up to US$300 USD for nine months. Based on repayment, business performance and the proposed business plan, women can borrow repeatedly to a maximum of US$5,000. All loan applicants must accept assessment visits to their households and proposed business location, to examine individual and family income, assets and business viability.15 While information is not available on the financial benefits the project has produced for individual women, loan repayment rates can serve as a proxy indicator for the success of activities undertaken. In fact repayment rates varied quite widely between the provinces involved, from approximately 40 percent in Ha Noi, to over 98 percent in Thai Nguyen province. In regard to empowerment of the women, a qualitative evaluation undertaken between 2004 and 2007 indicated that beneficiaries had gained self-confidence and self-esteem, learned to communicate with their peers and express their needs to service providers. In addition, women had increased their knowledge about treatment and their rights, accessed other state services, such as loans, counseling and legal advice, and gained access to school and treatment for their children. Group participation helped reduce the women\u2019s sense of isolation, and provided opportunities to share experiences and learn from others. Support groups also helped address conflicts between members and their families, and raise awareness about HIV and AIDS.16 14 Seri Phongphit: 2001 and 2002. 15 Final Report, Global Review of Good Practices on the Intersections Between HIV/AIDS and Economic Empowerment, Ford Foundation, March, 2009. 16 Ibid. 11 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia 3.2 positive partnership programme, thailand In 2001, with funding from UNAIDS and others donors, the Population and Community Development Association of Thailand set up a pilot micro-credit project aimed at helping people living with HIV. Initially loans were offered only to people living with HIV, who were guaranteed low-cost or free access to anti-retroviral drugs through programmes sponsored by other civil society organizations or the government. Eligibility criteria were later extended to include family members, orphans and other people affected by HIV and AIDS.17 From this initial project around 2003, PDA developed the Positive Partnership model, which pairs a person who is living with HIV with a non-positive person in the same community to work on a micro-enterprise activity supported by a small loan. The model was based on PDA\u2019s experience of support for micro-credit schemes for people living with HIV in rural communities in northern and northeastern Thailand. This second project, which became known as the Positive Partnership Programme, was supported with funds from UNAIDS and the British Embassy. USAID provided funding for implementation in urban areas of Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Chonburi provinces, with technical support provided by Family Health International (FHI) and, later, Pact, using USAID funds. Based on results of the two pilots described above, the model was further developed and funds were obtained through USAID and the Pfizer Thailand Foundation to expand the scope of the project. Funds from the Pfizer Thailand Foundation were used from 2004 to implement the model in eight provinces of the North and Northeast regions of Thailand. There is considerable variation in the operation of the model among implementation sites in Thailand, but in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "37e1e53b-c858-4290-b7b1-72e308401ae2": {"__data__": {"id_": "37e1e53b-c858-4290-b7b1-72e308401ae2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8542583363ed20ac1bd801b9b19b1aed66e1e7865ad45294cb5f7260b3d13f1b"}}, "hash": "8542583363ed20ac1bd801b9b19b1aed66e1e7865ad45294cb5f7260b3d13f1b", "text": "the basic model, PDA works closely with communities to identify people living with HIV who are interested in joining the project. HIV support groups are involved in this process and fully participate, particularly in urban areas. In cooperation with HIV support groups and PDA, the person living with HIV works with a non-positive partner in their community to identify a business opportunity, for which a loan is requested from PDA. The person living with HIV and partner jointly receive the loan so that they can work together on the selected enterprise. The incentive of access to micro-credit has helped foster the partnerships. Loans have been used to establish small-scale enterprises, often related to farming but also including trading and other small businesses, which has provided an opportunity for people living with HIV to increase their income. The selection criteria for people living with HIV within the PPP is that they must be in need of financial assistance, have a clear business plan and previous business experience, the business must be feasible and they must be able to work. Loan approval also includes a commitment by the applicants that they regularly attend meetings and briefings and agree to repay the loan on time. In assessment of business plans, selection committees focus on procurement plans for raw materials, investment costs, product pricing, profit analysis, business location and logistics, competitor analysis, and marketing or sales strategy, with a view to determining the plan\u2019s feasibility.18 A key feature of the model is that the micro-credit aspect of the scheme is used as an entry point to reduce both individual and community stigmatization. The model is designed to reduce stigma and discrimination through economic empowerment, with the potential to change the knowledge and behavior of members of many communities, even though the number of loan recipients is relatively small. In order to help measure the impact of activities, at both the personal and community level, PDA developed the \u201cBamboo Ladder\u201d (BLA) self-assessment tool. Using the BLA, participants use a ten-point scale to fill out diagrams corresponding to five key areas relating to their well-being. These consist of: physical health; mental health; social condition; economic condition; and quality of life. When used regularly, the BLS provides a useful means of measuring changes that have occurred in people\u2019s lives and their future aspirations. 17 The Positive Partnerships Program in Thailand: Empowering People Living with HIV, UNAIDS Best practice Collection, UNAIDS, 2007. 18 Ibid. 12 Since the commencement of the project, 1,055 pairs, that is 2,110 people, have received support under the PPP.19 Women have comprised the majority of participants. After five years operation of the project, more than 42 percent of all participants paired two women; 39 percent were composed of one man and one woman; and about 19 percent consisted of two men.20 A measure of the success of the model in generation of increased income for beneficiaries is that, in the period from its inception until 2007, 91 percent of loans were repaid on time.21 During the period that the model has been in operation, it has evolved and adapted to fit the different environments that are faced in various parts of Thailand. Local innovations have been piloted and, where successful, are being scaled-up to include other regions. In some areas in the north the Positive Partnership model approach is integrated into the existing village bank infrastructure, which is community owned and managed. Urban and rural models funded by different donors have been implemented somewhat differently to take into account the varying nature of social relations and levels of stigma and discrimination and that exist in rural and urban areas. 23 Even within rural areas, however, the model has been flexible and has changed to adapt to local conditions or take advantage of local opportunities. The PPP has contributed to improved economic conditions for the families of people living with HIV and raised the visibility and acceptance of people living with HIV in many communities in urban and rural Thailand. For beneficiaries living with HIV, PPP has proved effective in improving their self-confidence, health, and increased their social acceptance and re-integration into the community. People living with HIV report that they no longer feel that they must accept discrimination against them, or hide from society. Participation in group activities has led to significant improvements in the quality of the lives of the people living with HIV involved, with support, understanding and assistance from others, leadership roles in their communities, and greater access to health care and treatment.

Under the initial model, implemented from 2003 to 2010, support was directed at income generation activities, with small grants provided to individuals or households to start, or strengthen, small agricultural enterprises. Grants were supported with intermittent training, although with little follow up, and additional assistance was obtained from the World Food Programme for nutritional support to complement the small grants. From 2010, in collaboration with DAI, the model was revised to a household asset maximization approach to develop a more systematic approach. Village Savings and Loans Schemes were established, supported by ongoing training and follow up, to maximize savings. Technical and skills support is provided in areas such as land management, water management, business skills, and animal husbandry to enable beneficiaries to use their savings to start or strengthen small businesses. High performing beneficiaries are also able to access small grants. The new model was developed to promote sustainability through incorporation of village savings and loan associations, which changes beneficiary expectations from ongoing NGO and donor financial support to independent saving and investment. The model promotes behaviour change in economic activities, which increases self-reliance and ability to respond to economic, health and social stresses. The main funders from 2003-2010 were the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, under the Rounds 5 and 7 grants, and USAID and the EC, through the International AIDS Alliance. Currently the livelihood programme is being funded by the EC/Alliance, USAID, and the GFATM. Support from the EC through the Alliance ended in December 2011, and GFATM Round 5 in September 2011. DAI is also one of KHANA\u2019s collaborating partners, providing technical support under the USAID grant agreement. The partnership ended in Sept 2011. 27 From 2003-2010 KHANA worked in 19 out of 24 provinces in Cambodia; however the new model is being pilot-tested in six provinces (three with European Commission and three with USAID support). The beneficiary group has also been broadened: from 2003-2010 the criteria for receiving small grants were to be a person living with HIV, have a poor socio\u2013 economic status and be a member of a KHANA self-help group. Under the revised approach the livelihoods programme targets people living with HIV, children affected by HIV, and members of key affected populations who belong to KHANA-supported self-help groups.

Beneficiaries of the project include people living with HIV, and families affected by HIV in Shanxi Province. The project builds on what was initiated by UNDP\u2019s previous experience with microfinance operations in 48 rural counties in China, and the collaboration with the Rural Credit Cooperatives (RCC), as the main microfinance institution, utilizes RCC\u2019s extensive networks down to township and village levels across rural China. UNDP China also mobilized resources from the provincial Poverty Reduction Office to provide the Guarantee Fund in order to ensure access to micro-credit by people living with HIV under a participatory and transparent management system, with a Board of stakeholders that included people living with HIV. The project provided training to staff of the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who assist in the mobilization of people living with HIV and their families to apply for microfinance services to the Rural Credit Cooperative. UNDP also conducted a needs assessment and provided technical assistance to national consultants to conduct training programmes for different components of the project and to develop an appropriate financial management system. In order to maintain confidentiality regarding the HIV status of beneficiaries, special training programmes were conducted for loan managers and other staff members of the Rural Credit Cooperatives. The loan agreements state explicitly that the cooperatives should not disclose the HIV status of the beneficiary. Partners in the project include the China International Center for Economics and Technology Exchange, the National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control, the Provincial Poverty Reduction Office of Shanxi, Rural Credit Cooperative of Shanxi, and Municipal Government, including Wenxi and Xia County Governments. To date, over 100 households affected by HIV have benefited from the microfinance scheme and another 100 are in the process of submitting applications. Beneficiaries have doubled or tripled their income through various economic activities, such as animal husbandry. This scheme has also enabled them to transport their produce to county markets, and has provided a stimulus to improve local transport services. Another noteworthy outcome is that none of the children from HIV-affected families have been compelled to drop out of school due to economic difficulties or peer pressure. Furthermore, the project\u2019s income generating activities, through the microfinance scheme, have created incentives for villagers to remain in Shanxi, rather than migrating to other provinces, thereby potentially reducing vulnerability to HIV. Some factors that contributed to the success of the project include the right choice of implementing partners, addressing financial literacy as one of the first steps in mobilizing people living with HIV and their families to participate in the project, which continued to 28 UNDP China, n.d. 15 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia be strengthened through the project,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "519c4f83-a7e5-4a5c-bc74-82ffe87aa408": {"__data__": {"id_": "519c4f83-a7e5-4a5c-bc74-82ffe87aa408", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "423f8b4bae2d6d7a8269a22a5a18938461fed89691c30f6468ceb698c928ec0e"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c36b8cd-62d6-4bbe-a1ad-8a806c31a78b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5441164803e0ea9db5fc7e46956e1b28b736cc8410bfb19c021eb2cc54d5be38"}}, "hash": "1116fb119c030267506f7885b2b593cc515ca328e39c1a1ca83b5f31761087cb", "text": "and respect and protection for the rights of people living with HIV.

Since 2000, the Foundation\u2019s HIV prevention and public awareness education programme has been extended to Guangxi, Hunan and Henan, another province in central China seriously affected by HIV. The micro-credit project aims to improve the quality of life for the families of people living with HIV and to help them re-enter mainstream society by supporting them to take part in income-generating projects. The Amity Foundation provides a loan of CNY 2,000 (US$240), which beneficiaries can use to pursue income-generation activities, fitting in with and making use of local resources. Recipients are required to pay back the loan within two years so that the money can go towards supporting other families in need.29 3.6 empowerment through self-help income generation for people living with hiv in myanmar30 To provide a financial safety net for people with HIV, Pact Myanmar built on existing experience providing livelihoods assistance to support groups living with HIV by adapting WORTH, an award-winning savings-led microfinance and micro-enterprise programme. The WORTH model combines two integrated approaches: 1) economic independence through community banking and small business development; and 2) care and support through self-care and support among members. As people living with HIV begin saving together in small groups, they learn how to make loans, start micro-businesses, and transform their savings groups into community banks. As bank owners and managers, people living with HIV collect the interest on the loans they make to each other and then distribute it back as dividends to themselves. This gives each member two income streams, from their own micro-business and the bank\u2019s dividends, increasing the members\u2019 wealth and financial security. Once their banks become established and their businesses begin to grow, they can take on other issues related to self-care and stigma reduction. Loans taken out by group members have been used to establish small businesses that help earn a daily income, such as driving a motorbike/trishaw taxi, and selling snacks. Four groups operate group businesses such as selling brooms or running a pay phone service. These types of businesses are recommended because they provide an opportunity for a higher turnover. Data collected with 15 groups beginning in 2008 shows that another benefit of the programme is a reduction in the number of high interest external loans held by members, which decreased by half from the beginning of the project until August 2010.31 By March 2011, there were 22 savings groups and the total savings had reached US$20,273. In the 2010-2011 reporting period there were over 420 members of the savings groups, of who around 70 percent of members were female.32 Female members constitute the majority of WORTH participants and they also tend to have higher levels of savings, contribute higher rates of voluntary saving and take consistently larger and more frequent 29 Micro-credit Project for People Living with HIV/AIDS, The Amity Foundation http://www.amityfoundation. org/page.php?page=1455 30 \u201cEmpowerment through self-help income generation for people living with HIV in Myanmar\u201d, Pact/USAID, n.d. 31 Ibid. 32 \u201cSemi-annual performance report October 2010-March 2011\u201d, Pact Burma, 2011. 16 loans.

While this may have negative effects on the stability of the group if they are not sufficiently well established, for strong groups it can provide a good opportunity to access additional funding. Proposals submitted by three strong savings groups supported by Pact were approved by UNDP for funding.35 3.7 Entrepreneur groups for people living with HIV model and rehabilitation of people who inject drugs through social enterprises model, China In China, Pact partners with local civil society organizations to pilot several livelihood strengthening models for people living with HIV and other at-risk populations in the Yunnan and Guangxi provinces. Currently two models are supported. The first is the entrepreneur groups for people living with HIV model, which provides business development training, micro-loan methods, technical and social support to people living with HIV. The second is the rehabilitation of people who inject drugs through social enterprises model, which provides technical assistance to an enterprise owned and operated by recovering drug users. This model provides employment opportunities coupled with rehabilitation support. Work on other models and livelihood development interventions supporting men, women and children marginalized by the effects of HIV is underway. Pact aims to use lessons learned in these pilot sites to replicate similar projects throughout China.36 The Xingcheng Limited (see Box 2) exemplifies the success of employment opportunities for people who formerly injected drugs, or those that are stopping.

The project uses a socio-economic empowerment approach to reduce the vulnerability of displaced persons along this section of the Thai-Myanmar border, including over 20 families affected by HIV. Because they are displaced citizens from Myanmar, this group is unable to access the Thai Government\u2019s village fund schemes and other programmes, and have no voice in, or membership of, community committees. From 2007, with support from the Hussman Foundation, the Pattanarak Foundation established savings and micro-credit activities that encouraged these communities to form savings groups, with regular monthly meetings, and provision of training on accounting, group management and other relevant topics. Activities focus on income generation and expenditure reduction, and include broom making and self- sufficient environmental friendly agriculture. There are now 14 active savings groups in communities in Sangkhlaburi, with membership extending beyond the border into Mon State, Myanmar.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60eebc6f-4c66-49e2-8ed0-5c604b3754bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "60eebc6f-4c66-49e2-8ed0-5c604b3754bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f13445f09f617813825bc5d2767921d64ac41b1ec69961f33a55c33d0b018b14"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9fadaf3-90a0-4044-ad87-6eea5d3b58a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "edfc50db1e72803e12f56aedee54344f3b25ef7c71384bb3cfd4e948a7306d94"}}, "hash": "edbfa54668fee3e0bba93824520ba025b8344f756c65bf95b731a7eb716279f0", "text": "Total membership in June 2011 was over 1,464 people, and savings about THB 1.2 million (around US$39,700).

Under this initiative, the company has given user rights to till 46 acres of land to a group of 20 women living with HIV. The Suzlon Foundation, based in Maharashtra state, is supporting the project in collaboration with the national Positive Women\u2019s Network (PWN+). A national women\u2019s NGO based in Delhi, Sathi All for Partnerships (SAFP), facilitated the collaboration between PWN+ and SF as a first ever private and public agreement. In a three-year agreement made with PWN+ in 2009, SF made available 46 acres of land, along with existing assets, including 152 mature coconut trees, a farm house with a metered electricity connection, and a pump. Income is used to build a collective savings account at a bank. PWN+ identified women in and around Radhapuram village to form a group that would undertake collective income generating activities and share produce, in order to earn an income as well as to increase their self-esteem and empower them. The group subsequently established the Thirunelveli District Positive Women\u2019s Network (TPWN+). Each of the women came to the project with seed capital of 2,000 rupees (US$41). SF contributed around US$2,058 to the first year\u2019s operation of the project. After the first year\u2019s operation of the project, SF and PWN+ planned to review the conditions of the agreement, and develop a plan for the following two years\u2019 operation. One early challenge that has been encountered was that despite growing up in a rural area, few of the women involved had any real experience in farming. To help address this situation SF has also provided technical support through their CSR section, in particular regarding the use of organic farming methods. While some profits are already being generated, for example from sale of coconuts, at this stage it is too early to assess the financial success of the project. However, there have already been gains in terms of empowerment of the women involved, who have experienced increased self-worth and confidence.

In addition to income generation, the project sought to empower women through building their skills and knowledge, and also to help create a supportive environment that would promote increased acceptance and lessen stigma and discrimination against women and other people living with HIV. The initial strategy adopted by UNDP was to establish partnerships with networks of women living with HIV in the region, which would develop social enterprises that provided women with an income, form a context for training and mutual support, and serve as a positive example that would show society the capacity of women living with HIV and thus increase understanding and acceptance. PDA, a Bangkok-based NGO, which has considerable experience in implementation of microfinance projects with people living with HIV in Thailand, is the implementing agency for the WWP, which provided training and on-going support, including monitoring and evaluation. In addition, local consultants with business experience were engaged in each implementation site. Later, the strategy was varied, with the addition of a partnership between UNDP and a local NGO with community development expertise, rather than a people living with HIV network, which supported the development and implementation of a rural social enterprise in Assam, India. WWP activities were initially implemented in three countries, Cambodia, India and China. In Cambodia, activities were implemented in Phnom Penh, with the network of women living with HIV, the Cambodian Community of Women Living with HIV (CCW), as the local partner. In India, the Chennai-based Positive Women\u2019s network was the implementing partner. In China, the local partner for activities initiated in Kunming and Guangzhou was the women\u2019s branch of AIDS Care China (ACC). In each site a local consultant was hired, who worked with women living with HIV, recruited through the network of women living with HIV to identify business opportunities and then developed a business plan, which was further refined in consultation with and support from PDA. Some two years after commencement of the initial WWP activities, UNDP provided support for an additional site in Bodoland, Assam, India, in partnership with the NEDAN Foundation, a local NGO. In this case the business plan was developed by NEDAN in collaboration with the beneficiaries, who consisted of women from displaced communities who were vulnerable to HIV through trafficking, labour migration and poverty. In all sites, a key achievement of the WWP has been the empowerment of the women living with HIV involved, with an increase in their confidence and self-esteem and recognition by their communities of the important contribution they have made to their families and society. While hard to measure, WWP also helped increase the acceptance of women living with HIV by their communities, in appreciation of their efforts to improve their own well-being, and contribution to society in general. In all sites WWP, has created a safe and 43 See The assessment of WWP for more details reCAp: the women And weAlth projeCt in the Context of other similAr initiAtives in the region 4 20 supportive work environment, where workers\u2019 rights are prioritized, and there is sufficient flexibility in working time to allow employees time off work for medical appointments and regular breaks. Creation of a regular income for women involved is also an achievement of WWP, even though coverage, in relation to the total number of women living with HIV in the implementation sites, has been relatively low. Several important challenges have been encountered in the implementation of the WWP. The capacity of available human resources has proved to be a major challenge in all sites, especially in regard to recruitment and retention of women living with HIV who have the specialized skills in design, marketing, and management needed for successful implementation of the business models. The capacity of the main implementing partners in regard to management has been another important challenge; where implementing partners lacked experience, then their capacity to provide support to the social enterprises has been weak or inadequate. Lack of clarity in the relationship between networks of women living with HIV and larger people living with HIV networks, or instability within these groups,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbaea6b5-cc20-4b7d-843f-e74dbd3e50f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbaea6b5-cc20-4b7d-843f-e74dbd3e50f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "747b79b9ca3e82370b7bd452607cad41828d2c663f5a908a8eeaa06581b4b70b"}}, "hash": "747b79b9ca3e82370b7bd452607cad41828d2c663f5a908a8eeaa06581b4b70b", "text": "was also another factor that affected successful implementation of business models. Linked to the issues of staff recruitment and management has been the issue of unclear organizational structures, with, in some cases, a lack of well-defined staff job descriptions, organograms and accountability. Even when these structures were in place, they were not necessarily implemented, as was the case in Chennai and Cambodia. All sites also faced the challenge of making the shift from an NGO or CBO perspective to a more business-like approach, with adoption of a broader and more proactive approach to marketing in the business and government sectors, rather than reliance on the UN and INGO sector as the main point of access to markets. Some of the other challenges faced in implementation can be attributed to the design of the WWP. At times, there was some uncertainty among partners regarding the timeframe of the project, which was designed as a short-term pilot, and gradually extended to the current five year length. The lack of a long timeframe meant that planning activities that would have increased the opportunity for learning and capacity building within the project, such as forums, networking and exchanges between women, consultants and support personnel in the different sites, were not part of WWP. Partners felt strongly that for this type of project to be successful, a long-term commitment, of at least four to five years, is necessary and this should be agreed among partners at the start to enable adequate planning. However, given that almost all development projects operate on an annual or, at most biannual, funding cycle, expecting such long-term commitment may not be realistic and needs to be considered as an inherent limiting factor. Also, clear indicators were not included in the design for some of the expected outcomes, in particular the objectives related to empowerment of the women, and improvement in the social environment. The lack of these indicators made it hard to assess progress in achieving the objectives in these areas. 4.2 Comparison of wwp with other similar initiatives A review of similar activities in the Asian region shows that WWP is just one of a range of approaches that have been implemented to improve the socio-economic situation of women and others living with HIV. The various approaches differ in several key characteristics. These include: \u2022\ufffd The type of approach chosen: for example microfinance, savings groups, livelihood support, skills training and occupational assistance, and social enterprises. Most activities in the region appear to incorporate at least two of these models, with microfinance being the most common; \u2022\ufffd Whether women living with HIV are directly targeted by interventions, or are included in activities that are targeted more broadly at people living with HIV in general, or even whole communities felt to be vulnerable to HIV. Generally, while not directly targeted in most projects, women living with HIV have nevertheless constituted the majority of beneficiaries in the region; 21 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia \u2022\ufffd Which women living with HIV are targeted: for example, women living in rural areas, women in urban settings, women who are members of displaced populations, women considered to be vulnerable to HIV or the impact of HIV or those at an increased HIV risk among key affected populations. In fact, most activities have been implemented in rural or semi-rural areas; and \u2022\ufffd The types of partnerships established for design, implementation and support of activities. These range from government agencies and state-run unions or cooperatives, as in Viet Nam and China, to INGOs, local NGOs and CBOs, including people living with HIV self-help groups and networks. WWP differs from most other major initiatives in the region in that it: \u2022\ufffd Specifically focuses on women living with HIV; \u2022\ufffd Focuses primarily on women in urban settings; \u2022\ufffd Has been implemented primarily by local networks of women living with HIV; \u2022\ufffd Employs a social-enterprise model; \u2022\ufffd Incorporates a comprehensive plan for training and technical support for beneficiaries and associates, as well as significant assistance with marketing; \u2022\ufffd Has objectives that specifically include empowerment and improvement of the socio-cultural environment of women living with HIV, in addition to financial benefits, and results in these areas have been well-documented. In terms of effectiveness, it is very difficult to determine whether WWP has advantages over the other approaches reviewed. Very few socio-economic support activities have gone to scale and, without detailed documentation, including data on cost-effectiveness, it is difficult to assess their effectiveness. In any case, even if activities were shown to be effective in one context, it is not certain that this", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab4d1c49-571a-4d5e-b80e-38c3497758e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab4d1c49-571a-4d5e-b80e-38c3497758e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a57a7d84218f8b72a43365358e25661e4c91650d53e53ed290ea0042cf3bf144"}}, "hash": "a57a7d84218f8b72a43365358e25661e4c91650d53e53ed290ea0042cf3bf144", "text": "would be so in other settings owing to the wide differences in contexts, including types of beneficiaries and their socio-cultural situation. Given the wide variation in context across the Asian region, there is room for many different approaches, so, in practice, it should not be a question simply of one approach being more effective than another. Clearly, different approaches are needed depending on the specific context. It is more useful to focus on contrasting WWP with the various approaches, especially in relation to their apparent strengths and weaknesses, and the types of challenges that they have faced. In common with other initiatives, WWP has had positive results in the following areas: - Economic benefits; - Empowerment of women living with HIV; and - Improved socio-cultural environment. All approaches reviewed resulted in increases in the financial well-being of beneficiaries; however, the greatest benefit for all people living with HIV involved, especially women, has been seen in their personal empowerment. The increased self-confidence and self-esteem resulting from involvement in activities has led to improvements in the quality of their lives in a range of other areas, in particular health, access to services and social acceptance. This was an especially strong feature of WWP, owing to the project\u2019s specific objectives in these areas. The social enterprise model used in the WWP has not been widely used as a means of addressing the socio-economic needs of women living with HIV, or indeed people living with HIV in general, in the Asian region. This is probably due to the higher capital investment and on-going technical support required, as well as increased financial risk involved, in comparison to microfinance approaches. Also, the social enterprise approach may be more suited to an urban context, rather than a rural context, which is the focus of most socio- 22 economic support activities. Social enterprises rely on close proximity to markets and business networks, and suit beneficiaries who do not own land, or whose property is too small to engage in other activities. Interestingly, however, the social enterprise under WWP that was most successful in terms of generating sustainable profits is located in a rural, rather than an urban area, although in this case the enterprise was linked to a traditional handcraft and supported by a local NGO with extensive links to local and international networks. Regardless of the approach, the number of women living with HIV to have benefited appears to be small. Even in the Positive Partnership Project in Thailand, which is arguably the best documented, if not best established, activity in the Asian region, only about 50 percent of the 1,055 beneficiaries living with HIV were women. Further, as with WWP, the fact that most activities recruit women through self-help groups and networks of people living with HIV means that they favour women who feel sufficiently comfortable to join groups and reveal their HIV status. This means that support is not directed to other women living with HIV in the community who may be undiagnosed or hide their status and whose needs may be even greater. Given the context of improved health through greater access to ART services, resources may be more effectively used in support of a broader strategy that includes activities to improve workplace conditions, micro-credit schemes that target a broad range of vulnerable people in communities, as well as activities that reach women living with HIV through an entry point of focusing on key affected populations including men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, people who inject drugs, sex workers, people living with HIV and their households. Given the changes that have occurred in the epidemic, such an approach may be more appropriate than those currently in use, and more consistent with the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia, which recognized the need for better targeting of programmes towards key affected populations. With the majority of new cases occurring among key affected populations, it may be timely to focus more closely on ways in which the needs of women living with HIV can be addressed in the context of activities that target these populations. To date most socio-economic support programmes are not targeted towards key affected populations. However, members of key affected populations are involved in several projects, including the WWP site in Assam, WORTH in Myanmar, and Xincheng Limited in China, with encouraging results. A focus on the improvement of workplace conditions, together with specific activities focusing on key affected populations, as well as a broader based focus of community interventions that include key affected and vulnerable populations, may be more effective in regard", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "487d692d-ad6c-4da8-b55b-bd5dc2c03fef": {"__data__": {"id_": "487d692d-ad6c-4da8-b55b-bd5dc2c03fef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afc18a182c08d26209d892285f6a5d0da68161e575c1277ce32f4a58cc3a4327"}}, "hash": "afc18a182c08d26209d892285f6a5d0da68161e575c1277ce32f4a58cc3a4327", "text": "to use of available resources and reaching the women living with HIV who are truly in need of support. WWP has faced a number of additional challenges common to other approaches. In brief, they include high staff turnover rates, low skills level of staff, lack of sustainability of activities, management issues. These factors can all contribute to the risk of business failure. The risks mentioned above can be reduced significantly when implementation of socio- economic activities is supported by a strong local NGO partner with socio-economic and community development experience. The review clearly shows that in selection of partners, the strong support of a local organization, NGO or equivalent, is an important factor in relation to the success of the initiative. While INGOs and other agencies can provide technical and other crucial support, a \u201cfly-in-fly-out\u201d model is unable to supply the same level of on-going support and match the understanding of the local situation necessary for successful implementation of activities. 23 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia The results of the current review are summarized in Table 1, together with information on the Women and Wealth Project based on the separate report on this activity.44 As can be seen from the table, the response to this issue includes a wide range of approaches, settings, beneficiaries and partnerships. An important constraint in undertaking this review has been the lack of systematic documentation on the types of socio-economic empowerment activities for people living with HIV in the region, and the outcomes of these. A more comprehensive study would require a systematic approach, with a longer timeframe, site visits and interviews with a wide range of stakeholders. A review of livelihood initiatives for people living with HIV using such an approach, currently underway in India, has managed to document over sixty activities.45 It is likely that a similar situation exits in other countries in the region, where the response to the epidemic has an even longer history, and a systematic study would reveal a large number of small initiatives hitherto undocumented. From the available information, it is very difficult to assess the outcomes of activities that have been implemented in relation to the three main areas of interest outlined in the introduction to this review: financial benefits to women living with HIV; personal empowerment and improved quality of life; and increased acceptance and understanding of people living with HIV in society. In most cases, the documentation does not clearly articulate the objectives of activities implemented or, in the cases where it does so, describes objectives in a broad way so that it is difficult to make a direct comparison with the WWP. In any case, as with the WWP, few clear indicators are defined that would enable these outcomes to be measured. In the area of financial benefits, the indicator most commonly used for microfinance activities is the rate of loan repayment, which is a proxy indicator. Apart from WWP, little information is available on the financial benefits from social enterprises, other than that obtained from personal interviews with beneficiaries. For assessment of changes in regard to personal empowerment and improved quality of life, most projects reviewed rely on qualitative approaches, in particular interviews with beneficiaries. In addition to interviews with beneficiaries, the Positive Partnership Project also employs the Bamboo Ladder Survey, which has proved to be an effective tool to measure personal empowerment and improved quality of life. Changes in the socio-cultural environment are very difficult to assess, and here again qualitative techniques provide the best available information. Based on this review, it is clear that with good support all the approaches described can result in increased and sustainable income generation for people living with HIV, in particular women, who have constituted the greater proportion of beneficiaries. The clearest benefit from all activities, however, can be seen in the empowerment of people living with HIV and improvements that have resulted in the quality of their lives. In every activity, whether undertaken on an individual basis, as in the microfinance schemes, or with a group, as in social enterprises, beneficiaries have experienced increased self-confidence 44 Assessment of the Women and Wealth Project, UNDP, 2011. 45 \u201cStrategies for Promoting Livelihoods for PLHIV and those Affected: - Study findings leading to a national policy\u201d, Powerpoint presentation, Vrutti Livelihoods Resource Centre, June 2011. disCussion 5 24 table 1: Comparison of cross-section of socio-economic empowerment initiatives for people living with hiv and Aids in the Asia-pacific region project implementing Agency/partners location beneficiaries type setting 1 Sunflower Support Groups Netherlands Vietnam (MCNV), Viet Nam Red Cross, Medical Committee of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b0670cf-0ef6-4832-b58b-165da694c819": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b0670cf-0ef6-4832-b58b-165da694c819", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8afb05838ad728da605339fab186df91a1b63ede2bd8b9ded2df1c8c8bb31a6b"}, "3": {"node_id": "c2c9bd9b-d8ea-45ad-8dd0-6fce051d0ff3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b119797d865a5d4c5f0cbe4ecc4522186be0d3d3ee3e4c83d10051c6f892667e"}}, "hash": "985619e8a3dab1e51f63a45f43787f855ee21e573824d239959e6522ed524d8f", "text": "the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union Viet Nam Women living with HIV, families affected by HIV and AIDS, caregivers Microfinance and vocational training Rural and urban in 4 provinces in North Viet Nam 2 Positive Partnerships Programme Population Development and Community Association (PDA) Thailand People living with HIV, families affected by HIV and AIDS, and community members Microfinance, and vocational training.

These benefits can be attributed to a combination of factors, including personal feelings of self-worth obtained through learning new skills, being able to contribute to family income, rather than feeling that they are a burden, acceptance and support from other members of a group, and a recognition by other community members that people living with HIV have the capacity, and are prepared, to make a contribution to their own well-being and that of their community. The most common approach in the region is one based on support for livelihoods and income generation through microfinance, supplemented by vocational or other training in specific skills. This support provides beneficiaries with the capital and the skills to pursue occupations or establish small business enterprises that will generate sustainable income. In a number of cases, these activities are linked to savings groups or similar mechanisms, which help achieve additional development outcomes, such as promotion of concepts and skills in financial management and increased sustainability of benefits through recycling of funds on repayment of loans and interest. There seems to be general agreement that such models, which take a much more comprehensive approach, in some cases including initiatives to secure women\u2019s property and inheritance rights, are much more effective.46 The establishment of social enterprises, as distinct from micro-enterprises supported under microfinance, is another approach that has been attempted in the region as a response to socio-economic empowerment of people living with HIV.

The settings in which the above approaches have been implemented include rural and urban areas, semi-urban areas, and border regions. Most activities have been implemented in rural areas, with a focus on agriculture, or related occupations, or small enterprises that cater for the needs of rural communities. Implementation of these activities face fewer challenges in terms of travel and capital investment, although the scale of the return is correspondingly lower than from activities undertaken in an urban context. Also, rural populations often have existing occupational skills that can be developed, as well as land. In contrast, activities implemented in urban areas generally require a greater capital investment, and usually require more travel on behalf of beneficiaries, with corresponding costs in terms of transport and time. Urban populations may need special training to match the occupational opportunities available, and many people, especially those who have migrated from rural areas, do not own their houses or land. However, the potential financial returns in urban areas are much greater than in a rural context. Activities implemented in border areas are similar to those in rural areas, but there may be additional challenges related to population mobility, legal issues in the case of displaced persons, and access to services owing to the remoteness of the locations. There is also considerable variety in regard to the beneficiaries of activities. They include, in addition to women living with HIV, children affected by HIV (including orphans), men living with HIV, key affected populations, such as people who inject drugs, sex workers, and 46 Final Report, Global Review of Good Practices on the Intersections Between HIV/AIDS and Economic Empowerment, Ford Foundation, March, 2009. 47 Ibid. cross-sectorAl interventions to Address economic emPowerment And hiv/Aids Are feAsible, cAn creAte new synergies, And Add vAlue to current resPonses to the ePidemic.47 26 men who have sex with men, vulnerable populations such as displaced persons, survivors of human trafficking, migrant returnees, tribal communities and members of the general population. Women living with HIV are included in activities in several different ways. In one approach, exemplified by the WWP, the focus of activities is directly on women living with HIV. In several projects, such as those supported by PDA in Thailand, which pairs people living with HIV with those who do not have HIV, KHANA in Cambodia, and Pact in Myanmar and China, the focus is on people living with HIV in general. While women living with HIV are not specifically targeted in these activities, owing to the nature of the epidemic they constitute a high proportion of the beneficiaries. A third approach, as seen in the Weaving Destination project in Assam, under WWP, and the Pattanarak Foundation project in Thailand, focuses on displaced populations, among whom are women living with, or vulnerable to, HIV. The issue of whether or not HIV impact mitigation activities should focus specifically on people living with HIV is of course a contentious one. Many people, including people living with HIV themselves, argue strongly that because of their special health needs, as well as stigma and discrimination, they require special treatment in the form of socio-economic support and working conditions. Others, also including some people living with HIV, hold the opinion that such positive discrimination in favour of people living with HIV, or what has been termed \u201cHIV exceptionalism\u201d, only serves to increase social stigma and discrimination as it highlights their differences from other members of the community. The best approach, they argue, is to target socio-economic support activities more broadly, to include people living with HIV among a wide group of vulnerable people. Similar arguments can also be made regarding the further specific focus on women living with HIV, rather than vulnerable women in general, or addressing the needs of women living with HIV under a broad focus on vulnerable communities. A further dimension to this issue, which may well make finding a solution to such arguments irrelevant, has come with the recognition, reflected in the 2008 Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia48, of the considerable changes that have occurred in the HIV epidemic in the Asian region. In particular, the Report indicates that, in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions, there is a need for greater focus on key affected populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men and people who inject drugs. Under concentrated epidemics prevailing across Asia, it can be expected that in future key affected populations will constitute a greater proportion of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ca4e95f-2353-4d54-a097-3f85f95a84e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ca4e95f-2353-4d54-a097-3f85f95a84e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/review-socio-economic-empowerment-initiatives-women-living-hiv-asia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af08cd9aad8f52ca39f87d248a97384e23e03acd94f6ca30d13b58907cb2f935"}}, "hash": "af08cd9aad8f52ca39f87d248a97384e23e03acd94f6ca30d13b58907cb2f935", "text": "population of people living with HIV in the region. While there will also be a large number of new infections resulting from transmission from these people to their partners, the most effective way to access them with interventions to address their socio-economic needs may be through activities that are focused on the key affected populations themselves. For this reason, it is of interest to note that several of the projects reviewed here, such as the KHANA project in Cambodia, Pact activities in Myanmar (MSM) and China (people who inject drugs), and the Assam site in the WWP (female sex workers), involve members of key affected populations in their activities. While still relatively early in terms of programme experience, the results to date are positive. In contrast to some views49, they suggest that, with appropriate support, economic empowerment initiatives such as microfinance and social enterprises can be successfully employed with people living with HIV and members of key affected populations. While no examples are included in this review, workplace interventions can also be expected to become increasingly important in addressing the socio-economic impact of HIV. With greater access to ART, health considerations are becoming less of a challenge, and the issue of stigma and discrimination is now the main reason given by people living with HIV for leaving the workforce. This is one reason why advocates of a more general approach suggest that, in the context of decreased availability of funding for HIV and AIDS, resources 48 Redefining AIDS in Asia: Crafting an Effective Response, Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia, Oxford University Press, 2008. 49 Final Report, Global Review of Good Practices on the Intersections Between HIV/AIDS and Economic Empowerment, Ford Foundation, March, 2009. 27 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia could be more effectively used in a greater focus on promotion of workers\u2019 rights and conditions, that would increase understanding of HIV and allow more flexibility in regard to working hours and medical leave.50 51 Insufficient detail is available to enable a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of the different approaches described here. However, this would be an important consideration in assessing the merits of workplace interventions relative to direct support for group-based socio-economic activities, such as social enterprises. There is also considerable variation across the region in terms of the types of partnerships that have been established to support socio-economic activities among people living with HIV and AIDS and vulnerable groups. The nature of these seems to be mainly related to the process by which they were developed and the country context. Thus, in Viet Nam and China, where until recently there have been few local NGOs or CBOs, the main partners have been state agencies and unions. For example, in Viet Nam, the Sunflower Support Groups were supported by a partnership between the Netherlands Vietnam, the Viet Nam Red Cross, and the Medical Committee of the Viet Nam Women\u2019s Union. In implementing the Community-Based Care, Support and Poverty Reduction through Microfinance in Shanxi Province, UNDP China partnered with the China International Center for Economics and Technology Exchange, National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control, the Provincial Poverty Reduction Office of Shanxi, Rural Credit Cooperative of Shanxi and Municipal Government. The WWP differs from most other initiatives in that it sought to partner with networks of women/people living with HIV. While, in the end, the initiative met with mixed success, at the time it commenced (in 2006) the collaboration was an important recognition of the high level of development of the networks, and of the fundamental principle of involvement of people living with HIV. In implementing the WWP in India and Cambodia, where people living with HIV networks are firmly established, UNDP APRC partnered with PWN+ and CCW, respectively, in implementation of the MDSF and SLC projects, which are on-going. PWN+ subsequently partnered with a business corporation, Suzlon Foundation, as part of a CSR collaboration to support an agriculture-based social enterprise in South India. From the information available, it seems that, whatever the approach selected, the chances of success and sustainability are improved considerably through support from a strong local partner with socio-economic and community development experience. This seems to have been the case with the Sunflower Support Groups in Viet Nam, KHANA\u2019s support for the Economic Livelihoods Programme in Cambodia, PDA\u2019s implementation of the PPP in Thailand, the Pattanarak Foundation\u2019s activities in Sangkhlaburi, Thailand, and the NEDAN Foundation\u2019s support for Weaving Destination in Assam under the WWP.

While documentation of activities is lacking, from the information available it can be seen that these projects have utilized a range of approaches, including microfinance, vocational training, livelihoods and social enterprises. Very few activities have gone to scale and, without detailed documentation, including data on cost-effectiveness, it is difficult to assess their effectiveness. In any case, because of the wide differences in contexts, including both location and beneficiaries, even if activities were shown to be effective in one context, it is not certain that they could be scaled up or replicated in other settings. All approaches reviewed have resulted in increases in the financial well-being of beneficiaries; however, the greatest benefit for all people living with HIV involved, especially women, has been seen in their personal empowerment. The increased self-confidence and self-esteem resulting from involvement in activities has led to improvements in the quality of their lives. It is difficult to assess the number of people living with HIV in Asia who have benefited from socio-economic support activities, but overall, in relation to the estimated total number of people living with HIV in the region, the number appears to be small, and of these the number of women is less. A further consideration is that the needs of the women actually involved in activities, who are likely to be those who feel sufficiently comfortable to join groups and reveal their HIV status, may be less than the women living with HIV in the community who are not reached. Beneficiaries of socio-economic support activities have included women, men, key affected populations and vulnerable populations. Few activities appear to address the needs of young people. While there have been few activities directly involving women living with HIV, positive women have been included in other more general approaches to socio- economic support. In fact this approach may enable a much wider group of women living with HIV to access socio-economic support, since in the broad approaches there is no need for disclosure or identification as being HIV positive. It is interesting to note that members of key affected populations have been involved in activities in several projects. To some extent this runs counter to popular wisdom, which has it that members of key affected populations, such as people who inject drugs or sex workers present formidable challenges, in terms of commitment and responsibility, to the success of microfinance and other socio-economic support programmes. A similar argument has been made for young people. 53 While no firm conclusions can be made on the basis of the information presently available, this is an area that deserves further investigation. The wide range of approaches to socio-economic support is consistent with the many different settings that exist in the Asian region, which include rural, urban, border areas, 53 Final Report, Global Review of Good Practices on the Intersections Between HIV/AIDS and Economic Empowerment, Ford Foundation, March, 2009. generAl ConClusions 6 29 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia and a wide variety of beneficiaries. For this reason, it is difficult to say that one approach is more effective than another. Among these, microfinance approaches seem to be the most common, mainly being implemented in a rural context.

The study also questioned the sustainability of the activities. All businesses face the risk of failure, as well as success, and for people living with HIV groups, whose members already face significant challenges in their lives, the risk may be too great.54 The authors argue, instead, for \u201crisk-free livelihood support\u201d as the most preferred option for provision of socio-economic support to people living with HIV. Under this approach, the main focus is on keeping people living with HIV in jobs, together with promotion of employment. However for this to be successful, sustained efforts must be made, working closely with both the private and public sectors55, and sometimes in a challenging environment where stigma and discrimination against HIV positive people are strong. As discussed in the current review, with changes in the nature of the epidemic, a focus on the improvement of workplace conditions, together with a broader based focus of community interventions to include key affected and vulnerable populations, may be more effective in regard to use of available resources and reaching the women living with HIV who are truly in need of support. A last point that emerges from this review is that, for all approaches, partnerships are important in order to provide funding support, technical assistance, and overall guidance for beneficiaries and the enterprises that they establish. The India review challenges the assumption held by many people, both those living with HIV and staff of development agencies, that it is necessary for people living with HIV to own an enterprise in order for it to be friendly to people living with HIV.56 However, the current review clearly shows that in selection of partners, the strong support of a local organization, NGO or equivalent, is an important factor in relation to the success of the initiative. While INGOs and other agencies can provide technical and other critical support, a \u201cfly-in-fly-out\u201d model is unable to supply the same level of on-going support and match the understanding of the local situation necessary for successful implementation of activities. 6-1. lessons learned Several lessons can be learned from this comparison of approaches to socio-economic support for women and other populations living with and affected by HIV in the Asian region, as follows: \u2022\ufffd Given opportunities to participate in microfinance, livelihood and social enterprise activities, people living with HIV, in particular women, can derive important benefits in the area of generation of increased income, personal empowerment and improved quality of life, and increased social acceptance; \u2022\ufffd Without systematic documentation of activities and results comparison of different approaches and assessment of effectiveness is challenging; \u2022\ufffd Social enterprise approaches may not be suitable for addressing the needs of women living with HIV in all situations, and selection of a female-exclusive, or even 54 \u201cStrategies for Promoting Livelihoods for PLHIV and those Affected: - Study findings leading to a national policy\u201d, Vrutti Livelihoods Resource Centre, June 2011. 55 Ibid. 56 Ibid. 30 an HIV-exclusive approach, depends on the setting; \u2022\ufffd Socio-economic support activities can also successfully address the needs of key affected populations such as MSM, IDUs and SWs, and, with changes in the nature of the epidemic in the Asian region, inclusion of members of these groups will become increasingly important; \u2022\ufffd In planning for social enterprise and other socio-economic support activities for women living with HIV and vulnerable populations, it is crucial to identify a strong local partner with experience in community development that can provide on- going support to beneficiaries. 31 A Review of Socio-Economic Empowerment Initiatives for Women Living with HIV in Asia It is clear that, on the one hand, there remains an important need for action to address the socio-economic impact of HIV on women and their families in the Asian region and, on the other, support for microfinance, livelihoods and social enterprises can make an important difference to the quality of women\u2019s lives, in terms of empowerment and increased acceptance by society. A failure to address this issue puts at risk the important gains that have been made through increased access to ART and health services for women living with HIV. For this reason, the main recommendation of this report is that support for activities to address the socio-economic impact of HIV continue, combined with efforts to identify the approaches that are most effective with due consideration of the contexts, appropriate capacity assessment and strong local support.

Here, based on a comparison between the conclusions from the in-depth assessment of the WWP and those from a comparison between the approach used in the WWP and other similar initiatives in the region, a number of broader recommendations can be made. These are presented in two sections, the first consisting of recommendations for governments, donors and other stakeholders concerned with the mitigation of the impact of HIV in the region and the response to protection of vulnerable populations. The second consists of recommendations for NGOs and CBOs, in particular networks of people living with HIV, interested in exploring the social enterprise approach for impact mitigation. 7.1 general recommendations for future support of activities to address the socio-economic situation of women living with hiv (and people living with hiv in general) in the Asian region \u2022\ufffd In future programming, governments and donors should consider support for activities under a three-pronged strategy that includes: i. targeting of activities at members of key populations (e.g. sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgendered persons, people who inject drugs, and people living with HIV) and their partners; ii. ensuring that broad-based socio-economic support activities targeted at populations made vulnerable by poverty, displacement or other causes are designed to be HIV-sensitive (i.e. HIV-sensitive social protection); and iii. supporting HIV workplace policy with strong anti-discrimination clauses and legal redress mechanisms for HIV-related discriminations, to ensure that women and people living with HIV can enter the workforce, and retain their jobs, as equals with other workers; \u2022\ufffd Programme design for socio-economic support activities should be based on a long-term commitment that includes: generAl reCommendAtions 7 32 i. planning for a learning process among beneficiaries, with provision for documentation and sharing of the results of activities and lessons learned from implementation; and ii. a clear definition of objectives and indicators to measure progress against these; \u2022\ufffd Social enterprises should be considered as one of a range of available options for socio-economic support, depending on the specific context; \u2022\ufffd Implementation of social enterprises should be undertaken only where a strong local NGO or equivalent local partner organization with experience in social enterprise and community development is available for close, on-going support, not only periodic technical assistance. 7.2 specific recommendations for people living with hiv networks and Cbos considering the social enterprise approach \u2022\ufffd In identification of potential business models, where possible social enterprises that involve highly competitive markets should be avoided, unless there is a low cost of overheads, such as raw materials and rent, and existence of a strong funding reserve that can ameliorate delays in cash flow, ensure regular maintenance and replacement of equipment and ensure recruitment and retention of staff with essential specialized skills; \u2022\ufffd In assessing the feasibility of proposed business models, consideration should be given to who the main beneficiaries of the activity will be, their number, the ways in which the social enterprise will benefit them, and the mechanism by which this will be achieved. There should be full involvement of beneficiaries with support from those with skills and experience in this process in order to ensure understanding, commitment and robust business plans; \u2022\ufffd If possible, the proposed business model should build on an existing skills base among beneficiaries, rather than relying on training to meet gaps in expertise in areas essential to success of the venture. While on-going skills training is essential, resources are most effectively used on improving existing skills and learning additional specific skills that will add value to the products and services, rather than on provision of basic training; \u2022\ufffd In appraisal of the potential business model, the main implementing organization should conduct a rigorous self-appraisal to assess whether it has sufficient capacity to manage, on a long-term basis, the challenge of the additional activities of implementation of the social enterprise, without minimum negative impact on the core activities of the organization. It is also important to identify the local resource availability where beneficiaries\u2019 adoptability and acceptability is at stake, before considering an appropriate business model; \u2022\ufffd In order to help ensure smooth implementation and operation of the social enterprise, a clear management plan should be put in place from inception, including establishment of a management board or steering committee with the engagement of relevant experts, a staff organogram indicating reporting responsibilities and accountability, detailed job descriptions for all positions, and a monitoring and evaluation framework.

This Framework and Resource Guide is of utmost importance and relevance, especially regarding the high rate of HIV cases in Asia-Pacific is prevalent amongst the most vulnerable of groups: the MSM and transgender. The stigmatization and marginalization against these people is a common problem in the current society; while the state is thus far proven incapable of realizing the recognition and protection for the MSM and transgender groups. As they are some of the most vulnerable groups, the advocacy for the human rights specific for MSM and transgender groups in the region must be expanded, fortified and supported. Thus far, it seems to me that the agenda of advocacy for the MSM and transgender, especially regarding the access to information and HIV related health services, is not as massively organized compared to other vulnerable groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb428a9d-0f96-4bdc-8a9a-3347d3053884": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb428a9d-0f96-4bdc-8a9a-3347d3053884", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05169f830228483ce4c0bf442c44e3b04e3e3788ff5cdff0bf83b901489f7254"}, "2": {"node_id": "abfef3bb-f448-45c8-bdfb-c1776c3b8c63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8710af7dd6f138dea54ee9f16bf6d3c6e96568522801fcb1691a3386c0666b2"}}, "hash": "51403e7a440ee57d1b2ade3235e99e3f80cbaf340331b1395dc20b483ac55b7b", "text": "It is thus that the framework will be a most powerful ASEAN contribution towards empowering the advocacy effort for the human rights of the MSM and transgender groups, both in national and regional level.

We are hopeful that the framework will be instrumental for guiding the advocacy strategy for the Human Rights group in general, and more specifically for the MSM and transgender groups, to improve their effectiveness and coordination in facing the challenges against their human rights. May the guideline serve the civil society in the region and help them share and acquire \u201clesson learned\u201d in overcoming the challenges regarding the access to information and health services for MSM and transgender groups. This is but a small step in our effort to contribute towards the development of protection and services for the MSM and transgender groups. Even within ASEAN, the protection for MSM and transgender groups concerning the fulfillment and access to health services is regarded as one of the biggest and most sensitive issues. At the regional level, the ASEAN Community 2015 in the near horizon, the scope and challenges regarding the guarantee and protection of MSM and transgender groups\u2019 human rights will be even greater. The ASEAN Declaration of Human Rights (AHRD), adopted and signed by the Head of States of the ASEAN Nations in November 2012 is abundantly clear in guaranteeing the rights of the vulnerable groups, including the LGBTs; as provided in the Article 4: \u201cThe rights of women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, migrant workers, and vulnerable and marginalised groups are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of human rights and fundamental freedoms.\u201d AHRD also specifically stated the commitments of the ASEAN Nations to provide health service and support for People with HIV/AIDS. The Point 2 of the Article 29 of AHRD provides: \u201cThe ASEAN Member States shall create a positive environment in overcoming stigma, silence, denial and discrimination in the prevention, treatment, care and support of people suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS.\u201d The ASEAN human rights mechanism (institutional and instrumental) is oriented towards the advancement of human rights in the ASEAN region; however, considering the current political and cultural obstacles, the fulfillment of the said orientation is a great challenge. Are we up to the task? In order to advance the implementation of AHRD, the framework and guideline are a great step forward and initiative; which in turn will help AICHR to fulfill its mandate especially in 5 FOREWORD formulating the strategy of development and human rights protection for the vulnerable groups including MSM and transgender. Other than the CSOs, I believe that this framework will also be instrumental for our other stakeholders: the government and private sectors. Once again let me praise the Insular Southeast Asian Network on MSM, TG, and HIV (ISEAN) and all the partners for the finished framework; which I believe will be welcomed by all the stakeholders in Human Rights. Rafendi Djamin Indonesian Representative to the (AICHR) ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights 6 The development of the Islands of Southeast Asia Network on Male and Transgender Sexual Health (ISEAN) Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework was a result of an in-depth review and consultative process. The Framework outlines global and regional commitment related to HIV, human rights and sexual orientation and gender identify, and provides evidence for effective inclusion of specific men who have sex with men and transgender people strategies in regional, national and community-level HIV responses. Our thanks and special gratitude to the Mohamad Shahrani bin Mohamad Tamrin, the ISEAN Regional Program Manager for his leadership and guidance during the development of the Framework; and Mr. Rafendi Djamin, the Indonesian Representative to the (AICHR) ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights for providing the Forward. The Framework was prepared by Lou McCallum and Amber McQugh, AIDS Project Management Group (APMG) with Edmund Settle, Policy Advisor, UNDP Asia-Pacific Regional Centre. Many people were involved in the review of the Framework.

The development of ISEAN Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework was supported by UNDP under the Multi-Country ISEAN-Hivos Global Fund Programme (ME1\u2013011-G01-H). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 7 INTRODUCTION Despite persistent warning signals over the last ten years that rates of HIV are disproportionately high among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific, compared with general population, little has been achieved in reality to connect MSM and transgender people with the knowledge and services they need to either avoid HIV infection, or if living with HIV, to know and understand their HIV status and access life-prolonging anti- retroviral therapies and on-going support This Sub-Regional Advocacy Framework has been developed by the Islands of Southeast Asia Network on Male and Transgender Sexual Health (ISEAN) to support sub-regional and country- level advocacy efforts to better connect MSM and transgender people in ISEAN countries with the information and services they need in order to maximise their health. ISEAN countries include Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Timor-Leste. It complements ISEAN\u2019s previous work on advocacy, particularly the Training Module for Networking and Advocacy for Local CBOs, the B-Change Connecting the Dots: Blueprint of a Regional Technology Strategy for Development and the PlaySafe Initiative. It is ISEAN\u2019s view that it is inaccurate and often unhelpful to consider MSM and transgender people as a homogenous group. The health needs of transgender people, the barriers that exist for them in relation to access to health services and the way that the HIV epidemic impacts upon them, are significantly more difficult and complex for transgender people than they are for some sub-populations of MSM. Wherever possible throughout this Framework, data and information about transgender people will be presented separately to allow for a more considered and relevant discussion of their advocacy priorities. Rates of HIV among MSM and transgender people in many countries across the globe are significantly higher than rates among adults in general. By the end of 2011, 93 out of 196 countries had not reported on HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender people in the previous five years. Where data was reported, HIV prevalence among MSM and transgender people was substantially higher than the general population in every context.1 In order to achieve control of HIV worldwide, it is essential that new and effective HIV prevention, treatment and care approaches are developed and implemented at scale for MSM and transgender people. 1 Chris Beryrer, Stefan Baral, Frits van Griensven, Steven Goodreau, Suwat Chariylertsak, Andrea Wirtz, Ron Brookmeyer, Global epidemiology of HIV infection in men who have sex with men, Lancet July 2012 INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND Advocacy Framework 8 ADVOCACY FRAMEWORK This is not achievable if these populations are excluded from health care and denied full social recognition and political engagement, as they are in many parts of the world.2 Men who have sex with men (MSM) Sex between men is criminalised is 19 out of 48 countries in the Asia Pacific region and few countries have passed protective laws based on sexual orientation and gender identify or transgender status. MSM in the region experience high levels of stigma and discrimination in relation to sexual orientation, actual or perceived HIV status, current or past drug taking behaviour and involvement in sex work. Stigma and discrimination is a key barrier to access to health services, education, employment and a fair justice system. There is a misalignment on this issue between health and law enforcement sectors in the region, while criminalization of sex between men is common, many countries have identified the rights and needs of key populations through health sector responses.

The Philippines recently developed specific strategies of action in the National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for MSM and TG Populations 2012-2016.

Therefore, trans women- especially pre-operative trans-women- were always counted as MSM. Most research, statistics and surveys of the past few years always counted \u2018MSM and TG\u2019 together, and therefore missed opportunities to better inform outreach and other services. Data must now be disaggregated between transgender people and MSM, and also between trans men and trans women.\u201d The term transgender people refer to individuals whose gender identity differs from their gender at birth. In the Asia-Pacific region available data of population size and HIV prevalence among transgender people is limited with small-scale research focused predominately on trans women (transgender people born as biological men) in urban settings. It can be estimated that there are probably between 9-9.5 million transgender people across the region with HIV prevalence rates as high as 49 percent.7 In this region, country-level disaggregated data on HIV among transgender remains scarce, except in Indonesia.

As a result, trans women are reluctant to seek sexual health services unless experiencing symptomatic sexually transmitted infections (STI). NGOs and CBOs in some locations provide sexual health services for transgender people, however these services are scarce and are often out of reach.12 Poverty, lack of education opportunities and employment discrimination leads to many trans women engaging in sex work due to a lack of opportunity. Where data is available, involvement in sex work has been reported as high as 44 percent among some transgender populations. Transgender sex workers are exposed to unique risks of violence due to their gender identity and report experiencing humiliation and abuse from police and health providers when seeking care following violence. Sex work is illegal in many countries, which exposes transgender sex workers to arrest, detention, debt cycles and police abuse, increasing their risk of HIV.13 High rates of receptive anal intercourse among trans women also place them at a greater biological risk of HIV acquisition. The legal environments in many countries fail to fulfil the human rights of transgender people. Even in countries where same sex practices are legal, transgender people experience stigma and discrimination. Many national legal frameworks contradict international human rights frameworks and treaties. The absence of full legal recognition and protection for transgender people is a major barrier to HIV responses.14 In Indonesia, the law allows post-operative Transgender Women or Waria to legally change their gender on official documentation and records, however, many Waria in the country do not have official documentation. Waria are also classified as mentally handicapped by the Department of Social Affairs in Indonesia, which could restrict employment opportunities for transgender people.15 Transgender people in other countries in the subregion cannot change their gender on official documents.16,17 This Framework is intended for use as a template for subregional and national advocacy to improve HIV prevention and care among MSM and transgender people. It sets out five Key Domains for Advocacy, provides suggestions for partnerships that would make advocacy more successful and outlines some indicative advocacy strategies. Obviously, national and local Islands of Southeast Asian organizations are more familiar with the particular issues in their area and the barriers that exist for MSM and transgender people so, rather than prescribing specific approaches, the Framework provides a guide to a process they can follow to develop their own priorities, partnerships and strategies. The Framework is supported by a Resource Guide (the Guide) that summarizes key global and regional commitments and guidelines and provides examples of work that has been done to remove access barriers for MSM and transgender people. The Guide sets out the key clauses and sections of each relevant commitment document, the key sections of guidelines or standards that refer to MSM and transgender people and some of the elements of strategies that have 12 Sam Winter, Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region, APTN, UNDP, 2012 13 Stefan Baral, Chris Beyrer, and Tonia Poteat, Human Rights, the Law, and HIV among Transgender People, Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 2011 14 Stefan Baral, Chris Beyrer, and Tonia Poteat, Human Rights, the Law, and HIV among Transgender People, Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 2011 15 HIV and Men who have Sex with Men: Country Snapshots: Indonesia, UNDP, 2012 16 HIV and Men who have Sex with Men: Country Snapshots: Malaysia, UNDP, 2012 17 HIV and Men who have Sex with Men: Country Snapshots: Philippines, UNDP, 2012 HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK 11 HOW TO USE THIS FRAMEWORK been used in the region to promote access to health for MSM and transgender people.

To assist in determining priorities and strategies, this Framework identifies five key domains for action. These domains are not separate or discrete. Attitudes and actions within one domain affect, or are influenced by attitudes and actions in another. Tackling stigma and discrimination against MSM and transgender people not only involves working within these domains, but also on the relationships between them. The five domains are: 1. Legal and Policy Environment: Sensitization of legislators, parliamentarians, judiciary and law enforcement agencies to work towards replacing the current punitive laws, policies and practices with more rights-based approaches. 18 Training Module on Networking and Advocacy for Local CBOs, ISEAN, p21 KEY DOMAINS FOR ADVOCACY 12 ADVOCACY FRAMEWORK 2. Health Services: Enhanced capacity of health system to respond to health concerns of MSM and transgender people; the need for expanding coverage to deliver HIV prevention, treatment, care and allied health services. 3. Local Police and Justice Services: Turning good national policy into good local practice \u2013 co-operation of local police in HIV outreach efforts, reductions in harassment, unnecessary arrest, violence, blackmail and corruption, improved responses to reports of crimes against MSM and transgender people. Fair treatment in the justice system. Legal support services available. 4. Community Structures: Addressing stigma and discrimination by engaging with community based organizations, faith based groups and other stakeholders to ensure people of diverse sexual orientation and gender identities can access HIV and other social services with dignity and equity. 5. Media: Engaging with public media to ensure more balanced and respectful portrayal of HIV, MSM and transgender issues resulting in a reduction of stigma and discrimination. Working to ensure that relevant health information for MSM and transgender people can be published. 1.

Key recommendations set out in the Report of the Consultation on HIV, STI and Other Health Needs of Transgender People in Asia and the Pacific include: \u2022 Urgent advocacy is needed in order to create a safe, enabling health-care environment to achieve equal access to health for transgender people and realize the goal of zero HIV new infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths in this community. \u2022 All efforts to address transgender specific issues should be guided by the human rights principles of equality, non-discrimination and meaningful participation and be aimed at community empowerment. \u2022 Transgender people should be legally recognized as having equal rights and dignity, which are and should be protected under the law, with passage of protective legislation to contribute to a climate of acceptance and equality. Transgender people should have the right to legal recognition of their gender identity, and the recognition of gender status should not depend on medical treatment or surgical procedures. \u2022 Transgender people should be involved meaningfully in all efforts aiming to address the health needs of transgender people at all levels: policy-making; programming and service delivery; and design, implementation, monitoring and reporting. In order for this to occur 19 Goodwin, J (2010). Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific: an agenda for action. DOMAIN 1 - LEGAL AND POLICY ENVIRONMENT 14 ADVOCACY FRAMEWORK specific capacity-building and resources should be made available to strengthen and empower the transgender community and civil society organizations, as well as support groups. The following is a summary of key recommendations made by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law to ensure an effective, sustainable response to HIV that is consistent with human rights obligations: MSM \u2022 Countries must reform their approach towards sexual diversity. Rather than punishing consenting adults involved in same sex activity, countries must offer such people access to effective HIV and health services and commodities. Countries must: \u2022 Repeal all laws that criminalise consensual sex between adults of the same sex and/or laws that punish homosexual identity. \u2022 Respect existing civil and religious laws and guarantees relating to privacy. \u2022 Remove legal, regulatory and administrative barriers to the formation of community organisations by or for gay men, lesbians and/or bisexual people. \u2022 Amend anti-discrimination laws expressly to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation (as well as gender identity). \u2022 Promote effective measures to prevent violence against men who have sex with men. Transgender People \u2022 Countries must reform their approach towards transgender people. Rather than punishing transgender people, countries must offer transgender people access to effective HIV and health services and commodities as well as repealing all laws that criminalise transgender identity or associated behaviours. Countries must: \u2022 Respect existing civil and religious laws and guarantees related to the right to privacy. \u2022 Repeal all laws that punish cross-dressing. \u2022 Remove legal, regulatory or administrative barriers to formation of community organisations by or for transgender people. \u2022 Amend national anti-discrimination laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity (as well as sexual orientation). \u2022 Ensure transgender people are able to have their affirmed gender recognized in identification documents, without the need for prior medical procedures such as sterilisation, sex reassignment surgery or hormonal therapy.

In General Comment No. 3, the Committee confirms that States parties have a core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential levels of each of the rights enunciated in the Covenant, including essential primary health care. Read in conjunction with more contemporary instruments, such as the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, the Alma-Ata Declaration provides compelling guidance on the core obligations arising from article 12. Accordingly, in the Committee\u2019s view, these core obligations include at least the following obligations: a. To ensure the right of access to health facilities, goods and services on a non- discriminatory basis, especially for vulnerable or marginalized groups; b. To ensure access to the minimum essential food which is nutritionally adequate and safe, to ensure freedom from hunger to everyone; c. To ensure access to basic shelter, housing and sanitation, and an adequate supply of safe and potable water; d. To provide essential drugs, as from time to time defined under the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs; e. To ensure equitable distribution of all health facilities, goods and services; f. To adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action, on the basis of epidemiological evidence, addressing the health concerns of the whole population; the strategy and plan of action shall be devised, and periodically reviewed, on the basis of a participatory and transparent process; they shall include methods, such as right to health indicators and benchmarks, by which progress can be closely monitored; the process by which the strategy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b67e9bc1-8a85-42e1-999c-c40722c3de89": {"__data__": {"id_": "b67e9bc1-8a85-42e1-999c-c40722c3de89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef982e5c006545d0f008bf601f7a0f35fae43b067b5f53fc344e7ba400e449a7"}}, "hash": "ef982e5c006545d0f008bf601f7a0f35fae43b067b5f53fc344e7ba400e449a7", "text": "and plan of action are devised, as well as their content, shall give particular attention to all vulnerable or marginalized groups. Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Anand Grover (UN General Assembly, Human Rights Council, 2011) Preamble This document sets out the rationale for a right-based approach to health. It connects the domains of human rights and human development. RESOURCE GUIDE 30 It uses the example of HIV and AIDS to show how a rights-based approach can add value to development policies and programmes. Specific sections: The \u2018right to health\u2019 framework complements current development approaches by underlying the importance of aspects such as participation, community empowerment and the need to focus on vulnerable populations. Specific paragraphs: 40. The relationship between the law, public health and human rights has thus been seen as of particular importance in relation to HIV. In an attempt to control the virus and the social practices that result in its spread, laws may be hastily enacted that are only partially successful in achieving behavioural change. The \u201cAIDS paradox\u201d is that: \u201c...one of the most effective laws we can offer to combat the spread of HIV which causes AIDS is the protection of persons living with AIDS, and those about them, from discrimination.\u201d Indeed, this paradox does not exist only in respect of laws. Any development intervention designed to combat the spread of HIV which respects the human rights of those directly affected by and those most at risk of HIV, will ultimately be more effective in achieving its stated goals. 41. HIV thus represents a good example of the multi-faceted relationship between health and human rights. It shows how health policies and legislation can impact detrimentally on human rights, while violations of human rights can detrimentally affect health. Thus, policies and legislation which allow for the quarantining of a person who has contracted HIV would infringe on the right to liberty and security of person, while \u201cnaming and shaming\u201d people who test positive to HIV, in violation of their right to privacy and confidentiality, creates stigma and deters others from seeking out testing and counselling. This close interrelationship also means that human rights and health-related policies and programmes have a great potential to be mutually reinforcing in the realization of health-related development and the right to health. The Paris Declaration, 1994 (UNAIDS, 1994) During the 1994 Paris AIDS Summit a joint commitment was made by all Governments and Representatives present stating, \u201cWe, the Heads of Government or Representatives of the 42 States assembled in Paris on 1 December 1994 Solemnly Declare:\u201d All are relevant, but specifically: \u2022 our obligation as political leaders to make the fight against HIV and AIDS a priority, \u2022 our obligation to act with compassion for and in solidarity with those with HIV or at risk of becoming infected, both within our societies and internationally, \u2022 our determination to ensure that all persons living with HIV and AIDS are able to realize the full and equal enjoyment of their fundamental rights and freedoms without distinction and under all circumstances, \u2022 our determination to fight against poverty, stigmatization and discrimination, \u2022 our determination to mobilize all of society \u2013 the public and private sectors, community- based organizations and people living with HIV and AIDS \u2013 in a spirit of true partnership, GLOBAL COMMITMENTS ON HIV AND AIDS 31 1.

Out of this meeting the General Assembly adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration which outlined commitments to values and principles; peace, security and disarmament; development and poverty eradication; protecting common environment; human rights; democracy and good governance; protecting the vulnerable; meeting the special needs of Africa; and, strengthening the United Nations (UN General Assembly 55th Session, Agenda Item 60, 2000). The declaration led to the development of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a series of eight time-bound goals with sub-goals which have been adopted by all 191 UN member states. All Goals are relevant, but specifically: Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Target 6.A: Have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS \u2022 The spread of HIV appears to have stabilized in most regions, and more people are surviving longer \u2022 Empowering women through AIDS education is indeed possible, as a number of countries have shown \u2022 Condom use during high-risk sex is gaining acceptance in some countries and is one facet of effective HIV prevention \u2022 Mounting evidence shows a link between gender-based violence and HIV RESOURCE GUIDE 32 Target 6.B: Achieve, by 2010, universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS for all those who need it \u2022 Expanded treatment for HIV-positive women also safeguards their newborns UNGASS Declaration of Commitment (DoC) on AIDS, 2001 (United Nations, 2001) In 2001, all UN member states adopted the UNGASS Declaration of Commitment \u201cGlobal Crisis- Global Action\u201d with the goal of reversing the AIDS epidemic. The Declaration contained time- bound commitments.

The Yogyakarta Principles affirm binding international legal standards that all states are obligated to comply with. The Principles define sexual orientation and gender identity as the following: \u2022 Sexual orientation is understood to refer to each person\u2019s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender. \u2022 Gender identity is understood to refer to each person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms. All Principles are relevant, but specifically: Principle 1 The right to the universal enjoyment of human rights: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. Human beings of all sexual orientations and gender identities are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights.

Principle 2 The rights to equality and non-discrimination: Everyone is entitled to enjoy all human rights without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Everyone is entitled to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law without any such discrimination whether or not the enjoyment of another human right is also affected. The law shall prohibit any such discrimination and guarantee to all persons equal and effective protection against any such discrimination. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity includes any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on sexual orientation or gender identity which has the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing equality before the law or the equal protection of the law, or the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal basis, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity may be, and commonly is, compounded by discrimination on other grounds including gender, race, age, religion, disability, health and economic status. States shall: a. Embody the principles of equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in their national constitutions or other appropriate legislation, if not yet incorporated therein, including by means of amendment and interpretation, and ensure the effective realization of these principles; b.

Adopt appropriate legislative and other measures to prohibit and eliminate discrimination in the public and private spheres on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; d. Take appropriate measures to secure adequate advancement of persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities as may be necessary to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights. Such measures shall not be deemed to be discriminatory; e. In all their responses to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, take account of the manner in which such discrimination may intersect with other forms of discrimination; RESOURCE GUIDE 36 f. Take all appropriate action, including programmes of education and training, with a view to achieving the elimination of prejudicial or discriminatory attitudes or behaviours which are related to the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of any sexual orientation or gender identity or gender expression. Principle 3 The right to recognition before the law: Everyone has the right to recognition everywhere as a person before the law. Persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities shall enjoy legal capacity in all aspects of life. Each person\u2019s self-defined sexual orientation and gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity. No status, such as marriage or parenthood, may be invoked as such to prevent the legal recognition of a person\u2019s gender identity. No one shall be subjected to pressure to conceal, suppress or deny their sexual orientation or gender identity. States shall: a. Ensure that all persons are accorded legal capacity in civil matters, without discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and the opportunity to exercise that capacity, including equal rights to conclude contracts, and to administer, own, acquire (including through inheritance), manage, enjoy and dispose of property; b. Take all necessary legislative, administrative and other measures to fully respect and legally recognise each person\u2019s self-defined gender identity; c.

Rather than punishing consenting adults involved in same-sex activity, countries must offer access to effective HIV and health services. All recommendations made by the commission are relevant, but specifically: To ensure an effective, sustainable response to HIV that is consistent with human rights obligations: \u2022 Countries must prohibit police violence against key populations. \u2022 Countries must also support programmes that reduce stigma and discrimination against key populations and protect their rights. \u2022 Countries must reform their approach towards sexual diversity. Rather than punishing consenting adults involved in same sex activity, countries must offer such people access to effective HIV and health services and commodities. Countries must: \u2022 Repeal all laws that criminalize consensual sex between adults of the same sex and/or laws that punish homosexual identity. \u2022 Respect existing civil and religious laws and guarantees relating to privacy. \u2022 Remove legal, regulatory and administrative barriers to the formation of community organizations by or for gay men, lesbians and/or bisexual people. 39 1. GLOBAL \u2022 Amend anti-discrimination laws expressly to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation (as well as gender identity). \u2022 Promote effective measures to prevent violence against men who have sex with men. \u2022 Countries must reform their approach towards transgender people.

Countries must: \u2022 Respect existing civil and religious laws and guarantees related to the right to privacy. \u2022 Repeal all laws that punish cross-dressing. \u2022 Remove legal, regulatory or administrative barriers to formation of community organizations by or for transgender people. \u2022 Amend national anti-discrimination laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity (as well as sexual orientation). \u2022 Ensure transgender people are able to have their affirmed gender recognized in identification documents, without the need for prior medical procedures such as sterilization, sex reassignment surgery or hormonal therapy. Amnesty International, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (Amnesty International n.d.) Amnesty International has embraced a sexual orientation and gender identity framework as part of its Demand Dignity campaign, which aims to end the human rights violations that drive and deepen global poverty. Amnesty International is calling for: \u2022 The decriminalisation of homosexuality where such legislation remains. This entails reviewing all legislation which could result in the discrimination, prosecution and punishment of people solely for their sexual orientation or gender identity. This includes: \u2022 \u201csodomy\u201d laws or similar provisions outlawing sexual conduct between people of same- sex or transgender individuals; \u2022 discriminatory age-of-consent legislation; \u2022 public order legislation used as a pretext for prosecuting and punishing people solely for their sexual orientation or gender identity; and \u2022 laws banning the \u201cpromotion\u201d of homosexuality which can be used to imprison lesbian, gay, bisexual, same-sex practicing and transgender individuals and human rights defenders. All such laws should be repealed or amended. \u2022 A review of all legislation under which a person may be killed by the state, with the immediate aim of progressively restricting the scope of the death penalty so that it is not applied on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, and with a view to the eventual abolition of RESOURCE GUIDE 40 the death penalty, and flogging, all other corporal punishments and all other cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments should be abolished in law. \u2022 The immediate and unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience held solely on the basis of their actual or imputed sexual orientation or gender identity.

Human Rights Considerations in Addressing HIV Among Men who Have Sex with Men (Avrett, 2011) This technical brief provides guidance on rights-based approaches to HIV programming for MSM. It identifies three strategies that are necessary for rights-based programming and provides practical examples of ways in which such programmes have improved health and human rights environments for MSM. Strategy 1: \u2022 Engage with those who would benefit Purpose: \u2022 To advance their collective needs and priorities for health and rights. \u2022 Support effective measures to prevent HIV and improve health in the community. Recommended programme approaches: \u2022 Encourage peer-to-peer support, dialogue, and leadership among MSM. \u2022 Encourage and support the involvement of MSM in health and rights programming. Strategy 2: \u2022 Remove barriers that limit access to HIV programming Purpose: \u2022 To increase the number of MSM who access HIV services, thus increasing the proportion of MSM who receive HIV counseling, testing, and treatment in the context of combination HIV interventions, and ultimately reducing rates of HIV infections and improving the overall health of MSM. 41 1. GLOBAL Recommended programme approaches: \u2022 Document policies and practices that present barriers to the HIV response. \u2022 Promote literacy about human rights and supportive policies and practices. \u2022 Support reporting of and response to rights violations. \u2022 Facilitate dialogue between MSM and policymakers. Strategy 3: \u2022 Integrate rights approaches within health programming and support universal rights to health Purpose: \u2022 To increase access to and use of appropriate, non-discriminatory, and easily available HIV services, with the ultimate aim of reducing the incidence of STIs, HIV, and AIDS-related illness. Recommended programme approaches: \u2022 Promote professional and institutional standards in health care settings \u2022 Support peer-based health services in both community and clinical settings. \u2022 Fund health programming for MSM at sufficient scale. Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity (UN Assembly: Human Rights Council, 2011) The report sets out the areas within which people are discriminated against because of sexual orientation and gender identity and the laws and commitments that guide the removal of these forms of discrimination. The report specifically addresses: \u2022 The absolute right to be free from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity \u2022 The right to privacy and against arbitrary detention \u2022 The right to life, liberty and security \u2022 The need to record and address all forms of homophobic and transgender-phobic violence Gender recognition and related issues: 71. In many countries, transgender persons are unable to obtain legal recognition of their preferred gender, including a change in recorded sex and first name on State-issued identity documents. As a result, they encounter many practical difficulties, including when applying for employment, housing, bank credit or State benefits, or when travelling abroad. 72. Regulations in countries that recognize changes in gender often require, implicitly or explicitly, that applicants undergo sterilization surgery as a condition of recognition. Some RESOURCE GUIDE 42 States also require that those seeking legal recognition of a change in gender be unmarried, implying mandatory divorce in cases where the individual is married. 73. The Human Rights Committee has expressed concern regarding lack of arrangements for granting legal recognition of transgender people\u2019s identities. It has urged States to recognize the right of transgender persons to change their gender by permitting the issuance of new birth certificates and has noted with approval legislation facilitating legal recognition of a change of gender. The Global Fund Strategy in Relation to Working with Sexual Orientation and Gender Identities (The Global Fund, 2009) In 2009 the Global Fund board approved the Strategy in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI). This strategy identified that MSM, transgender people and sex workers often have a difficult time accessing Global Fund grant money and have limited access to Global Fund decision-making bodies, exacerbating the barriers to access to funding. The Strategy recommends 19 actions that the Global Fund Secretariat, its governance structures and its partners can take to better meet the needs of SOGI. All recommended actions are relevant, but specifically: \u2022 Action 7 The Global Fund will work with the Technical Review Panel to strengthen technical review criteria with additional language about both gender equality and SOGI-related health and rights. \u2022 Action 9 The Global Fund will work with Principal Recipients and Country Coordinating Mechanisms to encourage increased country-level and regional-level budget allocations for development of monitoring and evaluation adapted to interventions on vulnerabilities related to gender inequality and SOGI in the fight against HIV, TB and malaria. \u2022 Action 14", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e143bce1-dfd8-460e-8584-35a88ee1d463": {"__data__": {"id_": "e143bce1-dfd8-460e-8584-35a88ee1d463", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15d32cce53c3639c7565d08cf1e14d1bb854c2c5175c71c40ca2761c7e4dd77b"}}, "hash": "15d32cce53c3639c7565d08cf1e14d1bb854c2c5175c71c40ca2761c7e4dd77b", "text": "The Global Fund will support Principal Recipients in improving plans and budgets for community systems strengthening relevant to gender and SOGI in in-country contexts, including budgeting and contracting for technical assistance for this community systems strengthening. \u2022 Action 15 The Global Fund will work with in-country partners, in ways appropriate to those settings, to raise and discuss the role of criminalization of consensual adult homosexual behaviours as a potential barrier to effective health interventions for people due to SOGI. \u2022 Action 19 The Global Fund will commit to meeting with government and civil society representatives before it holds Board meetings in any country where sex between consenting adults of the same gender is criminalized. The Global Fund will use the occasion of a Board Meeting to bring exposure and urgency to this issue through high-level meetings and public relations events, conducted within the scope and mandate of the work of the Global Fund. As with the politically sensitive issue of HIV-related travel restrictions, the Global Fund Board commits to 43 1. GLOBAL dialogue with policy-makers so that decisions can be made with maximum understanding of the implications of such laws and policies. UNAIDS Action Framework: Universal Access for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People (UNAIDS, 2009) The UNAIDS Action Framework was developed with a view of achieving universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support for MSM and transgender people in order to achieve universal access for all. The Framework highlights that actions must be grounded in an understanding of and commitment to human rights and that actions must be informed by evidence. Action is required by a broad range of stakeholders including affected communities, allies, governments, private sector and the UN family. The Framework proposes three immediate objectives and corresponding actions to scale up the response to HIV. The objectives and key actions proposed: \u2022 Objective 1 Improve the human rights situation for men who have sex with men and transgender people\u2014the cornerstone to an effective response to HIV For an enhanced response for male-to-male sex, transgender people and HIV, UNAIDS and its Cosponsors will: \u2022 Develop, strengthen and promote rights-based norms and standards for the integration of men who have sex with men and transgender people into national AIDS responses and provide specific policies and guidance for rights-based and evidence-informed programmes and services; \u2022 Support and strengthen partnerships to address the political, social, legal and economic barriers to appropriately addressing HIV-related issues among men who have sex with men and transgender people. \u2022 Objective 2 Strengthen and promote the evidence base on men who have sex with men, transgender people and HIV For an enhanced response for male-to-male sex, transgender people and HIV, the UNAIDS Secretariat and Cosponsors will: \u2022 Ensure that country partners and other partners have adequate information to develop and support the implementation of appropriate policies and programmes addressing male-to-male sex, transgender people and HIV by supporting improved epidemiological and behavioral surveillance, programme monitoring and evaluation, and related operational research on men who have sex with men and transgender people in relation to HIV (population size, epidemiological, behavioural, social, human rights and other aspects, where relevant, and paying attention to different men who have sex with men and transgender identities, behaviours and situations, such as male sex workers, injecting drug users and prison populations), including appropriate HIV sentinel surveillance, while providing guidance and technical support for the collection of this information; RESOURCE GUIDE 44 \u2022 Develop, document and share evidence of successful HIV programme models that address men who have sex with men and transgender people, along with lessons learnt, to facilitate improved, more targeted and scaled-up programming. \u2022 Objective 3 Strengthen capacity and promote partnerships to ensure broader and better responses for men who have sex with men, transgender people and people with HIV For an enhanced response for male-to-male sex, transgender people and HIV, the UNAIDS Secretariat and Cosponsors will: \u2022 Identify and advocate additional financial resources to address HIV among men who have sex with men and transgender people, help direct these resources to where they are most needed, and support governments and civil society in receiving and applying funds for HIV-related work that addresses male-to-male sex and transgender people; \u2022 Ensure that UNAIDS-supported regional knowledge hubs and technical support facilities are able to deliver timely support and strategic information on male-to-male sex, transgender people and HIV.

PEPFAR\u2019s Technical Guidance on Combination HIV Prevention for MSM identifies a set of core prevention interventions that should be delivered by partner countries to adequately address the needs of MSM. Country Teams are expected to build the capacity of partner countries in order to implement these interventions in a non-discriminatory manner. The Technical Guidance document highlights that access to services must be equitable, voluntary and non-discriminatory and that PEPFAR programmes should involve MSM and support existing MSM networks. The guidance identifies core elements of a comprehensive package of HIV-prevention services and encourages PEPFAR programmes to adopt best practices for MSM. Elements of a comprehensive package of HIV-prevention services: \u2022 Community-based outreach; \u2022 Distribution of condoms and lubricants; \u2022 HIV counseling; \u2022 Active linkages to Health Care services and ART; \u2022 Targeted information, education and communication (IEC); and \u2022 STI prevention, screening and treatment.

The document makes a set of recommendations for advancing the sexual and reproductive health and human rights of MSM living with HIV. For Sexual Health Advocates and HIV Care Workers \u2022 Access to affordable legal assistance should be made available to MSM (youth and adult) who experience sexual coercion or violence \u2022 Specific and targeted information on sexual and reproductive health designed to appeal to MSM living with HIV should be made available, including social marketing efforts that reflect the subjective experiences of MSM. \u2022 Availability of safe virtual or physical social spaces for MSM living with HIV should be expanded and promoted. For Community and Civil Society Organizations \u2022 Empowerment of MSM living with HIV should be integral to all sexual and reproductive health programmes and policies \u2013 including the establishment of self-help groups and networks of MSM living with HIV. \u2022 Campaigns to decrease stigma, discrimination, and the acceptability of homophobia should be supported and promoted. \u2022 Initiatives that encourage the greater involvement of MSM living with HIV must be supported. Trans and intersex people: Discrimination on the grounds of sex, gender identity and gender expression, 2011 (Agius, 2011) This report describes the challenges faced by transgender people and what discrimination on the grounds of gender identity and gender expression looks like. The report looks at the importance of international human rights law and the application of such laws to the rights of transgender people. The report defines trans as those people who have a gender identity and/or a gender expression that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. Transsexual people and transgender people and intersex people are defined as the following: \u2022 Transsexual people identify with the gender role opposite to the sex assigned to them at birth and seek to live permanently in the preferred gender role. This is often accompanied by strong rejection of their physical primary and secondary sex characteristics and a wish to align their body with their preferred gender. Transsexual people might intend to undergo, be undergoing or have undergone gender reassignment treatment. RESOURCE GUIDE 46 \u2022 Transgender people live permanently in their preferred gender. Unlike transsexuals, however, they may not necessarily wish to or need to undergo any medical interventions. \u2022 Intersex people differ from trans people as their status is not gender-related but instead relates to their biological makeup (genetic, hormonal and physical features) which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but is typical of both at once or not clearly defined as either.

The overarching principle of this document in respect for and protection of human rights. All recommendations are relevant, but specifically: d. Legislators and other government authorities should establish anti-discrimination and protective laws, derived from international human rights standards, in order to eliminate discrimination and violence faced by MSM and transgender people, and reduce their vulnerability to infection with HIV, and the impacts of HIV and AIDS. e. Health services should be made inclusive of MSM and transgender people, based on the principles of medical ethics and the right to health. f. Offering HIV testing and counseling to MSM and transgender people is strongly recommended over not offering this intervention g. Implementing individual-level behavioral interventions for the prevention of HIV and STIs among MSM and transgender people is suggested over not implementing such interventions. h. MSM and transgender people living with HIV should have the same access to ART as other populations. ART should be initiated at CD4 counts of \u2264350 cells/mm3 (and for those in WHO clinical stage 3 or 4 if CD4 testing is not available). Access should also include management of opportunistic infections, co-morbidities and treatment failure. Additional resources: 1.

The Report and Regional Framework for Action that came out of this meeting were endorsed by ESCAP member states. The Framework called for greater regional cooperation to accelerate progress towards meeting the commitments in the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS and the MDGs. The Meeting noted that there has been an increase in HIV prevalence among MSM in the region, and recognized efforts made to promote greater access to HIV services for MSM by countries such as India, Indonesia, Thailand and Viet Nam. The Meeting acknowledged that transgender people face heightened stigma and discrimination, including a lack of formal recognition of their gender identification. In order to meet global commitments, countries must work to reduce HIV among MSM and transgender populations. Punitive legal and policy environments that hinder interventions targeting key affected populations are a major constraint in Government\u2019s ability to develop effective HIV responses. This includes laws that criminalize same-sex relations and sex work, as well as laws that impose HIV-related restrictions on entry, stay and residence. Laws criminalizing same-sex sexual activity coupled with stigma and discrimination limit access to HIV services for MSM and create conditions that encourage the spread of the epidemic. Interventions aimed at delivering services to MSM cannot succeed if the intended beneficiaries are fugitives of the law. The Regional Framework for Action: \u2022 2012 \u2013 National multi-sectoral consultations on policy/legal barriers (almost complete for MSM/transgender people) \u2022 2013 \u2013 participatory and inclusive national reviews on implementing the Political Declaration, ESCAP resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 \u2022 Early 2014 \u2013 Regional overview of progress in meeting the commitments in the Political Declaration, ESCAP resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 51 2.

Acknowledge that prevention is the cornerstone of regional, national and international HIV responses and ensure that adequate financial resources are provided for scaling up evidence-based and targeted prevention programmes for key populations-at-risk; b. Ensure that national prevention strategies comprehensively target populations at higher risk, such as people who use drugs, sex workers, and men having sex with men, including transgender people, and that systems of data collection and analysis about these populations are strengthened; c. Develop and scale up community-led HIV prevention services to reduce sexual transmission of HIV and to address stigma and discrimination; f.

Redefining AIDS in Asia (Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia, 2008) Commissioned by UNAIDS and presented to Mr. Ban Ki-moon on 26 March 2008, Redefining AIDS in Asia cemented Asia\u2019s commitment to focusing on MSM and key population focused HIV programmes. The Commission undertook research into Asia\u2019s pandemic and produced recommendations for effective action. The report found that HIV knowledge among surveyed groups of MSM was poor and calls for an urgent scale-up of interventions focused on MSM to prevent the transmission of HIV and to ensure greater access to HIV services. 53 2. REGIONAL All findings and recommendations are relevant, but specifically: \u2022 The vast majority of HIV infections in Asia occur during three high-risk behaviours (unprotected commercial sex, the sharing of contaminated injecting equipment, and unprotected sex between men) and one ostensibly \u2018low-risk\u2019 behavior (sex between wives and their HIV-infected husbands). \u2022 Leaders should ensure that an \u2018enabling environment\u2019 for prevention, care and impact mitigation is established. Legislatures and institutions must address legal or institutional restrictions that undermine effective programmes. Non-governmental and community organizations, working with Government entities, need to develop strategies to convince the public to support appropriate efforts. Some of those interventions form an intrinsic part of the HIV response and should be funded accordingly. \u2022 HIV-related stigma and discrimination continue to undermine Asia\u2019s response to the epidemic\u2014whether by sanctioning inaction or encouraging the harassment and maltreatment of people affected by the epidemic. Leaders must show greater resolve in challenging the ignorance and prejudice that surround the epidemic, and in supporting legislative and other changes that can reduce stigma and discrimination. \u2022 Engagement of affected communities in planning, implementing and assessing HIV responses is weak. Because of the marginalization of people most at risk and the stigma experienced by people living with HIV, AIDS policies and programmes need to be informed by engagements with the affected communities. At present in Asia, the involvement of such key populations in national HIV responses is weak and, in many places, tokenistic.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ced56ec5-067f-4ee7-bf00-9d572a809abb": {"__data__": {"id_": "ced56ec5-067f-4ee7-bf00-9d572a809abb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62cc7019d2515aeeb91b5b00000783975a490f737f8f66ee385e35587636fd13"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bda8165-d000-4cd3-bfd8-2298affb4695", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eada67cf54bf9bb0078d8171e62d4e526c864505d9748ce60a4977d811eb90ca"}}, "hash": "b5904af04f3d36ce06b2b7ca6188fad69797546c04fe9de4af85745d5a619757", "text": "\u2022 Address legal barriers to effective prevention in most at-risk populations.

Community organizations, including those representing most-at-risk groups and people living with HIV, should be involved in designing, implementing and monitoring this undertaking. RESOURCE GUIDE 54 Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 An agenda for action (Godwin, 2010) In 2010 APCOM and UNDP commissioned an investigation into the legal environments affecting HIV responses of 48 countries in Asia and the Pacific. The study specifically focused on the effects of laws, policies, and practices and the role of CSOs in improving legal environments for MSM and transgender people. The study found that legal environments that marginalize MSM and transgender people contribute to low levels of access to HIV services. The report identified the following as characteristics of a repressive legal environment: \u2022 laws criminalizing male-to-male sex between consenting adults; \u2022 law enforcement practices targeting MSM and transgender people for harassment, assault, extortion and detention, relating to allegations of breach of public order, sex work, trafficking or other offences; \u2022 censorship laws restricting publication of images or messages relating to homosexuality; \u2022 laws that restrict community-based organizations (CBOs) from obtaining legal status; \u2022 absence of legal protections from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity; \u2022 absence of legal recognition of transgender status, for purposes including identification, passports and travel rights, voting, entitlements to welfare, and the right to marry; \u2022 absence of legal recognition of same-sex relationships. This can result in denial of a range of benefits available to heterosexual partners including participation as next-of-kin in medical decisions, denial of welfare and housing entitlements, and denial of inheritance rights. All recommendations made by the report are relevant, but specifically: Governments should: \u2022 Repeal laws that criminalize sex between consenting adults. \u2022 Enact anti-discrimination laws in relation to sexual orientation and transgender status. \u2022 Ensure parliamentarians, police, judges and justice ministry officials have access to evidence- based information and are trained on the epidemiology of HIV and the harmful public health and human rights impacts of punitive laws and law enforcement practices relating to MSM and transgender people. \u2022 Support community-based education and advocacy regarding the human rights of MSM and transgender people, and access to legal aid for MSM and transgender people who have experienced human rights violations.

RESOURCE GUIDE 56 MSM, HIV and the Law: The Case of Gay, Bisexual and other Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) (Beyrer and Stefan D 2011) This report presents a review of available literature on MSM, HIV and the Law and makes a series of recommendations from the findings. All recommendations and key findings are relevant, but specifically: \u2022 Sodomy laws and other anti-gay laws should be repealed. \u2022 Responses to HIV epidemics among MSM in these highly disparate political and human rights environments have to be context specific: one size will not fit all. \u2022 Community participation in every step of programme development and implementation for MSM is crucial: the community is the key partner for this population. \u2022 Although quantification of the impact of structural interventions is important, action is mandated to decrease human rights abuses against MSM on social justice and human dignity grounds alone. \u2022 While the available evidence base does not allow for the direct measurement of laws against homosexuality on HIV rates among MSM, there is compelling and consistent data to demonstrate that legal sanctions and stigma and discrimination limit MSM access to HIV prevention, treatment, and care, and are a barrier to universal access. \u2022 Because HIV infection remains incurable, limits on the right to access prevention and treatment services are limits on the right to life itself, making the repeal of anti-homosexual legislation a life-saving intervention. \u2022 Law enforcement programmes and policies should move from harassment to protection, and to being valued partners in the HIV response, rather than obstacles to outreach, services provision, and public health. Lost in Transition: Transgender People, Rights and HIV Vulnerability in the Asia-Pacific Region (Winter, 2012) The aim of this report is to provide a research and strategic information framework to guide governments, civil society, donors and key stakeholders to design and produce relevant research as part of collective effort to reduce the extreme vulnerability of transgender people to HIV, while protecting their rights in the Asia-Pacific Region. A research agenda is proposed that can facilitate reduction in future HIV risk for trans* people, as well as promoting better access to treatment, care and support for transgender persons living with HIV in the Asia-Pacific region. Trans* women here are birth-assigned males identifying and/or presenting as female, or (in those cultures in which it is accepted that there are more than two genders) as members of another broadly feminised gender. Trans* men are birth-assigned females identifying and/or presenting as male or as another broadly masculinised gender. Key conclusions from this report include: \u2022 The available Asia-Pacific research on trans* people is patchy. Across the region some research issues, geographical areas and demographic groups are better researched than others. Where research exists the research samples are often small, and focus on narrow sections of transgender communities. 57 2. REGIONAL \u2022 It is not known how many trans* people (whether trans* men or trans* women) there are region-wide, but it is suspected that there are many, and (as already noted) that far too many are HIV positive.

Men who have sex with men \u2013 the missing piece in the national responses to AIDS in Asia and the Pacific (UNAIDS, 2007) In 2007, UNAIDS identified MSM-specific services as a key component missing from most national HIV programmes. The report highlighted that MSM are a significant component of the HIV epidemic in the Asia-Pacific region and that stigma and discrimination drive the epidemic. The report found that condom use among MSM was low and that many MSM also have sex with women, indicating a clear risk for female sexual partners of MSM. The report also highlighted the importance of evidence-based national responses, emphasizing the need for countries in Asia to address MSM in these responses. Treatment Access for Positive MSM in the Asia Pacific (APN+, 2010) The Asia Pacific Network of People Living with HIV and AIDS (APN+) commissioned a research project in six Asian countries to assess the range and quality of HIV services available for MSM and transgender people living with HIV and structural barriers to treatment access. The countries in which research was undertaken are India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, and Singapore. Structural barriers identified through this research include availability of treatment, accessibility and economic costs of services. All research findings are relevant, but specifically: \u2022 Stigma and discrimination, particularly amongst healthcare providers, is a major disincentive to seek treatment. \u2022 Unethical disclosure of sexuality and/or HIV status by healthcare staff perpetuates distrust in local healthcare infrastructure. \u2022 Strong cultural norms pertaining to sexuality impede availability of accurate treatment information, create the fear of disclosure and an increased chance of social isolation and loss of social support. HIV in Asia \u2013 Transforming the agenda for 2012 and beyond (Godwin & Dickinson, 2012) This report builds on findings from the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia in 2008, providing strategic advice on policy, programming and partnership investments for HIV in the STRATEGIC INFORMATION RESOURCE GUIDE 58 region. In order to develop evidence-based strategic options, an assessment of investments and impacts in the region was conducted. The report addresses issues related to funding and service architecture, and provides strategic options aimed at bilateral and multilateral organizations. Organizational Mapping Project of HIV/AIDS Groups for MSM and Transgenders in Insular Southeast Asia, 2010 (APCOM, 2010) This project report summarizes activities and finding from a Mapping Project that aimed to: 1. Produce an organizational database of groups, community organizations, and institutions that provide HIV/AIDS services for MSM/TGs in their respective countries or territories, from prevention, treatment, care and support to stigma reduction advocacy work; 2. Aggregate findings on the state of preventive measures for MSM/TGs that are being implemented in the target countries and territories and identify the strengths and weaknesses of these responses, and; 3. Identify MSM/TG-related issues to present a general and qualitative analysis of situation of the community in their respective countries and cull needs for further action. Key findings: \u2022 There appears to be no institution, NGO, community-based organization or hospital or clinic in insular Southeast Asia that can provide a comprehensive response or package of HIV and sexual health services and interventions for MSM/transgender people. \u2022 There is limited or no information on existing HIV/AIDS services for MSM/TGs in Brunei Darrusalam and Timor-Leste, raising questions on the response being taken to address the issue in these areas. \u2022 Community response is largely focused on prevention, with peer-led workshops, confidential discussions, online and on-site or venue-based outreach activities, hotlines and anonymous counseling, and the distribution of IEC materials and safer sex paraphernalia as the main forms of interventions. \u2022 Community organizing is strong in Indonesia and the Philippines, very minimal in Malaysia, and almost non-existent in Brunei Darussalam and Timor Leste. In all countries, discriminatory policies and practices, abusive law enforcers, and punitive laws and ordinance hinder community organizing. \u2022 There is difficulty in reaching out to vulnerable sub-groups of MSM/TGs, such as male or transgender sex workers, drug users, and sex workers. \u2022 In all ISEAN countries, political repression, persecution by religious groups, and lack of social acceptance hinder the full inclusion of MSM/TGs in their respective national response and compromise the effectiveness of an already limited range of services.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17b31d30-1e24-4d4c-8bf9-2efd400b928a": {"__data__": {"id_": "17b31d30-1e24-4d4c-8bf9-2efd400b928a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ede30dc05dab1cb0206e13eaca9372b62db7fb80fc58b2c79c074387811ef6f6"}, "2": {"node_id": "16c8fbee-fc92-40d1-b74a-5962c38bd347", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63b6e14176be2afdb59921d344a20ba2ec9fcf950030ac87b0403d8b9fbd33a0"}}, "hash": "9486fa85c114c57d9b7c146013643c83af701a3250eac2f06f4f38f914529894", "text": "MAP Report 2005 \u2013 Male-Male Sex and HIV/AIDS in Asia (Pisani and Brown, 2004) This report summarizes key epidemiological findings of HIV and AIDS among MSM in Asia and discusses implications of those findings.

It all starts here: Estimating the size of populations of men who have sex with men and transgender people- (APCOM 2010) 3. HIV and Men who have Sex with Men in Asia and the Pacific- (UNAIDS 2006) 4. Men who have sex with men and transgender populations Multi-City Initiative (USAID/ UNDP 2010) Report of the Consultation on HIV, STI and Other Health Needs of Transgender People in Asia and the Pacific, 2012 (WHO, 2012) The WHO Regional Offices for the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific held a Consultation on HIV, STI and Other Health Needs of Transgender People in Asia and the Pacific from 11 to 13 September 2012 in Manila, Philippines. Recommendations: 1. Urgent advocacy is needed in order to create a safe, enabling health-care environment to achieve equal access to health for transgender people and realize the goal of zero HIV new infections, zero discrimination and zero AIDS-related deaths in this community. 2. All efforts to address transgender specific issues should be guided by the human rights principles of equality, non-discrimination and meaningful participation and be aimed at community empowerment. 3. Transgender people should be legally recognized as having equal rights and dignity, which are and should be protected under the law, with passage of protective legislation to contribute to a climate of acceptance and equality. Transgender people should have the right to legal recognition of their gender identity, and the recognition of gender status should not depend on medical treatment or surgical procedures. 4. Transgender people should be involved meaningfully in all efforts aiming to address the health needs of transgender people at all levels: policy-making; programming and service delivery; and design, implementation, monitoring and reporting. In order for this to occur specific capacity-building and resources should be made available to strengthen and empower the transgender community and civil society organizations, as well as support groups. 5. Comprehensive standards of care for transgender people and evidence-based guidelines on transgender health should be developed, taking into account holistic needs of transgender people in Asia and the Pacific, including sexual health care, transition health care, hormone therapy, mental/psychosocial health care and general health care. An appropriate agency or group of agencies should be tasked with developing guidance on the: \u2022 use of hormone treatment for transgender people; \u2022 use of surgical treatment for transgender people; and \u2022 management of the specific needs of transgender men, transgender women, and young and older transgender people. GUIDANCE ON DESIGNING HIV PROGRAMMES AND SERVICES FOR MSM AND TRANSGENDER PEOPLE RESOURCE GUIDE 60 6. Collection of strategic information through transgender-specific HIV/STI surveillance combined with more operational, psychosocial and mental health research, including population estimation, should be conducted with transgender people specific to the Asia Pacific context. This is to measure the levels of HIV and other STIs, risk behaviours, stigma and discrimination, and the impact on the HIV response. Disaggregation of data between transgender people- transgender women (male-to-female), transgender men (female-to-male) and other genders- and men who have sex with men (MSM) was strongly recommended. 7. Efforts to reduce stigma and discrimination against transgender people should be included in national health strategic planning and programming activities. Stigma and discrimination against transgender people by health-care providers should be decreased in public and private settings by increasing knowledge, sensitivity and empowerment in an effort to create an enabling environment. 8. Health-care providers and other care providers should be receive training on nondiscrimination, codes of conduct, quality of care and oversight for service providers to support transgender people. 9. Training institutions for health-care providers, school teachers and administrators, and other stakeholders should ensure that basic content addressing the health needs of transgender people is covered in medical, nursing, law enforcement, social service institutions and other relevant training curricula. Additional efforts should also be made to focus on content to reduce stigma and discrimination by health-care providers in pre-service and post-service training. 10. Efforts should be made to mobilize resources to undertake special surveys and mapping of existing services and to enable and sustain good models of health services for transgender people, which can be replicated across the regions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ac7c36b-724e-4372-b7a4-4be7d69e2fec": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ac7c36b-724e-4372-b7a4-4be7d69e2fec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42004f972eed94eb0c3441b824cc06ef6e3cd6756421af7ce8d26fb5c2e08fed"}, "2": {"node_id": "493e710c-1e83-42c1-99e4-b4ad87d451ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78852794bbf8dd67b89daad1853b5e8dfe87709318e2fbab84471c36ee3b16d7"}}, "hash": "322e2b5409cf08547db2954b629f6d6beaf8ad10e6e3007631fbd408f57a372a", "text": "Towards Universal Access: Examples of Municipal HIV Programming for Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender People in Six Asian Cities (UNDP, 2011) Methodology and Implementation Manual for Six Cities Scanning Initiative for Scale-Up of HIV Responses to MSM and TG Persons (Berry, 2010) In 2010 UNDP commissioned a scan of programme activities addressing HIV and human rights among MSM and transgender people in six cities across Asia and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad70c761-59c3-43f4-8e2f-a47a03ffa8fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad70c761-59c3-43f4-8e2f-a47a03ffa8fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4083031c370b821f2bb04690af12f45e578daa78ac9b9663ed2a630682173a2"}}, "hash": "b4083031c370b821f2bb04690af12f45e578daa78ac9b9663ed2a630682173a2", "text": "the Pacific.

The aim of this study, beyond its use in the six cities, was to identify activities conducted by successful HIV programmes working with MSM and transgender people to aid in future programme design. Ensuring universal access to comprehensive HIV services for MSM in Asia and the Pacific, 2009 (amfAR, 2009) An assessment to identify priorities for operations research was undertaken in 2009 to better understand effective models for HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support among MSM in 61 2. REGIONAL Asia and the Pacific. Prevention-to-care approaches include health promotion, behavior change communication, emotional and social support, and clinical care. A conceptual model for an HIV prevention-to-care continuum for MSM includes the following: \u2022 Improving knowledge through community education, outreach services and promoting the effective use of condoms and other prevention tools; \u2022 Promoting behavior change through community mobilization, health education workshops, seminars, support groups, cultural change; \u2022 Providing STI diagnosis and treatment through accessible clinical services that help to reduce population-level rates of STIs, individual susceptibility to HIV infection and general health; \u2022 Enabling people to know their HIV status through effective VCT services that provide pathways to ongoing prevention support for all; \u2022 HIV treatment, care and support that provides for the social and emotional needs of people with HIV; and, \u2022 Access to other social, legal and welfare services that affect other drivers of the epidemic: poverty, unemployment, poor mental health, marginalization and lack of education. Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific \u2013 Regional Consensus Meeting (Bangkok), 2009 (UNDP 2009) This report summarizes the presentations and group-work at a regional consensus meeting held to develop a comprehensive package of programmes and services for MSM and transgender people in Asia. Elements of the Comprehensive Package agreed to: \u2022 HIV Prevention \u2022 Peer outreach, peer education and drop-in services \u2022 Promotion of, and access to the means of prevention \u2022 STI prevention and treatment \u2022 HIV counseling and testing \u2022 Access to HIV Treatment, Care and Support \u2022 An Enabling Environment for prevention and care services \u2022 Strategic Information RESOURCE GUIDE 62 Health sector response to HIV/AIDS among MSM, 2009, Western Pacific Region (WHO, 2009) In February 2009 the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific held a consultation in Hong Kong to discuss ways of scaling up the health sector response to HIV and AIDS among MSM and transgender people. The consultation identified action areas necessary for strengthening the response through the strategic collection and use of information, advocacy for a supportive environment, and promotion of a single comprehensive package of services for MSM and transgender people. The report recognized that laws and policies can hinder a supportive environment and made the following recommendations for a supportive legal and regulatory environment. This collaboration identified a comprehensive package of service and programmes that would support HIV prevention and care among MSM and transgender people: \u2022 free condom and lubricant distribution \u2022 outreach projects \u2022 targeted media campaigns, including use of the internet \u2022 HIV and sexual health services including: \u2022 HIV counseling, testing and treatment \u2022 STI screening & treatment \u2022 screening and treatment for genital & anorectal problems \u2022 Hep B testing & vaccination \u2022 Hep C testing \u2022 Hormonal management & monitoring for transgender people \u2022 services for HIV-positive MSM and transgender people \u2022 HIV treatment \u2022 HIV prevention services, including: \u2022 family planning for female partners \u2022 care, counseling & testing for sero-discordant couples \u2022 psychosexual counseling \u2022 psychosocial counseling, including substance use issues The report identifies the following essential supportive activities to implement the comprehensive package of services: \u2022 capacity building for health-care workers, CBOs \u2022 mobilization by CBOs of their target community \u2022 advocacy 63 2.

The report highlights the responsibility of the health sector, in collaboration with other sectors and the community to develop and support accessible, acceptable and equitable comprehensive programmes and service delivery models that address the needs of MSM. WHO, UNDP, UNAIDS, UNESCO and APCOM are all of the view that the meaningful involvement of MSM and transgender people is central to an effective, rights-based HIV response. All recommendations set out in this report are relevant, but specifically: \u2022 HIV prevention interventions in the health sector should include: \u2022 interventions aimed at changing behavior; \u2022 those aimed at addressing cultural norms, social attitudes and behaviours that may increase people\u2019s vulnerability to STI and HIV infection; and \u2022 biomedical interventions such as promotion of condoms, lubricants, and clean needles and syringes. \u2022 The health sector, as part of a multisectoral response, should provide guidance on sex education, school-based HIV education, mass media communications and educational messaging, and other behavior change interventions designed to increase the demand for and use of condoms and lubricant by MSM. Health facilities in contact with MSM should actively promote effective and consistent condom and lubricant use. \u2022 HIV prevention programmes should accord high priority to transgender people in all settings through specially targeted programmes. In addition to the full range of prevention interventions, these programmes need to place special emphasis on developing advocacy skills related to the special needs of transgender people, self and community empowerment, psychosocial support and counseling, and capacity building. \u2022 MSM services should generally be provided in mainstream STI clinics rather than in stand- alone MSM clinics, which may increase stigma and discourage attendance. Conversely, it may be deemed preferable to have MSM-specific facilities in some local contexts, at least as referral or centers of excellence. \u2022 Healthcare practitioners at all levels of service provision should be sensitized to the needs of MSM and transgender clients. \u2022 Priority must be given to engaging and maintaining MSM in HIV care with services that offer an environment in which stigma and discrimination are minimized. MSM should be given supportive access to the full range of services in which staff are sensitized to their issues and needs. RESOURCE GUIDE 64 International Union against Sexually Transmitted Infections (IUSTI Asia Pacific Branch) Clinical Guidelines for Sexual Health Care of MSM (Bourne, 2005) The Clinical Guidelines for Sexual Health Care of MSM acknowledge that clinical environments can be threatening to MSM and transgender people and that these populations often withhold information that may be critical to care or avoid medical care all together due to fear of discrimination. This document outlines various clinical guidelines for working with MSM and transgender people. Health care services guidelines for MSM and transgender people: \u2022 Employment of qualified MSM & transgender staff at the clinic where possible; \u2022 A workplace free from discrimination and harassment for MSM & transgender staff; \u2022 Policies for non-discriminatory service delivery; \u2022 Complaints procedure for anti-discrimination policies; \u2022 MSM & transgender sensitive clinic reception procedures and staff; \u2022 Culturally competent MSM & transgender issues services; \u2022 Confidentiality as a cornerstone of sexual health care; \u2022 Privacy; \u2022 MSM & transgender youth and children issues; and \u2022 MSM & transgender community input to board of directors.

Brunei Darussalam UNGASS Report, 2012 (Government of Brunei, 2012) Brunei\u2019s Global AIDS Progress Reporting 2012 and Universal Access in the Health Sector Reporting identified that MSMs are a difficult group to target for surveillance and prevention due to the fact that homosexual acts are illegal and that and there are no formalized groupings or associations that deal specifically with MSM issues. Brunei Darussalam UNGASS Report, 2012 (Government of Brunei, 2012) The report highlights Brunei Darussalam\u2019s commitment towards achieving the targets of the Millennium Development. The report does not however outline strategies specifically targeting MSM or transgender people. It states the following: \u2022 His Majesty\u2019s Government provides free and comprehensive health care to all citizens and permanent residents of Brunei Darussalam. This includes all aspects of prevention, care, treatment and support for HIV although there is no separate budget allocated for HIV/AIDS specifically. \u2022 First-line antiretrovirals are readily provided to citizens and permanent residents. \u2022 Although available, second and third-line have to be applied for on an individual basis. NATIONAL RESPONSE RESOURCE GUIDE 68 Organizational Mapping Project of HIV/AIDS Groups for MSM and Transgenders in Insular Southeast Asia (APCOM, 2010) This report presents the finding from a mapping project aimed at identifying HIV/AIDS services for MSM and transgender people and scoping the capabilities and engagements of existing organisations. The mapping reported finding limited or no information on existing HIV/AIDS services for MSM and transgender people, identifying one hospital with VCT and treatment facilities and no NGOs or CBOs. HIV and men who have sex with men: Country Snapshots- Indonesia, 2012 (UNDP/UNAIDS, 2012) Key legal information identified: \u2022 Sex between males is legal, except for MSM and waria who live in provinces or districts that have Sharia-based ordinances. Homosexual acts are only officially criminalized in the Province of South Sumatera (including the Municipality of Palembang). An anti-homosexuality ordinance in Aceh was never enacted though it is believed that the present governor is more religiously conservative. \u2022 The legality of sex work is difficult to determine since crimes against decency or morality are sometimes applied to sex workers. Provinces or districts with Sharia-based ordinances generally have laws that forbid sex work. \u2022 There are no laws that explicitly aim to protect MSM, waria, or people living with HIV. However, the Indonesian Constitution does describe every citizen\u2019s \u201cright to a life of well- being in body and mind, to a place to dwell, to enjoy a good and healthy environment, and to receive medical care.\u201d \u2022 The Department of Social Affairs classifies waria as mentally handicapped, a designation that is suspected to restrict employment opportunities, though evidence for this is limited. \u2022 The law allows post-operative waria and intersex people to change gender on official documents and records, though waria often do not have legal documentation. In Jakarta, 70 percent of waria were found not to have any kind of identification card. \u2022 MSM, waria, and HIV outreach workers have reported difficulties with law enforcement authorities. These include police violence and interpretation of some laws to arrest MSM and waria. \u2022 There is no legal protection against sexual assault or rape for men. \u2022 The legal system has been classified as \u201cneutral\u201d for MSM/ TG in two UN reviews.

Article 33 of the proposed law provides for penalties for homosexual acts of 100 lashes, a fine of 100 grams of gold or eight months imprisonment. The Ordinance was enacted by the Aceh Legislative Council. Approval from the Governor of Aceh is mandatory before a provincial law can be formally enacted. Once the Qanun Bill has been accepted by the Governor of Aceh, it remains subject to the final endorsement of the Minister of Home Affairs of the national government as a prerequisite to entering into force. The local Governor has not endorsed the bill and has suggested revisions. It has been reported that human rights organizations are seeking to challenge the validity of the Qanun Jinayat in the Constitutional Court. Despite the lack of confirmation of the Qanun Jinayat, there are reports of Sharia police harassing sexual minorities in Aceh. Sharia police reportedly harass transgender people who work at beauty parlours, on the grounds that Sharia law prohibits men working in female environments. It is possible for inter-sex and post-operative transsexuals to legally change their sex on identity cards. Although a legal mechanism to change sex exists, it requires documentation that many waria do not have. Waria are often unable to acquire basic legal documentation. The Department of Social Affairs classifies waria as mentally handicapped under the national \u2018cacat law\u2019 (Mentally Disabled Law). This effectively denies waria the right to work or reduces them to working in low- paid jobs in the hidden economy. Other Laws: National legal framework for district support to community-based responses Presidential Decree No. 75/2006 defines the powers of the National AIDS Commission and the AIDS Commissions operating at the provincial and municipal or district-levels. In some localities, this has provided a framework in which local government health authorities have been able to assist in the development of CBOs that focus on HIV responses for MSM and transgender people.194 Devolution of legislative powers in Indonesia is resulting in a diversity of local responses to HIV. Rape of males There is no protection against sexual assault or rape for homosexual men. The Indonesian Penal Code rape provisions (Art. 285) only protect women. RESOURCE GUIDE 70 Pornography Law The Pornography Law of 2008 defines pornography broadly to include any picture, photograph, conversation, body language or other messages through various forms of communication and/ or public performance that contain obscenities that violate the norms of morality. Educational materials for HIV prevention and other purposes are not intended to be within the definition of pornography. Nonetheless, there are concerns that this definition is so broad that the law may act as a disincentive to use of explicit images or messages in health promotion materials that relate to homosexuality. Indonesia\u2019s Constitutional Court has upheld the validity of the Anti- Pornography Law. Broadcast standards Guidelines for Broadcast Behavior and Broadcast Program Standards were issued by the Indonesian Broadcast Commission in 2004. Article 49 on Homosexuals/Lesbians states: Broadcasting institutions can broadcast programmes which report, discuss, or contain a story on homosexuality and lesbian [sic], within the following parameters: the programmes may not promote and depict homosexuality and lesbian as an acceptable practice within society; except for news programmes, those discussing or containing a story on homosexuality and lesbian may only be broadcast between 22.00 to 03.00 hours of the time zone of the broadcasting station. Transgender people are not mentioned in Article 49. Transgender people are protected from humiliating depiction in Article 51 of the Guidelines. The 1945 Constitution of Indonesia (Parliament of the Republic of Indonesia, 2002) All articles are relevant, but specifically: Article 27 1. All citizens shall be equal before the law and the government and shall be required to respect the law and the government, with no exceptions. 2. Every citizen shall have the right to work and to earn a humane livelihood. Article 28A Every person shall have the right to live and to defend his/her life and existence. Article 28B 1. 1.

RESOURCE GUIDE 72 National HIV and AIDS Strategy and Action Plan 2010 \u2013 2014 (National AIDS Commission Secretary, 2010) This document contains a comprehensive set of strategies and prioritized activities and is in line with Indonesia\u2019s Mid-Term National Development Plan 2010 \u2013 2014. Prior to developing this document, a Mid-Term Review was conducted to evaluate the implementation of the National HIV and AIDS Action Plan 2007 \u2013 2010. Important findings from this review, as well as the policy guidance from the Mid-Term National Development Plan 2010 \u2013 2014 were used by representatives of both government and non-government groups to develop strategies and plans for future implementation. Relevant strategies, actions and targets for responding to HIV and AIDS include: \u2022 To increase MSM coverage which is still too low, a comprehensive programme will be formulated and implemented with active participation of the MSM community. \u2022 The main populations to be reached and served in prevention programmes are: injecting drug users, sex workers, and men who have sex with men (MSM). \u2022 Effective work with MSM will be important to reverse the rising trend of the of AIDS epidemic. Coverage and programme targets will need to increase 3 to 8 times over before the transmission of HIV among MSM and their intimate partners can be contained. \u2022 By 2014 programme implementation is expected to cover at least 80 percent of key populations. To achieve universal access targets by 2014 annual targets have been set to ensure that key populations and people living with HIV can access prevention, care, support, and treatment services that they need. \u2022 By 2014 it is hoped that at least 60 percent of the key populations should have reduced their risk behaviour and that they will continue safe practice into the future. At least 60 percent of key population engaging in unsafe sexual intercourse will use condom consistently.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58aa471f-910e-4c77-badb-f05a5a7f5176": {"__data__": {"id_": "58aa471f-910e-4c77-badb-f05a5a7f5176", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Community Leadership and Advocacy Framework and Resource Guide: HIV, Human Rights and Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Islands of Southeast Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f7e6d427e0c1a68a1901db786be2e7c24ac636f0ff3bdbdc783291a8d69b7ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "8fe58265-9dcf-411d-ba3f-2e80d3d4e2a8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/community-leadership-and-advocacy-framework-and-resource-guide-hiv-human-rights-and-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2ef493c6c87a1939c10ae48c78ce992019987f8389f63579a219f664c76b6e69"}}, "hash": "3973594770092e6608657f0bb87000aa0cadc57b41b48085609072a72fb4ee70", "text": "At least 60 percent of key population engaging in unsafe sexual intercourse will use condom consistently.

National MSM Networks: \u2022 There three national networks that work for and involve MSM and transgender people: Aliansi Satu Visi, a network made up of several CBOs and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work on sexual and human rights issues, including increasing access to crisis centres for gender-based violence victims; Indonesia LGBTIQ forum, a network of CBOs and NGOs that work on human rights issues that concern MSM and transgender people; and Gay-Waria-MSM (GWL-INA), a network of CBOs and NGOs that work on HIV and human rights issues that concern MSM and transgender people. \u2022 GWL-INA was heavily involved in drafting the National HIV and AIDS Strategy and Action Plan for 2010 to 2014. Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific- An agenda for action, 2010 (Godwin, 2010) According to this report: The National Network of MSM, Waria and Other Stakeholders (GWL-INA) sits on the National AIDS Commission. Arus Pelangi is the Indonesian Federation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Communities. Arus Pelangi campaigns for LGBT issues, with a focus on issues affecting human rights. Arus Pelangi advocates and lobbies with governmental institutions in order to increase the level of formal protection of LGBT people through government policies and the law. Arus Pelangi is involved in advocacy related to legal representation and campaigns for the amendment of discriminatory public policies. GAYa NUSANTARA is another CBO that conducts advocacy on MSM and waria issues. Indonesian Waria Communication Forum (Forum Komunikasi Waria Indonesia\u2013FKWI) advocates for legal recognition of transgender people. In 2009, FKWI reached an agreement with House of Representatives\u2019 Commission IX, which oversees citizenship, health, labor and transmigration affairs for protection from discrimination. The Commission asked the manpower minister to pay serious attention to complaints about employment discrimination and has facilitated meetings between ministry officials and waria groups. CBO success in challenging police harassment and violence towards waria sex workers: Surabaya After a spate of violent police operations targeting sex workers in 2008, the Surabaya Association of Waria (Perwakos) approached a local legal aid organization (LBH Kosgoro) and an HIV NGO (Genta Foundation) working with female sex workers for assistance in advocacy with authorities. A meeting was held with officials from Provincial Social Services, regular police officers from different levels (provincial, metropolitan and suburban) and from the municipal police. The result RESOURCE GUIDE 74 was that police clean-up operations were carried out without physical or sexual violence for some months. However, the violence happened again in 2009, and a similar mediation meeting was facilitated by the same organization with the same institutions, which succeeded in preventing further violence.

Now, for the first time ever, these groups have a voice in the coordination of Indonesia\u2019s national HIV response. As a member of the National AIDS Commission (NAC), the network has gained the respect and attention of the Indonesian government and has developed a National Strategic Action Plan that complements the existing 2010\u20132014 AIDS National Strategy and Action Plan, providing clear guidance for the development and implementation of HIV and AIDS response programmes targeting gay, MSM and waria. With other civil society groups, the network has also launched a joint advocacy campaign on the rights of people living with HIV (PLHIV).

Sex reassignment surgery and reassignment therapy are legal in Malaysia, although transgender people cannot change their identity cards to reflect their new gender. Without proper documentation, transgender people face harassment and persecution from the police and religious authorities, are refused employment and are deprived of the right to marry. In 2004, a man who had undergone a sex change and was previously a woman lost his bid to the Ipoh High Court to be legally recognized as a male. Other Laws: Censorship Strict censorship laws restrict depiction of homosexuality in the media or on films. The Garis Panduan Penapisan Filem (Film Censorship Guidelines) discourage positive portrayals of homosexuality. Recent revisions of these guidelines in March 2010 have indicated that depictions of transgender persons (mak nyah) were permissible in films but required that they became \u201cnormal\u201d (i.e. heterosexual) in the end or died somewhere in the storyline insinuating a form of divine retribution. An independent review of HIV prevention for MSM in Kuala Lumpur observed: While service organizations are needed, the effectiveness of their work is limited by government censorship and control\u2014explicit or implicit\u2014of safer-sex information, particularly that which is targeted at the MSM community. Penal code sections 292, 293, 377A, and possibly others are broadly used to control information about homosexual sex, and effective HIV prevention must speak frankly about sexual activity. Section 292 criminalizes the circulation of \u201cobscene\u201d materials; Section 293 extends and harshens this criminalization around access to these materials of young persons \u201cunder the age of twenty years\u201d\u2026 While these laws are rarely used for prosecution, their existence provides government officials the authority to question the dissemination of MSM-targeted safer-sex information, the public distribution of condoms in businesses or elsewhere, and the operation of gay-targeted businesses. One case in point is the difficulty of distributing condoms at gay venues. Business owners fear harassment or adverse repercussions for \u201cpublicly announcing\u201d they have a gay clientele by housing MSM-targeted materials. Additional resources: 1.

Penal Code, Laws of Malaysia (Government of Malaysia 2006) Malaysia National Strategic Plan, 2011-2015 (Ministry of Health, 2011) The Government of Malaysia is concerned by the continued spread of HIV in the country, particularly amongst most at risk populations (MARPs) identified mainly as injecting drug users (IDUs), sex workers (SW), transgender persons (TG) and men who have sex with men (MSM). Key challenges identified: \u2022 Mobilising MARPs, vulnerable populations and related civil society organisations to access and utilise the many available public HIV related healthcare facilities and service points remains an ongoing challenge. \u2022 Stigma and discrimination continues to be an issue, however it has lessen now. Nevertheless, it not only affects PLHIV but to those around them, and also affect the progress and successful implementation of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes. Vulnerable populations and MARPs may encounter incidences of discriminatory practices in public and private workspaces as well as during the implementation of HIV programmes, which inevitably might complicate the outcomes of impact of such programmes. Key strategies: \u2022 HIV prevention efforts in 2011 \u2013 2015 will focus on addressing the three primary prongs of HIV transmission in Malaysia, namely the sharing of needles and syringes through injecting drug use, unprotected sexual intercourse, amongst most at risk and vulnerable populations and advocacy amongst the most-at-risk youth populations Strategy 1.2: Prevention of HIV transmission through unprotected sex: Key Activities: a. Review existing strategies including awareness programmes and activities to encourage and facilitate behavioural change among MARPs. b. Build an enabling environment for behavioural change through economic, welfare and religious aid. c. Raise awareness and build knowledge and awareness on HIV and other diseases (e.g. TB and STIs), among MARPs, married and unmarried couples, and members of most at risk youth and their sexual partners. d.

However, it also serves transgender people, male and female sex workers, and people who use drugs. At time of writing, their activities included: outreach at gay nightclubs, saunas, and massage parlours; and counselling, HIV testing, and health referrals. \u2022 A coalition of Malaysian nongovernmental organizations has spawned from an annual festival called Seksualiti Merdeka that celebrates sexual diversity.

Police have used the presence of condoms, used or unused, as evidence to prove that male sex work is encouraged in establishments such as gay clubs, bath houses, movie houses and bars. Condoms as evidence of sex work are used to instigate police raids and threaten MSM and transgender people with criminal charges. The enforcement of these laws creates a climate of stigma. Commercial establishments, such as sex-on-premises venues, find it difficult to take part in safer sex initiatives if it involves the distribution or sale of condoms. Despite the lack of legal basis, the police reportedly continue to use possession of condoms as an excuse for harassment. The Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003 (Republic Act No. 9208) expanded the definition of prostitution to cover transactional sex between males. Prior to the enactment of the anti- trafficking law, prostitution was a crime committed by females only. Raids in gay venues have used the anti-trafficking law as a basis because its gravity makes it easier for the police to extort money for arrested individuals and owners of establishments accused of facilitating sex work. The decision of the Supreme Court in the Ang Ladlad Case (2010) clarified that the provisions of the Constitution relating to equality before the law and non-discrimination extend to LGBT populations. This may have far-reaching (but as yet untested) implications in terms of challenging discriminatory practices (particularly in government services and the public sector) and application of laws. The Ang Ladlad Case established that the Constitutional principle of non-discrimination requires laws of general application relating to elections to be applied equally to all persons, regardless of sexual orientation. Other laws that are applied unequally to homosexual or transgender people can be challenged under the Constitution, although the result of a challenge would depend on the circumstances of the case. Legislation enacted in 2007 provides legal protection for public social workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation.183 Legislation enacted in 1998 prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender or sexual orientation in the Philippines National Police. There are no specific laws against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity in areas such as health care, education and private sector employment. Schools have discretion to exclude homosexual or transgender students, ban the promotion of condoms and exclude HIV prevention or sexual and reproductive health issues from the curriculum. 83 3. NATIONAL - PHILIPPINES There have been numerous attempts to introduce national anti-discrimination laws for sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2008, House Bill 956 Anti-Discrimination Bill sought to make unlawful a wide-range of practices and policies that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. The Anti-Discrimination Bill proposed to prohibit discrimination in the workplace, educational institutions, health centres, commercial establishment, police force and the military. Other Laws: Right to equal protection under the law: Registration of political parties Ang Ladlad, a national advocacy group for the rights of LGBT people, applied to the Commission on Elections be included in the list of groups that are eligible to be chosen as a sectoral party under the system of representation. The Commission on Elections rejected the application because the group \u201ctolerates immorality which offends religious beliefs\u201d. The Commission\u2019s decision equated homosexuality with immorality as defined by religion, and claimed that Ang Ladlad presented a threat to youth. The Commission invoked Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code, which deals with the glorification of criminals, violence in shows, obscene publications, lustful or pornographic exhibitions, claiming that Ang Ladlad espouses doctrines contrary to public morals. Ang Ladlad filed a petition asking the Supreme Court to review the decision of the Commission on Elections. In 2010, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, directed the Commission on Elections to grant Ang Ladlad\u2019s application for party-list accreditation. The Court held that the Constitutional principle of non-discrimination requires that laws of general application relating to elections be applied equally to all persons, regardless of sexual orientation. The Court stated: From the standpoint of the political process, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender have the same interest in participating in the party-list system on the same basis as other political parties similarly situated...Hence, laws of general application should apply with equal force to LGBTs, and they deserve to participate in the party-list system on the same basis as other marginalized and under-represented sectors.

HIV and men who have sex with men: Country Snapshots- Philippines, 2012 (UNDP/UNAIDS, 2012) According to this report: The central advisory, planning, and policy-making body of the government is known as the Philippine National AIDS Council (PNAC). It was established in 1992 to act as a multi-sectoral advisory body to the President on policy related to HIV. However, it remained crippled by a small budget until the Philippines Government enacted the Philippine AIDS Prevention and Control Act of 1998. Among the things it called for were a comprehensive nationwide HIV and AIDS educational and information campaign; greater recognition of the human rights of persons NATIONAL RESPONSE RESOURCE GUIDE 84 affected by HIV; and heightened involvement of local governments to provide community-based HIV services. The National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for MSM and TG Populations 2012-2016, which is anchored on the 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan for 2011 to 2016, represents the most ambitious effort yet to combat HIV in the Philippines. It calls for policies and programmes informed by serologic surveillance data, a broader range of actors, and the integration of stigma reduction measures across the spectrum of HIV and AIDS services. There is indeed a precedent for a late- stage resurgence of HIV transmission in countries with historically low and stable HIV prevalence. But there is also little doubt that the epidemic\u2019s future toll will depend in large part on how quickly and comprehensively the Philippines responds to rising HIV risk among men who have sex with men. National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for the MSM and TG Population 2012- 2016 (Philippine National AIDS Council, 2012) The National HIV and AIDS Strategic Plan for the MSM and TG Population 2012-2016 is a blueprint outlining priorities and key activities that aim to assist the Philippines Government to interrupt the transmission of HIV and ensure timely access to HIV treatment, care and support for MSM and TG people in the Philippines. The Plan\u2019s structure and language harmonizes with the goals, objectives and outcomes of the 5th AIDS Medium Term Plan for the Philippines 2011-2016 in support of the HIV prevention, treatment and care priorities outlined by the Government of the Philippines. The Plan aims to halt the spread of HIV among MSM and transgender people in the Philippines. The Country AIDS response will be responsive to and accountable for the effectiveness of MSM and TG peoples\u2019 programmes and services. The Plan sets out a series of priorities, measurable outcome, targets and activities. Strategic priorities: 1. Interrupt the transmission of HIV and STIs in MSM and TG populations. 2. Ensure that MSM and TG people living with HIV get timely access to HIV treatment, care and support. 3. Encourage a supportive environment for effective HIV services to MSM and TG people. 4. Strengthen health and community systems for the governance, management and delivery of effective HIV services to MSM and transgender populations. Outcomes: 1. MSM and TG people at risk for, vulnerable to and living with HIV avoid risk behaviors and prevent HIV infection. 2. MSM and transgender people living with HIV live longer, more productive lives. 3. The Country AIDS response is responsive to and accountable for the effectiveness of MSM and TG programmes and services. 85 3.

The Lesbian and Gay Legislative Advocacy Network-Philippines is a broad, non-profit, non- partisan network of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered (LGBT) organizations and individuals working towards achieving a society free from all forms of discrimination, particularly those based on gender and sexual orientation. LAGABLAB is composed of several LGBT organizations (The Library Foundation (TLF Share), Indigo Philippines, Lesbian Advocates of the Philippines, Metropolitan Community Church-Manila, Order of St. Aelred, UP Babaylan and Womyn Supporting Womyn Center) and individuals. LAGABLAB works closely with several international organizations. It launched the Stop Discrimination Now! campaign with Amnesty International Pilipinas and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission. It also links up with other LGBT groups in the region through the Asia-Pacific Rainbow (APR). The main purpose of LAGABLAB is to advance and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Filipino LGBTs, especially in the areas of policy and legislation. It does legislative advocacy to push for laws that will promote LGBT rights and welfare. It organizes campaigns to influence public discourse on sexuality and raise awareness on the situation of lesbians and gays. It does research and documentation, too, to gather cases of abuses and human rights violations committed against Filipino LGBTs. It is also starting to lobby for local ordinances against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

As in many countries worldwide, men who have sex with men (MSM) and sex workers (SW) experience stigma and discrimination in Timor Leste. FTH leads and takes part in a number of initiatives aimed at reducing stigma and discrimination against the communities we work with. NATIONAL ADVOCACY Policy level FTH works actively with the National AIDS Commission (NAC) to promote the rights of MSM, SW and other marginalised communities and to build an enabling environment for FTH\u2019s behaviour change programs. Promote MSM and SW\u2019s right to: \u2022 work and education \u2022 full and accurate information on sexual and reproductive health \u2022 be treated with dignity and respect when accessing health services \u2022 to live their chosen lifestyle. FTH has advocated on behalf of MSM and SW to ensure their representation at policy level. They also work with NAC to help promote the rights of MSM and SW in public discourse. FTH work with the Ministry of Health (MoH) to ensure health services operate with sensitivity, understanding and respect towards the communities we work with. FTH staff and volunteers have contributed to doctor and medical staff training on issues of Voluntary Confidential Counselling and Testing (VCCT) and STI testing. Community level At the community level they have found widespread misunderstanding of HIV prevention and prejudice towards the communities we work with. This can result in stigma, discrimination and violence towards these communities and FTH staff working with them. To mitigate these issues FTH conducts advocacy with community leaders and local populations. At the national level FTH facilitates regular multi-stakeholder advocacy workshops to reduce stigma and discrimination against marginalised communities including MSM, SW and people living with HIV (PLHIV). Representatives from uniformed services, the Church, faith-based organisations, local and international NGOs and local community elders are invited to workshops to which provide sensitisation on HIV prevention issues and improved understanding of marginalised groups. 3.

The Guidance Document is a direct follow up to the Global Commission on HIV and the Law\u2019s recommendations which call on countries to identify and remove legal and policy barriers to their national HIV responses. The Guidance Document also contributes to the implementation of the regional framework for action (ESCAP Roadmap to 2015) and the regional commitments made under ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9, which call upon members and associated members to to organize national multisectoral consultations on policy and legal barriers to universal access in and to review national laws, policies and practices with a view to eliminate all forms of discrimination against people living with HIV or at risk of infection, in particular key populations. National reviews and/or consultations have been completed in at least 18 countries in the ESCAP region, and a number of other countries in the region are expected to undertake national reviews/consultations in 2014. In March 2014, an Expert Group Meeting on the Implementation of National Reviews and Consultations on Legal and Policy barriers to Universal Access to HIV Services was held in Pattaya, Thailand, to share experiences and lessons learned from national reviews and consultations on legal and policy barriers to universal access to HIV services which have been held and to discuss the different models for implementing the recommendations arising from this process. The meeting also provided an opportunity to learn for countries planning to organize national consultations and participatory reviews in 2014. The Asia Pacific Guidance Document was developed under the Ad-Hoc UN Regional Interagency Team on AIDS on Enabling Legal Environments (Ad-Hoc RITA) by Edmund Settle, HIV, Human Rights and Governance Policy Advisor, UNDP Asia Pacific Regional Centre (APRC); Brianna Harrison, Human Rights and Law Advisor, UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific; Emilie Pradichit, Human Rights and Advocacy Officer, UNDP APRC; Kaori Nakatani, HIV, Human Rights and Governance Technical Officer, UNDP APRC; Srinivas Tata, Chief, Social Policy and Population Section, ESCAP; and Maren Jim\u00e9nez, Social Affairs Officer, ESCAP. The UN Ad-Hoc RITA on Enabling Legal Environments is Co- chaired by Nanda Krairiksh, Director, Social Development Division, ESCAP and Nadia Rasheed, Regional Practice Leader, HIV, Health and Development, UNDP APRC.

National reviews and consultations conducted in a participatory and transparent manner will increase awareness and understanding of a range of stakeholders on HIV, law and human rights issues, build consensus on necessary actions to strengthen the legal environment, and foster strategic alliances between different sectors of governments including parliamentarians, justice, law enforcement and health, affected communities and others. Considerable work has been done in recent years in Asia and the Pacific through both regional and country-level initiatives towards the creation of enabling legal and social environments for effective HIV responses. Governments made commitments in 20111 and 20122 to conduct national reviews and consultations in order to accelerate progress towards targets including the elimination of HIV-related stigma and discrimination, gender inequality and gender- based violence and ensuring affected to HIV services for those who need them. The implementation of these commitments at the national level should (i) build on prior efforts to create an enabling legal and social environment for the HIV response and (ii) allow for prioritisation of efforts so as to focus attention on those aspects of the legal environments that are key barriers to effective HIV responses.

As recognised by Helen Clark, UNDP Administrator at the 2011 Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law: \u201cHIV epidemic patterns vary between and within countries in the Asia Pacific region. There has been mixed progress in halting and reversing its spread. In some countries in the region, the rate of new infections fell by more than 25 percent between 2001-2009. In other countries however, new infections increased by more than 25 percent in that same timeframe. What does remain a painful constant across the region is that HIV thrives among those who are excluded, who are misunderstood, who are stigmatised. An estimated 16 percent of people who inject drugs in Asia are living with HIV, and that figure is markedly higher in some countries. There is higher prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender people, and sex workers.\u201d Stigma and discrimination, violations of human rights, gender inequality and poor access to HIV services are major socio-structural contributors to epidemics in the region. There is also a significant relationship between enabling legal environments and reduction of HIV. Laws that criminalize and violate human rights of key populations at risk are not only threats to human dignity, but also hurdles to appropriate public health responses. Significant progress has been made in the region in responding to HIV. Four countries that account for a large number of people living with HIV in the region \u2013 India, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Thailand \u2013 reduced new HIV infections by more than 50%5 between 2001 and 2011. In China, the number of people receiving ART has increased 3 UNAIDS. 2012 UNAIDS Report on the Global AIDS Epidemic. 2012. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid. 9 more than five-fold from 2005 to 20106. There has also been progress in addressing stigma and discrimination, including lifting of travel restrictions in several countries in the region including China, Fiji and Mongolia.7 Some countries have moved away from punitive approaches to drug use and sex work, and many countries have enacted laws and regulations providing improved legal protections for people living with HIV (PLHIV), MSM and transgender people. However, more change is needed to achieve the targets of Zero New Infections; Zero Discrimination and Zero AIDS- related Deaths in Asia and the Pacific. Rising epidemics are reported among MSM in major cities across Asia, especially in 6 countries: China, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. HIV is still increasing among people who inject drugs. High HIV prevalence among female sex workers is found in geographical hotspots in several countries8. Prevention and treatment coverage for those most in need are still unacceptably low. In Asia and the Pacific, key legal and policy challenges in relation to HIV include: \uf0b7 Restrictions on the entry, stay and residence of people living with HIV based on their HIV status; \uf0b7 HIV-related stigma and discrimination in employment, healthcare and education settings; \uf0b7 Criminalization of possession and/or use of drugs; \uf0b7 Compulsory detention centres for people who use drugs and sex workers, and imposition of the death penalty for drug-related offences; \uf0b7 Criminalization of sex work; \uf0b7 Criminalization of same-sex sexual conduct between consenting adults; \uf0b7 Lack of legal recognition of transgender people; \uf0b7 Restrictions on access to confidential HIV testing and other services on a range of grounds including age, marital status, nationality/migration status and for those in closed settings; \uf0b7 Public security and police harassment, violence and selective enforcement of obscenity, vagrancy and other public order offences targeting sex workers, people who inject drugs, MSM and transgender people; \uf0b7 International agreements and intellectual property laws that hinder access to affordable antiretroviral drugs (ARVs). 6 HIV and AIDS Data Hub for Asia and the Pacific.

Five of the fourteen Commissioners are from Asia and the Pacific, and should be considered experts and advocates that can support national consultations on legal and policy barriers to HIV services.

Dame Carol Kidu, Papua New Guinea \uf0b7 The Hon. Michael Kirby, Australia \uf0b7 Mr Jon Ungphakorn, Thailand The Commission\u2019s findings and recommendations reveal that evidence-based laws and practices firmly grounded in human rights do exist and are powerful instruments for challenging discrimination, promoting public health, and protecting human rights. The benefits are felt beyond HIV responses to encompass health and development outcomes more broadly. The Commission made specific recommendations to strengthen legal environments for HIV and AIDS (see Box 4 below). Some of the key messages from the Commission were: \uf0b7 Punitive laws are fueling the spread of HIV, resulting in human rights violations and costing lives; \uf0b7 Punitive laws are wasting resources and limiting the effectiveness and efficiency of HIV and health investments; \uf0b7 Good laws and practices that protect human rights and build on public health evidence already exist \u2013 they strengthen the global AIDS response and they must be replicated or brought to scale urgently; and \uf0b7 Structural drivers such as law have a vital role to play in ending HIV epidemic. The Commission\u2019s final report15 \u201cHIV and the Law: Risks, Rights & Health\u201d forms the basis of the next generation of HIV responses, where governments approach HIV through multiple lenses of health, equity, and justice. The Commission recommended that its final report be used as a blueprint for national processes to examine HIV-specific laws, and to undertake a legal environment assessment for HIV16 addressing laws, policies and practices that impede effective HIV responses. The Commission finally recommended countries to implement a set of combined interventions to remove barriers to health services and create enabling environments for effective HIV responses: interventions addressing bad practices and social attitudes (health providers and police officers\u2019 trainings, media and religious leaders\u2019 sensitizations); interventions building the capacity of communities to advocate for their rights (legal literacy and legal aid services, community mobilization for policy advocacy); and interventions improving the legal and policy environment (parliamentarian and judicial sensitizations, legal reviews, legislative reforms).17 15 Global Commission on HIV and the Law, UNDP.

Reporting back to ESCAP at the regional intergovernmental review meeting ESCAP Roadmap to 2015 In February 2012, the Asia-Pacific High-Level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Development Goals was convened and concluded with the endorsement of a Regional Framework for Action, the \u201cESCAP Roadmap to 2015\u201d18, to support the implementation of international and region-specific commitments, calling for greater regional cooperation to accelerate progress towards meeting the global commitments and increased collaboration among government ministries, including health, justice, law enforcement, drug control and social protection, in partnership with civil society and key affected populations (including men who have sex with men, transgender populations, people who inject drugs, and sex workers and their clients). The framework also emphasized the need to share good practices and lessons learned in implementing the measures and commitments related to HIV. As a result, an inclusive regional intergovernmental review meeting on national efforts and progress in addressing the HIV epidemic will be convened in January 2015. This is an opportunity for governments to share their progress, successes and challenges in implementing these commitments.

Sex Work and the Law in Asia and the Pacific20 reviews the legal environments impacting on HIV responses in the context of sex work in every country in the region, assessing the impact of laws, legal policies and law enforcement practices on HIV responses in the context of sex work and provides recommendations for actions required to create enabling legal and policy environments for HIV responses. Other UN agencies have also conducted studies or reviews that will support national reviews and consultations. For example, UNESCO has worked with the UNAIDS family and other partners to review legal environments for young people21 and UNICEF is developing a resource on legal environments impacting on access to HIV services by young MSM (see Annex 10 for key resources). Example of synergies between regional and country-level actions to address legal and policy barriers to HIV services Two multi-country Global Fund programmes22 provide opportunities to support activities in the ESCAP Roadmap to 2015.

UNDP APRC also serves as the Technical Assistance provider on Human Rights and Advocacy under the ISEAN-HIVOS Round 10 Programme. Through this two Multi-Country Global Fund programmes, UNDP supports countries to identify legal and social barriers to their national HIV responses by coordinating inclusive and meaningful national and regional multisectoral consultations and dialogues with key stakeholders (from government experts, law and policy makers, members of judiciary, to civil society and community members). These consultations or dialogues, focused on the HIV-related legal environment, not only identify barriers to accessing HIV services but also provide a safe space to discuss solutions to remove barriers: by helping create partnerships with governments, National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), law enforcement and communities for protection and promotion of human rights of key populations, by reviewing existing laws and regulations, and by developing national advocacy strategies. For instance, the regional National Human Rights Institutions project on the inclusion of sexual orientation and gender identity issues led by UNDP and International Development Law Organization (IDLO) was a direct follow up to the South Asia Roundtable Dialogue on Legal and Policy Barriers to the HIV Response23 and was designed to assess the capacity of NHRIs, to strengthen their capacity and to address human rights and socio-legal environments relating to HIV and SOGI in the region. The project documented regional and national progressive initiatives and good practices of national human rights institutions (NHRIs) and other human rights advocacy bodies in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Timor-Leste to protect and promote the rights of highly marginalized individuals.24 The two Multi-Country Global Fund grants further generated strategic information to strengthen the evidence based on HIV and human rights by developing regional and national Legal Reference Resources which document key protective laws focused on HIV, men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people in five countries in South 19 UNDP.

The Guidance Document focuses primarily on the possible processes and structures to be put in place in order to conduct reviews and consultations to create enabling environments for HIV responses. These processes and structures can be used to support a range of reviews and consultations in various contexts, whether they are broad, comprehensive reviews and consultations of a country\u2019s legal environment or reviews or consultations focused on a particular issue or law. The Guidance Document also contains examples, case studies and detailed annexures that provide more detail on specific areas such as the composition of a national Steering Committee to oversee the reviews and consultations or the different branches of law, regulation and policy that may be relevant in the country context of HIV and AIDS. It is recommended that partners use the Guidance Document as a reference guide when developing their own review and consultation. The suggestions regarding possible processes and structures may guide decision-making regarding a country\u2019s review and consultation \u2013 the process they will follow, who will be involved and how it will take place \u2013 based on its particular needs, resources and time constraints. Furthermore, while country-specific issues and concerns will inform the purpose, scope and nature of each country\u2019s individual review and consultation, the illustrative examples contained within the case studies and annexures in the Guidance Document may help to guide a country\u2019s planning of their review and consultation. The processes and structures suggested by this Guidance Document should be discussed with partners and tailored to the relevant local context. The Guidance Document is divided into four main sections dealing with a recommended three-stage process to support a national review and consultation. 25 UNDP, IDLO, SAARCLAW.

The national review may be conducted in various ways and may include: \uf0b7 A consolidation of previous reviews and recommendations, with further research to fill any gaps. \uf0b7 A desk review of relevant international and regional commitments, national laws, regulations and policies as well as research reports, submissions and case studies relevant to the HIV, law and human rights. \uf0b7 Interviews, surveys, questionnaires, site visits and/or focus group discussions with key stakeholders from executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, civil society, key population groups, traditional authorities, religious organisations, the private sector and international organisations, amongst others. National Consultation Stage The primary purpose of the national consultation is to provide the opportunity for a broad range of stakeholders to discuss and (where appropriate, validate or refine) recommendations for law reform or other programme initiatives intended to increase access to rights-based HIV services particularly for people living with HIV and key populations at higher risk. It is also expected that a key output of the consultation will be a measurable and monitorable action plan for undertaking key legal and policy reforms and improving access to justice at country level to bring national legislation and policies in line with international good practice relating to human rights and rights-based HIV responses. National consultations should include: \uf0b7 An opportunity for stakeholders from government and civil society to discuss and develop consensus on the findings and recommendations of national reviews of legal and policy barriers to access to HIV services. \uf0b7 Dialogue to develop a measurable and monitorable action plan for undertaking key legal and policy reforms at country level to bring national legislation and policies in line with international good practice relating to human rights and rights-based HIV responses. \uf0b7 Consensus around a mechanism (existing or new) to support and monitor the implementation of the action plans. Limitations of the Guidance Document and National Review and Consultation Processes Undertaking a national review and consultation is a complex task. It is therefore very difficult to identify all the complexities encountered during the process, and ways to address each, within a single Guidance document or a single process. This section therefore briefly sets out some of the limitations of the Guidance document and some of the complexities that countries may encounter when undertaking a national review and consultation. The following are some of the main limitations of the Guidance Document and the national review and consultation process. \uf0b7 Identifying key legal and human rights issues at a national level: The Guidance Document focuses on the issues identified by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law\u2019s investigation into HIV, law and human rights at the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue on HIV and the Law in February 2011. Therefore, it includes a specific focus on reviewing the legal environment with respect to criminal laws for people living with HIV and vulnerable to HIV; violence and discrimination against women living with HIV; the laws to access to HIV treatment and HIV and children30. It guides the reader to possible sources of law, regulation and policy that may deal with these key issues, possible queries and issues to examine in terms of these areas of law and stigma, discrimination and human rights issues impacting on specific key populations at higher risk amongst other things. However, the Guidance Document cannot account for all the possible issues and concerns raised at a country/national level, nor can it account for every possible type of law, regulation, policy or guideline, or the implementation and enforcement practices, found in each country. Issues may differ within each national legal environment. Country teams should use the Guidance Document as a starting point to conducting the national reviews and consultations, but will also need to ensure focus on the specific concerns identified during the consultative planning and review stage and the particular legal environment within each country. \uf0b7 Determining relevant norms and standards: The Guidance Document suggests a process to follow, key issues to consider as well as possible sources of law, regulation and policy in conducting a national review of the HIV-related legal environment (laws, law enforcement and access to justice). In some countries, there may be limited examples of current or comprehensive medical and health laws, and the various laws, regulations and policies that have an impact on HIV, AIDS and key populations at higher risk will be found in a range of sources of law, from health law to criminal law. In other cases, the lack of health and HIV-specific laws may require applying general laws such as constitutional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "425330ec-dad9-4e4a-8265-356177223c11": {"__data__": {"id_": "425330ec-dad9-4e4a-8265-356177223c11", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efe50518c9779113b875a9fc0b14b97cf989786371973556ac5cdf1b2f3dfb64"}}, "hash": "efe50518c9779113b875a9fc0b14b97cf989786371973556ac5cdf1b2f3dfb64", "text": "laws to health issues. Some countries have dual legal systems, with conflicts between civil laws and other (e.g. customary and/or religious) laws and practices creating further complexity. \uf0b7 Looking beyond the law: Some of the issues identified as priority concerns for HIV, law and human rights (e.g. the need for appropriate sensitisation of lawmakers, law enforcement personnel and service providers) are not issues generally set out in law. In many cases, protective laws and policies are ineffective due to weak access to justice and punitive law enforcement practices. Accordingly, the review of the legal environment should look beyond the law and to include a review of access to justice and law enforcement issues to gain a comprehensive understanding of the strengths and gaps within the current legal environment. \uf0b7 Dealing with gaps and weaknesses in the legal environment: The review findings will highlight strengths, and also potential gaps and weaknesses in a country\u2019s legal environment. The national review and consultation cannot create a protective legal environment; however these processes can guide and catalyse advocacy and action for reform. Where the national review and consultation identifies gaps, challenges, human rights 30 UNDP. Report of the Asia Pacific Regional Dialogue of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. 2011. 21 abuses and barriers to effective HIV responses within a country\u2019s legal environment, country teams and stakeholders will need to support the outcomes of the process, particularly the follow up on action plans developed at the consultation. Some issues are not easily remedied through law review and reform and may require long-term policy and programmatic strategies to address cultural practices, attitudes and stigma and discrimination involving specific populations (e.g. in the case of gender inequality or stigmatisation of key populations such as sex workers and MSM). This may require additional technical assistance, resource mobilisation and other support from country teams including the UN. \uf0b7 Dealing with urgency and resource constraints: The Guidance Document suggests a comprehensive four-stage process for conducting a national review and consultation. In some countries, there may be limited time and budgets to conduct a national review and consultation; and countries may need to consider short-cuts to the process. An extensive and participatory national review and consultation could take over 6 months whereas an abbreviated process may well be finalised within 3 months. While it is possible to conduct reviews and consultations without undertaking all of the proposed steps, it is important to ensure that the process allows for consultation and participation of all key stakeholders, including key populations at higher risk, at the conceptualisation and throughout, including in any mechanisms developed to support follow up. Section 1: Planning Stage Overview of National Review and Consultation National reviews and consultations are an opportunity to: \uf0b7 Raise awareness of and generate national dialogue on the priority HIV, law and human rights issues and of key populations at higher risk within the country; \uf0b7 Identify and examine key HIV, law and human rights issues affecting people \u2013 including key populations at higher risk \u2013 and in particular HIV and human rights issues affecting MSM, people who use drugs, sex workers, women, children and young people, prisoners and migrants; and/or access to treatment; \uf0b7 Determine the extent to which the current legal environment protects rights or acts as a barrier to access to HIV related services, in compliance with international, regional and national human rights commitments; \uf0b7 Identify the extent to which these protections are known (e.g. by communities, service providers, law enforcers), implemented and enforced and for which people are able to access justice; \uf0b7 Make recommendations for steps to strengthen the legal environment including through law review and reform, programmes to increase awareness of rights and access to legal services and improve law enforcement; \uf0b7 Develop national consensus on priority actions for strengthening legal environments for effective responses to HIV; \uf0b7 Identify or establish a participatory mechanism to oversee and monitor the implementation of agreed actions. Purpose of Planning Stage The Planning Stage should ensure that the national legal review and consultation is a transparent and participatory exercise, involving a range of stakeholders key to the HIV response within the country and focusing on priority HIV, law and human rights issues of national concern to all. Thorough planning and preparation helps to increase awareness and understanding of the review and consultation process, to foster buy-in and support from leadership and key stakeholders and to ensure that the review and consultation relevant to the needs of the country. 23 Box 5: Commitment and leadership from all partners Government commitment to and leadership of the national review and consultation process", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a53a90ec-50cc-4a14-b2e9-a0482e4ce1dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a53a90ec-50cc-4a14-b2e9-a0482e4ce1dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac3be6350fe87c672702e4e08a063aaf3d5af619f8fb7bf09b7e75c49d55edfa"}}, "hash": "ac3be6350fe87c672702e4e08a063aaf3d5af619f8fb7bf09b7e75c49d55edfa", "text": "is crucial to the success of the review and consultation as well as to ensure that uptake of recommendations coming out of the process. Lessons from reviews and consultations in the region reinforce the importance of government commitment to the review and consultation process, ensuring the participation of key ministries and institutions and facilitating the integration and uptake of recommendations into the strategies and action plans of government ministries. Similarly, the involvement of other forms of leadership at all levels of society, including traditional and religious leaders is also vital to the review and consultation to the final outcome of the process. The participation of key affected populations as individuals and through civil society organisations representing their interests is equally crucial to the success of the project. This helps to ensure that the review and consultation focusses on priority human rights issues experienced by key affected populations in their daily lives, includes the voices and perspectives of key populations and that recommendations from reviews and consultations are relevant and are supported by key populations. Any potential challenges to commitment and participation of the relevant stakeholders should be identified, discussed and addressed at the outset. Challenges may include lack of government commitment to leadership of the review and consultation process; \u2018territorial\u2019 disputes between government institutions as well as between government and other stakeholders regarding the leadership of a review and consultation; potential conflicts between the traditional and/or religious norms and beliefs of leaders and communities and the human rights principles which underpin the process; the \u2018invisibility\u2019 of key populations within a country (particularly in countries where criminalised populations such as sex workers and MSM are unable to live and organise freely without fear of harassment) and the lack of capacity within government and civil society to participate effectively within the process. The UN and other development partners may help to identify and overcome challenges to stakeholder\u2019s participation in the review and consultation process through various means. For instance, they may elicit the support of senior leaders at high level meetings, support and facilitate processes to bring stakeholders together to plan and implement a review and consultation; sensitise stakeholders to the role of law in national responses to HIV and to HIV, law and human rights issues of national concern, provide technical and other forms of support to the process, and mobilise resources and donors. In this way, the participation and inclusion of all partners promotes an effective and useful review and consultation process. The planning stage of a review and consultation may involve various steps including some or all of the following: \uf0b7 Holding a consultative planning meeting or series of dialogues to discuss national HIV, law and human rights issues and to agree upon the purpose, nature and scope of the review and consultation and priority issues of national concern; \uf0b7 Establishing a representative Steering Committee (SC) to lead the process; \uf0b7 Briefing the Steering Committee on the relevant background information around HIV, law and human rights; \uf0b7 Agreeing upon a terms of reference for the SC; and \uf0b7 Planning for the national review and consultation. Holding a consultative planning meeting A consultative planning meeting or dialogue may be a useful way to \u2018kick off\u2019 a national review and consultation and to encourage the participation and inclusion of all partners. It may help to: \uf0b7 Raise awareness and understanding of HIV, law and human rights issues in the country and the importance of a review and consultation in strengthening effective responses to HIV (including dissemination of the findings and recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law), \uf0b7 Ensure a transparent, participatory and rights-based approach to conducting the review and consultation, 31 UNESCAP.

A consultative planning workshop or dialogue may be an important aspect of the planning stage where leaders are otherwise unwilling to engage on particular issues or where key populations do not otherwise have opportunities to be heard or are unable to participate due to lack of organisation, fear of harassment or because their criminalised status leads to a real fear of arrest or prosecution. A National Dialogue encourages the participation of key populations and allows government and civil society to come together in a safe space to enter into a moderated dialogue with each other on HIV, law and human rights issues. In this way it encourages awareness-raising and sensitisation of stakeholders as well as facilitating the identification of key issues for a review and consultation. Setting up a Steering Committee It is strongly recommended to identify a Steering Committee to guide, support and oversee the work of the review and consultation. The role, composition and functioning of the Steering Committee can be discussed and deliberated during the consultative planning stage and the terms of reference agreed upon by the group itself at their first meeting. Ideally, a Steering Committee is convened by governments, with members from a range of sectors including key affected communities and UN. Where a multisectoral and participatory coordination body on issues relating to HIV and human rights already exists, partners may consider vesting this body with the responsibility of planning the review and consultation. If necessary, additional members could be added or brought into the process so as to ensure the participation of relevant stakeholders. The roles and responsibilities of a Steering Committee are not fixed and will differ from country to country depending on the needs and capacity of stakeholders. A number of suggested roles are set out below for consideration in developing locally relevant terms of reference for a country group (see Box 8 and Annex 1 for terms of reference of the Steering Committee). A well-functioning Steering Committee will provide a robust mechanism for making important decisions such as the scope of the review, the process for identifying participants at the consultation and any decisions around prioritisation/focus issues. A well-constituted Steering Committee can also serve as the foundations for any agreed mechanism to oversee and monitor the implementation of the recommendations or action plans developed at the consultation. Box 7: Roles and responsibilities of Steering Committee The Steering Committee (SC) has a number of possible roles that it may fulfil in guiding and supporting the national review and consultation: \uf0b7 Oversight Role: The Steering Committee guides and monitors the review and consultation process in order to ensure it is conducted according to agreed-upon processes and in a way that ensures consultation, inclusivity and a commitment to a rights-based response. \uf0b7 Advisory Role: As a multisectoral and representative body the Steering Committee itself can provide various perspectives and technical input on key HIV, law and human rights issues and on the various stages in the legal review and consultation process. \uf0b7 Implementation Role: In some situations, particularly where resources are limited, the Steering Committee members may take on an implementation role where they may be required to implement some aspects of the review and consultation process themselves. The various responsibilities of the Steering Committee may include the following: \uf0b7 To guide the national review and consultation in accordance with national priorities and recommended guidance, as a multi-disciplinary reference group; \uf0b7 To facilitate fund raising/resource mobilisation for conducting", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "303cc289-546d-4d83-b963-730565d6b9fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "303cc289-546d-4d83-b963-730565d6b9fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f1fc0a52b115bcabc23e7e9b228b0c047779ec785113173918fb8b02dc7fca3"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3e832af-bb10-4814-9af1-36d0a81df2a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4b214413919a254ed815d93915c63e9db91a14be99d8e509b6490c20972120d"}}, "hash": "7fa518a0a54de40778796670a7a9825f2a2a8ee5540bd7c7a2f45263606499f5", "text": "the national review and consultation; \uf0b7 To provide on-going technical support to the planning, implementation and finalisation of the national review and consultation; \uf0b7 To oversee and monitor the national review and consultation throughout each stage of the process; \uf0b7 To raise awareness of the HIV, law and human rights issues of priority national concern; \uf0b7 To strengthen and to ensure political commitment to the national legal review and consultation and its outcome; \uf0b7 To review and endorse the review and consultation recommendations and to support action planning for strengthening the legal and regulatory environment for HIV and AIDS; \uf0b7 To report back on the outcomes of the process to key stakeholders, and \uf0b7 To develop a process or forum for on-going monitoring of the outcome of the consultation (i.e. the action plan for creating an enabling legal environment), with the involvement of key stakeholders. The Steering Committee should be composed of up to 15 representatives from a range of sectors, institutions and organisations key to the HIV response and influence over the legal environment - see Box 9 for suggestions. It should also include members with the skills and expertise to support and oversee the legal review and consultation as well as those with direct experience and understanding of stakeholder perspective and key human rights issues. The Steering Committee should include key government ministries with technical expertise in and responsibilities for the uptake of 27 recommendations on health, HIV, law and human rights developed through the review and consultation. All Steering Committees should include community representatives, including PLHIV and some or all key populations. These representatives should be nominated in a democratic way so as to ensure that they represent and are accountable to communities. The roles and responsibilities of the various members to the SC, including which institutions will provide leadership and which will provide administrative, financial and other support to the process, should be clearly identified up front. Ideally, the Government should take the primary responsibility for convening a Steering Committee and, where possible, serve as Chair or Co-Chair of the group. UN entities such as UNAIDS, UNDP and other members of the Joint Team on AIDS or UN Country Team can provide additional support as required, for example through secretarial support to the Steering Committee and ensuring the identification and participation of relevant communities.

Members of the Steering Committee include: Ministry of Health (National AIDS Commission), Ministry of Law and Human Rights, National Human Rights Commission, representatives of the communities, UNAIDS and UNDP. In Pakistan, the Steering Committee convened consists of representatives from UNAIDS, UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, IDLO, the National AIDS Control Programme, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, CCM, and key affected populations. The Steering Committee oversees the overall process of the national study of the status of legislative and policy environment with regards to human rights of key affected populations by HIV and AIDS in Pakistan and approve the methodology, workplan and deliverables.

Immediate outputs of the review and consultation process could include: \uf0b7 Prioritized recommendations for removing legal and policy barriers to universal access for national partners to take forward; \uf0b7 A timeframe for action; \uf0b7 A multisectoral working group with responsibility for monitoring progress on the agreed actions and recommendations; \uf0b7 A report for public to support transparency and accountability, and which could be used to support government reporting to regional and global bodies such as ESCAP and Global AIDS Response Progress Reports on progress in implementing ESCAP and High-level Meeting commitments. Box 10: Purpose and scope of a legal review and consultation: broad versus narrow focus? In some countries a legal review and consultation may have a very specific and narrow focus. For instance it may focus on a specific issue (such as reviewing the impact of laws, policies and practices that promote harmful gender norms and gender-based violence, including stigma and discrimination against MSM and transgender people, hindering HIV responses, or eliminating punitive laws, policies and practices impacting on people who used drugs and sex workers) or it may focus on a specific law (e.g. the review of an existing HIV law in a country). In other countries, a legal review and consultation may be a broad-based assessment of a country\u2019s legal environment as a whole, including a review of all relevant laws, regulations and policies that impact on HIV as well as on key populations at higher risk (e.g. health laws, criminal laws, anti-discrimination laws, laws impacting on young people, employment laws etc) as well as a review of the extent to which laws are known, implemented and enforced, and access to justice for PLHIV and key populations.

A high level national consultation resulted in amendment of that law to eliminate mandatory detention of sex workers and improve justice process protections for people accused of drug dependence. National Assembly members, government, judiciary, UN and other development partners and communities are now working to develop alternative policies and processes to create a more enabling legal environment for sex workers and people who use drugs to access health services. c) Malaysia\u2019s review was commissioned by the UN HIV/AIDS Theme Group in Malaysia and overseen by a Technical Steering Committee comprising representatives of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia, the medical profession (Hospital Sungai Buloh), legal profession (Malaysian Bar Council), Centre of Excellence for Research in AIDS, Malaysian AIDS Council, Pertubuhan Advokasi Masyarakat Terpinggir (Malaysia\u2019s community-led sex worker organization), PT Foundation, Kuala Lumpur AIDS Services Society, WHO, UNDP and UNAIDS. The terms of reference for the Technical Steering Committee were to: \uf0b7 Provide oversight and technical guidance on the structure and substantive content of the study and multi- stakeholder consultations; \uf0b7 Review the findings or the study and feedback/ recommendations from the multi-stakeholder consultations; \uf0b7 Provide feedback on identifying appropriate platforms to share, disseminate and support further strengthening of the legal and policy environment for HIV services. The review gathered data using the following methods: \uf0b7 Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives the Ministry of Health, Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department, Human Rights Commission, Kuala Lumpur Legal Aid Centre, Malaysian AIDS Council and PT Foundation. \uf0b7 The proceedings of the national consultation including recommendations that were produced by participants. \uf0b7 A literature review was undertaken on laws, policies and practices that affect key populations and their access to HIV services. Sources of literature were peer-reviewed articles (e.g. social sciences and health 31 sciences) and primary sources such as strategic plans, articles of law (constitutional, civil and Sharia law), and local, regional and international reports on law, health and HIV. The focus of national review and consultation will depend on each country\u2019s context and the key issues at stake. When making decisions about the scope and focus of a review and consultation. it is important to bear the following considerations in mind: \uf0b7 Reviews and consultation should seek to build on previous efforts to identify and address legal and policy barriers to access to HIV services for PLHIV and any key populations. \uf0b7 A narrow and focussed review and consultation allows for an in-depth analysis of a particular issue or law and provides an opportunity for detailed and very specific recommendations in response to its findings. A broad national review and consultation, on the other hand, is able to look at a range of issues covering a country\u2019s entire legal environment. This means that a broad national review and consultation is able to provide comprehensive recommendations for effective HIV responses that work across all sectors for all affected populations; however it is not always able to provide an in-depth analysis of all issues. It can highlight specific issues for further investigation, where required. \uf0b7 Where there are in-country sensitivities around specific issues (e.g. criminal law issues to do with key populations), a broad review and consultations may be preferable to focussing a review and consultation on one controversial issue that may receive limited commitment from stakeholders. Selection of priority issues should be based on an assessment of the political landscape including issues where real change is feasible based on national and international trends and interests, as well as the issues that will have the biggest impact on the HIV response. \uf0b7 Whether reviews and consultations have a narrow or broader focus, they should always look beyond simply reviewing \u2018law on the books\u2019 to include a review of the ways in which laws are implemented and enforced and the extent to which populations know their rights and are able to access justice.

Some may wish to review a specific law (such as an HIV law) within the country, to determine its impact on the response to HIV and AIDS. Other countries may wish to review all relevant laws, regulations and policies within a country, including customary and religious laws and practices, as well as the extent to which laws are implemented and enforced and communities are able to access justice for violations of their rights. This would also mean looking at issues such as the nature and extent of HIV- related stigma and discrimination by institutions, service providers, communities and leaders; the extent to which people know their rights, the existence of organisations and programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination, provide legal literacy and provide legal support services and the extent to which service providers, law-makers and law enforcers are sensitised to the HIV, law and human rights. \uf0b7 National reviews and consultations commonly also review international and regional human rights commitments relevant to a particular country to use as a benchmark for an effective, rights-based response; others also review legal and regulatory responses to HIV in other countries (e.g. countries within the region which experience similar HIV, law and human rights issues) for guidance in making recommendations. \uf0b7 A brief overview of the nature of the national review and consultation, how it shall be carried out and what it shall seek to report on. b) Methodology and implementation modalities The concept note should clarify the various methodologies, activities and deliverables which will form part of the review and consultation process and how these will be carried out, including for instance: \uf0b7 A desk review of international, regional and national human rights obligations and commitments, particularly those relevant in the context of HIV and AIDS; national laws, regulations, policies and codes of conduct that apply to HIV and/or to key populations at higher risk; HIV-related strategies and planning documents as well as research, reports and case studies on aspects of the law relating to HIV, AIDS and key populations and HIV- related laws in foreign jurisdictions, where relevant. \uf0b7 Stakeholder consultations (interviews, consultations, surveys, questionnaires and/or focus group discussions) with key stakeholders from a range of sectors including executive, legislative and judicial branches of government, networks of people living with HIV and key populations at higher risk, civil society organisations working on HIV, law and human rights issues, religious organisations, the private sector and international organisations, amongst others. \uf0b7 National consultative forum/s or dialogue/s for presenting draft findings, obtaining feedback, building consensus, disseminating final findings and recommendations, prioritising recommendations and identifying key actions for moving forward to strengthen the legal environment. \uf0b7 A broad overview of the roles and responsibilities, including reporting mechanisms, of various partners in the process including the lead organisation/s, the researchers and the national reference group set up to oversee the process. c) Detailed roadmap It is useful for the Concept Note to also include a detailed workplan, including : \uf0b7 Specific activities to be carried out in the various stages of the national review and consultation \uf0b7 The deliverables to be achieved during the various stages of the national review and consultation \uf0b7 The timelines attached to the specific activities and stages of the national review and consultation 33 \uf0b7 The specific roles and responsibilities of various partners for each activity \uf0b7 How the reporting and feedback mechanisms are to be incorporated during the process, and \uf0b7 The support and resources required for each stage of the process. d) Appendices Other useful information to be attached to the concept note include: \uf0b7 A list of international and regional human rights instruments, national laws, regulations, policies, strategies and plans and other documents to be reviewed \uf0b7 A list of stakeholders to be consulted or surveyed in interviews, consultations, focus group discussions or questionnaires \uf0b7 Tools to be used in the review process including tools for analysis of the legal environment, questionnaires, surveys, interview guides \uf0b7 Minutes of meetings of the Steering Committee and notes/a report of any consultative planning meeting.

Key steps to conduct national reviews These are several key steps to conduct the national review: a) Identifying key stakeholders (e.g. UN agencies, NGOs, networks of key populations) who can provide insight on the legal environment and provide inputs to the review; b) Identifying and consolidating relevant literature on/reviews of the legal environment in the context of HIV; c) Reviewing national laws, policies and practices which impede universal access to HIV prevention, care, support and treatment; d) Identifying significant efforts and progress made on creating enabling legal environments; and e) Developing (or synthesising) and prioritising recommendations for legal environment (laws/policies, law enforcement, access to justice) in the specific focus areas to be addressed. Identifying stakeholders Consulting with key stakeholders is a useful way to obtain information on the legal and regulatory environment from the different perspectives of those who experience it in the course of their work at different levels and those who experience it as populations accessing services. It helps to gain insight into issues and experiences that may not otherwise be documented, particularly in relation to the impact of laws, regulations and policies on people\u2019s lives, whether they are able to access justice and how laws are implemented and enforced. In addition, it is also a mechanism for raising awareness and promoting dialogue about HIV, law and human rights issues and the purpose of the legal environment assessment as well as for promoting an inclusive and participatory legal review in which the voices of all key stakeholders can be heard. At the planning stage of the national review, it is important to determine: \uf0b7 Which stakeholders will be consulted during the review process, \uf0b7 How stakeholders will be consulted, \uf0b7 Who will undertake stakeholder review, and \uf0b7 What they will be consulted on. 35 Box 12: Identifying key stakeholders The consultative planning stage provides a good opportunity to gain broad input and agreement on the key stakeholders who should be consulted during the review. Key stakeholders should include a broad range of individuals or organisations working in different sectors or at different levels in the country as well as those representing populations at higher risk and vulnerable in the context of HIV and AIDS. It is important to look beyond HIV-specific organisations and institutions to draw in and include a broader range of \u2018mainstream\u2019 organisations such as organisations and institutions working on human rights issues, health issues, women\u2019s issues, employment rights issues, for example. It is also important to recognise that key populations may be diverse and are not a \u201chomogenous group\u201d. For instance, transgender sex workers may have specific issues and concerns that are different to those of migrant sex workers; women living in rural areas may have specific needs and concerns not shared by women with disabilities. Key stakeholders may include: \uf0b7 National leaders and technical experts from the executive branches of key government ministries including HIV and AIDS, Health, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Police/Law Enforcement, Gender/Women, Social Development, Social Welfare, Education, Youth, Child Protection, Trade & Industry, Employment / Labour, Correctional Services, Safety and Security, amongst others \uf0b7 Parliamentarians \uf0b7 Members of the judiciary, legal fraternity and legal aid services \uf0b7 Representatives of statutory bodies such as an Ombudsperson, Public Protector, Human Rights Commission and/or Law Commission \uf0b7 Representatives of professional bodies such as medical councils, nursing councils, councils of psychologists \uf0b7 Service providers such as health care workers, educators, social welfare workers \uf0b7 Networks of people living with HIV \uf0b7 Networks of other key populations at higher risk and vulnerable to HIV such as women\u2019s groups, youth groups, sex worker organisations, organisations of MSM, organisations of people who use drugs etc. \uf0b7 Civil society organisations working on health, HIV, law and human rights issues and with key populations \uf0b7 Faith-based organisations \uf0b7 Traditional authorities and religious leaders \uf0b7 Any other group of specific relevance to the country\u2019s HIV epidemic, e.g. chambers of commerce, workers\u2019 unions, migrant workers\u2019 groups, etc. There are various ways to obtain the views of different stakeholders.

See www.stigmaindex.org for information on the involvement of people living with HIV in the Stigma Index carried out in various countries, with the support of the Global Network of People Living with HIV (GNP+) and other partner organisations. Other community-led efforts to investigate and document rights violations of PLHIV and key populations, such as Positive and Pregnant \u2013 How Dare You (APN+. 2012), are also resources that can supplement and strengthen the reviews and consultations. Methodologies to undertake reviews with stakeholders Various methodologies may be used for undertaking reviews with stakeholders and key populations, including: \uf0b7 Undertaking one-on-one interviews with individual representatives of organizations, \uf0b7 Holding focus group discussions with groups of individuals with common characteristics and with possible shared experiences and concerns, such as: o A group of service providers providing similar services (e.g. health care workers, HIV counsellors, legal aid lawyers), o A group of people who share characteristics such as age, gender, disability, social origin (e.g. women, young people aged 15 to 24), o A group of people who share a similar positions in society (e.g. traditional leaders), or o A group of people who self-identify with a specific population (e.g. a group of MSM). \uf0b7 Conducting site visits to view and speak to people at different sites across the country (e.g. clinics, courts, police stations, prisons, drug rehabilitation centres, etc.) \uf0b7 Distributing questionnaires to selected individuals and organizations from different sectors, or \uf0b7 Posting on-line surveys on the web-sites of different organizations. There may be a need to develop tools for a standardized approach to stakeholder consultations, whether they are one-on-one interviews or focused group discussions. It is important to design stakeholder consultation tools to allow for: \uf0b7 The provision of background information on HIV, law and human rights in the context of HIV and the purpose, scope and nature of the review process, \uf0b7 Questions for discussion and feedback on common issues relevant to all stakeholders, and \uf0b7 Questions and discussion points on key issues relevant to each particular organisation or institution. The feedback from legal reviews should inform the final review report. The information should also be collated and analysed to draw out the key issues identified by the stakeholders. 37 If possible, the following should be described in a consolidated report on the stakeholder consultations: \uf0b7 The level of awareness of HIV, law and human rights issues and their role in effective responses to HIV \uf0b7 The key HIV, law and human rights concerns of various stakeholder groups, including: o Concerns regarding the current laws, regulations and policies o Concerns regarding the ways in which rights are implemented and enforced o Concerns regarding levels of awareness of rights and ability to access justice o The impact of protective or punitive laws on people\u2019s ability to promote or achieve universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support o Recommendations that have been made for strengthening the legal environment. Desk Review The desk review aims to determine the nature, extent, efficacy and impact of the legal environment for protecting rights and promoting universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. This requires also determining key HIV, law and human rights issues of concern within a country, common concern for countries in the region and how these are addressed by laws, regulations and policies. Law and human rights issues of global concern, common to countries across the world include: \uf0b7 HIV-related stigma, discrimination and criminalization \uf0b7 Women, HIV and the Law \uf0b7 Children, Young people, HIV and the Law \uf0b7 Criminal Laws and HIV, and \uf0b7 Access to Treatment.

Similarly, laws prohibiting\u2014or interpreted by police or courts as prohibiting\u2014gender nonconformity, defined vaguely and broadly, are often cruelly enforced. The criminalization of sex work, drug use and harm reduction measures create climates in which civilian and police violence is rife and legal redress for victims impossible. Fear of arrest drives key populations underground, away from HIV and harm reduction programmes. Incarceration and compulsory detention exposes detainees to sexual assault and unsafe injection practices, while condoms are contraband and harm reduction measures (including antiretroviral medicines) are denied. Women, HIV and the Law: Women and girls make up half of the global population of people living with HIV. Laws and legally condoned customs\u2014from genital mutilation to denial of property rights\u2014produce profound gender inequality; domestic violence also robs women and girls of personal power. These factors undermine women\u2019s and girls\u2019 ability to protect themselves from HIV infection and cope with its consequences. Children, Young People, HIV and the Law: Where sex education, harm reduction and comprehensive reproductive and HIV services are accessible to youth, young people\u2019s rates of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) drop. These interventions are rare, however, and in both developed and developing nations, the denial of the realities of young people\u2019s lives is reflected in the high physical, emotional and social toll of HIV among the young. Criminalisation of HIV Transmission: In over 60 countries it is a crime to expose another person to HIV or to transmit it, especially through sex. At least 600 individuals living with HIV in 24 countries have been convicted under HIV-specific or general criminal laws. Such laws do not increase safer sex practices. Instead, they discourage people from getting tested or treated, in fear of being prosecuted for passing HIV to lovers or children. Access to Treatment: A growing body of international trade law and the over-reach of intellectual property (IP) protections are impeding the production and distribution of low-cost generic drugs. IP protection is supposed to provide an incentive for innovation but experience has shown that the current laws are failing to promote innovation that serves the medical needs of the poor. The fallout from these regulations\u2014in particular the TRIPS framework\u2014has exposed the central role of excessive IP protections in exacerbating the lack of access to HIV treatment and other essential medicines. The situation is most dire in low- and middle-income countries but reverberates through high- income countries as well. Provisions allowing some low- and middle-income countries exceptions to and relaxations of these rules could help alleviate the crisis, but pressure against their use is substantial. A small number of countries have been able to take advantage of the few international legal flexibilities that exist. Several countries in Asia and the Pacific are now negotiating free trade agreements that may contain provisions that constrain their right to implement TRIPS flexibilities. Legal systems differ from country to country. However, most countries have various sources of the law as well as different branches of the law. They also have a range of organisations, services, mechanisms and institutions to implement laws, regulations and policies and to enable people to access justice and enforce laws when these are violated. Reviewing laws, regulations and policies relevant to HIV and AIDS requires looking at many sources of law in a country. Laws regulating public health and HIV are seldom codified in one form. In most cases, health norms are found in various sources and branches of the law and are complemented by a range of health regulations, policies, plans, guidelines and strategies. Some countries have HIV-specific laws. However in other countries general laws related to health and medical practice (e.g. laws setting out patients\u2019 rights; or laws regarding the safety, quality and availability of health services) will apply equally to HIV and AIDS. Additionally, general principles of law, such as those set out in 39 the constitution, as well as principles of civil law or common law relating to privacy and autonomy, will also apply to patients\u2019 rights. A range of laws outside of the health sector are equally important to understanding the impact of law on access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support. For this reason, the legal environment assessment needs to also consider laws affecting key populations such as the following, amongst others: \uf0b7 Criminal laws, punitive laws and practices in relation to key affected populations. \uf0b7 Laws that set out additional protections or restrict the agency of children and adolescents. \uf0b7 Family, marriage and inheritance laws providing information on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41c59395-0e00-415c-b170-155f30054550": {"__data__": {"id_": "41c59395-0e00-415c-b170-155f30054550", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d542860dcc477dd03b7be526538e79c90c943b9527bad5fef5f25a1666144a0a"}, "3": {"node_id": "496b4db9-1f7f-4886-9507-d6fd762cffdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d7a26850d2324dc3bcd598e4711ae035dd2401012e8d059a80a999e3992d9a5"}}, "hash": "875d0ad9bfed32b44fc5a4d8507178b59df9ca3f89db091f990136e60ce91e11", "text": "the rights of women to own and inherit property. \uf0b7 Criminal laws that impact on people living with HIV (e.g. laws that criminalise HIV transmission), that protect people from sexual violence, and that criminalise behaviour including sex work, sexual behaviour like same- sex relationships, or injection drug use. \uf0b7 Intellectual property laws that restrict or promote access to medicines. \uf0b7 Correctional service laws that determine access to services for prisoners. \uf0b7 Migration laws that determine access to services for non-citizens. \uf0b7 Employment laws that set out the rights of employees with HIV or AIDS and the obligations of employers. \uf0b7 Disability laws that set out the rights of people with disabilities. Finally, a country may have a \u2018dual\u2019 legal system, where statutory law operates alongside customary law and/or religious laws (e.g. Afghanistan). In this case, customary or religious laws may have a greater impact on the daily lives of many populations than the statutory laws of the land. It is important to ensure that they form part of the legal environment assessment for inclusion in the desk review. Box 14: Documents to be reviewed The desk review may include an assessment of: \uf0b7 International and regional human rights instruments and declarations, including those specific to HIV \uf0b7 Laws, regulations and policies \uf0b7 Plans, strategies and guidelines \uf0b7 Reports of cases that have been decided in the courts \uf0b7 Annual reports and research reports of networks of people living with HIV and other CSOs (eg, PLHIV Stigma Index report), statutory bodies (such as a Human Rights Commission), international and regional organisations (e.g. Human Rights Watch) and academic publications \uf0b7 Country reports on human rights commitments to regional bodies and international bodies. (e.g. Reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, Report to Universal Periodic Review) \uf0b7 The Global AIDS Response Progress Report including National Commitments and Policies Index (completed every 2 years and submitted to UNAIDS) \uf0b7 Regional reports that contain analyses of national legal environments, such as Sex Work and the Law (UNDP, UNFPA, UNAIDS, 2012) Each of the key issues may be regulated by a range of laws, regulations, policies and/or guidelines. The review process will require all relevant laws to be identified and analysed in order to describe how they protect rights in the context of HIV or act as a barrier to universal access to services. It will also require reviewing how laws are implemented and enforced, the nature and extent of stigma and discrimination amongst communities and how people access justice. This may involve mapping the work of various organisations and services in the country and examining documentation such as case law, annual reports of civil society organizations, research reports, submissions and case studies.

The legislative review employed a series of 10 \u201cchecklists\u201d from Handbook for Legislators on HIV/AIDS, Law and Human Rights, with which to assess whether different areas of law are compliant with the International Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights published in 1998. The checklist includes 1) Public health law, 2) Criminal law, 3) Prisons/correctional laws, 4) Anti-discrimination legislation, 5) Equality of legal status of vulnerable populations, 6) Privacy/confidentiality laws, 7) Employment law, 8) Therapeutic goods, consumer protection laws, 9) Ethical human research, 10) Association, information, codes of practice. Each review examined national laws and regulations following the check list.

Structure of the national consultation Ideally, a national consultation will be based on a 2-day agenda. Some countries have used the first day for multisectoral presentations, discussions and group work to scope the issues, while focusing the second day on action planning. Another option is to use the first day for a preparatory workshop/meeting as outlined below, with the second day dedicated to mutli-sectoral and participatory dialogue and action planning. Alternatively, the preparatory meeting can be held in the weeks leading up to the broader multisectoral dialogue. See Annex 7 for a Draft Agenda for the 2 day consultation, and Annex 8 for a Sample Agenda from a multi-country national consultation held in the Pacific. (i) Preparatory meeting for civil society and governments Experience from participatory models employed at the national (Papua New Guinea, Philippines) and regional dialogues of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law (2011-2012), and the Asia Pacific Consultation on HIV and Sex Work (2010), shows us that a preparatory meeting - where civil society participants and government representatives meet separately to discuss their expectations of the consultation - enables them to prepare to effectively interact with their counterparts in a constructive and meaningful way. Accordingly, this is seen as an important aspect of an effective consultation. Photo by Aroon Thaewchatturat Topics at the preparatory meeting may include setting agenda items ahead of the national consultation, selecting delegates or deputations for the national consultation, discussion of review recommendations, establishing a community consensus and advocacy messages on key issues that may be discussed at the consultation, the role that communities can/should play in supporting reform of the legal environment going forward (See Annexure 6 for an example of an agenda for a preparatory community consultation meeting conducted several weeks prior to the national multisectoral meeting). A simultaneous preparatory meeting for government representatives is also recommended, but can be considered optional. (ii) The multisectoral and participatory national consultation: It is good practice for the national consultation meeting to be convened or co-convened by a government agency. This ensures government ownership of the event and increases prospects of the recommendations of the meeting being acted on by government partners. Government agencies that convened national consultations in the period 2011- 2014 included: \uf0b7 Bangladesh: The National AIDS/STD Programme convened the national consultation, with the assistance of UNAIDS and support of the Global Fund on HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria. \uf0b7 Cambodia: The National AIDS Authority co-convened the national consultation and managed the overall review process, with technical support from UNAIDS. \uf0b7 Myanmar: The Ministry of Health\u2019s National AIDS Program convened the national legal consultation with technical support from UNAIDS, UNDP and the UK Government. \uf0b7 Indonesia: The National AIDS Commission and the Department of Justice and Human Rights convened the national legal consultation. \uf0b7 Papua New Guinea: Papua New Guinea National AIDS Council Secretariat and UNDP convened the National Dialogue on HIV and the Law. 47 \uf0b7 The Philippines: The Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines and UNDP convened the National Dialogue on HIV and the Law. It is important that participants of national consultations share a common understanding of the objectives of the meeting. The objectives should clarify the relationship of the consultation meeting to the review process, and address the contribution of the meeting to forward planning (e.g. to develop a time-bound action plan). Examples of good practice in ensuring that there are clear objectives of the national consultation include: \uf0b7 Bangladesh The meeting objectives were to: o Identify laws that are hindering the AIDS response; o Build consensus on reforms needed to create an enabling legal environment for access to HIV services; and o Develop a time-bound action plan of identified priorities to address the punitive and discriminatory legal environment that is impeding the AIDS response in Bangladesh. \uf0b7 Cambodia The meeting objectives were to: o Validate findings from the desk review and group consultations held with community representatives, NGOs, government agencies, UN and development partners; o Identify priorities for recommendations; and o Discuss and agree next steps for taking the agenda forward.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d87298ba-e502-4763-aa96-4e43f432b6f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "d87298ba-e502-4763-aa96-4e43f432b6f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eae32984fc718f595dfe98f54aefe8640b90d8123b038f8dbdb5377aea281b0f"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecf09957-6d87-4a3e-b291-009b44579086", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a6192917ee1ef7cc41c4c3f9160697ea6b5dc505c34975d3403ca3712a1e570"}}, "hash": "92cc25888d56a4ab86eb1a41a4e733a2ec3e393332b2ef8b9c77d7d1e298be17", "text": "\uf0b7 Myanmar The meeting objectives were to: o Validate findings from consultations held with NGOs and community networks;

Key elements of the national consultation include: 1. Country goals, commitments and progress relating to addressing stigma and discrimination (and linkages to regional and global processes) 2. Process of the national review including: \uf0b7 What laws, policies and documents were reviewed and which stakeholders were consulted \uf0b7 How stakeholder\u2019s perspectives and other findings were incorporated into the analysis and Review Report \uf0b7 Any limitations and challenges during the process and how these were dealt with \uf0b7 Key issues, draft findings to be validated at the national consultation and recommendations made by the review; 3.

The role of people living with HIV and other key populations in national consultations It is good practice to maximize participation of people living with HIV and other key populations throughout the consultation processes. An opportunity should be provided for community representatives to present in the opening session of the consultation meeting. For example, representatives from national networks of people living with HIV were provided an opportunity to speak at the opening sessions of the national consultations in Cambodia and Myanmar.Participation of people living with HIV and key populations enables participants to be exposed to first-hand accounts of the negative and positive impacts of the legal environment on HIV responses. Providing an opportunity for a person living with HIV to speak is also important to set the tone of the meeting as it signals that community inputs are welcomed. It reassures community participants that their voices are regarded as being of central importance and that the opinions and perspectives of people living with HIV will be valued and respected by other participants including government representatives throughout the meeting. It is essential to ensure key populations at the national consultation can participate in a supportive environment in which confidentiality concerns are addressed e.g. by excluding media from sensitive sessions. It should be recognized that participants who belong to key populations whose behaviours are criminalized may feel reluctant to identify themselves or to speak in the presence of police, government officials or the media. Examples of participatory processes include: \uf0b7 The Cambodia consultation included organizations representing MSM, transgender people, sex workers and people living with HIV. A women living with HIV presented in the opening session. 49 \uf0b7 The Philippines consultation included representatives of community-based groups of people living with HIV, MSM and transgender people. \uf0b7 The Myanmar consultation included national networks representing MSM, sex workers, people who inject drugs and men and women living with HIV. \uf0b7 The Papua New Guinea consultation included presentations from a sex worker, MSM, transgender persons and a young gay person. It was noted that: \u201cThis was one of the first times in Papua New Guinea that such persons had stood up, spoken out and expressed their demands as citizens for engagement with, and protection by, their government.\u201d33 It can be helpful to allocate time for preparation of community participants so that they can clarify their priorities and meaningfully participate in the national meeting. In Cambodia and Myanmar this occurred in the week before the national meeting. Malaysia\u2019s consultation was conducted over two days, with the first day dedicated to civil society organizations (particularly those working with key populations) so that civil society could agree a consensus statement to present to government representatives at the multisectoral meeting convened on the second day. Participation of other key stakeholders Government representatives Participation of senior representatives of the government (the responsible minister or senior government officials from key ministries) can help to ensure that the plans and recommendations of the consultation will be acted on by the lead government sectors. Examples of good practice in multisectoral participation include: \uf0b7 The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97442ff5-c240-44d1-875f-1e6b958a1f8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "97442ff5-c240-44d1-875f-1e6b958a1f8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdfc5f7b8b89c7295110fe6dc358f2daa706dc8a0d0c84df51d0012078b0a196"}}, "hash": "cdfc5f7b8b89c7295110fe6dc358f2daa706dc8a0d0c84df51d0012078b0a196", "text": "Indonesia consultation included participants from nine ministries: the Coordinating Minister for People Welfare, Ministries of Health, Law and Human Rights, Social Affairs, Manpower and Transmigration, Trade, Women\u2019s Empowerment, Religious Affairs, National Education. Other government agencies represented included the Human Rights Commission, National Women\u2019s Commission, the National AIDS Commission and four Provincial AIDS Commissions. \uf0b7 The Bangladesh consultation included presentations from the State Minister of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, the Chairman of the National Human Rights Commission, the Acting Chairman of the Law Commission, the Deputy Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, Executive Director of the Bangladesh Legal Aid and Services Trust, and the Director of the National AIDS/STD Programme. \uf0b7 The Philippines consultation included presentations from the Department of Justice, Department of Interior and Local Government, Department of Health and the Commission on Human Rights. Police and law enforcement agencies Police and law enforcement agencies can play a key role in protecting the rights of key populations and implementation of action plans. It is also useful to involve police to address the implications of police abuses of key populations on HIV responses. Examples of good practice include: \uf0b7 The Bangladesh consultation included a speech by the Police Commissioner from the Dhaka Metropolitan Police. This speech acknowledged the need to prevent police abuses of key populations that impede HIV responses. \uf0b7 The Myanmar consultation included participation from the Myanmar Police Force who responded to community concerns about police practices affecting key populations. 33 Kirby M., PNG National Dialogue on HIV, Human Rights and the Law, 13-14 June 2011. National human rights institutions The mandate of national human rights institutions generally includes responsibilities relating to HIV, including receiving complaints of violations of fundamental rights, inquiring into HIV-related issues or educating the community on human rights obligations. It is therefore useful to include these institutions in national consultations so their role can be considered. For example, representatives of the Human Rights Commissions of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and the Philippines participated in the national consultation meetings of their countries. Academics Several consultations included participation of university-based academic experts on the legal and social aspects of HIV (e.g. China, Indonesia, Malaysia). For example, for the China consultation UNDP worked with Renmin University Law School to conduct the national review and consultation (National Law Review on HIV and Key Populations, 2013). China\u2019s national consultation meeting was hosted at Renmin University\u2019s Law School jointly organised by UNDP, Renmin University and the China Red Ribbon Forum on HIV and Rights and supported by UNAIDS. Renmin University was considered to be a strategic partner because it provided the review and consultation process with added authority and was able to draw in links with government institutions to increase government ownership in the review and consultation process. Parliamentarians It is strategic to involve parliamentarians who can advocate at the political level for legislative and policy reform. Parliamentarians participated in national consultations in Bangladesh, Myanmar, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea. In the case of Papua New Guinea, the Chair of the Parliamentary Committee on HIV/AIDS provided an opening presentation at the National Dialogue. The judiciary It is good practice to ensure representation from the judiciary at the national consultation and to provide an opportunity for a senior member of the judiciary to speak. This may help to ensure that the judiciary of the country is made aware of the issues raised and that the action plan arising from the meeting includes actions that address the role of the judiciary in creating an enabling legal environment for HIV responses. The Bhutan consultation included a keynote speech delivered by a judge of the Supreme Court of Bhutan focusing on the role of the judiciary in addressing human rights issues, including applying the protections provided by fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution, and the role of the judiciary in reconciling interests and rights between all relevant parties. The Sri Lanka roundtable included a speech by a female Supreme Court judge. Legal profession and justice sector Participation of the legal profession is important to ensure aspects relating to access to legal services and legal redress mechanisms for resolving disputes are addressed in consultations. For China\u2019s consultation, the Director of the Legal Aid and Public Interest Legal Affairs Committee of the All China Lawyers Association was a key participant. Representation by a senior member of the legal profession was important for China\u2019s consultation to draw attention to the legal service needs of people living with HIV and key populations. In Papua New Guinea, the National Dialogue process included a separate meeting with the Solicitor-General, the Public", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7d2b767-5c04-490f-ae8e-77d02ebdd302": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7d2b767-5c04-490f-ae8e-77d02ebdd302", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b39c8985c13cd8ee3c0430b95319fe4f70558fea8f830cdd89459b9abc6e37b4"}}, "hash": "b39c8985c13cd8ee3c0430b95319fe4f70558fea8f830cdd89459b9abc6e37b4", "text": "Solicitor, the Public Prosecutor, and the State Solicitor, Deputy Chief Ombudsman and the Director of Village Courts Secretariat. In Thailand, the national consultation included participation of the Ministry of Justice\u2019s Department of Rights and Liberty Protection and Office of Supreme Attorney and key law mechanisms such as National Law Reform Commission and Lawyers Council under Royal Patronage. 51 Faith-based organizations Faith-based organizations are often influential and can help shape attitudes and generate a broader base of community support for changes to laws and policies. Examples of good practice in engaging faith-based organizations include: \uf0b7 The Bangladesh national consultation meeting included a presentation from the Islamic Foundation; \uf0b7 In Malaysia, interviews were conducted with representatives of the Federal Territory Islamic Affairs Department as part of the review process; \uf0b7 The Myanmar review and national consultation meeting included participation of the Myanmar Interfaith Network on AIDS; and \uf0b7 In Papua New Guinea, the National Dialogue on HIV, Human Rights and the Law included participation of the Churches Alliance. Media Media organizations are an important stakeholder in the national HIV response but have often been excluded from formal consultation processes because of concerns about maintaining confidentiality and avoiding sensationalized reporting of sensitive issues. In the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, press conferences were scheduled as part of the agenda of the National Dialogue on HIV and the Law. In addition, the Papua New Guinea National Dialogue process included a dedicated meeting to discuss the role of the media with journalists and members of the Media Council. The Papua New Guinea meeting with media noted that journalists lacked specialist knowledge of HIV and that more technical support should be provided to strengthen the capacity of journalists to deliver accurate and appropriate, non-stigmatizing reporting of HIV-related issues. Youth Young people are key to the future of HIV responses so youth representatives should be supported in participating in national consultations. For the Myanmar national consultation, representatives of a network of young people from key populations or affected by HIV, the Myanmar Youth Stars Network, presented on key legal issues for young people. Support was provided to these young people to develop their presentation skills in advance of the meeting. Women It is important to pay attention to gender balance when arranging speakers, facilitators and participants. Some consultations included specific presentations on women\u2019s issues by women living with HIV or other relevant experts. For example, the Myanmar consultation included a presentation from the Myanmar Positive Women\u2019s Network, and the Sri Lanka roundtable included a presentation from the Sri Lanka Positive Women\u2019s Network. In Cambodia, a woman living with HIV presented alongside government and UN speakers during the opening session of the national consultation. UN agencies and donors It is good practice to engage development partners such as UN agencies and donors in consultations as they have access to resources to support implementation. In several countries UNAIDS and/or UNDP has played a key role in co- convening or providing technical assistance to national consultations (e.g. Cambodia, China, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, Pacific region). In Malaysia, the UN HIV/AIDS Theme Group convened the national consultation. In several countries, bilateral donors have been represented at and/or supported the consultation meetings (e.g. Japan\u2019s aid programme was represented at the Myanmar meeting; Australia\u2019s aid programme supported and was represented at the Papua New Guinea National Dialogue; a UK-funded civil society programme Pyoe Pin co-convened the Myanmar consultation with UNAIDS, UNDP and the Ministry of Health). Participatory methodologies It is important for national consultations to be structured in a way that maximizes participation and encourages cross- sectoral dialogue. The consultation should encourage sharing of perspectives and peer learning. It is effective to structure the consultation to include a mix of presentations, panel discussions, interactive dialogue involving members of the audience, and small group work. Consultations should be interactive and therefore go beyond didactic lecture-style presentations from experts. A facilitated dialogue and \u2018town hall\u2019 style meetings can provide a forum for an open and respectful exchange of views about sensitive and sometimes divisive issues, such as the legal status of sex work, male-to-male sex and gender- based violence. Consultation meetings can provide a space for a diverse range of stakeholders to share their experiences and views and provide a basis for mutual understanding to be established to inform an ongoing policy discussion. Small group work can be an effective participatory approach that enables focused discussions on key issues to occur. Group sessions (preferable comprising less than 10 people per group) facilitate in-depth discussion and analysis of the issues, after which each group can present ideas, strategies and issues to the plenary or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2531a1ce-53aa-4520-b221-8ca5c7e2a6d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "2531a1ce-53aa-4520-b221-8ca5c7e2a6d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71e47d97e17ef0b2027575943d0379f2ed129747518f9e3b06fb65191820e383"}}, "hash": "71e47d97e17ef0b2027575943d0379f2ed129747518f9e3b06fb65191820e383", "text": "further discussion. In consultations conducted in the past, some countries preferred to structure these groups to focus on different key populations. Other countries structured the group work to focus on broader cross-cutting issues. Examples of approaches taken to group work include: \uf0b7 At the Bangladesh consultation, each group discussed issues relating to one of six key populations: female sex workers, transgender hijras, men who have sex with men, people living with HIV, people who inject drugs, and migrant workers. The groups brain-stormed and identified major legal barriers, policies and practices hindering access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support by these populations and recommended specific actions. \uf0b7 Participants of the Cambodia national consultation were divided into groups that included a mix of government and community representatives. All groups then addressed the same overarching question: To support the national HIV response, what changes are required to: o Laws, regulations and policies? o Law enforcement practices? o Access to legal aid services? On the basis of the issues that were identified by the groups in answering this overarching question, four issues were identified for further group work on the second day. The issues identified for further group work were (i) the health care rights of people living with HIV; (ii) employment, social protection and poverty; (iii) police practices and key populations; and (iv) gender and violence. \uf0b7 At the Indonesia national consultation, group work was focused on the following six issues grouped according to subpopulations: people living with HIV and access to treatment, women, people who inject drugs, sex workers, MSM and transgender people, and young people. Each group was tasked to consider priority issues identified by the Steering Committee through the national review, referencing recommendations of the Global Commission on HIV and the Law. Group discussions sought to define time- bound actions relating to: (i) specific laws and policies; (ii) law enforcement practices; (iii) access to justice. \uf0b7 At the Malaysia consultation, three groups were formed. Each group focused on one of the following priority issues: (i) harm reduction; (ii) key affected populations including injecting drug users, sex workers, MSM, transgender people, migrants, indigenous people and most-at-risk young populations; and (iii) treatment, care and support. \uf0b7 At the Myanmar consultation, participants were divided into six groups. The groups discussed punitive laws, policies and practices on the first day and protective laws, policies and practices on the second day. On the first day, groups considered key issues and priorities relating to criminal justice such as laws criminalizing key populations and police practices. On the second day, the groups considered the need for protective laws and 53 policies and the key issues and priorities relating to stigma and discrimination and quality of treatment and care. Participants reported back on their group\u2019s priorities and the key government and civil society actors responsible for addressing each priority. \uf0b7 At the Papua New Guinea consultation, the participants worked in five groups, with each group discussing one issue. The groups were asked to identify challenges and opportunities for improving policies for that issue. The five issues addressed were: existing laws affecting vulnerable groups; enforcement of the national AIDS law; discrimination; gender equality and gender-based violence; and access to services. The Papua New Guinea consultation also involved a panel discussion involving representatives from affected communities, the Churches, the Ombudsman\u2019s Commission, the legal profession and parliament. \uf0b7 At the Philippine dialogue, participants were divided into four groups: government sector, civil society organizations, support groups, and MSM and transgender groups. All groups discussed the same overarching question and proposed recommendations: How can we use the law to effectively protect and promote the rights of people living with HIV and key affected populations? \uf0b7 The Pacific regional consultation was structured so as to provide participants with opportunities to learn from regional experts and to share, support and learn from other Pacific nations and peers from health and justice sectors facing similar challenges. Emphasis was placed on the need to engage in questions and answers at each session and to recognize that many of the answers were within the skills, experiences and expertise of peers and professional colleagues within the country delegations. There were formal structures in the programme and informal meeting rules to encourage country pairing and mutual review and support in preparing draft action plans for each of the seven participating countries. Evaluation of national consultations It is good practice to integrate a participatory evaluation process into the national consultation process. The Pacific regional consultation included a written evaluation process that enabled participants to provide a rating of the objectives of the consultation, facilitation, reading materials, logistics, increased", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e0be236-e951-4501-bc9f-0417974be53d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e0be236-e951-4501-bc9f-0417974be53d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "998d6ada8c839f9760ec8528833380690f779d4858d0eb0463f7b31907355fef"}}, "hash": "998d6ada8c839f9760ec8528833380690f779d4858d0eb0463f7b31907355fef", "text": "knowledge and suggestions for improvement. Participants, speakers and resource personnel were invited to complete evaluation forms and an Evaluation Report was provided to the meeting organizers. An evaluation report provides an important resource to inform future consultation processes. As an alternative approach to written surveys, in Papua New Guinea face to face de-briefing meetings were convened following the National Dialogue with representatives of the sex worker, MSM and transgender communities. This provided an opportunity for oral feedback to be provided on whether key populations felt meaningfully included in the dialogue. Given the marginalization of these populations, such opportunities are rare so it is good practice to provide an opportunity for participants to provide direct oral feedback on the experience to inform future consultations. Section 4: Implementation and monitoring progress It is important to ensure that the legal environment review does not end with the production of the review report or the national consultation. The recommended outputs of the consultative process include: \uf0b7 a time-bound action plan for key actions for strengthening the legal environment; and \uf0b7 the identification of an oversight and monitoring mechanism as a way of increasing ownership in achieving the reforms identified as necessary for an effective HIV response Action plans National consultations provide an opportunity to develop action plans that define a time-bound framework for implementation of the priority recommendations flowing from the review and national consultation. Action plans should be clear and implementable, with responsibilities for actions assigned to specific institutions and organisations and time frames for completion identified. See Annex 9 for examples of country action plans. It is good practice for action plans to address all aspects of the legal environment, i.e. laws, regulations and policies at national and sub-national level; law enforcement issues including police practices and enforcement of protective laws; access to justice and legal literacy; and capacity building of key sectors in a human rights-based approach to HIV including health care workers, people working in the law and justice sector, parliamentarians and the media. Consideration should be given to including activities that empower key populations and civil society organizations to claim their rights and that build the capacity of state institutions to implement HIV and human rights activities Action plans should identify the specific laws or regulations that create obstacles to HIV responses and require repeal. Action plans should also identify the new protective laws that should be introduced to strengthen the legal environment. For example, the review and consultation processes in some countries have led to proposals for comprehensive new national laws on HIV that address the human rights of people living with HIV to non- discrimination, confidentiality and informed consent. National reviews and consultations also provide an opportunity to focus attention to access to justice issues, such as the availability of legal aid to address HIV-related human rights violations. For example, the reviews and consultations in Cambodia, China and Myanmar identified the need to build on the existing small-scale legal aid services to provide expanded access to justice to people living with HIV and key populations. Consideration should be given to allocating substantial time in the agenda of the national consultation meeting to allow government and civil society stakeholders to jointly develop action plans. The Pacific regional consultation was held over a three-day period and two days were allocated to drafting country action plans. Draft action plans were presented to the full consultation meeting for comment and feedback. The action plans specifed activities that each country would complete by the end of 2013, 2014 and 2015. Meeting facilitators should help participants to agree the status of the action plans developed at consultation meetings. For example, the status of the action plans developed at the Pacific regional consultation meeting were described as follows: The Action Plans are not intended to replace any existing national plans of action, nor are they intended to restrict countries to actions that the delegates at the meeting can/could implement. Hence the intention of 55 the plan is to map out key actions to be taken to address priority issues identified at the consultation, and to identify those stakeholders that need to be engaged at the national level to make this a reality.34 Further action planning can also be conducted in the period following the national consultation by a body such as a national AIDS commission or departmental committee with responsibility for legal and policy aspects of the national HIV response. National reviews and consultations can lead to identification of a large number of recommendations that need to be further prioritized, taking into account such factors as upcoming law reform and policy opportunities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "818aaf07-1fea-4f4e-85dc-176594c76985": {"__data__": {"id_": "818aaf07-1fea-4f4e-85dc-176594c76985", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "815d0c462086dc9b8fb8c05566ca2ce184139d6b2d3a77c5753d34e72effd784"}}, "hash": "815d0c462086dc9b8fb8c05566ca2ce184139d6b2d3a77c5753d34e72effd784", "text": "and the significance of the recommendations to the epidemiology of the local HIV epidemic. It can be strategic to give priority to a limited number of high priority recommendations for which opportunities have been identified to achieve progress. Integrating action plans into government processes Effective implementation requires political will to drive forward the agenda. It is therefore helpful to ensure government ownership of recommendations and action plans. If the recommendations or action plan are developed by non-government actors, endorsement from the national AIDS authority or other government bodies may be essential to ensure recommendations are acted upon by government. It is desirable that recommendations from the national consultations feed into other existing planning and implementation processes, such as the implementation plan for the national HIV and AIDS strategy or the national human rights plan. National review recommendations and follow-up activities can also be integrated into Global Fund proposals and funding proposals to other donors, and UN development assistance frameworks. It is important that there is clarity regarding the relationship between action plans agreed at national consultations and the planning mechanisms of the various organizations that are expected to implement activities (government agencies, community-based groups including national key population networks, UN and donor agencies). To ensure accountability, clarity is required as to who will lead implementation and how progress is to be monitored. The consultation outputs should include the identification of a structure to co-ordinate and communicate with the various sectors, oversee follow-up work and report back to stakeholders at regular periods. The mechanism for overseeing and monitoring implementation of the recommendations and/or action plan should be multisectoral and include influential members of government, PLHIV and key populations. One option may be to continue to convene the Steering Committee that oversaw the review and consultation as the body that oversees and monitors progress in implementing action plans. If necessary, resources should be mobilised to support the oversight mechanism\u2019s functions. Where this mechanism can be integrated into or linked with an existing coordination forum it may have improved sustainability and influence. Experiences of countries indicate that it is good practice to convene legal or human rights subcommittees as task- oriented working groups to drive the legal and human rights agenda forward, to engage government partners and to keep national partners accountable. While government bodies generally convene these committees, they may include representatives from communities, NGOs and UN agencies. Implementation may require coordination of efforts between different branches of government as well as between government, NGOs, community networks and UN agencies. Examples of implementation mechanisms Note: In some cases these were pre-existing committees (e.g. Cambodia, Thailand). In some cases, new committees were established in response to the legal review and consultation processes (e.g. China, Myanmar). 34 UNAIDS, SPC, ILO, UNDP (2013).

It may be helpful to integrate this summary of the consultation meeting into the national review report so that the link between the review and consultation process is documented. It is very important that there is a record of any action plan agreed at the consultation meeting, including timeframes and identification of the organizations responsible for leading implementation of the activities and monitoring of progress. Finally, a national review and consultation in one country may provide valuable experiences and information for other countries considering a review and consultation. Countries are encouraged to take advantage of opportunities for sharing lessons and progress at the regional level, for example at the inclusive regional intergovernmental review meeting (Bangkok, January 2015) and its follow-up meetings. The review and consultation process in each country will be unique. Documenting and sharing strategies, successes and lessons learned between countries can only further enrich national legal review and consultation processes. 57 Annexes Annex 1:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0837ca6-21e7-4380-b01e-631e1bc90516": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0837ca6-21e7-4380-b01e-631e1bc90516", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Creating Enabling Legal Environments: Conducting National Reviews and Multi-Sector Consultations on Legal and Policy Barriers to HIV Services", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe5e235ae998e1104044a6711b49dff14ec2d56c35568b4fac3b737e75397110"}, "3": {"node_id": "26203381-5a84-445c-8a90-0879a96424c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/creating-enabling-legal-environments-conducting-national-reviews-and-multi-sector-consultations-legal-and-policy-barriers", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afcddf1942b3b37986302cac5ec901e067911316962252a3776d447051701919"}}, "hash": "94ba8157c99b822bacb690e346bb17fb32d6991862720714fafba064729ad8dc", "text": "Draft Terms of Reference: Steering Committee for national review and consultation Draft Terms of Reference for Steering Committee Background In the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS, governments are committed to review laws and policies that adversely affect the successful, effective and equitable delivery of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes to people living with and affected by HIV. Governments in the Asia-Pacific region had previously made similar commitments in ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9. ESCAP Governments further reinforced this commitment with the Regional Framework (\u201cESCAP Roadmap\u201d) to Support the Implementation of International and Region-specific Commitments, endorsed by the Asia-Pacific High-level Intergovernmental Meeting on the Assessment of Progress Against Commitments in the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium Development Goals, the report of which was endorsed by the 68th session of ESCAP. UNAIDS has also focused on supporting governments to meet their commitments and targets relating to eliminating HIV-related stigma and discrimination. An example of such support is the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, an independent Commission of global leaders that developed actionable, evidence-informed and human rights based recommendations for effective HIV responses. The governments in Asia and the Pacific are committed to conduct 1) national reviews on policy and legal barriers, 2) national multisectoral consultations to assess progress in meeting the commitments in the Political Declaration and ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 by early 2014. The ESCAP Roadmap includes the following key actions: \uf0b7 a review of national laws, policies and practices to enable full achievement of universal access to with a view to eliminating all forms of discrimination against people at risk of infection or living with HIV, in particular key affected populations (ESCAP Resolution 67/9, 2011); \uf0b7 organize national multisectoral consultations, as appropriate, on policy and legal barriers to universal access, in accordance with ESCAP resolution 67/9 (Regional Framework to Support the Implementation of International and Region-specific Commitments, E/ESCAP/HIV/IGM.1/3/ Rev.1, 2012); \uf0b7 a regional overview of progress made in achieving universal access (ESCAP Resolution 67/9, 2011). It is vital to set up a Steering Committee to guide, support and oversee the national review and consultation process and conduct a national overview of progress in in meeting the commitments in the Political Declaration and ESCAP Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9. Steering Committee Objectives - Provide oversight, technical guidance and monitoring for the review and consultation process in accordance with national priorities and recommended guidance, as a multi-disciplinary reference group; - To develop a process or identify a forum such as Working Group for on-going monitoring of the outcome of the national review and consultation, with the involvement of key stakeholders; - Discuss and agree the scope and objectives for the review and consultation process, participatory methodology, detailed action plan with timelines and responsible agency/body and budget and technical support needs; - Plan and approve TORs of national review and consultation and conduct necessary preparations for the process; - To review and endorse the review and consultation recommendations and to support action planning for strengthening the legal and regulatory environment for HIV and AIDS; - To report back on the outcomes of the process to key stakeholders; - Conduct follow-ups of the implementation of the action plan.

These agreements are consistent with earlier Pacific regional Declarations on HIV and AIDS signed by these seven countries in Suva in October 2004, and again in Auckland in April 2007 (attached as reference documents). Recognizing the importance of addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination, and gender inequality, UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS) has also made zero discrimination one of the three pillars of its vision and strategy for 2011-2015. UNAIDS is focused on supporting governments to meet their regional and international commitments and targets relating to the elimination of HIV-related stigma and discrimination especially through review and revision of laws which impede Human rights-based health programming. UNAIDS in the Pacific is supporting a process in mid April 2013 to: (i) review laws and policies in seven Pacific nations (Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Vanuatu) which impact on human rights-based health programming and initiatives; (ii) consult on legal and policy barriers to effective HIV responses in the seven countries through a multisectoral and participatory dialogue on laws, regulations, and policies including issues pertaining to access to justice and law enforcement in the context of HIV, and which reviews earlier commitments including the Auckland and Suva Declarations; and (iii) develop action plans for the seven countries which can be supported by country partners (including the United Nations), and monitored for progress and success. The primary purpose of undertaking this work and holding a seven-country consultation meeting in April 2013 is to identify the national laws and policies which need review and/or reform, or other programme initiatives which will increase access to rights-respecting HIV services by eliminating real or perceived impediments to delivery of equitable health services to all individuals and communities. It is hoped that countries will complete a measurable and monitorable action plan for undertaking key legal and policy reforms at country level to bring national legislation and policies in line with international good practice relating to human rights and rights-based HIV responses which the United Nations and/or other partners can support over the coming two-year period. Possible Outcomes of the Consultation Longer term possible outputs / outcomes of the seven-country consultation may include: a) Protective laws concerning non-discrimination and non-violence with regard to people living with HIV and key populations (including MSM, transgender people, people who use drugs, sex workers, prisoners, migrants, young people), drafted, considered, enacted, disseminated, resourced and enforced; b) Expanded programmes to assist countries to improve legal environments; c) Design and implementation of programmes, or drafting of laws and policies that will increase access to prevention and treatment, including around the prevention of transmission from parent to child (PMTCT), and deal with intellectual property issues related to medication and other commodities; d) Provision of legal protection against discrimination for people living with HIV, women, children and key populations in various sectors, including housing, labour, education and social services; and e) Expanded means by which to obtain redress for discrimination and violence in the context of HIV. Immediate outputs of the review and consultation process should include: - Increased awareness and understanding of HIV, the law and human rights issues for a range of stakeholders; - Documented consensus on prioritised recommendations for removing legal and policy barriers to universal access in each country, for national partners to take forward; - A time frame for action; and - A multisectoral working group with responsibility for monitoring progress on the agreed actions and recommendations 61 Annex 3: Draft Terms of Reference: National review report Draft Terms of Reference for National Review Report on Legal and Policy Barriers to Access to HIV Services by PLHIV and Key Populations Background In the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS, governments committed to review laws and policies that adversely affect the successful, effective and equitable delivery of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support programmes to people living with and affected by HIV.

Desirable outcomes from national consultation: \uf0b7 Protective laws concerning non-discrimination and non-violence with regard to people living with HIV and key populations enacted, disseminated, resourced and enforced; \uf0b7 Programmes to improve the legal environment expanded; \uf0b7 Promotion of programmes, laws and policies that will increase access to prevention and treatment \uf0b7 Provision of legal protection against discrimination for people living with HIV, women, children and key populations in various sectors, including housing, labour, education and social services; and \uf0b7 Expanded means by which to obtain redress for discrimination and violence in the context of HIV. 67 Immediate outputs of the consultation: \uf0b7 Prioritised recommendations for removing legal and policy barriers to universal access for national partners to take forward \uf0b7 A timeframe for action \uf0b7 A multisectoral working group with responsibility for monitoring progress on the agreed actions and recommendations \uf0b7 A report for public to support transparency and accountability, and which could be used to support governments in their regional and global reporting on progress in implementing the ESCAP and High-level Meeting commitments. Participants: 1. Government: As global and regional commitments have been made by governments, governments should be leading the planning and implementation of national consultation. The United Nations and other partners can support and facilitate as appropriate. Government participants at relevant ESCAP meetings should be engaged. Other ministries may include HIV and AIDS, Health, Foreign Affairs, Justice, Police/Law Enforcement, Gender/Women, Social Development, Social Welfare, Education, Youth, Child Protection, Trade & Industry, Employment / Labour, Correctional Services, Safety and Security, Parliamentarians (including any parliamentary HIV working group/committee); Members of the judiciary, legal fraternity and legal aid services. Government representatives including Ministry of Foreign Affairs who have participated in ESCAP intergovernmental meetings at which Resolutions 66/10 and 67/9 and the Roadmap were adopted and endorsed, respectively, should also be involved. 2. Representatives of statutory bodies such as an Ombudsperson, Public Protector, Human Rights Commission and/or Law Commission; Representatives of professional bodies such as medical councils, nursing councils, councils of psychologists; Service providers such as health care workers, educators, social welfare workers. 3. Civil society: Civil society, including communities of key populations, faith based organisations, NGOs, have a key role to play in holding governments to account on commitments, data collection and inputs on legal/policy barriers, recommendations and advocacy for legal/policy/programmatic reform, as ongoing partners on creating an enabling legal environment, and providing inputs to ESCAP regional overview of progress. 4. United Nations: UN Country Teams, including UNAIDS, UNDP and other members of the Joint Team on AIDS. ESCAP also has an important role in supporting governments to meet regional commitments and in ensuring that progress is reported back through the system. 5. Donors and national investors in the HIV response and human rights: Ministries responsible for determining national investments in the HIV response (such as Ministries of Commerce) should also be invited to participate in the dialogue. Parliamentarians can also have influence over national funding of the HIV response. Donors such as AusAID, USAID, SIDA, and the Global Fund can also be valuable participants, particularly where it is foreseen that high level political or financial support may be required for follow up actions. Timeline of the consultation: A consultation should be convened by the end of 2013 (latest early 2014) in order to submit a country report on progress in implementing the ESCAP and High-level Meeting commitments.

Preparation A preparatory meeting (1/2 day \u2013 1 day) is suggested to allow time for civil society participants to discuss issues and refine messages. Where resources permit, a simultaneous preparatory meeting for government participants may also be held. In many countries, this will be a valuable opportunity to speak frankly on progress, challenges and opportunities for change and to foster communication between different governments sectors that do not necessarily work together regularly (e.g. parliamentarians, health and law/ justice). Meeting objectives: To prepare participants for the National Consultation, clarify participants\u2019 roles in the consultation process, review (and if necessary, amend) agenda items ahead of the national consultation, select delegates or deputations for the national consultation, establish a community consensus on key issues that may be discussed at the consultation, and meet each other and the moderator/facilitator before the national consultation. This preparatory meeting will be an important opportunity for civil society participants to plan their interventions and become comfortable with the consultation process. Meeting outcomes: By the end of the preparatory meeting participants will have a clear understanding of their role in the consultation and will feel ready to contribute to discussions.

This in a region already mired in challenges from legal and social barriers that inhibit effective programming and resource allocation, to deep-rooted stigma in health care settings that further limits access to services for hiV prevention, care and treatment. highly concentrated and severe hiV epidemics among men who have sex with men in urban areas across the region are already well documented. in 2008, the independent Commission on aidS in asia made several key policy recommendations intended to reduce the impact of the hiV epidemic among key affected populations, including men who have sex with men and transgender persons. These include calling for the urgent scale-up of interventions that are known to prevent hiV infection, and to ensure including greater access to treatment, care, and support for those already living with hiV. in addition, the Commission noted that countries, in order for their responses to be effective, need to understand and address what is driving their hiV epidemics, and how to reach populations most at risk of infection. addressing the specific concerns of hiV among men who have sex with men and transgender persons is one of the un family\u2019s key priority areas. This requires joint and collaborative efforts by governments, civil society, donors, development partners, and perhaps most importantly men who have sex with men and transgender persons living with hiV. in order to define a rights based, comprehensive response to hiV among these highly marginalized and stigmatized populations, undP, Who, uneSCo and unaidS, in partnership with the association of South east asian nations (aSean), uSaid and the asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual health (aPCoM) convened the \u201cRegional Consensus Meeting on developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce hiV among Men who have Sex with Men and Transgender Populations in asia and the Pacific\u201d to review and endorse a comprehensive package of services and programmes to support hiV prevention, treatment and care. We hope this inclusive report and the accompanying evidence based \u201cPriority hiV and sexual health interventions in the health sector for men who have sex with men and transgender people in the asia Pacific \u201cwill serve as essential resources for national aidS authorities and community-based organizations to design and scale up effective responses to hiV among these populations at the national and local level. We are at a critical moment. an enabling environment is essential for an effective and comprehensive response to hiV among men who have sex with men and transgender people in the Region. in order to achieve universal access to hiV prevention, treatment, care and support and progress towards the Millennium development goals, we must first facilitate a conducive legal environment coupled with human rights-based hiV policies and programmes for men who have sex with men and transgender persons. This will mean significantly stepping up our investment in legal and social programmes which effectively address discrimination and stigmatization that are crippling regional, national and local efforts to stem the rapidly rising tide of hiV infection among men who have sex with men and transgender persons. Secondly, we must support adequate capacity among grassroots organizations in order to undertake a massive scale-up of quality and innovative services to infected and affected community groups; only high degrees of coverage levels could have a significant and rapid impact on the progression of the epidemic.

The meeting further recognised that enabling environments, strategic partnerships and collaborations that include governments, com- munities and development partners are essential for the design, costing and implementation of com- prehensive responses. Prevention activities must target the diversity of MSM and Tg, including those living with hiV, and address sexual health needs through a variety of approaches and combinations of interventions. in- novative use of mass and targeted media, including the internet, should be an integrated component in the delivery of prevention messages, health pro- motion and social support services.

To maximise service utilisation and coverage, access to STi management, hiV counselling and testing and, where appropriate, structured referral mecha- nisms to health, social services and peer support groups, needs to be increased. This can be achieved through implementation of interventions such as peer outreach, drop-in centers, and mobile clinics that seek to provide services in addition to standard public health settings. addressing stigma and discrimination, enhancing the appropriate clinical skills, knowledge, and sensi- tisation of health care workers, removing structural barriers to appropriate services delivery, and increas- ing health seeking behaviours of MSM and Tg are also essential to programme success. Consequently, an increased proportion of MSM and Tg living with hiV will realise their right to positive health, includ- ing access to existing public health aRT services, life saving therapies, and targeted prevention and care through community programmes designed and run by and for MSM living with hiV, as well as the provi- sion of clinical management of co-infections such as TB and hepatitis. The meeting also recognised the potential of exist- ing and emerging bio-medical prevention technolo- gies to increase the impact of prevention program- ming, and recommends urgent consideration of these developments such as the use of pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis. Similarly, it was recog- nised that a successful comprehensive response requires specific attention to non-hiV health needs of MSM and Tg. The meeting concluded that strategic information is essential to guide the planning, design and moni- toring of appropriate interventions, as well as the allocation of resources. Meeting participants agreed that monitoring and evaluation systems need to be built around programmes in order to provide data that will demonstrate what extent and intensity of coverage of the comprehensive package is required to promote health behaviours and reduce hiV and STi incidence. While bio-behavioural information is becoming in- creasingly available, gaps remain in the knowledge base, especially in issues relating to the changing nature of the epidemic, the impacts on affected communities, population size estimates and so- cio-cultural determinants. Further investment and harmonisation of surveillance, socio-behavioural and operational research, with the substantive 2 01 Final ConSenSuS STaTeMenT involvement of MSM and Tg or affected commu- nities, are needed. The meeting supports the recommendation of the report of the Commission on aidS in asia that com- prehensive interventions on hiV among MSM and Tg in asia and the Pacific be fully integrated and costed into national plans. Consequently, monitor- ing and evaluation processes to address the qual- ity, effectiveness and coverage of comprehensive interventions need to be conducted. The meeting recognises that an enabling environ- ment is essential for an effective and comprehen- sive response to hiV among MSM and Tg in asia and the Pacific. The meeting also agrees that the establishment of broad based partnerships, mutual recognition of roles and responsibilities, and com- mitment to rights based approaches are essential to address restrictive legal and regulatory frameworks, stigmatising and discriminatory social norms, while promoting appropriate policy development and the meaningful engagement and mobilisation of affected communities. Further, increased investment on the develop- ment of organisational and technical capacities of all partners, particularly of community based organisations, is necessary to strengthen an effec- tive response. The Regional Consensus Meeting concluded that effective action on the recommended key compo- nents of comprehensive responses can only move forward with the continued synergy of govern- ments, communities and development partners, working together towards a continuum of preven- tion, care, treatment and support for MSM and Tg in asia and the Pacific.

For example, the esti- mated hiV prevalence rate in Bangkok is 30.7%ii; Phnom Penh - 8.7%iii; Mumbai - 9.6%iv; and Beijing - 5.8%v. yet, investments in hiV programming for MSM remains limited, ranging from 0% to 4% of the total spending for hiV programming in coun- tries region-wide.vi Most other major asian cities still have a window of opportunity to avoid serious epidemics among MSM, but that opportunity will close soon unless investment and programming are put in place rapidly. in the majority of the countries in the asia-Pacific region, there is a lack of hiV interventions for MSM which comprehensively focus on prevention, treat- ment, care and support. a 2006 survey of the cover- age of hiV interventions in 15 asia-Pacific countries estimated that targeted prevention programmes reached less than 8% of MSM, far short of the 80% coverage that epidemiological models indicate is needed to turn the hiV epidemic around.vii due to the increased availability of epidemiological data on hiV among MSM in recent years, there is a better understanding of the magnitude of these epidemics, of the rapidity with which they can de- velop, and of the relative importance of male to male sexual transmission within the hiV epidem- ics in the region. in some countries this has led to increased political will to address hiV among this behavioural population. despite this, there is still no widespread consensus on what constitutes a comprehensive package of interventions for MSM and Tg, and insufficient information available on evidence-based interventions and costs. This infor- mation is critical for governments and donors to assist them to develop, implement and scale-up hiV programmes for MSM and Tg. on 7-9 May 2008, aSean, undP and aPn+ co-or- ganised the aSean Regional Consultation Plan of action for greater involvement and empowerment of People living with hiV in Vientiane, lao PdR. in this regional consultation, a suggestion was made to convene a further regional consultation to address hiV among MSM and Tg in the region. in line with this recommendation, the aSean Sec- retariat recognised the urgent need to work with member states, the un system, donors, civil society and government partners throughout the asia-Pa- cific region to scale-up access to comprehensive ser- vices for MSM and Tg, and in general, recommend advocacy for changing or amending restrictive legal and social environments. They also recognised re- source mobilisation, synthesis of data collection and analysis, and strengthening the capacity of health care works and key priorities. in recent years, several initiatives have begun to support countries address hiV issues among MSM and Tg in the greater Mekong Subregion (gMS). in 2004, the uS government (uSaid and uS CdC), along with Family health international (Fhi), Background on World aidS day 2008, un Secretary-general, Ban ki Moon stated there is a critical need to protect human rights and attain access for all to hiV prevention, treatment, care and support. he called on countries to remove laws that discriminate against people living with hiV, women and marginalised groups, including MSM. Countries are also urged to realise the many commitments they made to protect human rights in the declaration of Commitment on hiV/aidS (2001) and the Political dec- laration on hiV/aidS (2006). 4 02 inTRoduCTion uneSCo and others organised two consultation meetings of government and MSM community rep- resentatives and technical experts that produced six country action plans built around the concept of a comprehensive package of services (labelled a \u2019conceptual framework\u2018 and a \u2019minimum package of services\u2018 at that time). in 2008, the uSaid/health Policy initiative, greater Mekong and China (hPi/gMR-C), in partnership with Burnet institute, undertook a survey to map donor expenditure for hiV prevention programmes for MSM in the gMS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6f72862-7f1b-4d2f-9a3f-7a40483d4294": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6f72862-7f1b-4d2f-9a3f-7a40483d4294", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Developing a Comprehensive Package of Services to Reduce HIV among Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) and Transgender (TG) Populations in Asia and the Pacific - Regional Consensus Meeting Report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33858236069dec261d5114738d695d3bcea0a1e063f7306dab85261e2d747f3f"}, "2": {"node_id": "97fb61a8-fba4-45f1-a4f3-3b85f1dd02dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/developing-comprehensive-package-services-reduce-hiv-among-men-who-have-sex-men-msm-and-transgender-tg-populations-asia-and", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29d8a1843ee4870fce9f4984c5ac7eb5277e84fb992748786a981d9f146cdaeb"}}, "hash": "4a107a360f48cf4c0a5543c2a3b6516c5ecee42a04e4e7431fccd2639435c608", "text": "The survey found that although aid agencies, international ngos, the un system and donors are very supportive of interventions targeting MSM in principle, uSaid was the only aid agency making significant funding contribu- tions throughout the gMS,viii The survey also found that some countries in the region had started to implement hiV programming among MSM through gFaTM grants. in 2009, uSaid/hPi, in partnership with aPCoM and undP is supporting two complementary projects in the region to advocate and assist national gov- ernments to prioritise the response to hiV among MSM and Tg populations.

The Foundation for aidS Research (amfaR) has been supporting community- based responses to MSM and hiV in asia and the Pacific since late 2007 through a small grants programme and ca- pacity-building assistance.
