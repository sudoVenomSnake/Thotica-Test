The councils\u2019 effectiveness was demonstrated, for example, when women in one village became aware that the village head had received the substantial tsunami funds he claimed had never been delivered. The women\u2019s council then challenged the village head\u2019s legitimacy, ensuring a more accountable and transparent recovery. \u2018We Can Definitely Apply This Elsewhere\u2019 Overall, a key lesson arising from the tsunami has been that deploying disaster management resources is much more effective when flexible funding modalities can be put in place but where the key national agency is able to remain aloof from the fiduciary responsibilities for donor funds. This promotes trust between donors and the national government. The high level of donor trust which BRR enjoyed was earned as much by the arms-length funding arrangements it endorsed a by its many breakthroughs in terms of concept (accountability to beneficiaries as well as donors), standards (RAND, HGD), and scale (inclusion of all parties in a project already unprecedented in scale) and institutional arrangements such as its Anti Corruption Unit. By setting high standards from the start, BRR and the Indonesian Government demonstrated to the world its capacity in tackling corruption. The local government, which continues Aceh and Nias reconstruction after the end of BRR\u2019s mission in April 2009, deems the RAND a particularly important tool. Already, RAND has benefited more than 2,600 villages with its blend of easy data mining, multiple analytical perspectives and a sound basis for planning and evaluation. The system is extremely replicable, says Pak Kuntoro: \u201cBRR has proven the critics wrong. Public cynicism about bureaucratic integrity and defeatism about bureaucratic reform are self-defeating. We went beyond enforcement to get to the root of the problems by reforming our systems. Even in a disaster situation, we should fight not accept corruption.\u201d Moreover, says Pak Kuntoro, \u201cWhat can be achieved in a disaster can surely be done in normal circumstances. We can definitely apply these breakthroughs elsewhere. The President wanted us to prove that reform was possible. With his backing we did so.

Many still wonder, what if it happens again? How will we survive? \u201cIn the old days, people felt like disasters were far from them,\u201d states Atiwan Kunaphinun, IFRC Disaster Management Programme Officer in Thailand. \u201cAfter the tsunami, they realised the impact of what happened, and they feel like it is much closer to real life.\u201d Not long ago, disasters were viewed as isolated events and were responded to without taking into account the social and economic factors that aggravate the situation. The sheer scale of the tsunami, however, inevitably made such a narrow understanding of disasters difficult to sustain. Instead, the tsunami drew attention to the importance and urgency of reducing the enabling causes of disaster. By looking at the range of those factors and processes that ultimately transform containable emergencies into outright disasters, the priorities of disaster policy have increasingly come to encompass innovative ways of reducing the vulnerability of people and communities in disaster prone areas. By increasing their ability to manage risks and by recognising that complex social relationships and structures determine why certain groups are more vulnerable, Disaster Risk Reduction has taken critical strides in preparing communities and countries for the worst possible scenario. For example, ensuring sound infrastructure by focusing on long-term economic development is as important as remedying the shortcomings of preparedness systems. Better planning and investment decisions, not to mention better construction, can save both lives and property. Even smaller disasters \u2013 such as post-tsunami earthquakes or flooding \u2013 can keep poor, marginalised communities trapped in poverty and underdevelopment, making them much more vulnerable to disasters than other communities. \u201cHumanitarian aid needs to invest more in prevention and go beyond food, medicine and immediate needs,\u201d observes the United Nations\u2019 International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR). \u201cDonors need to think about the longer term and include prevention in aid packages. We are trapped in a reactive, rather than proactive, development trajectory. We can no longer afford to rebuild buildings which will collapse again in the face of a similar disaster.\u201d Governments around the region are taking the advice to \u201cbe proactive\u201d to heart \u2013 especially since the reminders of the high levels of risk in Southeast and South Asia are stark. In all, the region is now much better prepared than before, with new disaster preparedness structures established in four out of the five tsunami-affected countries. It is also using lessons from the tsunami response to prepare for a wide range of other, far more frequent natural disasters because, as United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared to the UN General Assembly in 2007: \u201cThe intensity of floods, droughts and extreme weather, perhaps made worse by climate change, have brought pain and suffering to many millions.\u201d 74 Stronger Early Warning Systems Important progress has been made in developing early tsunami warning capacities. Following intensive efforts by 29 governments around the Indian Ocean, a regional tsunami early warning system has been operational since 2006 as part of a coordination plan by UNESCO-Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. All this represents an important complement to the stronger global commitment pledged by 168 governments to reduce multi-hazard risks and vulnerabilities under the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. Through the Deep-Ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) system, 24 buoys have been placed in the Indian Ocean to warn countries in the region. The DART system monitors seismic activity on the sea floor, signalling buoys on the surface. The buoys then use satellite communications to pass on information to tsunami warning centres. In an earthquake, DART is designed to detect whether a tsunami will occur and pinpoint its height, location and time of landfall. Linked to this regional system will be a new warning system in Indonesia. Launched in November 2008 with technical support from Germany, the United States, Japan and France, among others, the system was hailed by the United Nations Secretary-General as \u201ca major step forward for countless people in the region.\u201d Technical advice by the UN and its partners, including the International Tsunami Information Centre, is enabling the Indonesian national warning centre to develop procedures which will allow it to issue warnings within 5 minutes of detecting an earthquake. In India, meanwhile, \u201clast-mile\u201d connectivity implemented in Tamil Nadu is being replicated in other vulnerable coastal locations including Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry. Thailand in particular has been a leader in numerous disaster risk management initiatives, and its early warning system is well-positioned to become a regional role model.

This allowed as well as necessitated investment in disaster risk management. The country, like India, did not appeal for international financial assistance \u2013 although it welcomed technical assistance from organizations such as the United Nations and IFRC \u2013 and in fact itself became a donor to other affected nations. Through ASEAN, the Thai Government swiftly proposed a regional tsunami early warning centre that would coordinate with various nations\u2019 early warning systems to ensure complementarity. It established a Voluntary Trust Fund and donated US$10 million in seed money to it; additional funding came from donors such as Sweden. Thailand\u2019s own disaster management system was deeply rooted in a civil defence tradition, National Disaster Warning Centre, responsible for detecting earthquakes, assessing the possibility of a tsunami Inter-agency coordination system in an emergency situation in Thailand incorporating traditionally response-oriented structures. After the tsunami, the government established the 74 75 and issuing public warnings through 42 communications systems, 280 radio stations and SMS messages to 20 million mobile phones. In addition, the early warning system is taken to the local level, linked with loudspeakers in rural villages and with more than 100 warning towers along the coast. The Royal Thai Navy also operates sea-level gauges as part of the overall DART system, allowing in-country analysis of sea level changes immediately after an earthquake and empowering the government to make critical tsunami warning decisions independent of external inputs. Likewise, the Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation (DDPM), under the Ministry of Interior, initiated the development of a comprehensive disaster database as a national clearinghouse of information. Combining previous databases that could not be used together because each employed different software, the new system is based on a \u201cone- stop map server\u201d \u2013 including high-resolution satellite images, aerial photographs and base infrastructure maps \u2013 and is supported by the Thailand International Cooperation Agency, UNDP and IFRC. At the same time, capacity to reach remote areas inside the country remains less developed. A significant number of people in Thailand \u2013 up to 10 percent49 \u2013 still live outside of communications loops or may lack resources to prepare adequately. Further strengthening is also required to coordinate nationwide multi-hazard monitoring and warning, offsetting a residual undercurrent of ambiguity over roles. Support from numerous international organisations is helping to clarify these roles, and the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act, enacted in November 2007, sets up a high-level system of command for disasters. In India, the tsunami galvanized and re-energized the national dialogue on disaster management, ultimately resulting in a Disaster Management Act (DMA). DMA now provides an institutional mechanism for drawing up and monitoring the implementation of disaster management plans, ensuring measures by various wings of government for prevention and mitigating effects of disasters and for undertaking a coordinated and prompt response to any disaster situation. Critically, a National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was created alongside the DMA, and was given the mandate to lay down policies, plans and guidelines for disaster management all across the country. As elsewhere, this reform process in India was guided by the realisation that previous disaster management routines would not be sufficient, reactive and relief centric as they were. The creation of a broader, more holistic, disaster management system therefore represented a significant paradigm, heralding a move towards integrated approaches and an emphasis on pre-disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness. In addition to implementing key disaster policies and plans, NDMA is also responsible for guiding the functioning of the National Institute for Disaster Management, the entity created specifically to build national capacity in the area of disaster mitigation and response. A recent high profile initiative is a programme to educate engineers and architects in earthquake risk management including seismic-safe construction. The aim is to train 20,000 professionals by 2010.$ Thai students participate in evacuation drill 75 76 Fully Involving Communities However, preparedness is not just about high-tech early warning systems.

Still, expanding women\u2019s traditional roles in emergency preparedness is an ongoing project under way in several countries because of post-tsunami organising by women\u2019s groups. Thai women, among others, are well-placed to participate in risk assessments and the promotion of disaster risk reduction, ensuring consideration of specific concerns such as physical strength, security and protection. \u201cThe tsunami destroyed so much, but we have been able to get up, pick up the pieces and learn new skills,\u201d says Wilairat Hadden, a woman from Ban Koh Muk. \u201cAs mothers, we always think about our children\u2019s futures. We can now prepare them for these challenges in life. If another wave comes, they should be ready.\u201d50 Even before the tsunami, large community-based disaster risk management programmes existed in vulnerable areas in countries such as India \u2013 where they have been credited for capacity strengthening in search and rescue, first aid and evacuation methods that resulted in saving countless lives during the disaster as well as minimising damage to assets and livelihoods. Post-tsunami, excellent opportunities have been presented for deepening community disaster risk management across the region, setting up local and national partnerships. In Thailand, community-based disaster risk management projects also started before the tsunami, but were Workshops are held in India to ensure gender-sensitive Disaster Risk Management 76 77 focused primarily on floods and landslides. These early attempts reached the tambon (sub-district) level, and it was recognised that additional training was needed to incorporate a multi-hazard approach.51 After the tsunami, these efforts were intensified and included training of provincial officials in crisis management and needs analysis. Custom-made training was also provided to DDPM, local authorities and the Thai Red Cross so that they could better support community-based efforts.52 Involvement of NGOs and the private sector, including the Coca-Cola Company as well as hotels and businesses connected to the tourism industry, has been critical. The National Disaster Warning Centre promoted the use of locally designed work plans for disaster preparedness and response, with UNDP support. The most effective work plans were selected from 24 villages and schools to demonstrate practical community techniques, for possible scaling up. Communities were extremely vocal in discussing their own disaster preparedness, says H\u00e5kan Bj\u00f6rkman, currently UNDP Country Director in Indonesia and former Deputy Resident Representative in Thailand during the tsunami. In Ban Nam Khem, a small town destroyed by the tsunami, \u201cpeople were looking at proposed evacuation routes and advising, \u2018We can\u2019t run across this field, we can\u2019t jump over this fence.\u2019 Focus groups were formed and culminated in public meetings \u2013 it was very important for people to trust these plans.\u201d Training of a number of community leaders, teachers, local disaster managers and media personnel has demonstrated the use of response techniques. In particular, some 600 teachers at 415 schools in tsunami-prone areas participated in an interactive workshop on multi-hazard disaster preparedness. This is being expanded into other high-risk areas, with the aim of reaching 30,000 schools and involving provincial, district and local officials. In at-risk provinces, schools also were invited to propose activities to be undertaken at the initiative of students. In addition, opportunities for including disaster risk reduction in the school curricula have been explored, and annual evacuation exercises in model schools and tsunami-affected coastal communities have particularly been featured. Community vulnerability mapping is also expanding in Thailand. Ideally, this includes social, economic and environmental factors as well as the perception of risks, community concerns and coping strategies, which often Taking DRM Seriously: Lessons from Madagascar and Tanzania Although the epicentre of the earthquake that caused the tsunami in 2004 was in the Indian ocean close to Indonesia, the tsunami reached the eastern coast of Africa.

Nonetheless the damage sustained served as a stark awakening for the Tanzanian government to the real threat that natural disasters pose to the country\u2019s hard won development gains. Tanzania was among eight \u2018non-epicentre\u2019 countries included in a study by the United Nations/ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) which underscored both a lack of political commitment to and poor public awareness of disaster risk mitigation. Responding to these findings and in line with recommendations set out in the Hyogo framework, the Tanzanian government proactively worked to formulate institutional policies and legislative frameworks for disaster risk reduction. These included new initiatives to train primary school teachers and mainstream disaster risk reduction knowledge into school curricula, with a view to develop a culture of safety and resilience at the community level. Box 5.1 77 78 vary between women and men. Often, the only way to collect vulnerability data is to go from village to village and conduct gender-inclusive participatory research. Under a grant from USAID, the Disaster Tracking and Recording Assessment Centre is researching tsunami-affected areas to identify gaps in the \u201clast mile,\u201d highlighting vulnerable people who live outside the early warning system. Healthy coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, estuaries, wetlands and sandy beaches, protect against the force of tsunamis and storm surges and contribute to disaster risk reduction while providing diverse livelihoods, sufficient nutritious food, shelter and access to goods for communities. In parts of Thailand and elsewhere, for example, the impact of the tsunami varied with the profile of the beaches and the angle of the waves, a result of the natural defences\u2019 value. The affected area is home to some of the world\u2019s most diverse coral reef ecosystems, some of which experienced damage of up to 80 percent. Sea grass beds, an important food source for many threatened animals, also were affected. In good news, however, scientists are reporting a rapid recovery for some coral reefs damaged by the tsunami; it had previously been feared that reefs off Indonesia, for example, could take a decade to recover. Several organisations and programmes, such as Mangroves for the Future, now focus on the humanitarian implications of failure to protect coastal ecosystems (see Box 5.2). But while most people are aware of the importance of resource-based industries such as ecotourism and fisheries to coastal economies, there is less comprehension of just how important these goods and raw materials are in terms of their multiplier effects nationally and locally. In southern Thailand, for example, traditional use of mangrove products is thought to generate products worth almost a quarter of per-capita GDP among coastal villages. \u201cA key concept for Mangroves for the Future is community resilience,\u201d says Don Macintosh, MFF Programme Coordinator. \u201cThis is not just the ability to survive a disaster, but the ability to provide for the community\u2019s daily existence \u2013 fishing, firewood and everything else. Human populations in coastal areas need to be able to adapt to changes that are coming, and this will require building both the resilience of communities themselves, An evacuation drill in Thailand stresses on the skills and knowledge needed in the event of an emergency 78 79 and of the ecosystems and natural resources upon which they depend.\u201d A \u2018Road Map\u2019 to Reduce Disaster Risk Since the tsunami, Sri Lanka likewise has come a long way in establishing disaster management-related systems. The Government developed a \u201croad map\u201d identifying more than 100 investments to reduce disaster risk, totalling US$600 million over 10 years. The road map is organised around seven themes: (1) policy, institutional mandates and institutional development; (2) hazard vulnerability and risk assessment; (3) tsunami and multi- hazard early warning system; (4) preparedness and response plans; (5) mitigation and integration of disaster risk reduction into development planning; (6) community-based disaster risk management; and (7) public awareness, education and training. Thus, it aims to provide an overall framework for disaster risk management and attempts to unify efforts at national, provincial, district and local levels, classifying projects as short-, medium- and long-term priorities.

In addition, the Disaster Management Act that had been under discussion for about a decade was passed in May 2005.

Six months after passage of the Act, disaster management was elevated to the ministerial Mangroves for the Future When former UN Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery Bill Clinton planted a mangrove tree in Phuket, Thailand, for the second anniversary of the tsunami, it began a unique partnership to promote investment in coastal ecosystems and ensure sustainable use of resources. Envisioning a healthier, more prosperous and secure future for Indian Ocean communities, Mangroves for the Future (MFF) is the product of the tsunami\u2019s dramatic illustration of the vulnerability of coastal zones deprived of natural buffers such as mangroves or coral reefs. MFF offers an opportunity to merge the world of development with the world of conservation \u2013 and to show that investment in ecosystems can generate tangible benefits to people and their livelihoods, in a context of more than 400 regional disasters annually. Yet not only natural hazards such as the tsunami threaten \u2013 over-fishing, marine pollution and coastal erosion also call for an urgent response. MFF works in the six tsunami-affected countries of India, Indonesia, Maldives, Seychelles, Sri Lanka and Thailand and looks to promote an ocean-wide approach to coastal zone management with Bangladesh, Kenya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Tanzania and Viet Nam. The organisation focuses on building knowledge, empowerment, and enhancing governance. In Thailand\u2019s Ranong and Phang Nga provinces, as well as in Sri Lanka, MFF is applying a \u201creef to ridge\u201d approach to rehabilitate and conserve critically degraded ecosystems. Under a project funded by the German Federal Government (BMZ), it is demonstrating a number of simple but powerful tools fundamental to the future of ecosystems conservation. These include gathering information on communities\u2019 physical and socioeconomic assets; analyzing land-based activities that affect coastal ecosystems, such as the encroachment of rubber and palm oil plantations; combining scientific and local knowledge; and enhancing community management and monitoring capabilities. Direct support is provided to environmentally sustainable livelihoods that promote low-impact, high-benefit microenterprise growth. MFF brings together six international agencies, including the co- chairs International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and UNDP, the United Nations Environment Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, CARE, and Wetlands International, along with donors such as the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) and the Governments of Germany and Norway.

Says Hon. Minister Abdulla Shahid, the Maldives\u2019 State Minister for Housing, Transportation and Environment: \u201cIf we had known about this risk and prepared for it, many lives could have been saved and the damage to our economy minimised.\u201d With this in mind, the Government of Maldives, supported by UNDP and IFRC, established a disaster risk management programme after the 2004 tsunami to minimize the impact of future disasters. Disaster risk management is being incorporated into development, governance and day-to-day life, encouraging preparedness and management at all levels. For effective risk management, it is important to assess specific hazards historically faced by people in a certain area; to understand the capacities and vulnerabilities of different groups; and to recognise national and local institutional capacities and gaps. Maldives\u2019 first disaster risk profile, created after the tsunami and based on Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, answers these questions and is an innovative approach to disaster management. In partnership with RMSI, an Indian company that specialises in geospatial solutions and risk modelling, and with SEEDS, an Indian non-profit organisation working to make vulnerable communities more resilient to disasters, UNDP supported a countrywide study of 1,037 islands, including 200 inhabited islands. The probability of hazards was based on geological evidence, historical data and projections derived from theoretical analysis. Hazards considered included tsunamis, earthquakes, flood, climate change and storm (wind, extreme rainfall and storm surges). Individual islands then were assigned rankings for physical as well as social vulnerability, to facilitate better planning and judicious use of resources for development. The final product was a matrix with each island\u2019s name and a risk score of 1 to 5 for each hazard, as well as all hazards together. Community preparedness plans also were supported in nearly 40 islands, as well as in tourist resort islands. A safe haven - Dhuvaafaru island is an uninhabited island in the Maldives that the IFRC is developing from the ground up for an entire community of tsunami displaced people. 81 82 \u201cIn retrospect, it is apparent that there was an acute need for a comprehensive examination of where the risks from multiple hazards are concentrated in Maldives, and also who are most affected by them,\u201d says Patrice Coeur-Bizot, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Maldives. The disaster risk profile describes the risk scenario for Maldives as moderate overall, because of the low probability of hazards occurring \u2013 it was estimated that the huge tsunami that struck in 2004 would not occur again for more than two centuries \u2013 but a high vulnerability arising from geographical, topographical and socioeconomic factors in the islands. Significantly, the government has used the report as a key input for development strategies to mitigate climate change and future disasters, particularly in developing a \u201cSafer Islands\u201d programme.

Ensuring Sustainability While mainstreaming disaster risk management into development instruments is critical to achieving development aims without generating new risks, mainstreaming sensitivity to gender concerns also is essential, given that women and girls are especially at risk in disasters and equally powerful agents of change for disaster resilience. In particular, the Gender Exit Strategy developed by BRR in Indonesia identifies specific strategies for maintaining a focus on gender equality in future risk reduction efforts. Sustainability of all these efforts remains a major issue, however, given that natural disasters put development gains at risk, even as development choices can pave the way for unequal distributions of risk. As noted in the 2008 joint follow-up evaluation of the Tsunami Evaluation Coalition\u2019s Study on Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development, one way that risk reduction is being sustained in all tsunami-affected countries is through institutions created for this purpose, such as the long-awaited Disaster Management Act in Sri Lanka and the country\u2019s 10-year \u201croad map.\u201d Still, much remains to be done, and the significance of contemporary decision-making for disaster risks that may be experienced by future generations cannot be underestimated. \u201cThere have been a lot of unsustainable efforts,\u201d concedes UNDP\u2019s H\u00e5kan Bj\u00f6rkman. \u201cSometimes there have been fancy tsunami drills just for show.

DRR can not be treated as a purely technical undertaking; in vulnerable communities it should be a core feature of all programming. \u2666 Empower community groups to build resilience and protect themselves from disasters by building on local knowledge and strengthening capacity. \u2666 Value indigenous knowledge and technologies for early warning and mainstream gender in all risk communication strategies. \u2666 Commit more firmly to women\u2019s and men\u2019s right to know, raising awareness, enabling people to make informed decisions and strengthening capacities to advocate. \u2666 Build accessible and easy-to-use disaster information management system from cost-effective, sustainable open-source software so that all parties can work together and easily access data. Having a common baseline by which to judge both challenges and gains \u2013 and having common tools to access these \u2013 is critical for efficient policy making. \u2666 Improve \u201clast-mile connectivity\u201d. No matter how impressive the technology, early warning systems will not deliver as promised unless they reach out to the totality of the population, even those living without phones and in isolated areas. \u2666 Encourage and ensure community participation in the implementation of disaster risk management policy through extensive consultations \u2666 Enact robust disaster response legislation, incorporating learnings from the tsunami experience. Future DRR regimes \u2013 from the national down to the local level \u2013 need to be informed by multi-hazard understanding of disasters, and be equipped to respond accordingly. \u2666 Build on the momentum created by the tsunami to create early warning systems across the Indian Ocean rim. In as much as possible, foster inter- regional and cross-border information sharing between national and regional systems. 83 Box 5.4 85 T he tsunami tragedy, generated by the profoundly indifferent forces of the Earth\u2019s surface, was burned into the world\u2019s collective memory. But if another tsunami happened tomorrow, would the response from governments and the international community be stronger and better? Can we multiply our successes, learn from our shortfalls and apply this in the future for both emergency relief and longer-term recovery? \u201cEven nearly five years after the tsunami, public scrutiny is still high in terms of people wanting to know that their individual financial support or investments made by their government have been worthwhile,\u201d says Bob McKerrow, head of the IFRC delegation in Indonesia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "319b96e2-6080-497d-83b9-7ff0fc786b1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "319b96e2-6080-497d-83b9-7ff0fc786b1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85e24db302dc0bd48e4b90cf6d85f7b962b24eb2b4187eafde21c6900650e559"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc7fbbd7-2da8-464d-8281-a41f18b94368", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d0e25887a89fe97de15b9c3cbbf1f2e08512700149e8e689b9a655e9042bca6"}}, "hash": "9215bf0640badc4a63094d1493c9590e0dd794f11c9d9f904bf296cc50f88236", "text": "You only know lessons have really been learned when you stop thinking about them and simply do them.

Particularly in light of the current global financial crisis, however, many of those interviewed for this report noted that the tsunami was a unique event that received unprecedented funds and global attention. \u201cNo other recovery ever had the resources that this one had, and I can guarantee that no other recovery ever will,\u201d declares Mihir Bhatt of the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute. \u201cWhatever innovations we think are replicable have to be at a low-cost level.\u201d Luckily, the most important lessons we have learned are not necessarily those that depend on the availability of large amounts of funding. Effective leadership and coordination, beginning at the grassroots and involving Governments and development organisations alike, can go a long way in ensuring an efficient and sustainable recovery. And while coordination and leadership may be more easily talked about than put into practice, they remain particularly important in a disaster context where chaos goes hand in hand with calamity. We have learned that Governments need to listen and respond to the voices of those most affected \u2013 including those normally not consulted, especially women. However, Governments cannot be alone in solving the leadership equation. The many delivery partners who make up the reconstruction community must also develop the quality and effectiveness of their leadership. NGOs must invest in top flight managers who can deliver the breakthrough initiatives required for programme success. For the sake of a measured and strategic approach to recovery, arguments dismissing management as a cost overhead can no longer be accepted. We have learned that accountability and preparedness are critical, as is a willingness to take risks and embed institutional as well as cultural reform amid disaster response. This must include serious reflection and be a continuous process through which weaknesses are overturned and strengths capitalised upon. We have also learned that despite the horrifying nature of that day of devastation in 2004, it is broader, longer- term development issues that impose the biggest constraints on the affected countries. Of the many challenges and priorities identified,, gender-sensitive recovery programmes stand out as particularly important \u2013 recovery actors need to address underlying problems, not just the issues that come to the fore following a disaster. Our most important lesson, however, is that disasters themselves should be seen as opportunities for reform and improvement. What stands out in this report is that governments in all five of the most tsunami-affected countries embraced change as a core ethic to confront this catastrophe. The importance and rewards of implementing participatory approaches and addressing social inequities even in emergency situations has become clear. Most of the reforms and new operational arrangements adopted have since been institutionalized in one form or another. The challenge now is to constantly build on and improve these new institutional arrangements. Change must be embraced, not for its own sake, but rather because in a disaster, organisational weaknesses will be severely tested and exposed. Continuous improvement is the only way to ensure all new institutional arrangements remain robust and relevant. 86 Finally, while we have divided the story of the tsunami recovery efforts into five themes in this report, we have learned that these themes do not stand alone. For example, while leadership and coordination play a vital role in effective recovery, without effective accountability, people\u2019s participation, a careful consideration of equity and investment in disaster risk mitigation, the recovery remains incomplete and does not succeed in building back better. Thus we have learned that it is not enough to focus on one aspect of recovery at the cost of others. The recovery community needs to consider and address disaster response in its entirety, rather than take sectoral approaches, hoping that all individual efforts will somehow fit together in the end. As former United Nations Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, President Bill Clinton, has declared, \u201cIn every recovery process, there will be flawed assumptions and decisions that we regret. Hopefully, there will also be innovations worth replicating and stories of progress to highlight.\u201d We have tried to highlight such innovations in this report. Perhaps the lesson we have struggled most to learn, however, is that when everyone shares the same ethical values, development goals and strategic objectives, it contributes to the effectiveness of the desired outcome \u2013 that is, to help those affected by unthinkable disaster rebuild their lives. We have learned all this, and we have changed. In the future, we are going to have to do it together and do it better. That is our persistent challenge. 86 88 ADB Asian Development Bank AIDS Acquired Immunodeficiency", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

According to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index, widely used as a guide to corruption levels by NGOs, governments and international organizations, in 2006 Indonesia ranked 143rd out of 180 countries; this was in the midst of tsunami recovery. Despite this, disbursement of committed recovery funds has remained very high, at more than 70 percent, with a further 23 percent still being implemented. The rate of transfer from pledge to implementation likewise is remarkable. 42. These include all funds channeled through the Government from sources including the Indonesian Government itself (\u201con budget, on Treasury\u201d), as well as governments of other countries, United Nations Agencies and international NGOs (\u201con budget, off Treasury\u201d). 43.

Tragedy, because the destructive power of the tsunami left countless communities without homes or livelihoods, eradicated key infrastructure in countries around the region, and irrevocably damaged large swaths of coastal area. In all, more than 228,000 people \u2013 in 14 countries \u2013 perished as a result of the disaster. Triumph, because while the disaster wreaked havoc and devastation on the coastlines along the Indian Ocean rim, it also triggered an overwhelming national and international response, delivering emergency relief and recovery assistance through multiple partners, funds and programmes. Milestone successes have been collectively achieved in supporting affected communities to restore their lives and livelihoods, and to reconstruct their houses and settlements, all with care to empower future generations to thrive. Individual citizens, national governments and international \ufb01nancial institutions around the globe contributed funds to the recovery, resulting in an estimated US$13.5 billion in aid. With an operation of such unprecedented scope, a number of useful lessons have been learned across the recovery spectrum about what worked and what did not. To take stock of these collective and country-speci\ufb01c \ufb01ndings, this report asks if those involved in this massive undertaking were able to achieve meaningful development and reform? The report takes its cue from former UN Secretary-General Ko\ufb01 Annan\u2019s words \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not enough to pick up the pieces. We must draw on every lesson we can to avoid such catastrophes in the future\u201d \u2013 and from the call of the UN Special Envoy for Tsunami Recovery, President Bill Clinton, to \u201cbuild back better.\u201d PROLOGUE Both the destruction caused by \u2013 and the response to \u2013 the tsunami were unusual in terms of scale. The unique situation warranted intensive strategic coordination for the recovery to be effective as well as considerable pressure to deliver tangible results. Closest to the epicentre, the Indonesian Province of Aceh faced one of the most complex situations with a massive loss of life, extensive destruction of infrastructure, and an extraordinary in\ufb02ux of actors. In response, a dedicated body, the Aceh-Nias Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency (BRR), was set up in April 2005, with a 4-year mandate to coordinate all recovery activities as well as implement a number of government projects. Elsewhere, in Sri Lanka, the tsunami was a catalyst for creation of the Ministry of National Disaster Management and Human Rights in 2006. The Government of Maldives moved swiftly to set up a similar structure. On the same day as the tsunami, it created a National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) to coordinate activities. This development of lead governance mechanisms for relief and recovery, tasked with coordinating ministries, donors, agencies, communities, women\u2019s groups and others, and with building national and local capacities to manage the process, turned out to be a critical breakthrough in all these countries. Carefully connecting the local body to a broader, global coordinating infrastructure \u2013 as was done in Indonesia via the Global Consortium for Tsunami Recovery, the Multi Donor Fund (MDF) and the UN Of\ufb01ce of the Recovery Coordinator for Aceh and Nias (UNORC) \u2013 was key to facilitating coordination in a complex recovery context involving countless international and national stakeholders. As new structures, void of institutional baggage, these agencies also bene\ufb01ted from the ability to be \ufb02exible and quickly adapt to local circumstances. In India, too, where no new body needed to be created, government seized on the moment by devolving signi\ufb01cant authority to local administrators, a crucial aspect to the Tamil Nadu recovery effort. A network of state- and district-level knowledge centres provided the infrastructure for disseminating vast amounts of information and reliable village-level data; it also became a focal point for NGOs on how they could contribute to recovery.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "575b4135-c42a-4947-9cfd-28f3444eb8e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "575b4135-c42a-4947-9cfd-28f3444eb8e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change \u2013 Executive Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7de9caf89a0c9db52e38b1274b09006e86a440d5d2234511dbbbea100a7201c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f4ebf6d-e9a1-471f-ba69-27d5c5b64fcc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f041bc35371e341f0f7a96363bb5211bee85c5894665e9391df1e2a352cc3ba7"}}, "hash": "139e97f69a8ea7828de6088efc1364f64ec429be16f0a256519a36e83c3b58f1", "text": "The key to coordinating recovery here and elsewhere was maintaining speedy, \ufb02exible and accountable coordination systems and procedures, including at the local level.

Signi\ufb01cantly, BRR Headquarters was located in the capital of Aceh, and not in Jakarta. Flexibility and know-how, coupled with a culture of risk-taking, was a central aspect of BRR\u2019s success and led to several important breakthroughs and innovations. These included the Tim Terpadu (a one stop shop for processing all visa, customs, tax and other clearance requirements for thousands of aid workers and equipment) and a mandatory Project Concept Note (PCN) format for all programmes, which helped avoid unnecessary duplication and ensured ef\ufb01cient use of funds. 1\u201cWho Stops to Think?\u201d The Challenges of Leadership and Coordination Similarly, when Maldives faced a shortfall of nearly US$100 million in recovery funds, a number of innovative partnership strategies were implemented to secure additional funding. The unique \u201cAdopt-An-Island\u201d initiative implemented by UNDP, emerged as a particularly powerful marketing tool under which donor support could be matched directly to a speci\ufb01c project. By mid-2006, 44 percent of the US$41 million that UNDP had raised was mobilised through Adopt-An-Island. In both cases the willingness to be opportunistic and take risks with \u201cbreakthrough initiatives\u201d accelerated recovery and facilitated \u2018building back better\u2019. In the \ufb01nal analysis, however, lack of local capacity has remained an issue, throughout. In the Maldives, the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) was set up to coordinate activities in a similar vein to BRR. But while the Centre took the lead in many aspects, being new to disaster management it relied on outside help to a signi\ufb01cant degree. And in the future, it must be remembered that building local capacity is an important priority if the purpose- built recovery agency is temporary and the local Government is expected to sustain the gains in the long term. Saying Yes to Change \u2666 Develop in advance a governance mechanism for relief and recovery, tasked with coordinating Ministries, donors, agencies and communities. \u2666 Give coordination structures full authority to make decisions over all aspects of the programme and, where practical or necessary, base them close to the action. As the bodies overseeing and managing the recovery, they need to become intimately familiar with \u2013 and responsive to \u2013 the local context. \u2666 Seek \u201cbreakthrough initiatives\u201d to accelerate recovery and build back better and avoid a culture of risk aversion. Business as usual will not suf\ufb01ce in unusual situations. \u2666 Appoint credible senior of\ufb01cials who have good knowledge of local conditions and are familiar with affected communities, with a willingness to consult widely and the communication skills to explain the rationale for major decisions. \u2666 Maintain speedy, \ufb02exible and accountable coordination systems and procedures, including at local level, that provide incentive to act. The demands of complex recovery require multi-sectoral expertise and the ability to adapt to changing needs. \u2666 Undertake in-depth and continuous sectoral stocktaking; collect and collate all relevant documents, studies and data for wider circulation. \u2666 Integrate monitoring and evaluation for all sectors to determine what has been implemented and what the future should be, engaging women\u2019s and community groups in the process. \u2666 Build national and local capacity at every turn. Local government and communities need to be prepared to take over responsibilities, resources and assets \u2013 and maintain them. The sustainability of the recovery depends on it. \u2666 Ensure a visible and responsive presence of government and coordination bodies in the \ufb01eld. Daring to devolve and decentralise coordination will help promote responsiveness and grassroots involvement. \u2666 Foster strong global and regional support mechanisms.

As recovery actors in all \ufb01ve locales quickly realised, there could be no more business-as-usual when dealing with a disaster of such unusual proportions. Responding to the initial exclusion, they were quick to catch up in innovative ways, many employing a human rights perspective to create an enabling environment for participation. In India, the State Government\u2019s timeliness, responsiveness and openness to working with representatives of different social groups in addressing \ufb02aws stands out as particularly praiseworthy. Authorities in Tamil Nadu did not simply respond to practical needs but offered real opportunities for change, through several key steps. Breakthroughs in India included the implementation of disaster-resistant construction and the institution of inexpensive, 10-year housing insurance against all forms of disasters. Houses were built for indirectly affected families who were also given housing assistance and rights to land ownership. Women bene\ufb01ted from opportunities for strategic change in their status, such as joint housing rights for spouses and funds for the education and resettlement of orphaned adolescent girls and unmarried women, amongst other initiatives. Across the waters, in Sri Lanka, strong emphasis was placed on equity and the targeting of vulnerable groups after the tsunami, especially with regard to permanent housing, road building and highlighting of issues such as human rights, participation and the environment. Along these lines, a number of successful \u2013 and \ufb02exible \u2013 interventions were initiated, with many partners coming to see the importance of addressing con\ufb02ict and post-con\ufb02ict issues in the post-tsunami setting as a consequence. For example, the Government resettled the con\ufb02ict-affected in permanent housing under its Uni\ufb01ed Assistance Scheme or had their houses upgraded. Hallmarks of the scheme included clear eligibility criteria, management at local and provincial levels, and signi\ufb01cant community involvement. For equity gains to be sustained it was necessary to anchor innovative practices in the institutional infrastructure of the recovery \u2013 good intentions can only do so much if systems are not in place to track and identify vulnerable groups. Rather than a piecemeal approach, then, countries succeeded best when there was a commitment from high-level managers to ensure equity. In India, a series of independent equity audits were carried out in 2005 and 2006, at the request of local and international NGOs, by the Social Equity Audit Secretariat and trained auditors. The success of the audits is re\ufb02ected in the fact that amongst some NGOs, the percentage of budget that went to directly support interventions for the excluded rose from 10 or 12 percent to 60 percent. Building on women\u2019s grassroots activism, recovery actors in Indonesia, among other things, sought to ensure that gender issues were considered in all development sectors through a special unit that formulated a comprehensive gender policy. UNIFEM placed a gender advisor in BRR to provide sustained input and guidance and BRR also employed gender-speci\ufb01c data for monitoring and evaluation, developed practical checklists for use in health, housing, education, livelihoods and institutional change, and promoted active participation of tsunami-affected women in plans for their future. Successes in India and Indonesia underscore the importance of developing institutional anti-discrimination capacity by reviewing organisational culture and offering training to staff on rights-based approaches, including awareness and understanding of gender-sensitive international codes, guidelines and principles. Depending on the context, this was not always an easy goal to achieve across the board. In Sri Lanka and Aceh, both regions affected by con\ufb02ict, there was a need to also address the victims of con\ufb02ict as well as those of the tsunami. However, most post-tsunami organisations largely ignored the post-con\ufb02ict context, in part due to donor- stipulated restrictions on how they could use their funds. This led to numerous grievances raised by con\ufb02ict- affected communities and perceptions of rising inequalities in aid provision. If con\ufb02ict sensitivity had been more widespread and funds not restricted to tsunami victims only, building back better could have been more equitable all along. The provision of \u201duntied\u201d donor funds that offer \ufb02exibility to modify assistance packages to suit local needs would have enabled more \ufb02exibility to address these issues in a straightforward manner.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c375ad0-1f50-49e2-b0a5-455cd08aa871": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c375ad0-1f50-49e2-b0a5-455cd08aa871", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change \u2013 Executive Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92d9cb2ad31506e77265ce53691c91bb871a6d2604a3020e9a979f0fddf4fc4c"}, "2": {"node_id": "b66bf1cd-f97b-4f46-ab13-139ae0bd6bb4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86975bab00e34042aa490db16561cf207ba29f8f97723f3259e3ce9a854991b1"}}, "hash": "bc3b925f6b7c4545b2d94e33b9c4713447f36ec4eea2cc3a3a0846089727bb1d", "text": "Saying Yes to Change \u2666 Ensure a human rights perspective and provide an enabling environment for participation of different players in decision-making processes, with emphasis on directly affected women and men. \u2666 Build capacity to \u2013 and provide opportunities to \u2013 demand rights or make claims on the humanitarian system and authorities through a strong platform for community feedback. \u2666 Seek to extend equity through practical reform such as joint land titling. \u2666 Ensure that policies and programmes are based", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a42a992-e495-48b6-a866-8b23e0d5f29d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a42a992-e495-48b6-a866-8b23e0d5f29d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change \u2013 Executive Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "671c7f5e085507d8ffaa223f841fe5655ff577f3a33d5051655f732e0dae0df1"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4f5b703-a69c-4adf-8470-2d7c9c0230b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1af656a3b99721a175c5d8b3422dcf02a66fe05798b2ffd37c02aa61568d1764"}}, "hash": "f1afb253ed4d9ac2ea1569f708eb54b88c1b60e20ca7c7756854f4cf86e05c33", "text": "on solid and detailed assessments.

Concerted efforts were made in all countries affected by the disaster, however, to curb this initial trend. Perhaps the most valuable bene\ufb01t of promoting participation was something that, in the end, is not easily quanti\ufb01able: a feeling of individual empowerment, of \u201cownership\u201d of community resources, and the unleashing of people\u2019s own capacities to cope. Efforts to overcome the lack of consultation were particularly successful in Sri Lanka, Maldives and Thailand, where recovery actors employed participation by both women and men, through extensive people\u2019s consultations, bene\ufb01ciary surveys, Help Desks and community monitoring of projects. The Government of Sri Lanka empowered the national Human Rights Commission to conduct people\u2019s consultations in more than 1,100 tsunami-affected communities in 13 districts. Although it was not always easy to ensure community participation, in cases where participation was enforced, projects were more successful. As a result of the thousands of complaints received during the people\u2019s consultations, United Nations could provide support to the Human Rights Commission in establishing Help Desks in each district to raise awareness among communities on their rights and entitlements and to follow up on grievances. In the Maldivian context, community consultations had rarely occurred before to the extent instituted after the tsunami. Bene\ufb01ciary surveys deepened knowledge of important qualitative dimensions of recovery, increasing accountability to affected communities, and were hailed as \u201cone of the most signi\ufb01cant innovations of the tsunami response.\u201d Thailand, too, made it a priority to give communities a strong voice. Local authorities took the lead in many reconstruction efforts and were supported to improve community consultation, including training to strengthen women\u2019s leadership and decision making. One of the most successful such initiatives was the restoration of indigenous livelihoods in Koh Lanta, an island district of 30,000 in Krabi province. Taking into account the traditional livelihoods of the many ethnic groups on the island, the island was developed by community mobilisation, savings schemes, and cooperatives. Still, it was not always easy to ensure community participation, especially as some agencies and organisations sometimes tended to approach the issue with only limited enthusiasm. Many, it appears, tacked on consultations as a programmatic afterthought, and did not approach it as a key component of the project\u2019s success.

Saying Yes to Change \u2666 Regard civil society as a partner in relief and recovery, with international agencies sharing information with affected people so they can participate. \u2666 Foster participation at all stages of the recovery \u2013 in planning, implementation, and monitoring. \u2666 Conduct people\u2019s consultations as early as possible to engage marginalised groups in discussions of damages and community expectations, capacities and needs. \u2666 To manage expectations, explain progress, and outline plans, recovery partners need to draft credible and accessible communications strategies. The medium is the message: communicating to communities on their terms, in their local languages, using concepts and ideas that appeal to them, will elicit responses and promote dialogue. \u2666 Take a holistic approach, in the true sense of the term. Recovering and rebuilding affected communities should only translate into infrastructure. It also means the recapturing or strengthening of social capital and contributing to a sense of security. People who played a key constructive part in the community\u2019s structure before the disaster should be encouraged to resume their roles. \u2666 Complement housing reconstruction with overall community development projects to strengthen relationships, networks and trust. \u2666 Build capacity of existing community structures/mechanisms rather than establish new ones. \u2666 Connect participatory mechanisms to tangible results. Participation is a two-way street and for communities to truly feel like they have a stake in the process, traditional surveys and interviews will not be enough. Soliciting input and ideas from the community should not be treated as a must, but as a critical component of recovery programmes \u2666 Provide programme implementers with the tools necessary to conduct participatory planning, implementation and monitoring. Participation done wrong, risks a backlash. Recovery partners need to have skills and experience in working with communities and employing a human rights framework in post-disaster contexts. \u2666 In order to truly build back better, donors, organisations and governments need to embrace participation as key to the success. Stringent deadlines and supply-driven policy making, while satisfying reporting requirements and a home public eager for results, do not always make for measured and ef\ufb01cient programming. Taking the cue from the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, recovery partners need to internalise the need for a pragmatic approach to consultations and participation. 4 Countering Corruption and Ensuring Accountability With large amounts of cash and goods in motion, corruption is always a threat during a crisis. But despite the in\ufb02ux of billions of dollars in tsunami affected countries, corruption levels across the board were kept remarkably low. Key to this success was a commitment to view corruption, not as a nuisance or unfortunate side effect of the recovery, but as a core threat to the reconstruction effort as a whole. In Aceh, where an unprecedented US$6.4 billion were pledged for recovery, Dr. Kuntoro Mangkusubroto, the Director of BRR, urged the recovery community to set the bar high: \u201cWe see the \ufb01ght against corruption in Aceh and Nias as advancing Indonesia\u2019s wider struggle against corruption.\u201d A punitive focus on \u201c\ufb01nding corruptors\u201d would not be enough. From the \ufb01rst days of the recovery, then, steps had to be taken to ensure anti-corruption and accountability would inform all levels of operations, starting with the institutions themselves. BRR set out to pay its employees competitive salaries to ensure that the best and brightest were not \u201cpoached\u201d by international agencies \u2013 and, more importantly, to break a culture of gift-giving. To enable complete transparent access and tracking of all tsunami-related funds, BRR developed a comprehensive information management system, the Recovery Aceh-Nias Database (RAND). All agencies involved in tsunami recovery were required to register with BRR, set up an account on RAND and send regular updates on funds committed and disbursed. Complementing the process-based RAND, a \u201csurvey-based\u201d Housing Geospatial Database (HGD) was created to provide a snapshot of recovery by verifying and digitally mapping the vast housing reconstruction sector. The HGD was recently merged with a third database, covering all other assets \u2013 bridges, hospitals, schools, roads, etc. \u2013 creating a combined information system which is one of the most comprehensive and \u201cleak-proof\u201d in the recovery spectrum.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fa7bee5-0ce1-43f3-a1c7-0d170c499a06": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fa7bee5-0ce1-43f3-a1c7-0d170c499a06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change \u2013 Executive Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb63a83f752c8dd807a294c54d45c8226a4e2d7762a5158778ec5c535858853d"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae070e1b-7e55-4675-b224-3bef5a6ca905", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6a8b444c459c97913c30d654f7ea8e2556aad1b2e11ecc424e9a841f33d69d9"}}, "hash": "4fb29a2f6a67f0d22197b7e787f28d65c16b0c86f6d3e4927583a29861d158e6", "text": "As Indonesia realised, however, good systems will not deliver \u2018on their own\u2019.

Recovery data, however complex it may be, should be shared in layperson terms to the extent possible. In Sri Lanka the establishment of an effective complaint mechanism through local Help Desks (in response to input solicited in consultations) was a particular breakthrough. The public could here question eligibility for assistance, report potential cases of corruption, or \ufb01le a complaint. By October 2006, the DRMU had received 17,000 complaints and successfully resolved most. In addition, UNDP Sri Lanka set up an AidWatch initiative to enable communities to closely monitor projects.

To tackle graft and fraud, BRR became the \ufb01rst Government agency to have an autonomous Anti-Corruption Unit (SAK) set up to work with other Government institutions, international institutions like the World Bank, and civil society organizations such as Transparency International Indonesia in carrying out its primary objectives of prevention, investigation and education. Since its inception in September 2005, SAK has received 1,530 con\ufb01dential complaints. 5 What If It Happens Again? Innovations In Disaster Risk Management The tsunami has precipitated a critical shift in the minds of policy makers and communities alike. It is no longer tenable to view disasters as isolated events and respond without taking into account the social and economic factors that aggravate the situation. The tsunami drew attention to the importance and urgency of reducing the enabling causes of disaster. In all tsunami- affected countries, a newfound enthusiasm for securing the country and community against future disasters has engendered the creation of disaster preparedness institutions and policies, new regional and national early warning systems, and concerted efforts at promoting community-based disaster awareness and preparedness at every turn. Critically, new disaster preparedness structures have been established in four out of the \ufb01ve tsunami-affected countries and a regional tsunami early warning system has been operational since 2006, complementing the global commitment pledged by 168 governments to reduce multi-hazard risks and vulnerabilities under the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015. Thailand in particular has been a leader in numerous disaster risk management initiatives, and its early warning system is well-positioned to become a regional role model. Through ASEAN, the Thai Government swiftly proposed a regional tsunami early warning centre that would coordinate with various nations\u2019 early warning systems to ensure complementarity. It established a Voluntary Trust Fund and donated US$10 million in seed money to it; additional funding came from donors such as Sweden. Thailand was also quick to create a \u2018one-stop map server\u2019, combining databases that previously could not be used together into one.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "210718b5-631a-414b-b50a-d7b4ed319d68": {"__data__": {"id_": "210718b5-631a-414b-b50a-d7b4ed319d68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change \u2013 Executive Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e82b1c740a3dbf058c7266acd91171b20d97c15caefabad722eb297f9304f97c"}, "2": {"node_id": "d89e4173-9853-4aab-9655-86bbcc20ce73", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29b7f47e8c87f07ea83b500be3693821dc820eec7832bbad754a6b2c2f2a0db6"}}, "hash": "d6e7fc7ab40414418d3512aa4e6d78463f1386919869d978da4ece7e63671663", "text": "This clearing house of information includes high-resolution satellite images, aerial photographs and base infrastructure maps, all available at the touch of a button in an emergency.

The Government has used the pro\ufb01le as a key source for development strategies to mitigate climate change and future disasters, particularly in developing a \u201cSafer Islands\u201d programme, which provides incentives for voluntary migration to safer islands. Sri Lanka, too, has come a long way in establishing comprehensive disaster management-related systems. Organised around 7 key themes, a \u201croad map\u201d has been developed, identifying over 100 investments to reduce disaster risk. Under it, numerous innovative initiatives have begun toward developing a multi-hazard approach for disaster management. In addition, the Disaster Management Act that had been under discussion for about a decade prior was passed in May 2005. Following intensive efforts by 29 governments around the Indian Ocean, a regional tsunami early warning system has been operational since 2006 as part of a coordination plan by UNESCO-Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. However, preparedness is not just about high-tech early warning systems. Community participation in disaster risk mitigation is also a necessity. Women, in particular, are well-placed to participate in risk assessments and the promotion of disaster risk reduction, ensuring consideration of gender-speci\ufb01c concerns. Training of a number of community leaders, teachers, local disaster managers and media personnel has demonstrated the use of response techniques. Saying Yes to Change \u2666 Mainstream disaster risk reduction (DRR) in development policies and programmes, including gender and development initiatives. DRR can not be treated as a purely technical undertaking; in vulnerable communities it should be a core feature of all programming. \u2666 Empower community groups to build resilience and protect themselves from disasters by building on local knowledge and strengthening capacity. \u2666 Value indigenous knowledge and technologies for early warning and mainstream gender in all risk communication strategies. \u2666 Commit more \ufb01rmly to women\u2019s and men\u2019s right to know, raising awareness, enabling people to make informed decisions and strengthening capacities to advocate. \u2666 Build accessible and easy-to-use disaster information management system from cost-effective, sustainable open-source software so that all parties can work together and easily access data. Having a common baseline by which to judge both challenges and gains \u2013 and having common tools to access these \u2013 is critical for ef\ufb01cient policy making. \u2666 Improve \u201clast-mile connectivity\u201d. No matter how impressive the technology, early warning systems will not deliver as promised unless they reach out to the totality of the population, even those living without phones and in isolated areas. \u2666 Encourage and ensure community participation in the implementation of disaster risk management policy through extensive consultations \u2666 Enact robust disaster response legislation, incorporating learnings from the tsunami experience. Future DRR regimes \u2013 from the national down to the local level \u2013 need to be informed by multi- hazard understanding of disasters, and be equipped to respond accordingly. \u2666 Build on the momentum created by the tsunami to create early warning systems across the Indian Ocean rim. In as much as possible, foster inter-regional and cross-border information sharing between national and regional systems. \u2666 Continue using the Hyogo framework as the baseline for regional and global disaster risk reduction policy Even before the tsunami, large community-based disaster risk management programmes existed in vulnerable areas in countries such as India \u2013 where they have been credited for capacity strengthening in search and rescue, \ufb01rst and evacuation methods that resulted in saving countless lives during the disaster as well as minimizing damages to assets and livelihoods. Post-tsunami, excellent opportunities have been presented for deepening community disaster risk management across the region, setting up local and national partnerships. In Thailand, for example, the early warning system was taken to the local level, linked with loudspeakers in rural villages and with more than 100 warning towers along the coast. The tsunami, \ufb01nally, brought an increased awareness on the importance of natural defence barriers. Healthy coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves, estuaries, wetlands and sandy beaches, are able to provide good protection against the force of tsunamis and storm surges and contribute to disaster risk reduction while providing diverse livelihoods, suf\ufb01cient nutritious food, shelter and access to goods for communities. Several organisations and programmes, such as Mangroves for the Future, now focus on the humanitarian implications of failure to protect coastal ecosystems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b11395f7-3c95-4f35-b0f1-e52aafc56abb": {"__data__": {"id_": "b11395f7-3c95-4f35-b0f1-e52aafc56abb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Tsunami Legacy: Innovation Breakthroughs and Change \u2013 Executive Summary", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae4c255f8fade5ee32ff251c9ad5c02b9be5966d94a34266906a470654dfc8a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "05bce6b8-1cd3-4189-818d-631489c99c96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-legacy-innovation-breakthroughs-and-change-%E2%80%93-executive-summary", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b726e63d57441a982aacdf9a432b2799f12c7437e6325838d5a585e7818ac367"}}, "hash": "954656d7e0fcbd652757ec35a27430cb039e65839dfde2459636d7346e8b7ca3", "text": "But while most people are aware of the importance of resource-based industries such as ecotourism and \ufb01sheries to coastal economies, there is less comprehension of just how important these goods and raw materials are in terms of their multiplier effects nationally and locally. 6 Will We Do Better Next Time?

Can we multiply our successes, learn from our shortfalls and apply this in the future for both emergency relief and longer- term recovery? You only know lessons have really been learned when you stop thinking about them and simply do them. Particularly in light of the current global \ufb01nancial crisis, many believe that whatever innovations we think are replicable have to be at a low-cost level. Luckily, the most important lessons we have learned are not necessarily those that depend on the availability of large amounts of funding. Effective leadership and coordination, beginning at the grassroots and involving Governments and development organisations alike, can go a long way in ensuring an ef\ufb01cient and sustainable recovery. And while coordination and leadership may be more easily talked about than put into practice, they remain particularly important in a disaster context where chaos goes hand in hand with calamity. We have learned that Governments need to listen and respond to the voices of those most affected \u2013 including those normally not consulted, especially women. However, Governments cannot be alone in solving the leadership equation. The many delivery partners who make up the reconstruction community must also develop the quality and effectiveness of their leadership. We have learned that accountability and preparedness are critical, as is a willingness to take risks and embed institutional as well as cultural reform amid disaster response. This must include serious re\ufb02ection and be a continuous process through which weaknesses are overturned and strengths capitalised upon. Our most important lesson, however, is that disasters themselves should be seen as opportunities for reform and improvement. What stands out in this report is that governments in all \ufb01ve of the most tsunami-affected countries embraced change as a core ethic to confront this catastrophe. The challenge now is to constantly build on and improve these new institutional arrangements. Change must be embraced, not for its own sake, but rather because in a disaster, organisational weaknesses are severely tested and exposed.

An international group of experts in the \ufb01elds of tsunami sources, propagation and inunda- tion, of hazard, vulnerability and risk assessment; also specialists in national and community preparedness and early warning, and in the strategic mitigation of tsunami hazard have contributed to their preparation. Their production has been facilitated by the gener- ous support of the United Nations Development Programme Regional Centre in Bangkok in the context of their Regional Programme for Capacity Building in Risk Reduction and Recovery. The development of the Guidelines was discussed at a specially convened Risk Assessment Workshop in Dubai in October 2007, sponsored by WAPMERR. Their production has been guided by an Advisory Committee of Working Group 3 led by John Schneider (Vice Chair of WG3, Australia), Sam Hettiarachchi (Chair of WG3, Sri Lanka), Sanny Jegillos (UNDP-Regional Centre in Bangkok) and the ICG/IOTWS Secretariat (Tony Elliott and Jane Cunneen). Two meetings of the Advisory Committee and experts were held respectively in Bangkok and Bali in September and November 2008. The principal authors were David Burbidge, Phil Cummins, Ken Dale, Jane Sexton and John Schneider (Geoscience Australia), Juan Carlos Villagran de Leon (formerly UNU-EHS, now UN-OOSA), Sam Hettiarach- chi (University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka), Laura Kong (IOC-ITIC), Masahiro Yamamoto (IOC), David Coetzee (MCDEM, New Zealand), Sanny Jegillos (UNDP) and Russell Arthurton (UNDP Consultant). Russell Arthur- ton was the overall coordinator for the preparation of the Guidelines. The Guidelines have been compiled with the bene\ufb01t of a wealth of published and unpublished information. This has included research by individuals as well as guidance documents from national and international organisations including IOC, ISDR, and partners in the German-Indonesian GITEWS project, led by the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ), Potsdam. This strong foundation to the compilation is warmly acknowledged. The text has been strength- ened by advice and critical appraisal by individuals and organisations including Brian Atwater (U.S. Geologi- cal Survey), Priyan Dias (University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka), Slava Gusiakov (Russian Academy of Sciences), Julie Leonard (USAID/Of\ufb01ce of Foreign Disaster Assis- tance), Jan Sopaheluwakan (Indonesian Institute of Sciences) and John Tychsen (Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, GEUS).

The imperative for these developments stemmed from the need to reduce tsunami risk. However, the warn- ing systems are intended to be integral components of comprehensive multi-hazard warning systems, cover- ing, for example, storm surge and extreme wind-forced wave events. Each will link with appropriate existing hazard warning systems and established specialized centres. These include systems coordinated by IOC and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), through the Joint WMO/IOC Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM). The implementation plans of these multi-hazards warn- ing systems embrace the detection, and forecasting and warning of hazard events, as well as communi- cation and dissemination, and mitigation \u2013 an \u201cend-to- end\u201d system. A key component of each system is the improvement of preparedness through public aware- ness, education and risk assessment. Regional Watch Centres have the important role of planning and imple- menting regional programmes, and providing guidance on alert and information services to National Warning Centres, ensuring full coordination between National Warning Centres in the region and taking maximum advantage of this high-level cooperation. The onward communication of hazard events and the issuance of warnings by National Warning Centres to local authori- ties are the responsibilities of individual countries. The purpose of these Guidelines is to facilitate the implementation of tsunami risk assessment and mitigation by IOC Member States. They have been produced as an initiative of Working Group 3 (WG3) of the Intergovernmental Coordinating Group of IOTWS (Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System). They have been compiled within the context of the \u201cHyogo Framework for Action 2005\u20132015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters\u201d (UN/ISDR, 2005). They describe a process aimed at fully integrating disaster risk reduction into relief and development policies and practices. The Guidelines have been prepared by an expert group within WG3 and with the support and cooperation of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). They are intended to be user-oriented and, although focused on the Indian Ocean Region, they are relevant to tsunami risk assessment and mitigation at the global scale. Their compilation has been closely allied to that of companion guidelines produced as part of the IOC-ICAM (Integrated Coastal Area Management) programme to promote hazard awareness and risk mitigation in coastal management (UNESCO, 2009). They have been developed in accord with Resolu- tion XXIV-14, \u201cTsunamis and Other Ocean Hazards Warning and Mitigation Systems (TOWS)\u201d, in the 24th Session of the IOC Assembly (June 2007). This reso- lution recognized that \u2018the development and imple- mentation of multi-hazard strategies and interoperable systems, including for tsunamis, can only be achieved through close consultation, coordination and coopera- tion among all stakeholders with tsunami and related ocean hazard mandates\u2019.

As an introduction to the procedure for hazard assessment, the document describes the scien- ti\ufb01c background to tsunami occurrence in the Indian Ocean region, taking into account their sources and their geological causes, the ways in which tsunamis travel from those sources to shores near and far, and the challenge of preparing for catastrophic tsunamis that happen centuries apart. This section explains how the scienti\ufb01c understanding of tsunamis in the region is being developed from research by the interna- tional science community. This account of the hazard context is followed by guidance on the procedures for countries to carry out their own hazard assessments in respect of tsunami impacts on their coasts. The guidance takes into account the likelihood of occurrence and also the ways in which a tsunami may be modi\ufb01ed (in terms of its height and momen- tum) by the speci\ufb01c coastal physiography.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98e6e29e-a6b6-42c5-8edd-d52686120381": {"__data__": {"id_": "98e6e29e-a6b6-42c5-8edd-d52686120381", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d388d8485a25d7a89c0221fff58d90914d362445c001267ae235d5cf33d7de15"}, "2": {"node_id": "e27c1f64-17ba-4c28-9ed2-5b4c5236faf5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33fa2e44287a7724c2579945298e6b13e921cd1e5490d6e3b37ccf285e401671"}}, "hash": "aa74716a6433463bf4a11728454208cc1e5ab0eb8472684f51ff1d6fd4880d4a", "text": "The assessment aims to delineate the parameters of potential inundation and inform local and/or national authorities on the likelihood of such impacts in rela- tion to a timescale relevant to their coastal manage- ment and planning.

There may also be weaknesses in the monitor- ing and forecasting of potentially catastrophic events, and weaknesses in issuing warnings, and/or ensuring that warnings reach vulnerable communities. Institu- tional capacities may not be adequate to respond to a warning of a potentially catastrophic event. The recommended tasks within this element of the guidance are to: \u2022 identify and appraise weaknesses in early warning systems and responses in the event of a warning, taking into account vulnerable groups; \u2022 identify and appraise weaknesses related to the post-impact response; and \u2022 assess the take-up or application of risk transfer mechanisms which would facilitate post-impact re- covery. The principal outputs associated with this assessment may include: \u2022 a preliminary appraisal of the state of early warning practices, so that local authorities and disaster re- duction and prevention agencies may appreciate the importance of setting up a plan to strengthen such early warning aspects in the designated coastal com- munities; \u2022 in-depth assessment of de\ufb01ciencies in each key area; \u2022 appraisal of coverage in terms of insurance and mi- cro-insurance schemes; and \u2022 appraisal of institutional capacities, notably the re- quirements for Search and Rescue Operations; also of the results of drills and exercises. ASSESSING THE RISK (B4) The integration of the probability of speci\ufb01ed tsunami scenarios and vulnerability and preparedness assess- ments is the \ufb01nal element of the risk assessment procedure. This indicates the risks to the various community dimensions (social, physical, economic and environmental) or, alternatively, development sectors, in respect of the speci\ufb01ed tsunami scenario(s). The levels of risk deduced by this process inform policy and decision-making, leading to the management of those risks within a coastal area management plan.

The recommended tasks are: \u2022 de\ufb01ne the temporal and geographical scales of the management area; \u2022 review the options for strategic mitigation; \u2022 consider the adoption of a hybrid approach to the management response; \u2022 incorporate other coastal management goals in the response; \u2022 apply decision-analysis tools in the management pro- cess; and \u2022 involve the public in the decision-making processes. The expected principal outputs from these procedures are: \u2022 a portfolio of effective hazard mitigation measures which are consistent with wider coastal manage- ment objectives; and \u2022 a long-term plan for the implementation of the mea- sures, including a monitoring programme to assess the effectiveness of the selected strategy in reduc- ing risks in respect of the tsunami hazard. Whatever the coastal communities\u2019 physical or devel- opmental situations, there are ways of reducing risk in respect of the tsunami hazard which are sustain- able and can be embedded in the culture of those communities. Of prime importance is the need to achieve sustained coordination of effort among the many stakeholders, whether in the assessment of the risk, the planning and implementation of mitigation measures, or the emergency response. The Guide- lines are intended to promote and facilitate this objec- tive, promoting tsunami- and other physical coastal hazard awareness and risk mitigation within a coastal management framework such as ICAM (Integrated Coastal Area Management). Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it A1.1 WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? Tsunamis are natural events that become disasters when they harm people and property. Humans now have the knowledge and the capacity to reduce the cost of such disasters in terms of human lives and economic losses. Loss of life can be reduced and economies need not be so badly damaged. While it is unlikely that all loss of life can be eliminated, the tragedy of coastal devastation can be minimized. With the engagement and assistance of the international community, you can help yourselves to achieve a signi\ufb01cant reduction in the risk to your coastal communities from tsunami impacts and inundation. It is the special responsibility of today\u2019s generations, as witnesses to the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of 26 December 2004, to minimize the losses of lives and live- lihoods to future tsunamis. A1.2 WHAT ARE THESE GUIDELINES FOR? National and local governments including national disaster management agencies may use and adapt these guide- lines to help identify, de\ufb01ne, and reduce tsunami risks to people, their infrastructure, and their supporting ecosys- tems. The Guidelines seek to facilitate the practical and realistic assessment by countries of risk in respect of the tsunami hazard. They present achievable and sustainable strategies for the management and reduction of that risk. The Guidelines build on, and have bene\ufb01ted greatly from, many publications dealing with the science of tsunamis and the assessment of tsunami risk, and providing advice to coastal communities on tsunami awareness and preparedness. One of these \u2013 \u201cHazard awareness and risk mitigation in ICAM (Integrated Coastal Area Management)\u201d (UNESCO, 2009) \u2013 considers tsunamis, along with a range of physical coastal hazards including storm surges, at a global scale. A1.3 WHO SHOULD READ THEM? All countries have room for improving their assessment and awareness of tsunami risks. Countries\u2019 experience of tsunami impacts over recent years has shown that inadequate preparedness and unplanned development have contributed to the loss of lives which may otherwise have been avoidable. These shortcomings have been due in part to a lack of early warning through poor regional detection and commu- nication systems. In many cases, however, they have re\ufb02ected an inadequate awareness at all levels of the risks faced by communities in respect of tsunamis. The Guide- lines are addressed, in particular, to national boards for disaster management (for example, BNBP in Indonesia), coastal development agencies, to coastal risk managers, emergency managers and planners, as well as those concerned with strategic mitigation and sustainable use of coastal resources. They promote coordination among the many agencies and other organizations involved with responsibilities for raising tsunami awareness, devising emergency plans, and building capacity for emergency preparedness and strategic mitigation.

A1.5 HOW CAN YOU REDUCE THE RISK? Guidance in the management of the assessed vulner- ability and risk promotes two broad objectives \u2013 devel- opment of public awareness and emergency prepared- ness, including: \u2022 education; \u2022 early warning systems; \u2022 evacuation plans and \u2022 community-based disaster risk management; and strategic mitigation options including: \u2022 promotion of natural defences; \u2022 hard and soft engineered responses; and \u2022 non-structural approaches including buildings codes and land-use planning. Civil protection emergency response and relief proce- dures are already well established in many countries, particularly where natural hazard events are common- place. These guidelines draw from established practices, but modify or supplement such procedures in order to address the speci\ufb01c circumstances of tsunami impacts. A1.6 POLICY ISSUES AND COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION The experience of the responses to recent coastal inun- dation hazard events and their ensuing disasters, notably the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 and the storm surges associated with Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and Cyclone Nargis in 2008, has highlighted a lack of knowledge of hazards and a poor awareness of community vulner- ability. It has highlighted dysfunctional institutional struc- tures and systems which have hindered the translation of such knowledge and awareness that does exist into responses that are effective in reducing risk. In addition, it shows the need to better understand the root causes of vulnerability in coastal populations, in particular the increasing trend of overpopulation, driven, for example, by global tourism. When a tsunami strikes a coastal area, it is the local population that makes its living in tourist- related activities as well as the tourists that suffer large losses. The Guidelines recognise that successful management of tsunami risk demands high levels of cooperation and coordination between all the involved agencies. These are dif\ufb01cult to achieve, even in developed countries. The Guidelines also highlight the cost-effectiveness of focusing on the local level to help communities take simple disaster mitigation measures. These measures would put in place elementary early warning systems consisting of basic communication chains that could ensure that information reaches the people most at risk. The successful application of the risk assessment may be impeded by a lack of political commitment, but wide stakeholder involvement in the formulation of a risk management plan, through frameworks such as ICAM, may help to resolve such institutional barriers. Whatever the level of risk, there is likely to be some potential for risk reduction, the overarching objective of these guidelines. Whatever the coastal communi- ties\u2019 physical or developmental situation, there are ways of reducing risk in respect of these hazards which are sustainable and can be embedded in the culture of those communities. Of prime importance is the need to achieve sustained coordination of effort among the many stakeholders, whether in the assessment of risk, the planning and implementation of mitigation measures, or the emergency response. These guidelines are intended to promote and facilitate this objective, as part of the coordinated efforts of the Working Groups of the ICG- IOTWS. The successful application of these processes, whether in risk assessment, management planning or in emergency response, will depend above all on the effective operational coordination and cooperation of the many parties involved.

Following this introduction (Section A), the guidance is set out in two main sections \u2013 Section B \u201cAssessing the tsunami risk\u201d, dealing with the steps involved in the risk assessment processes; and Section C \u201cManaging the tsunami risk\u201d, dealing with the procedures and recommendations for risk reduction. The interrelationships of these sections and their main elements are illustrated in Fig. A1. Section B comprises four main elements.

Finally, it deals with the recording of infor- mation about hazard exposure for use by emergency managers and coastal engineers. The second element (B2) provides guidance in response to the question on whether your coastal communities and their supporting assets and resources are vulnerable to tsunamis to which your coasts may be prone. This describes the multifaceted nature of vulnerability and different approaches to its assessment; it then provides guidance on vulnerability assessment procedures for estimating the consequences (damage and losses) arising from a tsunami event. The third element (B3) provides guidance on assessing the state of a community\u2019s preparedness for a tsunami impact, appraising possible de\ufb01ciencies in services essential to minimizing disaster losses. The fourth element (B4) combines the assessment outputs of the \ufb01rst three. It explains how you can integrate the informa- tion on the tsunami hazard with the information on the consequences of a tsunami impact on your communi- ties (their vulnerability and their state of preparedness) to provide a risk assessment in respect of a speci\ufb01ed tsunami hazard scenario \u2013 providing a measure of the probability of those consequences. Section C comprises two main elements which together deal with the reduction of risk in respect of the tsunami hazard. The \ufb01rst (C1) covers the procedures that you will need to prepare your communities for tsunami impacts. It deals with raising the levels of awareness of tsunamis, and then describes tsunami early warning systems, including the regional early warning systems and the part that national systems play in these regional facilities. It also includes information on evacuation procedures and shelters, and explains how community-based actions can contribute to risk reduction. The second element (C2) looks at your options for the strategic mitigation of the tsunami risk, both through the use of structural methods \u2013 by using natural coastal resources and engi- neering approaches \u2013 and also by non-structural initia- tives, including regulation and land-use planning. Each of the main elements of sections B and C is intro- duced by a summary list of the key tasks of the assess- ment and mitigation procedures, and each is concluded by a summary of the expected outcomes and prod- ucts of those procedures. Each element in Section B concludes with a table of information sources for the assessment procedure. Each element in Section B and Section C is appended by a list of suggested additional reading and supplementary information. A general bibli- ography covering published material taken into account in the compilation of the Guidelines follows Section C; this includes addresses on the World-Wide-Web that were accessible at the time of publication.

The term subduction refers to the process whereby one crustal plate under- rides the margin of its neighbour. The process of plate movement may be continual but its manifestation at the surface tends to be spasmodic, with stresses released periodically (and usually catastrophically) by displace- ment on fractures called faults. It is these releases of energy that cause earthquakes. The Makran and Sunda Arc subduction zones are both submarine features. When an earthquake occurs, the sea bed over the fracture zone may be catastrophically Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it 15 The term tsunami risk, as used in these guidelines, refers to the risk posed to a coastal commu- nity and their supporting systems by the hazard of potential tsunami impacts on their shores. The assessment of that risk depends on two main components \u2013 the physical hazard and a community\u2019s vulnerability to the hazard. Another in\ufb02uence on the risk is the state of the community\u2019s prepared- ness for a tsunami impact. B1 Is your coast prone to tsunamis? Key tasks in the hazard assessment procedure \u2022 De\ufb01ne the geographical limits of the coastal management area. \u2022 Identify the possible tsunami sources. \u2022 Compile written and geological records of tsunami impact events affecting your own and neighbouring shores. \u2022 Access information on tsunami sources and propagation patterns. \u2022 Acquire and compile data on nearshore bathymetry and coastal topography. \u2022 Determine the physical parameters of inundation. \u2022 Determine levels of probability, return times for speci\ufb01ed scenarios. \u2022 Prepare hazard maps showing inundation parameters for, and probabilities of, speci\ufb01ed scenarios. \u2022 Communicate results of hazard assessment to emergency managers and policy makers. Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it displaced, causing a collapse or an upheaval of the over- lying water mass. This is the source event that creates a tsunami. The scale of the disturbance depends upon: \u2022 the orientation and dip of the fault; \u2022 the location, depth and area of the earthquake rup- ture, and \u2022 the direction and amount of motion during the earth- quake (known as the slip). Note that some submarine earthquakes may not generate tsunamis (for example, if they are small or deep). Depending on the lateral extent of the fault displace- ment in the subduction zone, the tsunami source may be compact or, in the case of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, elongated over a thousand or so kilometres. The Sunda Arc \u2013 comprising the Java, Sumatra and Lesser Sunda subduction zone \u2013 is one of the most active plate tectonic margins in the world. Many of its characteristics change signi\ufb01cantly along its length. The Indian/Australian and Sunda plates (Fig. B1) meet 5 km beneath the sea surface at the Sumatran Trench, on the \ufb02oor of the Indian Ocean about 200 km off the western coast of Sumatra and southern coast of Java. At the trench, the Indian/ Australian plate is being subducted and overridden by the Sunda plate. Movement between the plates occurs on a fault termed a megathrust. As previously mentioned, the movement is not smooth, rather it occurs spasmodi- cally. The contact between the plates may remain locked for decades or centuries, then suddenly slips by several metres, giving rise to a powerful earthquake. Studies of the Sunda Arc show that large megathrust earthquakes have not been distributed evenly along its length. Histor- ical records spanning some 250 years show that speci\ufb01c sections have been active, while others, relatively quiet. However, in general, most sections of the Sunda Arc are considered to be capable of generating large megath- rust earthquakes and thus have the potential to generate signi\ufb01cant tsunamis. The Makran subduction zone of Iran and Pakistan is seis- mically less active than the Sunda Arc but has produced great earthquakes and tsunamis. The last major tsunami in the Arabian Sea was in 1945, caused by a great earthquake in the eastern part of the zone.

The well-de\ufb01ned terraces of raised seabed that feature along parts of the eastern and western Makran coasts indicate that both parts of this zone may have a potential for large earth- quakes (see Box B3). Neither of these subduction zones is fully understood. It is thus dif\ufb01cult to evaluate the level of tsunami hazard that they pose and to make informed decisions on level of hazard assessment appropriate for each area. The record and likelihood of earthquake occurrence in these zones and the implications for tsunami generation are discussed in B1.2. Identifying non-earthquake sources of tsunamis Globally, subduction zone earthquakes are by far the commonest source of tsunamis. Three quarters of the world\u2019s tsunamis are caused by earthquakes. Of the 18 known historical Indian Ocean-wide tsunami events, only one was not caused by an earthquake. Other possible sources of tsunamis are: volcanic eruptions, submarine landslides and asteroids. Volcanic eruptions The 1883 eruption of Krakatau is the only known major volcanic eruption that has triggered a tsunami which has affected the Indian Ocean. The Krakatau eruption caused a very large local tsunami which devastated the Sunda Strait coasts of Java and Sumatra (37 m and 22 m maximum run-up, respectively), killing more than 35,000 people. This tsunami also reached appreciable run-up heights at regional distances, for example, 1 m to 2 m along the coast of Western Australia. The potential for other volca- noes in the region, such as Barren Island in the Andaman Sea, of generating large tsunamis is uncertain. Submarine landslides Submarine landslides have the potential to produce large, local tsunamis. Factors that contribute to the potential for landslide occurrence are steep sea\ufb02oor slopes and rapid sedimentation. The Indian Ocean includes the two largest sea\ufb02oor accumulations of sedimentary material in the world, the Indus and Bengal fans, fed respectively by the Indus and Ganges rivers, with sediments derived from the Himalaya range (see Fig. B1). These fans adjoin the Makran and Sunda Arc subduction zones, earth- quake activity in which could provide triggers for subma- rine landslides. These considerations suggest that the threat of submarine slides as a source for tsunamis in the Indian Ocean may be underestimated. Asteroid/meteorite impacts Research opinion is divided on the importance of asteroid impacts as damaging tsunami generators. Consideration of their probability is given in B1.2. Accessing regional hazard information Databases that provide information on the hazards gener- ated from many potential sources in the Indian Ocean are being developed with the potential for presenting this information in map form. Such a regional scale data- base and map, the Indian Ocean Tsunami (IOT) Hazard Map, is being developed by Geoscience Australia and is intended to provide a useful initial database of possible tsunamigenic earthquakes and their probabilities. While no database could represent all of the tsunamis that might affect a community in the Indian Ocean region, a map including subduction zone earthquakes would cover some 80 per cent of the potential sources. A regional scale IOT Hazard Map would provide countries with an excellent hazard basis for a \ufb01rst-order, community-wide assessment of tsunami risk (Table B1). For detailed, site- speci\ufb01c applications, and for areas at very high tsunami risk, additional geological studies should be conducted to identify potential tsunami sources not considered in the development of a regional scale hazard map. An existing accessible database relating to potential credible tsunami sources that you might consider is the European Commission Joint Research Centre\u2019s (JRC) Grid Calculation System of the Tsunami Propagation Model as listed in Table B2. B1.2 ESTIMATING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A TSUNAMI IMPACT ON YOUR SHORES There are three sources of information that can be used to estimate the likelihood or probability of a tsunami impacting your coast: \u2022 historical evidence of past tsunami; \u2022 geological evidence of past tsunami, and \u2022 tectonic models for earthquake occurrence. While these sources of information are complemen- tary, they are also incomplete, and any tsunami hazard assessment should clearly express this uncertainty.

Regional weighted deaggregated hazard maps provide a convenient summary of the source of hazard over a region. However, if one is interested in the hazard at a particular location, near a large town, for example, then one should consult a deaggregated hazard map for a model output point near that particular location. Table B1. Products that may be generated from the database of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Hazard Map in preparation (Source: Geoscience Australia) Historical evidence of past tsunamis The historical record of past tsunamis, meaning the written or oral accounts of past tsunami impacts, generally provides a high level of certainty for the esti- mation of probability for return periods much shorter than the historical record. Historical knowledge of past hazard impact events to have affected a designated coastal area or region may be anecdotal, from the local community; and it may be derived from national archives or international tsunami databases (see Table B3). However, major, ocean-wide tsunamis occur infre- quently \u2013 there may be one every few hundred years or longer - and it is rare to \ufb01nd historical records that extend over the many return periods needed to esti- mate the probability of such events. Even where the historical record extends for millennia, the complete- ness of records more than a few hundred years old is open to question. Despite recent research efforts, little is known about maximum earthquake magnitudes and rupture modes, or the recurrence times of tsunami- genic events in the Indian Ocean region. While historical evidence of past tsunamis is invaluable in establishing the likelihoods of past tsunami events, it is invariably incomplete and is seldom able to con\ufb01- dently characterize the largest, most dangerous events that, typically, have long return periods. So, in addition to historical evidence, a tsunami hazard assessment should consider other sources of information, such as those described above. Geological evidence of past tsunamis Geological evidence can extend the knowledge of histor- ical tsunami events further into the past. The informa- tion gleaned from such sources can provide a reliable indication of the return periods for tsunamis, enabling con\ufb01dence in forecasting future events and thus in assessing the risk to coastal communities from tsunamis.

Only for the Sumatra section of the Sunda Arc have such studies enabled the building of a catalogue of the past occurrence of large earthquakes that could be regarded as complete for the past 700 years. Similar studies of other sections of the Indian Ocean subduction zones are only just beginning, and it may take many years before a similar level of infor- mation is available for them. Moreover, geological studies can provide only a minimum constraint to tsunami occur- rence, because a lack of geological evidence does not prove non-occurrence (for example, tsunami-formed deposits may not have been preserved). While geological studies are invaluable in extending the historical record and provide the best means of constraining the return probabilities of major tsunami events, geological evidence is typically sparse, and can provide only an incomplete picture of past tsunami occurrence. Tectonic models of earthquake occurrence An alternative approach to estimating tsunami event probabilities that does not rely exclusively on the phys- ical evidence of past events uses mathematical models based on the physics of earthquake occurrence. This approach combines the observed movements of the tectonic plates that cause earthquakes in subduction zones with a mathematical description of earthquake frequency and magnitude. This permits the estimation of the likelihood that earthquakes of a given magnitude will occur on a particular subduction zone. An example of the results of this work is shown in Fig. B3. This approach has the advantage of including earthquake source zones which may be of concern, but for which there is no actual evidence of tsunami occurence. This lack of evidence could be due to the incompleteness of the historical record or to the dif\ufb01culty in obtaining geological evidence for prehistoric earthquakes. The approach can also take into account other indications of the potential for earthquake occurrence, such as geodetic monitoring that may indicate a build-up of stress towards an impending earthquake (or the lack thereof).

Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it A major disadvantage of this approach is that the curves describing earthquake occurrence on individual subduc- tion zones are poorly constrained by the available data. Perhaps more importantly, the use of this technique might mask this lack of information, giving the appear- ance of a very complete, though false, knowledge of earthquake occurrence. On the \ufb01nal assessment, a range of possible maximum magnitudes and earth- quake recurrence relationships should be used in order to demonstrate the effect of the uncertainty in these parameters. Another disadvantage is that the technique ignores sources of tsunamis other than megathrust earthquakes; these include volcanoes, landslides, and asteroids as described above, as well as non-megathrust earthquakes. It should be noted that a conceptually similar approach can be used to estimate tsunami impacts due to aster- oids/meteorites. Statistical descriptions of the frequency at which asteroids of different sizes impact the earth can be used to estimate how often these would result in tsunami impact. However, the lack of observational data to constrain such events means there is consider- able uncertainty in the generation and propagation of tsunamis excited by such impacts.

A scenario-based approach focuses on a maximum credible event and historical experience. In the case of tsunamis, this approach is normally used for developing inundation maps and evacuation proce- dures. A probabilistic approach considers a broad range of potential events and their likelihoods (see B1.2). The reliability or credibility of each approach depends on an accurate characterization of the tsunami sources, an accurate representation of tsunami propagation (for example, accurate bathymetry data) and on the uncer- tainty in this characterization. Any hazard analysis should therefore attempt to make the best possible use of data concerning past events. Scenario-based Tsunami Hazard Analysis (STHA) STHA, sometimes called deterministic tsunami hazard analysis, attempts to describe the effects that a particular tsunami scenario, or suite of tsunami scenarios, will have on a coast of interest. These scenarios are chosen to include the worst credible and/or the most likely tsunami events, according to some presumed geological frame- work. STHA is a straightforward and useful way to under- stand the potential effects of a tsunami, especially if the worst credible event is well established. Such a scenario analysis can have likelihood information associated with it, based on estimated return times of the scenarios used. However, that is not a requirement for carrying out an STHA. Finally, STHA may, or may not, include inundation modelling (B1.3). Normally, the term \u201chazard analysis\u201d is used only for a broad-scale assessment affecting many communities. It would not usually involve detailed inunda- tion modelling at the community scale. STHA is limited in that it essentially addresses only one question: what is the potential impact of a particular suite of scenarios (and sometimes only one scenario) on a particular coast? It is of limited usefulness for broader policy and planning decisions, because it contains little or no information about the likelihood of a tsunami event. It is less suitable for a situation in which the coast of interest may be affected by a number of very different scenarios of varying likelihood; or if the relative hazard due to many scenarios needs to be evaluated over a broad geographical region; or where there is an interest (for example, for building codes, C2.3) in tsunami effects expected at various return periods. Also, STHA typically requires high-resolution bathymetric and topographic data for the shore of interest. Probabilistic Tsunami Hazard Analysis (PTHA) PTHA is at an early stage of development. Its approach has been derived from, and is closely allied to, Proba- bilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis (PSHA). In contrast to STHA, PTHA attempts to consider a large class of tsunami scenarios, essentially all those which might cause a signi\ufb01cant impact, and is often based on more than one geological framework. PTHA is focused less on what the effects of a particular tsunami scenario will be, and more on the question of the likelihood that a tsunami of a given height at sites of interest will be exceeded (see Box B3). PTHA produces a very information-rich result, which can be used to express hazard in many different ways \u2013 for example, maps of tsunami exceedance height for various return periods, or deaggregated hazard maps showing the relative contributions of different sources to the hazard at a particular site (see Table B1). These prod- ucts can be used to answer a variety of questions about the tsunami hazard of interest to emergency managers and coastal planners. A crucial limitation of PTHA, at least in its implemen- tations currently available, is its inability to model the detailed effects of tsunami inundation. This is because of the large amount of computation required and, some- times, because the lack of accurate bathymetric and topo- Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it 21 Assessing the tsunami risk Box B3.

The results from a PSHA for this region show that the largest expected earthquake has a moment magni- tude of about 8.3 and a return period of about 1000 years. Numerical modelling indicates that the tsunami produced by the largest expected earthquake for the region could reach a maximum run-up height of 9.6 m along the Makran coast. To determine the likelihood of a tsunami affecting the Makran coast, a probabilistic tsunami hazard assess- ment (PTHA) was conducted. A PTHA combines the probability of an offshore earthquake occurrence with numerical modelling of a tsunami in order to determine the probability of a tsunami wave exceeding a given maximum water elevation at a coastal site. Based on the results of a PTHA for the Makran subduction zone, the probability of tsunami wave-heights exceeding 5 m along the Makran coasts during the next 50 years is 17.5 per cent. For a moderate tsunami, with a wave height in the range 1 m to 2 m, this probability is as high as 45 per cent.

This restricts PTHA\u2019s ability to address site-speci\ufb01c mitigation measures, such as the identi\ufb01cation of evacuation areas and routes. Also, because this approach requires a much more complete characterization of potential tsunami sources than STHA, its results are more sensitive to uncertainties in the speci\ufb01cation of those tsunami sources. Applications of PTHA should take care to adequately express this. PTHA methodologies have been the subject of recent review with a view to improving tsunami hazard assessment guidance in the United States of America.

Of these forces, the state of the tidal cycle is likely to be the most signi\ufb01cant in considering the probability of increased levels of coastal inundation from tsunamis (Box B4). B1.3 ESTIMATING THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF TSUNAMI IMPACTS ON YOUR SHORES The physical effects of tsunami impact of concern here occur when the tsunami enters shallow water near the coast. At this point the tsunami increases in height through a process known as shoaling, and then runs over the land in a process known as inundation. Both of these are complicated phenomena best described via numerical modelling. There are three steps to modelling a tsunami: \u2022 In the \ufb01rst step, parameters describing the tsunami source are used to calculate the size and shape of the initial tsunami wave. This step is known as source modelling. \u2022 The second step is to take this initial wave and propa- gate that wave to the coast. This is called tsunami propagation modelling. \u2022 The \ufb01nal step is to model the tsunami as it inundates the coast. This is known as tsunami inundation mod- elling. Usually these three modelling steps use three separate and distinct computer programmes. The output of one forms the input of the next modelling programme in the chain. However, some codes are capable of doing multiple steps (for example, by combining the propa- gation and inundation modelling steps). Hazard maps can be created by analysing the results of one or more tsunami models. A list of models is given in Table B2. Modelling tsunami sources Once the tsunami source is characterized, then the size and shape of the wave it produces is calculated.

A very deep earthquake will not produce as large a tsunami as a shallow one. A wide rupture zone produces a tsunami with a longer initial wavelength than one with a narrow rupture. An earth- quake where the two sides of the fault move horizontally (called a strike-slip earthquake) will not uplift the sea \ufb02oor as much as an earthquake which moves vertically (called a dip-slip earthquake). A link for information on the parame- ters for modelling earthquake sources of tsunami is given at the end of this section. As with earthquakes, the parameters of other possible tsunami sources (landslides, volcanoes and asteroid impacts) must also be constrained in order to determine the size, direction and shape of the initial tsunami wave. Understanding tsunami propagation Propagation of the tsunami is the process by which its wave or waves travel away from its source. The pattern of propagation depends on source factors such as the lateral extent of seabed displacement and its amplitude. It is usually strongly in\ufb02uenced by factors such as water depth and the presence of islands and headlands along its path. Once a tsunami has been generated, its energy is distrib- uted throughout the water column, regardless of ocean depth. A tsunami comprises a series of very long waves. The dominant wavelength of the tsunami depends on the generating mechanism and the dimensions of the source. The larger and more extensive the earthquake, the greater its initial wavelength and period will be. Conversely, if the tsunami is caused by a local landslide, both its initial wave- length and period will be shorter. The period of constit- uent waves in a tsunami event may range from 5 to 90 minutes. As they propagate, the wave crests can range from just a few, to more than 100 kilometres apart. In the open ocean, the tsunami wavelength may be hundreds of kilometres, many times greater than the ocean depth. In the deep ocean, the height of the tsunami from trough to crest (the wave height) may range from only a few centimetres to more than one metre, depending on its generating source. Tsunami waves in the deep ocean can travel at high speeds, covering distances of thousands of kilometres and losing little energy in the process; the deeper the water, the greater the rate of propagation. At the deepest ocean depths, the speed of propagation may be as much as 800 km/hour. As it reaches coastal waters, the propagating tsunami may be diffracted around obstacles such as headlands and islands resulting in marked changes relative to the undisturbed wave \ufb01eld regime. Similarly the wave may be refracted by variations in water depth. In some cases a tsunami may be re\ufb02ected from a coastline in a way similar to that of wind-forced waves being re\ufb02ected off a seawall (boxes B4 and B5). Signi\ufb01cantly, the wave height is greatly increased where the tsunami enters shallow coastal waters in the process of shoaling, resulting in heights many times greater at the coast than in the open ocean (Fig. B4). One of the \ufb01rst indicators of an impending tsunami impact on a country\u2019s shores may be the withdrawal of the sea from the nearshore zone, with wide expanses of seabed becoming unusually emergent. This temporary lowering of sea level is a feature known to some coastal communities and knowledge of it has been the key to their survival (Section C1.4). Using tsunami propagation models Once the size and shape of the initial wave is calculated from a source model, this wave is the one used as input into a tsunami propagation model. The propagation model Fig. B4. Tsunami shoaling: the effect of water depth on wave height and velocity. In the open ocean, a tsunami is often only tens of centimetres high, but its wave height grows rapidly in shallow water. Tsunami wave energy extends from the surface to the bottom in the deepest waters. As the tsunami attacks the coastline, the wave energy is compressed into a much shorter distance creating destructive, life-threatening waves. Source: Tsunami Glossary, UNESCO 2006.

Tsunami wave impact on Sri Lanka The island state of Sri Lanka was severely affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Its eastern coast, directly exposed to the source, was heavily inundated by shoaling tsunamis. The south-eastern and south- western coasts were also affected and, at many loca- tions, inundation levels of 5 m to 10 m were recorded. The combined action of nearshore shoaling processes and local geomorphological features contributed to these high values. On approaching land, the wave \ufb01rst interacted with the continental shelf, during which process the initial transformation took place. Part of the energy was re\ufb02ected and the balance transmitted. Sri Lanka has a narrow continental shelf. The mean distance between the coast and the 200-m depth contour is about 20 km reducing to around 5 km at the southern end of the island. The narrow shelf led to wave trans- formation from deep to shallow water over a short distance without signi\ufb01cant energy dissipation. On reaching shallower water, the wave heights increased. This increase was accompanied by the processes of refraction, diffraction and re\ufb02ection around bays and headlands. Cities located adjacent to bays and headlands (for example, Hamabanthota and Galle) witnessed very high waves. Wide variations in inun- dation heights were observed over short distances along the coastline. On the western coast, not directly exposed to the tsunami source, the highest waves recorded corre- sponded to those re\ufb02ected from the Maldivian atolls to the west, illustrating the in\ufb02uence of such natural submarine features. Analysis of tidal gauge readings and measurements from equipment located off the coast of Colombo con\ufb01rmed that the highest wave arrived about 3.5 hours after the \ufb01rst wave. Sea-bed currents at this location increased from 20 cm/s to 70 cm/s. Inundation on the southern coast would have be greater but for the low tidal conditions on tsunami impact (albeit a microtidal shore). (see also Box C3) Sam Hettiarachchi incrementally solves a series of mathematical equations to take the initial wave and \u201cbring\u201d it to the coast. In order to model the tsunami accurately, the spatial resolution of the model must be much smaller than the smallest wave- length of the tsunami. The spatial resolution of the model controls the spatial resolution of the input data, such as the bathymetry. So, if the wavelength of a tsunami gener- ated by an earthquake is, for example, 100 km, then the grid resolution to accurately model this wave should be much smaller than this. Grids for deep-water propagation models are typically 1 km to 2 km in spacing when model- ling earthquake-induced tsunamis which are dominated by wavelengths of 100 km or more in deep water.

Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it Understanding tsunami inundation Observations of the impacts of the 2004 tsunami event have contributed greatly to our understanding of tsunami inundation. They have shown how variable it can be, even along a few kilometres of coastline. The form of the nearshore bathymetry is one of the key determinants. The in\ufb02uence of coastal bathymetry on tsunami wave height and velocity, and on the forces exerted, during the shoaling process has received considerable attention from researchers. The on-shore coastal geomorphology is also a key factor in\ufb02uencing the extent of inundation and run-up (Fig. B5). Other modi\ufb01ers of inundation are coastal vegetation, especially mangrove, and the built environ- ment, including any existing engineered defences. The impact of a tsunami can also be exacerbated by mate- rials that become entrained in the course of inundation and also, importantly, during its subsequent drainage. The inundation and its drainage can result in signi\ufb01cant erosion, e.g., by scouring around buildings foundations, and sedimentation, for example, causing degradation of coral reefs. An essential part of the risk assessment procedure is the geospatial recording of the various parameters of tsunami inundation on maps at the local scale. These maps are referred to collectively as local hazard maps and their construction is described below. Using tsunami inundation models The modelling of tsunami inundation and run-up has received considerable attention, and many models are now available (Table B2). Key inputs to these models include the open ocean (deep water) wave height (see above), and digital nearshore bathymetric and coastal elevation data. Tidal data may also be important (Fig. B6 and see Box B4). The severity of a tsunami impact is critically dependent on complex bathymetric and topographic effects near the area of interest. Estimating the physical impact of a tsunami on a shore therefore requires modelling of the non-linear process by which waves are re\ufb02ected and otherwise shaped by local bathymetry and topography. These complex effects generally require elevation data of a resolution much higher than is used by the propagation models, which typically use data resolutions in the order of kilometres or less (suf\ufb01cient to model long-wavelength tsunamis in open water). The data resolution used by inundation models, by contrast, is typically in the order of metres. Running an inundation model capable of resolving local bathymetric effects and run-up using detailed elevation data requires more computational resources than the typical propagation model. Except for the case local (near- \ufb01eld) tsunamis, where the tsunami is generated immedi- ately offshore the shore site of interest, it is impractical to use an inundation model for complete end-to-end (source to run-up) modelling of a tsunami event. Instead, a hybrid approach is typically used. In this, the output from a prop- agation model is used as input to an inundation model at the seaward boundary of its study area. The output of the propagation model thus serves as a boundary condi- tion for the inundation model. In this way, we restrict the computationally intensive part of the modelling to the geographical area where a detailed understanding of the inundation process is required (Fig. B6). Furthermore, to avoid unnecessary computations, some inundation models (for example, ANUGA, see Table B2) work with an unstructured triangular mesh rather than the rectangular grids typically used by propagation models. The advantage of an unstructured mesh is that different regions can have different resolutions, allowing compu- tational resources to be directed where they are most needed. For example, one might use very high resolution DATUM SHORELINE Water level at shoreline RUN-UP INUNDATION HORIZONTAL FLOODING Maximum water level Inundation line or limit DATUM is mean sea level or mean low water at time tsunami attack. Maximum Water Level may be located at shoreline or the inundation line or anywhere in between. Fig. B5. Tsunami impact at the coast: an explanation of terms.

In addition, the pattern of current velocities attained during inundation and drainage can be determined. The data should ideally capture all complex features of the underlying bathymetry and topography, and cell resolu- tion should be commensurate with the underlying data. Any limitations in the resolution and accuracy of the data, including the cell resolution, will introduce errors to the inundation maps as well as to the range of model approxi- mations. National scale datasets are often held by national geological and oceanographic surveys and local scale datasets by State and Local Governments. Local data sets are usually required for an inundation model, due to the higher resolutions required. In many cases there are limitations on use between different agencies according to the licence agreements. Validation of tsunami models The recent proliferation of tsunami modelling codes highlights the need for verifying that models accurately solve the appropriate hydrodynamic equations, and to ensure that they can accurately reproduce the observed phenomena. There are a number of analytical and labora- tory benchmarks against which tsunami models can be veri\ufb01ed. Models and their input data can be validated by comparing results from modelling a historic event for which observa- tional data exist. Typical data used to validate the source and propagation models are deep ocean pressure gauge data (for example, from the DART network) or coastal tide-gauge data. If the propagation model is coupled to an inundation model, then the observed tsunami run-up and inundation distance observations from historic events can also be used for validation. If the difference between the observed and modelled results is too large, then either the model, or (more typically) the input data, needs to be improved. This could include obtaining better/higher resolution bathymetry and topography, a better model of the source and/or using a more sophisticated numerical model. The exact requirements to reduce such mis\ufb01ts between observation and the model vary from one vali- dation run to another. Fig. B6.

These maps form a basis for evacuation planning and for land-use planning. They also provide the information for determining the exposure parameters within a de\ufb01ned coastal manage- ment area that will be used in the assessment of vulner- ability of the coastal community and of their supporting assets and systems. Local tsunami hazard maps are usually developed from speci\ufb01ed tsunami event scenarios. At the simplest level, a local hazard map would be constructed by using contoured elevation data for the coastal land at the level of a speci\ufb01ed wave height, using GIS (Geographical Infor- mation System) technology. The elevation data would be derived from, for example, a digital elevation model or, if available, topographic survey. Such a simpli\ufb01ed local hazard map does not, however, take into account the dynamics of the tsunami, in which the focusing and defo- cusing of tsunami energy may cause the inundation level to rise above the speci\ufb01ed wave height in some areas and never reach it in others. To some extent this shortcoming can be recti\ufb01ed by displaying observational information relating to past events as an event record map.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0ee4245-43a3-4d82-b866-1c6e1c0d6df2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0ee4245-43a3-4d82-b866-1c6e1c0d6df2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b31567a3a87de4e3907b1205b46e8a8e2f1fab3557e5832ef9a205388758ec41"}, "2": {"node_id": "29804bcb-265b-4107-a954-ccaa07800341", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b205ba533e86897521857de2253e5f268e7d9b51196870d3616575bffc3e23fb"}}, "hash": "9cb1e6b4f4ab15df1db3933c76e25101d531233529f6bf93c5d1841327d4b41c", "text": "The types of processes, extent of affected area and date of occur- ANUGA Geoscience Australia and Australian National University (http://www.ga.gov.au/hazards/tsunami/tools.jsp; http://sourceforge.net/projects/ANUGA) COMCOT Cornell Multigrid Coupled Tsunami model: Cornell University (http://ceeserver.cee.cornell.edu/pll-group/comcot.htm) Delft3D Deltares, Netherlands (http://www.wldelft.nl/cons/area/ehy/\ufb02ood/tsunami.html) FUNWAVE Fully Nonlinear Wave Model: University of Delaware, U.S.A.

Numerical inundation models, described above, allow us to considerably improve on the use of elevation contours alone for predicting the likely behaviour of a tsunami as it impacts the shore and coastal lowland. The procedure requires either that the modelling be end-to-end (source to run-up) as for a near-\ufb01eld tsunami generated near the coastal community, or that the inundation model be linked to the output of a propagation model, as for a tsunami generated far from the affected coastal community. Ideally, local hazard maps carry information about the parameters of inundation of water over the shoreline and coastal lowland \u2013 its run-up heights, its depths, and the \ufb02ow parameters (velocities and directions), not only during the \ufb02ood episode but also during drainage. As such, these maps represent the variations in exposure to a tsunami within a given area. Additional information might include an indication of the total \ufb02ood volume and the travel time of the tsunami from its likely source. The information on such an inundation map provides the reader with a picture of the extent and level of inundation to which a coastal commu- nity and its supporting assets (B2.2) would be subject. A basic inundation map records information for a speci- \ufb01ed tsunami scenario. The analysis in such cases is deterministic \u2013 determining the parameters of inunda- tion resulting from that scenario. In displaying inundation limits on printed maps, it may be considered convenient to depict the limits for a range of credible scenarios on a single base. Alternatively the geospatial information relating to individual scenarios within a range may be archived as independent layers using, for example, GIS technology.

Hazard mapping in Indonesia \u2013 approaches within the GITEWS project Understanding tsunami hazard and possible local impacts is a prerequisite for local authorities and other stakeholders in tsunami preparedness in order to anticipate future tsunami events. Different initiatives concerning Tsunami Hazard Mapping are currently under way in Indonesia. For many Indonesian coastal communities in tsunami-prone regions, however, still very little information is available and it is uncertain whether such communities will receive the attention they need. A current initiative in Indonesia, in three pilot districts in Java \u2013 Bantul, Kebumen and Cilacap, is to initiate the design of a participatory, simple, and low-tech but suf\ufb01cient and adequate tsunami hazard mapping meth- odology that can be applied at district level", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c39ce2f5-a025-4416-9864-251c70ca8b37": {"__data__": {"id_": "c39ce2f5-a025-4416-9864-251c70ca8b37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2e6bd4fed8628d9160d958488736cb1d6cb91aa3191f647dfacc84c52d7c8c3c"}, "3": {"node_id": "b5ec2f25-b575-4d39-8807-efc1b4d0a135", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "67c8a22b441ca4e22995ebaffe670266871b82a9b4f68b24ea0b0a867d95d0cb"}}, "hash": "ec5717eefd259eb38e190745997c2448378bb9a0333772c9d8d64dec2a9716fd", "text": "in order to understand tsunami hazard and become prepared for future disasters \u2013 especially in those regions where there is a persistent lack of understanding about tsunami hazard and limited attention from existing hazard mapping initiatives.

The method- ology may be downloaded at: http://www.jtic.org. A more comprehensive approach is being applied for the hazard mapping of the coastal areas of West Sumatra, South Java and Bali. The hazard maps are generated based on a multi-scenario approach. This deterministic approach uses a large number of real- istic scenarios and combines the inundation results to integrated hazard maps. The analysis of probabilities of earthquake occurrences derived from historical data and geophysical research is included in the derivation of hazard probability maps. The maps are provided at 1:100,000 (map scale) for the respective coastal areas, and in greater detail \u2013 e.g., 1:25,000 (map scale) \u2013 for the pilot regions of Padang, Cilacap and Bali. The results in the hazard maps are displayed as contin- uous values or as derived hazard zones. The de\ufb01nition of the hazard zones can be linked to the different levels of warnings provided by the Ina TEWS Early Warning System. The hazard zones are related to the levels of warning (tsunami warning or major tsunami), which are linked to the expected wave heights at the coast. An example is shown in Fig. B7.

Selecting representative scenarios So, how do we pick representative events or scenarios? In the case of a community threatened by a local (near- \ufb01eld) tsunami, the obvious choice is the tsunami source area immediately offshore. For a community threatened by a more complicated mix of tsunamis generated by more distant sources, this can be done through a method called deaggregation (Table B1). If a probabilistic tsunami hazard map exists for the area (see B1.2) it can be deag- gregated to allow the user to specify a location and either a hazard probability or wave amplitude of interest. The deaggregation process selects all the event scenarios (earthquake locations, magnitudes and frequencies of occurrence) that contribute to the tsunami hazard speci- \ufb01cation (probability, wave height). For very small-ampli- tude waves or very high probabilities, there is gener- ally a wide range of earthquake magnitudes, locations and frequencies that contribute to the tsunami hazard. However, as the probability decreases (or the return period increases), the number of events diminishes dramatically. At return periods of 1000 years or more, it is often possible to select a single, representative event for the scenario analysis. In some cases, several events may be required for further analysis, representing either different return periods or different sources of tsunamis which might result in different characteristics or distri- butions of inundation and damage to a community.

B2.1 UNDERSTANDING VULNERABILITY \u2013 AND HOW TO ASSESS IT Following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, impact damage and loss surveys were carried out in nearly all the affected Indian Ocean states. These surveys revealed very high levels of social, physical, economic and, in many cases, environmental vulnerability (Table B4). Many of these assessments could relate damage and loss to known tsunami heights. Such post-impact empir- ical observation inevitably has a potential for producing reliable vulnerability assessments. These guidelines, however, are concerned with achieving a realistic vulner- ability assessment before a tsunami event, so that action can be taken to reduce the levels of vulnerability in anticipation of such an event. There is yet no global consensus on how vulnerability to natural hazards should be assessed. Because of its multifaceted nature, it is dif\ufb01cult to measure and its measurements carry uncertainties. While recognising these uncertainties, this element of the Guidelines sets out options for assessment approaches that focus on measurable indicators that are relevant to achieving the overarching objective of risk reduction. Vulnerability analysis must be adapted to the speci\ufb01c objectives required by the policy maker and emergency manager. The choice of approach may depend on the scale of the assessment required.

At more local levels there are options of applying an increasing resolution to the assessment process. Managers also need to consider the time period that the assessment is intended to span. Factors that contribute to vulnerability are dynamic. They are likely to change over time because of, for example, changing (usually increasing) coastal population, economic developments, social structures, and environmental states. Irrespective of the approach employed, there are key steps that policy makers and emergency managers should follow in assessing vulnerability. These relate to the information outputs from the hazard assessment, i.e.: \u2022 the likely extent of inundation to affect their coastal area; \u2022 the way in which inundation occurs (\ufb02ow velocities and directions, momentum, entrained debris, etc.); and \u2022 the likely warning time that would be available for an emergency response, including evacuation.

Rapid assessment of damages and coping capacities within the city of Galle, Sri Lanka. UNU-EHS internal report. As described in B1.3, the extent and nature of the inunda- tion determine the extent to which the community and its assets are exposed to a speci\ufb01ed hazard scenario. Using the outputs from the hazard assessment, emer- gency managers will need to create a community asset database, a process known as asset mapping. The database is essentially a community census and asset inventory for the de\ufb01ned coastal area. The distribution of assets is then mapped in relation to the exposure infor- mation carried by the local hazard map, producing an exposure map and database for the community assets. This map should show the distribution of people, build- ings, infrastructure and environmental assets in relation to information on the various hazard exposure parame- ters (inundation limit, run-up, depth of water, proximity to open coast, inundation and drainage \ufb02ow velocities, etc.) for that hazard scenario. In making their assessment, emergency managers will need to consider the vulnerability of people and the various community assets in terms of human and mone- tary loss or damage in the event of an inundation. Socio- economic factors may play a major role in the extent to which a community is exposed to the hazard and thus its vulnerability. Vulnerability depends on a wide range of contributory factors or parameters. For any given hazard scenario, there is a range of vulnerability levels according to the parameter assessed, the approach used and the level of detail required. B2.2 CONSTRUCTING AN EXPOSURE DATABASE A foundation for any assessment of vulnerability is the existence of an up-to-date knowledge of the distribu- tion of people and their supporting assets within the coastal areas that may be exposed to tsunami inunda- tion. Such an exposure database, derived from an asset database and information contained in the local hazard map, forms a basis for determining the vulnerability of community assets to speci\ufb01ed tsunami scenarios.

These data provide the basis for vulnerability assess- ments, allowing you to determine the potential impact of an inundation event in terms of loss and damage. In order to conduct vulnerability assessments on a national scale, exposure databases need to be developed begin- ning at the local level and integrated at district or national levels, in order to assure uniformity in the assessment process. B2.3 CHOOSING AN ASSESSMENT APPROACH \u2013 THE OPTIONS Much has been written about the vulnerability of commu- nities and their supporting economies and ecosystem services in the context of natural disasters, for example, the publications of ISDR. Some publications deal with speci\ufb01c dimensions of a community\u2019s vulnerability \u2013 its social fabric, its buildings, its economy and its supporting environment and institutions. Some authors include the notions of exposure, coping capacity, and susceptibility within the context of vulnerability (see Box B8), but there is no consensus on the de\ufb01nition of vulnerability. In this document, coping capacity is included within the concept of preparedness (B3), and exposure information provides the spatial context for integrating hazard and vulnerability (B1). The term susceptibility is taken to be synonymous with vulnerability. Dimensional vulnerability assessments may assist policy makers in the identi\ufb01cation of critical areas or weak spots in respect of, for example, human and buildings secu- rity, industrial and utilities infrastructure and ecosystem integrity. Another approach, recently introduced, is the assessment of vulnerability by considering sectors of development. From a policy-relevant point of view, this approach, cross-cutting dimensional boundaries, encour- ages agencies in charge of these sectors to take respon- sibility concerning vulnerability reduction within their respective sectors. It is up to the policy maker or emergency manager to decide on the approach to be used and the level of detail required. The approach may be constrained by data availability or may be determined by the de\ufb01ned scale \u2013 whether for local, district or national overview purposes. Practitioners need to specify their priorities for assess- ment \u2013 those being of particular relevance or importance to the community. A \ufb01rst-order analysis The most basic approach is to consider that all commu- nity assets that would be subject to inundation are vulnerable. The geospatially referenced positions and topographic levels of people and their community assets such as buildings or infrastructure would be juxtaposed with speci\ufb01ed levels of tsunami exposure, an opera- tion achieved by use of GIS technology. This is the least reliable of the assessment approaches described here. However, it may be appropriate for an initial assess- ment of relatively large coastal areas. Typically, this is the approach used to de\ufb01ne evacuation routes (C1.4). A second-order analysis \u2013 dimensions of vulnerability The complexity of communities and their support systems has led experts to recognise dimensions of vulnerability \u2013 including social, physical, economic and environmental. Each dimension is characterized through a variety of parameters (B2.4). In making such an analysis, it should be recognized that the boundaries between dimensions are generally not clear-cut. Thus, losses in, say, the physical dimension (notably, build- ings) may have clear implications for losses in social and economic dimensions. Re\ufb01ning the analysis Assessment of each dimension of vulnerability may take into account the outcome of a more re\ufb01ned analysis. The degree of potential damage or loss of community assets may differ considerably within the de\ufb01ned coastal area. This may be because of different levels of expo- sure (associated with a speci\ufb01ed hazard scenario). For example, physical damage related to inundation tends to be greatest in parts of the area closest to the shore where exposure is highest. Social vulnerability in the case of tsunamis may be greatest amongst infants and small children, the old and disabled \u2013 such people having high susceptibility to harm, an intrinsic quality unre- lated to the hazard exposure.

B2.4 USING A \u201cDIMENSIONS OF VULNERABILITY\u201d APPROACH Vulnerability assessment involves the identi\ufb01cation of indi- cators or proxies which may qualitatively or quantitatively capture the following factors: \u2022 social \u2013 issues such as levels of literacy, gender, educa- tion, peace and security, access to human rights, so- cial equity, traditional values, beliefs and organizational systems; \u2022 physical \u2013 susceptibilities of the built environment, in- cluding infrastructure; \u2022 economic \u2013 issues of poverty, level of debt and access to credits; \u2022 environmental \u2013 natural resource depletion and degra- dation. In practice, the boundaries between these dimensions are far from clear cut. For example, there are obvious overlaps between the social and economic dimensions in respect of gender and poverty. These dimensions are described in more detail below and information sources are listed in Table B5. Social dimension Social vulnerability is a pre-existing condition that strongly determines a society\u2019s ability to prepare for, and recover from, a disruptive event. Disasters and similar shocks make social vulnerability visible since the unequal patterns of suffering and recovery become apparent. The assessment of social vulnerability in the context of exposure to a potential tsunami impact aims to determine the predisposition of people and their livelihoods, soci- eties, and organizations within the coastal community to be affected by a tsunami in this case. This predisposition may re\ufb02ect social structures and cultural values as well as people\u2019s access to resources and opportunities. Levels of social vulnerability may also re\ufb02ect social castes or ethnic differences, and tend to be highest among marginalized groups, such as the poor, women, children and the elderly (Box B7). Other parameters which may contribute to the social dimen- sion of vulnerability, particularly in urban areas, are: \u2022 population growth and migration patterns, notably in coastal megacities; and \u2022 fragmentation among different social groups and sec- tors in urban areas. In rural coastal communities, people dependent for their livelihoods on inshore artisanal \ufb01shers, such as those on the Indian Ocean coasts of Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania (see boxes C2 and C3), would be particularly vulnerable to a signi\ufb01cant tsunami impact on their shores. While it is imperative to measure the current state of vulnerability of a community (from the typology angle, for example), it is equally important to assess the root causes related to those social, political, institutional, economic, envi- ronmental, and cultural factors which have led to the current state of vulnerability of such a community. The assess- ment of root causes \ufb01nds uses when promoting a broader perspective within the context of risk management. Box B7. Gender and age-related differentials in social vulnerability The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami manifested gender and age-related differential aspects with respect to the social dimension of vulnerability. Children in the youngest age group (0\u201310 years old) and adults over 40 years old could be considered as highly vulnerable when looking at the mortality rates in the coastal cities Galle and Batticaloa in Sri Lanka. Similar results have been presented for women based on mortality rates by gender. Findings in the Ampara District of Sri Lanka con\ufb01rmed the notion that children in the youngest age group are highly vulnerable, as well as people over \ufb01fty. Researchers have concluded that women are far more vulnerable than men in these same geographical areas. A mortality survey in Tamil Nadu in India simi- larly highlighted the differential vulnerability of children, elderly and women. In the case of children, higher mortality can be explained by physiological differences. Their small mass means they can be readily carried away by a tsunami as they lack the strength to grasp \ufb01xed objects such as trees. For women, higher mortality may be attributed to physiological and social characteristics. Like children, women may have less strength than men. In addition, learned skills tend to differ between men and women, particularly swimming and climbing trees, activities usually taught to boys but not to girls. Finally, some authors argue that the traditional division of labour means that women spend substantial amounts of time inside houses which could collapse on tsunami impact due to structural vulnerability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dbf2eb39-9cfb-41e2-97e1-b379794d1223": {"__data__": {"id_": "dbf2eb39-9cfb-41e2-97e1-b379794d1223", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07d402fc62430e4d785b83926ba8447e50fcc4c7142af1b1952773a941a8389e"}, "2": {"node_id": "32365c40-36ff-47f7-80b0-890d4d9c74e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c89dfb60dac477e8283336f2351753b1ad7e2a20e9db80fc4d09df4a6e656daf"}}, "hash": "b87106605cf6cb7355cb8c46015fbac50b0a81f39f27dac29675e5b1dc6d3eaf", "text": "In the case of Sri Lanka and India, a social aspect which could contribute to higher mortality for women is the traditional wearing of saris, which could hamper running and swimming, and become tangled with heavy objects, leading to death by drowning.

Sub-national vulnerability assessment to tsunami risk in Indonesia \u2013 the GITEWS project (see also Fig. B8) The vulnerability assessment within the GITEWS project focuses particularly on vulnerability factors of people exposed to tsunamis in terms of loss of life, injury and loss of livelihood. The assessment framework outlines two potential paths for reducing disaster risk and vulnerability through preventive measures before a disaster manifests, and through disaster response and management in the aftermath of a disaster. As a result, the project aims at providing sound information to support: \u2022 crisis management capacities (e.g., emergency assistance) during an early warning scenario and \u2022 developing disaster risk reduction strategies, such as measures for adaptation and mitigation. Accordingly, the GITEWS vulnerability assessment aims at providing indicators and assessment tools for the continuous improvement of intervention tools, such as early warning and evacuation planning, disaster response and rehabilitation. The vulnerability assess- ment hence addresses the following components: \u2022 the susceptibility and degree of exposure of vul- nerable elements (population, critical facilities, built environment and regions affected), and \u2022 the ability to respond (coping) and recover from the disastrous impact of a tsunami. The vulnerability assessment results allow monitoring and quanti\ufb01cation of the spatial vulnerabilities within the timeline of disaster occurrence. That means that, at each location, people\u2019s vulnerabilities to tsunami warning (e.g. people\u2019s ability to receive and under- stand a warning, ability to take an evacuation deci- sion), to respond immediately (ability to evacuate and to reach a safe area), and to restore their livelihoods are quanti\ufb01ed. At sub-national scale, the assessment of vulner- ability to tsunamis, linked to the question of effec- tive people-centered early warning, encompassed different indicators that help to estimate the ability of people to respond to a tsunami (Fig. B8). Areas where people face unusual dif\ufb01culties to cope with a tsunami are disclosed and can be reduced when promoting respective adaptation and mitigation strategies. At the community level, vulnerability assessment products are being developed, taking into consideration speci\ufb01c local planning needs in the context of disaster manage- ment (e.g., for evacuation and contingency planning, Fig. C11). The vulnerability assessment results address speci\ufb01c end-users, such as early warning centres and disaster management agencies. J\u00f6rn Birkmann (UNU-EHS), Joachim Post (DLR) and Herryal Z. Anwar (LIPI) Physical dimension The following account deals with physical vulnerability (also referred to as \u201cstructural\u201d vulnerability) relating to tsunami impacts. It should be recognised that, in the case of near- \ufb01eld events, earthquake damage and loss may impact communities before a tsunami impacts. Damage and losses due to the tsunami impact will be compounded. Physical (or structural) damage to buildings as a conse- quence of tsunami impact is characterised by features such as: \u2022 failure of structural members including columns or load-bearing walls due to impact loads from hydrody- namic forcing or the momentum of \ufb02oating debris; \u2022 collapse of in\ufb01ll wall panels due to strong lateral loads; and \u2022 the undermining of foundations due to scour. The assessment of physical vulnerability would focus on the characterization of the combination of construction materials, building techniques, and the overall architec- tural design, which could be then related to damages which are typically observed. For example, the use of reinforced, con\ufb01ned masonry, using cement blocks or clay-bricks in the construction of houses, reduces the vulnerability of such houses when compared with mate- rials without any reinforcement or con\ufb01nement. A starting point for this assessment is the compilation of a buildings exposure database which identi\ufb01es the critical parameters relating to physical vulnerability. An example is the NEXIS database for residential buildings in Australia (Box B9). Fig. B8. Tsunami vulnerability at a local scale expressed as a warning response map.

It is built from a number of fundamental data- sets, such as Census, Mesh blocks, Cadastre, ABS Housing Survey and the Geo-coded National Address Framework. NEXIS-Residential is used to estimate the number of residential buildings affected by a tsunami event. Business or commercial buildings and infrastructure are not considered in this project as this NEXIS component is not yet mature and the vulnerability models are developed only for residen- tial buildings. The input datasets are of various quali- ties and resolutions; therefore NEXIS derives build- ings-level information based on generic rules and assumptions which produce errors and uncertainties. Any estimates of damage based on these data there- fore are compared on a relative scale, rather than in absolute \ufb01gures.

Krishna Nadimpalli Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it Buildings exposed to tsunamis are subject to buoyant, hydrostatic, and hydrodynamic forces. Damage may result from a combination of these factors. The level of damage sustained is dependent on the magnitude of these forces as well as on the capacity of the structure to withstand them. The former is a function of the height and velocity of the \ufb02ow, while the latter is determined by the building\u2019s physical vulnerability. Both of these factors can exhibit considerable variability across an inundation zone and thus the spatial pattern of damage may also be variable (Fig. B9). In addition, impact forces produced from debris transported by the tsunami and secondary effects such as \ufb01re may compound the level of damage. The assessment of physical vulnerability is particularly important in the identi\ufb01cation of buildings suitable for vertical evacuation (Fig. B9 and see also C1.3). In calculating potential damage resulting from a partic- ular hazard scenario, the maximum water height at the structure of interest is the most important parameter. You may see this referred to as the transfer parameter. Water height plus \ufb02ow velocity would provide a better understanding of the forces to which the structure is subject, though most damage models (used to link the hazard to damage or loss) do not require velocity as a parameter. The type and quality of construction can have a signi\ufb01cant effect on the damage sustained and these should be factors should be taken into account when vulnerability assessments are being undertaken. Available damage functions focus on empirically based (post-impact) approaches that relate observed damage to an inundation parameter, such as the water depth above ground at the structure of interest. (Damage func- tions are a method of linking hazard to damage or loss, which is related to risk). Observed damage is typically described qualitatively using a classi\ufb01cation comprising four or \ufb01ve different damage states, some of which have been derived to be consistent with those developed for seismic damage assessment.

However, in the absence of other models, and considering the uncertainties that exist within all of the damage models described, they can provide a useful initial estimate. The vulnerability models are usually developed based on limited data found in the literature as well as observations from historic events like the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The models incor- porate the following parameters which are considered to in\ufb02uence building damage: \u2022 inundation depth at building site; \u2022 inundation depth in building above \ufb02oor level; \u2022 building materials and types of construction; and \u2022 distance from the shoreline or channel. Overall, despite many research initiatives, the develop- ment of a satisfactory methodology for assessing phys- ical vulnerability is still immature. Economic dimension The economic dimension of vulnerability is related to the susceptibility of livelihoods, income, and economic activity to be affected by a tsunami scenario. The term \u201ceconomic\u201d is so broad, that it is dif\ufb01cult to make generalizations. The variety of manifestations of formal and informal economies, the interconnectivity between commercial services and economic activity, and the links between local and national levels in terms of supply, demand, and routine transfer of merchandise make it dif\ufb01cult to structure the analysis of this dimen- sion of vulnerability in a simple framework. Considering the concepts of direct and indirect vulner- ability; direct vulnerability focuses on the predisposi- tion of businesses and economic activity to short-term disruption. In contrast, indirect vulnerability addresses their predisposition to long-term, or even permanent, disruption (see boxes B10 and B11). Considering the reliance of economic activity on the commercialization of merchandise or products of a various kinds, the vulnerability of such merchandise and products is an element to assess within the scope of this dimension. Important aspects to consider would be the susceptibility of damage or destruction of merchandise when coming into contact with a tsunami wave (for example, cement powder or paper products). Other elements related to this dimension are related to commercial operations (cash or credit transactions). Economic losses can be broadly classi\ufb01ed as tangible or intangible, and sub-categorised into direct and indi- rect losses. In terms of estimating losses in respect of tsunami inundation, tangible direct losses are de\ufb01ned as losses resulting from the impact of the event such as physical damage to buildings, infrastructure, contents, and vehicles. Tangible indirect losses measure the disruption to businesses, transport and utility networks, clean-up costs, and emergency response and relief costs incurred as a consequence of the event. The extent of the indirect costs is dependent on the availability of alternative sources of supply, markets for the products and the length of the production distur- bance. Intangible indirect losses from natural disas- ters include death and injury, and loss of memorabilia. Intangible direct losses incorporate household disrup- tion (schooling, social life), and health effects. There are no market values for intangible losses but non-market Fig. B10.

Direct and indirect economic vulnerability of the \ufb01shing activity in Galle, Sri Lanka The \ufb01shing sector in Galle could be characterized via a formal component, which is characterized in terms of formal enterprises that make use of \ufb01shing \ufb02eets, permanent workers, and formal economic practices, leading to the commercialization of \ufb01sh at the regional, national, or even international level. In contrast, there is an informal component characterized in terms of local communities of \ufb01shermen which make use of small, personal \ufb01shing vessels, and who market their products in the local \ufb01sh markets through the informal economy. Economic activity, in either case, depends on the use of \ufb01shing vessels and equipment.

Direct economic vulnerability of petrol stations in Galle, Sri Lanka The city of Galle has nine petrol stations serving local and district needs. Four of these were exposed to tsunamis resulting in: \u2022 injury of staff operating the stations; \u2022 destruction of pumps to deliver fuel to vehicles; \u2022 contamination of storage tanks; and \u2022 loss of \ufb01nancial resources as cash and credit vouchers. The vulnerability of pumps relates to the fact that they are not properly anchored, nor designed to resist a tsunami impact. The vulnerability of the storage tanks relates to the fact that they were not properly designed to avoid the introduction of a tsunami surge once pumps become dislodged, and the fact that fuel inside such tanks may become contaminated. The vulnerability of \ufb01nancial resources was high in the context of credit vouchers typically used; as such, paper vouchers have no resistance in the event of a tsunami surge. Juan Carlos Villagran Box B12. Economic impacts of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in Aceh Province, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka In Aceh Province, the immediate economic impact (total damage and loss due to the earthquake and tsunami) was estimated by the World Bank at about US$4.45 billion. Of that amount, 60% was damage (direct loss) and 40% was loss of income \ufb02ow to the economy (indirect loss). The sector most affected was agricul- ture, in particular, \ufb01sheries. Half of the \ufb01shermen were con\ufb01rmed dead and 40%\u201360% of coastal aquaculture ponds were seriously damaged. It was also estimated that 60%\u201375% of the small-scale \ufb01shing \ufb02eet and its associated gear were destroyed. In Sri Lanka, damage to the national economy was esti- mated at around US$1 billion or 4.5% of the GDP, and the cost of reconstruction at US$1.5\u20131.6 billion. Tourism and \ufb01shing suffered massively in the tsunami-affected areas. More than 80% of the island\u2019s \ufb01shing \ufb02eet was wiped out. Approximately 30% of the room capacity of tourist hotels was damaged. While the rice crop was not badly affected, it was noted that heavy loss of life would probably lead to a manpower shortage affecting the harvest. Source: Athukorala and Resosudarmo, 2005 Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it valuation techniques can be implemented to provide proxy values. Ideally, an assessment of economic vulnerability in respect of a potential tsunami inundation will incorpo- rate all the above loss categories. However, in the \ufb01rst instance, tangible losses are likely to be suf\ufb01cient in providing conservative estimates of economic losses. Intangible losses are more dif\ufb01cult to estimate, given the need for proxy values. In any case, as direct tangible losses follow most directly from the physical impact, and are the simplest to obtain, they are also the most readily developed and applied on a regional or national scale. The economic assessment should establish those criteria and features of economic sectors that deter- mine their vulnerability to tsunamis. This should cover direct impacts regarding the location of activities as well as indirect disruption of economic activities and critical infrastructures through the interruption of, for example, transport lines or distribution networks. Dependencies between different economic sectors and critical infra- structures should be assessed. Electricity can play a crucial role for business continuity in the context of the tsunami hazard; the potential losses in different sectors in the event of the destruction of a generating site should be taken into account. Guidance on the categorization of economic vulnerability in terms of loss levels may be found in the ECLAC publi- cation described in Box B13 (see also B2.6).

Vege- tated sand dunes appear to have provided an excellent \ufb01rst line of defence. The damage to coastal ecosystems was highly variable, and the damage to coral reefs was mostly due to the impact of debris and sediment \ufb02ushed from the land. Assessment of environmental vulnerability includes the appraisal of the predisposition of ecosystems, natural resources and environmental services to be affected (through depletion or degradation) by tsunami inunda- tion. Elements that can in\ufb02uence environmental vulner- ability are: \u2022 exposure to toxic and hazardous pollutants; \u2022 inappropriate waste management; and \u2022 physical degradation. Parameters that need to be taken into account are: \u2022 surface water; \u2022 groundwater; \u2022 soil; \u2022 ecosystems; \u2022 ecosystem services including natural defences; \u2022 landscape / topography; \u2022 dependency of coastal community on environmental resources and services; and \u2022 linkages between environmental resources and land management. For each of these parameters, properties that could be affected by tsunami inundation should be identi\ufb01ed. For example, the surface water parameter has to be assessed in terms of potential salinity, contaminants and the pres- ence of debris. The possible impact for each selected property should be assessed, taking into account the environmental coping capacity both with, and without, human intervention. Such analysis will facilitate the prioritization of mitigation and rehabilitation measures. The level of dependency of the coastal community on the resource base, such as surface water, should also be appraised in case of contamination resulting from a tsunami impact. Thus the overall level of environmental vulnerability depends on the quality and fragility of the environmental resource base, as well as the dependence of the community on this resource base (see Box B16).

The ECLAC Handbook for Estimating the Socio-economic and Environmental Effects of Disasters The Handbook describes a tool that enables one to identify and quantify disaster damages by means of a uniform and consistent methodology that has been tested and proven over three decades. It also provides the means to identify the most affected social, economic and environmental sectors and geographic regions, and therefore those that require priority atten- tion in reconstruction. The degree of detail of damage and loss assessment that can be achieved by applying the Handbook will, however, depend on the availability of quantitative information in the country or region affected. The methodology presented here allows for the quanti\ufb01cation of the damage caused by any kind of disaster, whether man-made or natural, whether slowly evolving or sudden. The application of the methodology also enables one to estimate whether there is suf\ufb01- cient domestic capacity for dealing with reconstruction tasks, or if international cooperation is required.

Contamination and salination in Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, water wells remained contaminated months after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This forced the Red Cross and the Government to supply potable water to rural communities located on the coast for quite some time. In addition, salination of the soil used for agricultural purposes decreased agricul- tural yields. While it is not expected that such a condi- tion will be permanent, restoration of affected ground by rain-fed leaching could take years. Source: Renaud, 2006 Box B15. Coastal ecosystems providing natural defences to tsunami impact in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka offers some of the best evidence that intact coastal ecosystems, such as coral reefs and healthy sand dunes, helped buffer aggressive waves. For example, most of Yala and Bundala National Parks were spared because vegetated coastal sand dunes completely stopped the tsunami, which was able to enter only where the dune line was broken by river outlets. Some of the severest damage to Sri Lanka\u2019s coast was where mining and damage of coral reefs had been heavy in the past. Source: UNEP, 2005 Box B16.

B2.5 ASSESSING VULNERABILITY BY \u201cSECTORS OF DEVELOPMENT\u201d A recently introduced approach to the assessment of vulnerability is through sectors of development. From a policy-relevant point of view, this approach encourages agencies in charge of these sectors to take responsibility concerning vulnerability reduction within their respective sectors (Table B6). The employment of this approach has been proposed from the policy perspective. It promotes the assigna- tion of responsibilities regarding the reduction of vulner- abilities to those private or public institutions in charge of each sector. These institutions may be government departments or agencies and may span various political- administrative levels. Vulnerability assessment within the context of the \u201csector\u201d approach starts by de\ufb01ning: \u2022 the hazard scenario and geographical levels at which the assessment is being made; then \u2022 the sector to be addressed; then \u2022 the component of vulnerability being assessed. The assessment then focuses on six components of vulnerability. Elements within each component are iden- ti\ufb01ed presumptively from a systematization of damages and losses during disasters. \u2022 The human condition/gender component relates to the presence of human beings and encompasses issues related to de\ufb01ciencies in mobility of human beings and gender. \u2022 The physical component relates to the predisposition of infrastructure employed by the sector to be dam- aged by an event associated with a speci\ufb01c hazard. \u2022 The functional component relates to the functions which are normally carried out in the sector and how these are prone to be affected. \u2022 The economic component is related to income or \ufb01- nancial issues which are inherent to the sector. \u2022 The administrative component relates to those is- sues associated with the management of routine operations and how such administrative issues can be affected by an event. Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it \u2022 The environmental component relates to the interre- lation between the sector and the environment and the vulnerability associated with this interaction. The \u201csector\u201d approach then identi\ufb01es options for each of these components and assigns weights to each option regarding their disposition to be affected by a scenario. A simple linear combination of the elements is carried out numerically to obtain a numerical output for the intrinsic vulnerability component. This can be characterized as low, medium or high, using a table of ranges. All numerical values regarding options, as well as weights to combine the elements, have been deduced by employing expert judgment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17393253-dac6-4c2c-a424-3860a9de936c": {"__data__": {"id_": "17393253-dac6-4c2c-a424-3860a9de936c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c6d39db06eaf139a484ab97d935ab36deff9bf1a0188eca9c2a8dc01448d6d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc1c3d6b-07d7-41e5-a995-90049acba778", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e9221134aec78fc69849e7ac6d8b802529dcdcd592206d3b7534639ada56ad1"}}, "hash": "d876a90d5a93567d50258177ae5d83f4eafe4984cbf80114061035b69171511e", "text": "B2.6 DETERMINING THE LOSSES FOR A TSUNAMI IMPACT EVENT The combined losses from a tsunami event are deter- mined by summing the potential losses from each loca- tion or source of loss into an aggregated value.

In terms of physical quantities, examples of aggregated losses might include estimates for: \u2022 length of coastline inundated; \u2022 the exposure; \u2022 the number of affected population; \u2022 casualties or deaths; \u2022 the number of buildings damaged or destroyed; \u2022 the extent of critical infrastructure damage, etc. In terms of environmental measures, examples would include: \u2022 the area of salt water intrusion; \u2022 the numbers of trees damaged; \u2022 the extent of coastline affected, etc. For social and economic consequences, estimates of the duration of inundation or resulting disruption to the community also represent measures of potential loss that can be quanti\ufb01ed and ranked for different events and their probabilities. Finally, all of these factors and others expressed here can be cast into an economic model in order to estimate the total economic impact of an event. As noted above (B2.4) economic losses are generally grouped in terms of: \u2022 direct losses (those arising from direct physical dam- age and cost of reconstruction); and \u2022 indirect losses (those arising from the loss of income or utility of an asset). Ultimately, the measures of loss and the values placed on community assets and their function must be assessed and validated at the community level. Thus, if environ- mental factors are highly important to the community, these factors must be weighted so that this importance is re\ufb02ected in the risk assessment. On the other hand, if the potential for loss of life is the main driver for the study, the focus of the risk assessment and basis for loss estimation will naturally be placed on inundation mapping together with buildings and infrastructure damage. In any case, the measures of loss that are included must be consistent with the mitigation measures that are available or appropriate to the situation. B2.7 OUTPUTS FROM THE VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT The outputs of the vulnerability assessment are typically presented in reports and may include a range of vulner- ability maps. Vulnerability maps represent the status of the coastal community in respect of a speci\ufb01ed level of inundation (linked to a speci\ufb01ed tsunami scenario). They are a powerful tool for emergency management. Maps covering a range of hazard scenarios and depicting a range of vulnerability levels may be envisaged.

Vulnerability levels provide key guidance in the provision of speci\ufb01c advice to coastal managers and planners in linking the output of the vulnerability analysis to the input for mitigation. When integrated with the assessed probability of a hazard scenario, they provide an indication of the level of risk \u2013 the probability of the assessed consequences \u2013 for communities in the de\ufb01ned coastal area (see B4). Key outputs and results associated with the vulnerability assessment may include: \u2022 an asset database (or inventory); \u2022 an exposure database; \u2022 a preliminary appraisal of vulnerability in respect of exposure due to tsunami inundation carried out (perhaps leading to a preliminary risk appraisal), so that local authorities and disaster reduction and pre- vention agencies may appreciate the importance of setting up a plan for vulnerability assessment of the designated coastal area; \u2022 in-depth assessments of each dimension of vulner- ability and its potential consequences in respect of speci\ufb01ed hazard scenario(s); \u2022 vulnerability maps and reports produced, with the involvement of end users, for the designated coastal areas, whether at the regional or the local scale, cov- ering each dimension of vulnerability, and aggregated vulnerability, for speci\ufb01ed hazard scenario(s); \u2022 vulnerability maps and reports covering future sce- narios, taking into account the likely effects of im- proved emergency preparedness and mitigation; reports relating to \u201csectors of development\u201d as ap- propriate; and \u2022 communication of the vulnerability assessments to all involved in risk assessment and emergency man- agement.

Another possible de\ufb01ciency might be related to the lack of risk transfer mechanisms, such as insurance, micro- insurances, catastrophe bonds, or national emergency funds, enabling impacts to be confronted and facilitating a quick recovery (C2.3). Opinion is divided as to whether de\ufb01ciencies in prepared- ness should be assessed as a dimension of community vulnerability (B2.4) \u2013 \u201cinstitutional vulnerability\u201d. The presence of good institutionalized capacities, effective organizations and good governance may be seen as reducing vulnerability. However, from a policy-relevant point of view, the responsibility concerning preparedness should be placed on those agencies which are in charge of preparedness (national or local emergency commit- tees), while vulnerability should be the responsibility of those who generate it. For the latter reason, in these guidelines the topic of \u201cde\ufb01ciencies in preparedness\u201d is treated separately from vulnerability assessment. In general, weaknesses in preparedness may be grouped into: \u2022 weaknesses in early warning systems and respons- es in the event of a warning; \u2022 weaknesses related to the post-impact response; and \u2022 lack of (or weaknesses in) risk transfer mechanisms facilitating post-impact recovery. B3.1 ARE THE EARLY WARNING PRACTICES EFFECTIVE? The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami manifested major weak- nesses in early warning. While scientists in charge of the Paci\ufb01c Tsunami Warning Centre were able to fore- cast the potential tsunami, they did not have effective contacts within agencies in the various countries of the Indian Ocean to transmit the information so that such", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f770fbfe-9b7e-42a4-8afe-717da77757d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "f770fbfe-9b7e-42a4-8afe-717da77757d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95203a92d7034082a5f477c691eece89750b5cbe26b745d2b7801cb1db7a74be"}, "3": {"node_id": "85244c0a-e257-4538-93bc-c71963a0fad2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a86c0de0e76991ce3a50251ec7004ffaf0f21f7ba7b11c0fb6e69038ea46e27a"}}, "hash": "ca3930b34bed0c807b4df1dd50896f05db3d1a28b6c35c0686b86972a13e52ba", "text": "agencies could issue a warning. The only available route was through the U.S. State Department in Wash- ington D.C., which relayed the warning through the U.S. embassies in these countries. For many countries, the message arrived too late for appropriate responses to be implemented. A review of critical issues that hindered the ef\ufb01cient and timely operation of early warning systems has led to the identi\ufb01cation of four elements: \u2022 the implementation of technically-oriented early warning systems, without taking into consideration the notion of vulnerable groups and risk assess- ment; \u2022 weaknesses in monitoring and forecasting of poten- tially catastrophic events; \u2022 weaknesses in the emission of warnings, or in en- suring that warnings reach vulnerable communities; and \u2022 weaknesses in capacities to respond to a warning and to a potentially catastrophic event. In many Indian Ocean countries, the term \u201ctsunami\u201d was largely unknown before the December 2004 event. Thus, the transmission of an early warning targeting tsunamis may not have been properly understood by coastal communities, resulting in an inappropriate response. In some cases, there were limitations in communications which prevented agencies from issuing warnings. In others, people were unaware of safe areas for evacua- tion. The lack of awareness, compounded with a lack of evacuation route signage (Fig. C7), compounded losses. So long as these weaknesses are present, early warning B3 Are your communities properly prepared?

B3.2 WOULD THE RESPONSE TO A TSUNAMI BE TIMELY AND EFFICIENT? Another weakness in preparedness relates to the poor capacities of organizations to respond in case of an event. Such a response involves a coordinated approach that considers the type of event and the peculiarities of its manifestation. A lack of inter-institutional coordination can lead to the duplication of effort in some places, the response voids in others, and to costly delays in decision making. In developed countries, the use of Emergency Operation Centres in conjunction with Standard Operating Proce- dures allows emergency managers to minimise such inef\ufb01ciencies. In any case, Search and Rescue Operations for natural hazard disasters are critical to minimizing loss of life. To this end, teams of experts in these types of activities have the task of locating trapped and injured people, so that they can be transported quickly to a health centre for treat- ment. In the particular case of tsunamis, it is important to be aware that the inundation may be manifest in perhaps as many as three or four huge waves. Thus, teams must be properly trained in the nature of tsunamis, so that they do not end up as victims themselves. B3.3 TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE RISK TRANSFERRED? In developed countries, the use of insurance allows people to transfer their risks in time. Through the payment of premiums, people can manage the impacts of \ufb02oods or other disasters in a less traumatic fashion. In developing countries, the use of insurance is still only an option for those who can afford it. To this end, it is important to \ufb01nd ways in which to design and operate insurance schemes which may allow people to cope with such events and to recover in a timely fashion (C2.3). B3.4 OUTPUTS FROM THE PREPAREDNESS ASSESSMENT The outputs of the assessment of de\ufb01ciencies in preparedness are typically presented in reports and may include a range of maps.

It explains how you can inte- grate the information on the tsunami hazard with the information on the consequences of a tsunami impact on your communities (their vulnerability and prepared- ness) to provide a risk assessment in respect of the tsunami hazard \u2013 providing a measure of the probability of those consequences (Fig. B11). Its assessment is a logical outcome of the processes involved in the hazard, vulnerability and preparedness assessments. As with those assessments, it assumes a de\ufb01nition of its spatial and temporal scales, and its geographical limits. One may consider the risk from a particular event of interest, or risk may be aggregated across a suite of events or all possible events at all probabilities (or return periods). .

The vulner- ability component (B2) should have de\ufb01ned the losses and damages in respect of the social, physical, economic and environmental dimensions of interest. The prepared- ness assessment (B3) should have characterized those limitations which inhibit the community from responding ef\ufb01ciently and in a timely way during a speci\ufb01c event to minimize fatalities or losses (Fig. B11). The quality of the risk estimates depends on the reli- ability of the hazard assessment and on the availability and quality of vulnerability data. Subject to these require- ments, risk estimates may be derived for any chosen scale (for example, from individual buildings to the coastal built environment at the national scale), for any speci\ufb01ed dimen- sion of vulnerability, and for any speci\ufb01ed development sector. Estimates of risk can (and should) be customised. In this way they can meet the speci\ufb01c requirements of the risk manager, the planner or the emergency manager within the de\ufb01ned geographic area. B4.2 MAKING AND USING RISK MAPS A convenient and effective way of representing levels of risk (or of estimated risk) is geospatially, by means of risk maps.

Possible criteria for deter- mining risk categories for speci\ufb01ed scenarios include the following: \u2022 No impact (or risk) = No direct damage from tsunami inundation is likely. May be suitable for staging recov- ery operations such as evacuation shelters and other emergency services. \u2022 Low impact (or risk) = Damage likely to older build- ings or non-engineered buildings or structures is likely. Life-threatening particularly to young, elderly and in\ufb01rm. Some potential for locating or identifying structures suitable for temporary evacuation purpos- es. Requires emergency response planning includ- ing evacuation plan in the event of a tsunami. \u2022 Medium impact (or risk) = Signi\ufb01cant damage to non-engineered buildings and some damage to engi- neered structures likely. Highly life-threatening to all. Evacuation necessary to mitigate loss of life. \u2022 High impact (or risk) = Buildings and human life are unlikely to survive. Evacuation is the only viable re- sponse measure. Risk maps can be derived using GIS technology by over- laying hazard and vulnerability maps. Risk maps are often de\ufb01ned in relation to a speci\ufb01c hazard scenario and are perhaps the simplest and most effective tool at the community level for input to a wide range of decision making with a view to risk reduction (\ufb01gs B12 and B13).

An assessment of risk needs to be more than just a snapshot of risk under present conditions. The assess- ment needs to address how risk might change with time. This might be caused by changing socioeconomic and environmental scenarios, as well as by the outcomes of existing and planned mitigation measures. Successful mitigation can reduce risk by constraining the hazard (for example, by establishing barriers to inun- dation) and/or reducing the vulnerability (for example, by introducing building codes).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cde1ccae-4a98-472a-becd-b3c53649cbf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "cde1ccae-4a98-472a-becd-b3c53649cbf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2cf9cedc1afc9c50664dd0abb43da2275c5a208e7ee0069fb53aa5adfe193f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e7b12b5-3b95-4f6a-a766-32fb7121609d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "787a0283d80a8cce2b96a4d7a0d427be46bb6845ee7dadaf1aae56fb37339873"}}, "hash": "96e5a81af9c492afb54bd893aca6bbe999396e0eaef27f59d8c617456bf04ab8", "text": "However, environmental changes such as sea-level rise will increase the risk, because such changes modify the exposure of coastal areas to the hazard.

The assessments are vital inputs to policy- making, determining the nature and level of response for mitigating tsunami risk. B4.3 MAKING A QUANTITATIVE RISK ASSESSMENT The following account provides more detail in the meth- odology and options for combining the assessment of tsunami hazard with vulnerability to determine risk. In this more formal and quantitative approach, the estima- tion of risk must include information about the likelihood of a tsunami event occurring, together with information about the impact of that event or the resulting loss. The total risk is determined by combining the likelihoods and impacts or losses of the range of all possible events together. As described in the guidance on the production of risk maps (B4.2), impact or loss can be described in terms of a wide range of consequences including physical damage, human casualties or fatalities, economic loss, loss of social and environmental services and infrastruc- ture. All of these represent elements of impact or loss. The losses from a particular event will be a function of the dimensions of vulnerability that are of interest, as discussed in B2.4. Developing a \u201crisk curve\u201d For some decision-making applications, it is useful to capture information about all possible damaging events that could occur, as well as their consequences, in the formation of a risk curve, where the likelihoods and conse- quences of damaging events can be ranked in order of their severity (Fig. B14). Risk curves are commonly used in quantitative risk assessment, including insurance and engineering applications. Risk curves can be applied to potential losses at the level of an individual household, facility or property, or at an aggregated level for an entire Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it Fig. B13.

This map, covering the southern coasts of Java and Bali, shows the tsunami risk aggregated on village administrative level, combining hazard and vulnerability information. Source: GITEWS Project. Courtesy DLR, UNU-EHS community. Risk curves also provide the opportunity to compare risks to a community at different levels of probability, differences in risks between communities, or between different hazards to the same community. Risk curves can also be combined for different hazards or communities to provide all-hazard estimates of risk across a range of probabilities (or return periods) such as for national-scale assessments where the allocation of mitigation resources will often compete with a variety of other disaster management priorities. Fig. B14 demonstrates the concept of a risk curve. The risk curve is expressed as the amount of loss as a func- tion of the probability (or likelihood) of losses of any given amount being exceeded. (For this reason, risk curves are also referred to as loss exceedance curves.) Formally, the risk curve is actually constructed by ordering all events that are possible, as derived from the hazard assess- ment, from smallest to largest loss. The probability of exceeding a value of loss is then determined by adding up the probabilities of all events whose losses are esti- mated to be greater than any given loss value.

Determining hazard probabilities In order to demonstrate this concept, consider 5 events with losses X1 to X5 (X5>X4>X3>X2>X1), and hazard probabilities P1 to P5.

This is the probability of exceeding a given loss value in a period of one year. Using this risk-based or \u201closs- exceedance\u201d construct, the \u201c100-year event\u201d is more accurately de\ufb01ned as the event whose loss has a probability of 1/100 of being met or exceeded at least once during a one-year period. For very rare events, including most tsunamis, this is roughly equivalent to the event that occurs approximately once in 100 years. However, in reality, tsunamis events do not occur at regular intervals. Most recorded events tend to occupy the higher prob- ability, lower impact range of the curve; whereas, cata- strophic (or high impact) events tend to be low prob- ability (i.e., rarer). The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami is a clear exception in that, at many locations, for example, Sri Lanka and Sumatra, and certainly for the Indian Ocean region as a whole, it would be classi\ufb01ed at the extreme end of this curve. Purely from a tsunami hazard perspec- tive, this event is considered to represent a 500-year return period event for the Indian Ocean region. How the consequences of this event rank on any given risk curve depends on the area or community of interest and the vulnerabilities that are considered. The consequences also depend on the extent to which other hazards are included in the assessment. For instance, for Sri Lanka as a nation, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami represents the largest single loss of life from any event in its history; however, for India in the last several decades, there have been many other natural hazard events that have caused much greater loss of life. Thus, from a loss of life perspective, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami may represent a rare (for example, 500-year return period or greater) loss for some communities or nations, but will rank at very much higher probability for others. B4.4 OUTPUTS FROM THE RISK ASSESSMENT Key outputs and results associated with tsunami risk assessment may include: \u2022 assessments of risk for each dimension of vulner- ability (or sector of development) in respect of a tsu- nami scenario with a de\ufb01ned probability; \u2022 risk maps covering future scenarios as well as exist- ing conditions produced for the designated coastal areas, whether at the regional or the local scale, covering each of the different dimensions of vulner- ability (or each development sector) for the speci\ufb01ed tsunami scenario(s); and \u2022 effective communication of the risk assessment outputs to all levels involved in the coastal manage- ment process. The assessments are vital inputs to policy-making, determining the nature and level of response for risk reduction within the coastal man- agement plan.

This element of the guidance covers the procedures that you will need to prepare your communities for tsunami impacts and thus reduce the scale of a potential disaster. It deals with raising the levels of awareness of tsunamis, then describes tsunami early warning systems, including the IOC-coordinated regional Tsunami Early Warning Systems and the part that National systems play in these regional facilities. It includes information on evacuation procedures and shelters, and explains how community- based actions can contribute to risk reduction. Although addressed primarily at coastal practitioners and emergency managers, the guidance is relevant at all levels of society, at national, local and even individual levels. Thus, although this part of the guidance is entitled \u201cHow to improve your preparedness for tsunamis (as managers)\u201d, it is as much about how people at all levels can prepare themselves for tsunamis. A country\u2019s perception of the need for preparation depends on its perceived level of risk. The risk is a measure of the probability of the consequences of an assessed hazard. Section B has described how this level can be assessed, and how this level depends not only on the likelihood of a tsunami impact (expressed perhaps as a return period for a given height) but also on the vulnera- bility of the community including its supporting systems. Some countries may assess their risk as being low and 53 To be successful, the management of tsunami risk demands levels of cooperation and coordination between all the involved agencies which are dif\ufb01cult to achieve, even in developed countries. A key issue is the take-up of vulnerability and risk assessment knowledge by policy makers and those with responsibilities for risk management and mitigation. The practical application of vulnerability and risk knowledge in actions aimed at risk reduction may be facilitated by strengthening the involvement and co-ownership of the user community and public in the assessment agenda. This helps to establish the credibility, legitimacy and relevance of the research-based knowledge output among practitioners, and to lower the barriers to the take-up of assessment \ufb01ndings by policy makers. The successful application of vulnerability and risk assessments may be impeded by a lack of political commitment. However, coastal management frame- works, such as ICAM, may help to lower institutional barriers to the application of successful risk reduction measures. In addition to the guidance on managing tsunami risk provided in this section, the reader is referred to the treatment of this subject in a multi-hazard context in the IOC-ICAM hazard guidelines (UNESCO, 2009), which deal in greater depth with the options for stra- tegic mitigation. Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it thus have no imperative for response. At the other end of the scale, countries might anticipate much shorter return periods of damaging events. Such countries may know from their own experience, or their cultur- ally inherited knowledge, that awareness and prepara- tion for tsunamis may be vital for their wellbeing and survival. In the middle ground, there are those countries for which the tsunami risk may not be apparent because of long return periods. But even in some of those, there may be historical (including geological) records of past tsunami events impacting their shores on scales which, if they occurred today, would have serious conse- quences, causing major losses and damage to their coastal communities. For countries such as these, the appropriate management of tsunami risk is particularly challenging. Programmes of preparedness including public aware- ness, evacuation exercises and education aimed at improving community resilience may be some of the most cost-effective management responses, particu- larly in developing countries. However, it may be dif\ufb01- cult to sustain credibility and commitment amongst stakeholders where the return periods of damaging tsunami events stretch beyond the span of living memory. Such situations are especially problematic for coastal management. Coastal communities may be reluctant to forgo what they perceive as assured live- lihoods in potentially tsunami-prone areas on account of a threat of impacts which may not recur even over several generations. C1.1 COMMUNICATING AND ENHANCING AWARENESS OF TSUNAMI RISKS Tsunami survival can depend on education that raises awareness of tsunami risks and provides useful guid- ance on how to live with them. Education is especially important in communities where the felt shaking of an earthquake forewarns of a tsunami that comes ashore minutes later.

Advantage for others can still be gathered from eyewitnesses to even earlier tsunamis as well as from those who survived tsunamis of recent years (Fig. C2). C1.2 ESTABLISHING AN EARLY WARNING SYSTEM Early warning systems will save lives. An effective tsunami early warning system is achieved when all persons in vulnerable coastal communities are prepared and respond in a timely manner upon recognition that a potentially destructive tsunami may be approaching. The objective of a tsunami warning and mitigation system, such as the one that exists in the Paci\ufb01c (PTWS) and those that are being developed in the Indian Ocean (IOTWS), the Caribbean (CARIBE-EWS), and the North Eastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean and Connected Seas Fig. C1. The importance of local knowledge. Everyone knew to run to high ground immediately after an earthquake in the village of Langi, on Simeulue Island off Aceh. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which reached heights of 10 m to 15 m in the village, began its attack just 8 minutes after the earthquake. Though the waves destroyed all the buildings, all of the population survived. Several months later the villagers had constructed new houses (above) on the foundations of those swept away.

(NEAMTWS), is to effectively mitigate the hazard posed by local and distant tsunamis. Comprehensive tsunami preparedness and mitigation requires progress in three mutually dependent components: \u2022 \ufb01rst, the assessment of tsunami hazards and identi- \ufb01cation of vulnerable communities (see elements B1 and B2); \u2022 second, provision of warning guidance through a de- tection, threat evaluation and alert system that meets international to national to local requirements; \u2022 and third, the adoption of preparedness and mitiga- tion measures to reduce the impact and loss of life (this guidance and C.2). To achieve this objective, an end-to-end tsunami early warning system is needed that establishes national and regional warning systems for local, regional, and ocean- wide tsunamis, and promotes preparedness and risk reduction against tsunami hazards within a multi-hazard approach. Tsunami early warning requires a Regional Tsunami Watch Provider (RTWP) to monitor earthquakes and tsunamis and, when a tsunami threat exists, immedi- ately alert National Tsunami Warning Centres. National Tsunami Warning Centres may receive information and advice from international or regional watch providers to complement their national data streams (Fig. C3). National authorities must in turn provide understandable warning messages to local jurisdictions and/or the public to ensure that people along vulnerable coasts evacuate to safe areas (see Box C2). As a key component of an early warning system, sustained campaigns of public aware- ness, education, and outreach must be carried out. In detail, the architecture of an early warning system consists of the use of seismic, sea-level, and other geophysical data networks to rapidly determine the tsunamigenic potential of an earthquake and to con\ufb01rm the generation of a tsunami, the dissemination of that evaluation to proper national authorities and, in turn, the warning of the public through various communication technologies (Fig. C4; see also the IOC-ICAM hazard guidelines, UNESCO, 2009).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "838e3bbf-8647-4d5a-921b-03eea3e48da8": {"__data__": {"id_": "838e3bbf-8647-4d5a-921b-03eea3e48da8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8bab25f4c93fbf843268189c6f84071e54006d4cfa96d84f0a287821a717830"}, "2": {"node_id": "a281796f-af31-4e54-8d37-cab2112b88fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64cc6311c6f60c1215d710cc118cac11f502512e4e051fb8aefd5dcaf0d85d99"}}, "hash": "fc62edb232d4a6e7c4d85441ae2128aebeceda4aafbd7dc77b039fc6082cf48a", "text": "C4; see also the IOC-ICAM hazard guidelines, UNESCO, 2009).

Preparedness and early warning in eastern Africa, 2004 In eastern Africa, of\ufb01cial information, warning and response networks were non-existent prior to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Even when an of\ufb01cial response was generated in Kenya, the public demon- strated no faith or willingness to act on warnings from of\ufb01cials such as the police. Importantly, information on the tsunami and the generation of an of\ufb01cial response were dependent on two technologies, satellite televi- sion and mobile telephony. These should be built into future warning systems as key mechanisms and back- ups to of\ufb01cial information and warning networks. David Obura Local (near-\ufb01eld) tsunamis can impact shores within 10 minutes of the earthquake occurrence, so warnings must reach the public well within this time if they are to be even a little effective. Distant (far-\ufb01eld) tsunamis might take many hours to traverse an ocean. In these cases, National Tsunami Warning Centres and national disaster management organizations may have ample time to organize evacuations so that no one should lose their life on inundation. Local preparedness and commitment at all levels of the community are the keys for success. Ultimately, warning systems will be judged on their ability to reach people on the beaches and in low-lying coastal areas and to evacuate them to safe refuges before the \ufb01rst wave hits the coast (Box C3). Substantial knowledge and expertise in natural disaster management and mitigation are available to deal with the risks of tsunamis. In particular, invaluable experience and knowledge has been amassed in the Paci\ufb01c region, and now for the recent Indian Ocean tsunami, on how to assess tsunami risk at national and local levels (for example, these guidelines), how to promote awareness and preparedness, and how to build national and regional tsunami warning systems. Achieving success with early warning requires strong and sustained commitment by national governments. They must collaborate and work together in a regional framework to share data and they must jointly bear the cost for the regional elements of the network (Fig. C4). The need for regional collaboration is a result of the nature of tsunamis: local (near-\ufb01eld) tsunamis can be handled by National Tsunami Warning Centres; but, because regional or ocean-wide (far-\ufb01eld) tsunamis travel at 1000 km per hour as they propagate across the ocean, observational data is required from many countries in a region in order to accurately characterize the tsunamigenic potential of great earthquakes. To warn people of an impending tsunami without preparing them for such an event may be ineffec- tive. Preparing them through the provision of a public safety message that is clear, concise, and understand- able to every person, with directions on what to do and where to go, is essential (Fig. C5). Tsunami alerts Box C3. The need for an effective tsunami warning system in eastern Africa In Kenya, the \ufb01rst and largest surges (1 m to 1.5 m high) of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami occurred around 12.30 p.m. to 2 p.m. in low tidal conditions. If these had been larger tsunamis coinciding with high tide, impacts to lives and infrastructure on the Kenya coast would have been similar to those experienced in Asian coun- tries. While information on both the earthquake and tsunami was available on satellite television and was known to some people, the \ufb01rst responses occurred only when the surges started to impact the coastline. Private sector sources apparently correctly predicted the size and timing of the waves in East Africa, but this information did not go beyond individual recipients and clients of those sources. Privately, many residents and hotels along the coast responded to the obvious surges and news of the earthquake and tsunami by moving people off the waterfront.

Source: ITIC. Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it Proper instruments that enable the early detection of potentially harmful earthquakes and tsunamis. The data obtained by these instruments must be readily available to all nations continuously and in real-time to be effective. Warning systems that reliably inform the vulnerable populations immediately and in an understandable and culturally appropriate way. The Warning Centre must be able to analyze and forecast the impact of tsunamis on coasts in advance of the waves\u2019 arrival. The local, regional, and/or national disaster management organizations must be able to immediately disseminate information on the threat and to enable evacuation of all vulnerable communities. The communications methods must be reliable, robust, and redundant, and work closely with the mass media and telecommunications providers to accomplish this broadcast. Awareness activities that enable ordinary citizens to recognize a tsunami so that they know what to do. Citizens should recognize a tsunami\u2019s natural warning signs and respond immediately. This is especially true for the case of a local tsunami, which may hit within minutes and before an of\ufb01cial tsunami warning can reach their communities. Recognition and use of indigenous knowledge is important. Preparedness activities which educate and inform a wide populace, including government responders and those providing lifeline and critical infrastructure services, on the procedures and activities that must be taken to ensure public safety. Drills and exercises before an actual event, and proactive outreach and awareness activities are essential for reducing tsunami impact. Natural hazards science and disaster preparedness subjects that are part of the required curriculum taught to school children will prepare and carry awareness to the next generations. Gender-related issues in preparedness and family responses in emergencies need to be factored in. Planning activities that identify and create the public safety procedures and products and build capacity for organizations to respond faster. It is necessary to create and widely disseminate tsunami evacuation or \ufb02ooding maps, and instructions on when to go, where to go, and how to go. Evacuation shelters and evacuation routes need to be clearly identi\ufb01ed, and widely known by all segments of the coastal population. Strong buildings, safe structures, and prudent land-use policies to save lives and reduce property damage that are implemented as pre-disaster mitigations. Tall, reinforced concrete buildings may be adequate places to which people can vertically evacuate if there is no time to reach higher ground inland. Long-term planning to avoid placing critical infrastructure and lifeline support facilities in inundation zones will reduce the time needed for services to be restored. Stakeholder coordination as the essential mechanism that facilitates effective actions in warning and emergency response. Clear designation of the national or local authority from which the public will receive emergency information is critical to avoid public confusion, which would compromise public safety. High-level government advocacy that ensures a sustained commitment to prepare for infrequent, high-fatality natural disasters such as tsunamis. from Regional Tsunami Watch Providers (RTWPs) are the technical trigger for early warning. But any system will ultimately be judged by its ability to save lives, and simply by whether people move out of harm\u2019s way before a big tsunami hits. For this, seamless commu- nication is essential. The most important activity for building an effective end-to-end early warning system is stakeholder coor- dination (Fig. C6). Additionally, high-level Government advocacy and commitment is needed to make the system sustainable. Successful systems require coop- eration at all levels, a commitment of all stakeholders to work together during an actual tsunami warning emergency, and, over the long-term, a sustained effort to maintain awareness and preparedness at high levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe8825d7-7e82-454e-a16f-4b3afbd98d58": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe8825d7-7e82-454e-a16f-4b3afbd98d58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c081533563b25e206835865621767f8783858bd3df552a96be0d50ffb6c2aca"}, "2": {"node_id": "d089d5ea-d62b-457a-af9d-c789be826a9e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "170b39e5324f20b4dc72f335e4a80aa3f19138bdaa3cf8e5cd9916083d77e6c7"}}, "hash": "2e5be59307b4de14ce3dcf722f4e6f25c457548320832caab1308bc8478b0121", "text": "To build organizational support and long-term commitment, a Tsunami Coordination Committee is a mechanism that can bring together stakeholders from government and non-government agencies, science researchers, and the private sector.

We shall learn from every event, so that with time, each small step forward will contribute to building the preparedness for our future generations. C1.3 PREPARING FOR EVACUATION Evacuation zones, maps and signage Subject to the assessed level of risk in respect of a tsunami event (B3), emergency managers should place a priority on establishing and implementing a policy for the effective, orderly evacuation of the exposed popula- tion. The vulnerability maps derived from the inundation maps (B1) and the vulnerability assessment (B2) provide key information for evacuation planning. A consistent approach to evacuation zone identi\ufb01cation and mapping supports a common public understanding across commu- nities of tsunami evacuation zones, maps, tsunami evac- uation signage, and tsunami response actions. Tsunami evacuation zones The key consideration for tsunami planning and informa- tion requirements is the number of zones that should be used for evacuation management and the way in which the information might be depicted for the public. Use of a single tsunami evacuation zone has the advantage of simplicity for both emergency planning and public understanding. However, because a single evacuation zone must accommodate the very wide range of local risk scenarios that may exist, this can result in regular \u201cover-evacuation\u201d of the entire zone for common, small- scale events. Recurrent over-evacuation is likely to result in decreasing levels of community trust in emergency managers. Use of more than three or four evacuation zones may better re\ufb02ect the range of local tsunami risk scenarios. However, such differentiation requires far greater resources and a higher degree of coordination for planning and response, and the complexity of infor- mation may create public misunderstanding. Establishing evacuation zone boundaries The elevations and methods used to establish these zones are developed at local level, based on local hazard analysis and risk assessments. Evacuation zone bound- aries can be drawn based on a variety of hazard models. Zones ideally need to represent an envelope around all possible inundations from all known tsunami sources, taking into account all of the ways each of those sources may generate a tsunami. The high degree of uncertainty in tsunami source models, and the very time consuming and resource intensive nature of modelling make this comprehensive approach to tsunami risk assessment unlikely in the short term. The recommended approach to de\ufb01ning tsunami evacu- ation zones is to map now, and progressively re\ufb01ne the accuracy of boundaries as the science improves over time. It is recommended that authorities proceed with mapping based on current available information and knowledge and not wait for the perceived required knowl- edge. Zone boundary de\ufb01nition can then be re\ufb01ned as knowledge improves over time. Often authorities defend their hesitation to de\ufb01ne boundaries on the basis that they don\u2019t have suf\ufb01cient information. The \ufb01rst and basic means to de\ufb01ne evacuation zone boundaries is what we refer to as the \u201cbathtub\u201d model in which inundation is determined based on a uniform maximum elevation inland from the coast. This approach Fig. C5. Lea\ufb02et describing the tsunami early warning system, Sri Lanka. Source: UNU-EHS. Fig. C6. Stakeholder coordination is essential. A Tsunami Coordinating Committee engages all stakeholders to develop and participate in comprehensively reducing the risk from tsunamis. Key contributors are the scientists and engineers who assess and evaluate the risk, the tsunami warning centre which is responsible for rapid alerts, and government emergency services which must evacuate people before the tsunami arrives.

It is recommended that maps are available for display in homes, holiday homes, tourist facilities, workplaces and public buildings in areas subject to tsunami risk. High use coastal areas should prominently display evacuation maps as part of tsunami information boards. Maps should be prepared and deliv- ered in conjunction with planned tsunami signage place- ment depicting evacuation zones and routes on the ground. In addition to the number and appearance of evacuation zones on maps, the basic legend, instruction messages and supporting information on maps should be nationally consistent. To ensure common understanding across communities, maps should use the same or closely similar colours, the same names for evacuation zones, and common symbols. Tsunami evacuation signage Signage is an integral part of practical tsunami risk management. Signage depicting evacuation zones and routes raises public awareness of local tsunami risk and provides information to increase the ef\ufb01ciency and effectiveness of an evacuation (\ufb01gs C7, C8). Well placed evacuation signage is the critical link between the emer- gency response plan and an actual event. Evacuation planning Evacuation planning is a lengthy process and should be considered an ongoing endeavour which continues to improve in successive iterations. Consideration may be given to embedding such planning in the ICAM process (A1.5).The time taken for planning activities will be directly related to the: \u2022 geographical size of the management area; \u2022 regional topography; \u2022 regional hazards and vulnerabilities; \u2022 demographics; \u2022 size and density of the population; \u2022 number of agencies involved in the planning process; and \u2022 resources available. Evacuation in response to tsunamis generally implies voluntary and/or mandatory evacuation, both of which can place a signi\ufb01cant burden on the resources of emer- gency managers in terms of caring for the displaced people. The demands on emergency managers will change as the evacuation progresses though each of its phases (Fig. C9). Fig. C7. Safety instructions and signage for tsunami events.

As with all emergency planning, the process of evacua- tion planning itself is just as important as the \ufb01nal written plan (\ufb01gs C9 and C10). In addition to developing a working knowledge of the overall plan, this process also facilitates the development of relationships between stakeholders which helps to improve operational capacities.

The design should be based on the expected volume of humans and vehicles, speed of evacuation and safety. The design should primarily present the number of routes required, the width and the overall safety of the evacuation process. The design must ensure the safe passage of evacuation and consider the risk of failure of the route itself under disaster conditions. Such an approach will identify weak links which may have to be recti\ufb01ed in advance and also recommend alternative routes in the event of failure of a prescribed route. Evacuation structures The need for evacuation structures should be identi\ufb01ed with respect to the population at risk and time available for evacuation to safe places, if such places have been identi\ufb01ed. Evacuation structures are mandatory in the absence of safe places such as high ground or elevated infrastructure which can safely accommodate people at risk. Even if such safe places and facilities are available, it is necessary to be certain that the people at risk can be safely evacuated to such locations. If not, supple- mentary evacuation structures should be provided. For this purpose it is necessary to determine the critical time for the tsunami to reach a proposed safe place for a worst-case scenario after the warning is issued; also the maximum time required for evacuation (\ufb01gs C12 and C13). In the analysis a safety factor should be included to accommodate any potential delay in the evacuation process. Sometimes the need for evacuation structures may be avoided by having additional routes to the safe zones, thereby accommodating a reduced density of the human evacuation rate on a given route, leading to a higher rate of evacuation. Evacuation education and communication The community must be educated and made fully aware of the risk of hazard, potential disaster and the evacu- ation routes. Evacuation drills must be conducted to ensure training of the community on disciplined evacu- ation. A mechanism for this entire process to be moni- tored on a community-led, sustainable basis should be established. In effect it is necessary to ensure commu- nity ownership of this process. The maintenance of the evacuation route should be given high priority. The community must also develop an effective mechanism for communication duration the evacuation process. This will ensure the problems and issues of panic- stricken population who are on the move are swiftly handled and resolved, thereby minimizing the level of prevalent chaos. C1.4 PROMOTING COMMUNITY-BASED DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT How do communities deal with shocks of natural disasters? Following the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, sociologists have established that indigenous knowledge contributed directly in saving lives among the Moken (Thailand) and Simeulue (Indonesia) communities (see C1.1). These two success stories highlight the importance of commu- nities\u2019 abilities to cope with hazardous events. They also focus interest on the practice known as Community- based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM). Sadly, however, since the 2004 tsunami, many more catastrophic events have provided additional reminders of the vulnerability of many South Asian and Paci\ufb01c Ocean countries to natural disasters. These events included major earthquakes in China, Pakistan and India, devastating cyclones (typhoons) in Bangladesh, the Phil- Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it 61 Managing the tsunami risk Fig. C12.

Patterns such as these were observed in small island states (for example, the widespread sea swells in Maldives) and in countries where communities are prone to landslides and \ufb02oods (for example, Nepal, Sri Lanka). Because these low-intensity events failed to capture international attention, the recovery of those affected was unaided, their losses accumulating over time. In cases of these low intensity events, it is important to realise that it is the communities themselves that are the most important, often sole, agents for preparedness and remedial action. Recognizing this, the role of external actors is to support these communities through a system- atic approach that enhances community resiliency. Why use a community-based approach?

The importance of oral history The tsunamis on 26 December 2004 and 28 March 2005 killed only seven people on Simeulue Island in Indonesia\u2019s Aceh province. At Langi, on the north end of Simeulue, which is 40 km south of the December earthquake\u2019s epicentre, maximum wave heights exceeded 10 m less than 10 minutes after the shaking ceased. In the more populous south, wave heights averaged 3 m and caused signi\ufb01cant struc- tural damage, destroying entire villages. Oral histories recount a massive tsunami that occurred in 1907 and advise running to the hills after \u201csigni\ufb01cant\u201d shaking (~1 minute). All the interviewed Simeulue survivors knew of this event and of the necessary action. However, Jantang, on the Aceh mainland, suffered far more casualties. Simeulue\u2019s oral history provided an extraordinarily powerful mitigation tool that saved countless lives where even a high-tech warning system with a 15-minute response time would have been of no help.

Under this approach, the local community becomes not only part of planning and decision making, but also a major player in the implementation of those plans and decisions. Although the community is given greater roles in the deci- sion making and implementation process, CBDRM does not ignore the importance of scienti\ufb01c and objective risk assessment and planning for early warning. The CBDRM approach acknowledges that as many stakeholders as needed should be involved in the process, with the end goal of achieving capacity and resource transfer to the community, which would itself assume the main respon- sibility for disaster reduction. How would a tsunami risk assessment add value to CBDRM? Practitioners of CBDRM typically are trained to draw the appropriate participatory methodology from a \u201ctoolbox\u201d. However, opinions persist that, although these tools had been useful, a common and key weak- ness was the inadequate use of scienti\ufb01c information in risk assessment. Therefore the opportunity to apply these tsunami risk assessment and mitigation guide- lines to the CBDRM practice will be in the following, commonest CBDRM methods and procedures: \u2022 Participatory Risk Assessment Toolbox (including transect, seasonal calendar etc.). These methodol- ogies support community-level processes, where communities are engaged in understanding disas- ter risks, both realized/historical and unrealized/po- tential. The Guidelines should be able to foster a comprehensive understanding among communi- ties about risk as a con\ufb01guration of hazards, chang- ing patterns of vulnerability and community coping capacity. Communities would typically know about the realized risks that occurred in their living mem- ory (for example, the 1907 Simeulue Tsunami), but would be unable to anticipate future tsunami events including their sources. \u2022 Community meetings, face-to-face interaction, folk songs and traditional cultural presentation, and use of change agents that build awareness and develop public and culturally adaptable infor- mation programmes for preparedness. Studies resulting from tsunami risk assessment must be able to guide community education/awareness ac- tivities being undertaken under CBDRM. Besides, community facilitators or change agents must be knowledgeable of the results of risk assessment studies. \u2022 Community-level preparedness planning pro- cesses that engage members of the community. Results of risk assessment studies must provide an important input to stakeholders who would de- cide on the elements of community preparedness plan, i.e., contingency plan, evacuation plan, com- munity-based \ufb01rst aid and other life-saving skills enhancement. \u2022 Community-based warning system, including the practice of organizing and maintaining warning dis- semination volunteers\u2019 structure, use of indigenous resources like church bells, mosques, horns, local radio, etc. In many coastal communities, natural warning signs maybe more useful in saving lives, particularly for tsunamis resulting from local earth- quakes. A proper tsunami risk assessment study should be able to guide and enhance the effective- ness of a community-based warning system. \u2022 Processes that promote a culture of safety, particu- larly for future generations. The CBDRM tools that may be improved by a tsunami risk assessment in- clude: School-based education programmes; Edu- cation for Women; Education for people who have in\ufb02uence over communities, i.e., school teachers, religious leaders, local media, other traditional leaders. Box C6. Indigenous knowledge for disaster risk reduction Of the 52 people that died during the Solomon Islands earth- quake and tsunami in 2007, 31 (59.6%) were immigrant Gilbertese from Titiana, New Manra and Nusa Mbaruku that did not react properly because they had no memory in their culture of such an event. Kiribati is a coral atoll nation, situated far from any regular earthquake sources. Because there have been no major, tsunamigenic earthquakes in the 50 years since their emigration, they simply lacked the indig- enous knowledge of their adopted environment that could have helped save their lives.

C2.1 CONSIDERING THE OPTIONS FOR STRATEGIC MITIGATION The overarching goal of strategic risk management is effective and sustainable risk reduction. This entails choosing strategic management options for risk reduc- tion that are appropriate to the scale of the desig- nated coastal management area, balancing social and economic pressures against environmental consider- ations, including sustainability, over the long-term. Strategic mitigation of the tsunami risk may involve structural, commonly engineered measures that aim to protect coastal communities and their supporting systems; non-structural measures that aim to reduce risk by accommodating it through changes of individual to community behaviour and practice, and those that seek to reduce risk by promoting a retreat from the tsunami hazard by means of land-use planning and \ufb01nancial instruments (Fig. C.13). In practice, a coastal authority may adopt a risk management plan that incorporates all three types of measures. Some of the measures may encompass long timeframes, extending perhaps over several decades (C1). The treatment given for strategic mitigation in these guidelines should be considered only as an outline account. A more comprehensive description and review of the options open to policy makers and coastal engi- neers in respect of tsunami risk mitigation is available in the IOC-ICAM hazard guidelines (UNESCO, 2009). The application of decision-analysis tools Decision-analysis tools including bene\ufb01t-cost analysis and multi-criteria analysis can be very helpful in evalu- ating the bene\ufb01ts and drawbacks of the various options for mitigation. Bene\ufb01t-cost analysis involves the compar- ison of the total cost of one or more strategies with the total bene\ufb01ts it would provide.

Multi-criteria analysis does not require that all alternatives be placed in monetary terms but can incorporate both quantitative and qualitative data, including value judgements. While there are many different types of decision-analysis tools to select from, policy makers should be sure that the analysis will provide a reasonable comparison of the short- and long-term costs of protection, accommodation and retreat, and account for the major socio-economic and environmental costs of the alternatives as well. The need for public involvement Public opinion and wide stakeholder involvement are also valuable tools that should be included in the deci- sion-making process as the risk management strategy is developed. Public support and \u201cbuy-in\u201d is important for the success of the strategy as it is for the wider aspects of coastal management. To engage the public, policy makers should educate them about the risks and bene\ufb01ts and drawbacks of various management options. The public should have the opportunity to provide input on the level of risk that is acceptable or needs to be managed. The concept of \u201cliving with risk\u201d should be introduced in the context of mitigation. From a practical point of view, mitigation cannot eliminate risk and there are limits to the availability of funds for mitigation.

The possibilities of other phys- ical coastal hazards including storm surge inundation and coastal erosion affecting the shoreline of interest should also be considered in the formulation of such a plan. C2.2 USING NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL STRUCTURAL METHODS This part of the guidance deals with the options for reducing risk by coastal protection through structural means (Fig. C13). While the underlying principles of protection against coastal inundation and erosion are similar irrespective of the type of physical hazard, the scale of the structures capable of withstanding the hydrodynamics of tsunami \ufb02ow needs to re\ufb02ect the perceived level of tsunami hazard (B1). Furthermore, the possibility of long-term changes in coastal sedimentation and erosion, caused by changes in nearshore bathymetry resulting from a tsunami impact, should be considered. Fig. C13.

Blanket no-build zones are \u2018neither feasible nor sustainable\u2019 While it is laudable to try to protect at-risk communities from hazard events, international experience clearly shows that blanket no-build zones are neither feasible nor sustainable. A practical approach is necessary, in which risk assessments are undertaken to identify where return to original sites is or is not technically and environmentally feasible. These assessments should involve community representatives working with social and technical specialists, and assess the suitability of the original site for rehabilitation, including its vulnerability to various natural hazards, disease and environmental risks, the suitability of land for agricul- ture, and so forth.

This might be achieved through adoption of a single measure or, more usually, by a well integrated hybrid solution, comprising several measures and also satis- fying environmental concerns. Hybrid methods refer to combinations of arti\ufb01cial methods or a combination of natural and arti\ufb01cial methods. Natural solutions, such as planting mangroves, provide cost effective, envi- ronmentally friendly solutions to mitigate tsunami risk where there is with a low frequency of occurrence (Fig. C14).

These may be speci\ufb01ed in time and space to achieve a certain expected level of protection against existing or anticipated damage from tsunamis as well as other hazards. Such solutions can be proactive, leading to shoreline restoration and stability. A project monitoring and control system can also be incorporated within such a plan. Fig. C14.

These measures respectively: \u2022 reduce the impacts of tsunamis before they reach the shoreline (a partial barrier located in the near- shore zone); \u2022 protect the coastal area at risk by preventing the inland movement of tsunamis (a full barrier at the shoreline); and \u2022 reduce the impacts of tsunamis on entry to the shoreline (a partial barrier at the shoreline). Full and partial barriers, whether arti\ufb01cial or natural, are physical interventions which may be considered a protection solution for populated coasts. In designing arti\ufb01cial barriers it is necessary to ensure the continuity of sustaining multiple uses of the existing natural envi- ronment. From an engineering point of view, the design must be robust, functional and reliable. Due consider- ation should be given to convenient maintenance and effective operation. Equally it is important to minimize negative impacts on socioeconomic, livelihood and envi- ronmental issues. Sensitive landscaping of the environ- ment is a priority. Partial barriers in the nearshore zone Offshore tsunami breakwaters are usually partial barriers which dissipate part of the incoming tsunami\u2019s energy before the tsunami reaches the shore. These could also be designed as full barriers with the inclusion of a tsunami gate for complete closure. It is possible to integrate tsunami breakwaters within a strategic port development project; the principal breakwater of the proposed port would serve also as a tsunami breakwater. Coral reefs serve as natural breakwaters in dissipating tsunami- and other types of wave energy. This function is particularly effective during low-tide conditions, an aspect observed along the fringing reefs of the Kenyan coast during the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 (Box C3). Full barriers at the shoreline High-rise seawalls (dykes) constructed on the shore- line at or above the high water mark are designed to provide a full barrier against the tsunami propagation. Where the shoreline is interrupted by river mouths, tsunami gates can be installed within seawalls to allow for normal \ufb02ows and traf\ufb01c access. The closure of the gate prevents tsunami propagation. Sand dunes can provide natural full barriers against tsunami inun- dation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "50419f6d-ebf5-46f4-817f-dd08a8b29e8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "50419f6d-ebf5-46f4-817f-dd08a8b29e8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a02f9c3887be2287cbcf2b21f424414dcec27ab4adc2997c81838d79de6f60f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f8650ab-8f9e-4f8c-830b-446558933219", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f51efad78607aa628163887a9da6be7a2eaa775598964271281c5aa6ff3ccc5"}}, "hash": "b01a452f2dc34bc780970fa6fc0ebba21b0155ddd440748a25d304d8effb6678", "text": "Sand dunes can provide natural full barriers against tsunami inun- dation.

It is strongly recommended that sand dunes combined with coastal vegetation are adopted as a shoreline barrier where circumstances permit. Partial barriers at the shoreline Medium-rise seawalls (dykes) provide partial barriers against tsunami \ufb02ow and will prevent propagation up to speci\ufb01c design water levels. The design permits overtop- ping beyond these levels.

Coastal vegetation can be used to dissipate tsunami energy via turbulent \ufb02ow through the media. The effectiveness of dissipation is dependent on the density of vegetation, its overall porosity and its tortuous characteristics of porous matrix. It is important that the vegetation is itself resilient against tsunami propagation and have a root structure that can resist the high velocity regime at the \ufb02oor bed. Planting mangrove at appropriate locations can also serve to dissipate extreme wind wave energy (Fig. C14). The extent to which coastal trees, such as Casurinas, at the shoreline can act as bioshields is controversial. C2.3 USING NON-STRUCTURAL APPROACHES Non-structural measures that mitigate exposure and vulnerability to the hazard include: \u2022 hazard resilient buildings and infrastructure; \u2022 land-use planning including development \u201csetback\u201d; and \u2022 risk transfer. Hazard resilient buildings and infrastructure Coasts tend to be areas of high economic activity. However, it is not feasible to transfer all activities to areas that are completely free from potential tsunami risk. Therefore there may be a need to accommodate the risk (Fig. C13). The development and application of design guidance and construction manuals for tsunami-resistant housing and infrastructure form parts of this accommo- dation. It may be expected that properly designed struc- tures will withstand the impacts of tsunami with only limited damage. For coastal areas where safe evacuation refuges may be too remote for people to reach on foot, vertical evacuation structures may be necessary (C2.3). Such structures must be capable of withstanding the extreme conditions arising from a tsunami impact. Although cost may be an impediment to tsunami- proo\ufb01ng structures, national authorities may choose to make tsunami-proof structures with \ufb02ow-through designs, stronger buildings, and deeper scour-resistant foundations mandatory in areas of high risk. The orienta- tion of buildings with respect to the ocean is another factor for consideration. Particular attention should be directed to the security of structures used for vertical Tsunami risk assessment and mitigation for the Indian Ocean; knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it 69 Managing the tsunami risk evacuation shelters. In areas of low risk, the extent to which communities should accommodate the tsunami hazard may be dif\ufb01cult to determine, though the precau- tionary principle should prevail. It is recommended to develop and apply codes of prac- tice for the design of tsunami resistant structures (see B2.4). Two types of code are required: \u2022 Design Guidelines on Good Practice providing advice on concept, location, layout, orientation, structural con\ufb01guration, geotechnical considerations and other considerations leading to good design practice. Such designs will enhance the robustness of the struc- tures to withstand tsunami attack and other coastal hazard impacts without total collapse or failure. \u2022 Detailed Design Guidelines providing information on hydraulic and structural loads, geotechnical param- eters and detailed design information. The design approach should be based on the concept of design against failure and in this context attention must be focused on failure modes and the development of a \u201cfault tree\u201d. The overall design guidelines could be developed from the experience gained from post-tsunami impact damage assessments from different parts of the country. Such assessments should be analyzed in the context of the hydraulic regime which would have been generated by the tsunami at that location. Relevant information from other countries that have been affected by tsunamis will also be useful for this exercise. It is important that damage assessment should cover infrastructure that was destroyed; damaged; or survived (least affected). The proposed design guidelines should be applicable to the: \u2022 rehabilitation of damaged structures; \u2022 strengthening of existing structures (retro\ufb01tting); and \u2022 design of new structures. Countries may \ufb01nd widely varying recommendations for tsunami design loads. Some harmonization is desirable. Some attempts have also been made to produce qualita- tive guidelines for \u201cnon-engineered\u201d buildings. Land-use planning including development \u201csetback\u201d Land-use planning can be an effective means of imple- menting the option of managed retreat in tsunami risk mitigation (Fig. C13).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d894997-fe37-4304-ba2b-a957eacd9a76": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d894997-fe37-4304-ba2b-a957eacd9a76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af4209bfdfb0140a45e087082e766b867fa5b96d14c0a057f6705b3e12a760d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0a1054c5-f136-4a11-8226-1de029f11fa7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f371aac869b87c75022acebbfb889c3d843435b60c54048a3768b26eff519bb"}}, "hash": "5b7f3849a44911f35ddff62faa19a81c84cc4ecfaa36c26f7b6a6f97eafad07b", "text": "C13).

Setback lines are determined by local authorities, in some cases within a national legislative framework, to delimit exclu- sion zones for development in coastal areas that are perceived to be exposed to inundation or at risk from coastal erosion. In the Mediterranean region since January 2008, all countries that are signatories to the Barcelona Convention are bound to adopt setback plan- ning regulation. Development setbacks are intended to direct new development or redevelopment out of identi- \ufb01ed hazard areas and to protect natural hazard mitigation features such as beaches and dunes by restricting devel- opment seaward of a setback line, established parallel to the shoreline. The type of setback used, including how, and from where, it is established, can vary widely. The application of setbacks is a globally accepted good practice in coastal area management (see ICAM hazard guidelines, UNESCO, 2009). Risk transfer (see also B3.3) Insurance plays an important role in offering \ufb01nancial protection from the costs of \ufb02ooding. By spreading risk across policy-holders, insurance enables householders and businesses to minimize the \ufb01nancial cost of damage from inundation. Furthermore, because lenders are unlikely to offer mortgages on properties that cannot obtain build- ings cover, insurance plays a critical role in the operation of the property market. However, insurance can provide an effective mechanism for spreading the risk only if the risk is at a manageable level. Reinsurance is the insurance that insurers themselves take out to deal with catastrophic events/claims. It provides a mechanism that can help insurers provide \ufb01nancial protec- tion to developments located within the limits of potential inundation, and at risk from an inundation event. However, it is anticipated that reinsurers will become increasingly selective of the portfolios they are prepared to take on. Reinsurers model exposure based on the best-available estimates of risk. These are revised as more information becomes available, for instance following a catastrophic event. Where this reassessment leads to a limitation or withdrawal of reinsurance cover, insurers would need to re\ufb02ect this in the extent of insurance coverage and the premiums they charge. This underlines the need to take a precautionary approach to large aggregations of new development in potential inundation zones.

knowing your tsunami risk \u2013 and what to do about it 77 ACRONYMS AND ABBREVIATIONS Accommodation: The continued use of land at risk, without attempting to prevent land from being damaged by the natural event. This option includes erecting emergency \ufb02ood shelters, elevating build- ings on piles, converting agriculture to \ufb01sh farming or growing \ufb02ood/salt tolerant crops (Bijlsma et al., 1996). Climate change: Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identi\ufb01ed (for example, by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Climate change may be due to natural internal processes or external forcing, or to persistent anthro- pogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use. Note that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in its Article 1, de\ufb01nes climate change as: \u2018a change of climate which is attrib- uted directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods\u2019. The UNFCCC thus makes a distinction between climate change attributable to human activities altering the atmospheric compo- sition, and climate variability attributable to natural causes (IPCC, 2007). Community: The people with common interests living in a particular area; broadly: the area itself. (http:// www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community). In these guidelines, \u201cCoastal community\u201d includes its human and social aspects, its buildings, economic aspects and supporting environmental systems. Coping capacity: The means by which people or orga- nizations use available resources and abilities to face adverse consequences that could lead to a coastal disaster (UN/ISDR, 2004). Early warning: The provision of timely and effective information, through identi\ufb01ed institutions, that allows individuals exposed to a hazard to avoid or reduce their risk and prepare for an effective response (UN/ISDR, 2004). Ecosystem: A system of living organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. The boundaries of what could be called an ecosystem are somewhat arbitrary, depending on the focus of interest or study. Thus, the extent of an ecosystem may range from very small spatial scales to, ultimately, the entire Earth (IPCC, 2007). Emergency management: The organization and management of resources and responsibilities for dealing with all aspects of emergencies, in particularly preparedness, response and rehabilitation (UN/ISDR, 2004). Exposure: Elements at risk, an inventory of those people or artefacts that are exposed to a hazard (UNDP-BCPR, 2004). In these guidelines, \u201cexposure\u201d provides the spatial context for integrating hazard and vulnerability. Hazard: A potentially damaging physical event or phenomenon that may cause loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. A hazard is characterized by its location, intensity, frequency and probability (UN/ISDR, 2004). Inundation: The state of \ufb02ooding of coastal land resulting from the impact of a tsunami, storm surge or other coastal \ufb02ood hazard. Inundation line / limit: The line marking the maximum horizontal inland penetration of a tsunami, storm surge or other coastal \ufb02ood hazard from the shoreline. Joint probability: The likelihood of two or more hazard events impacting the same coastal area coinciden- tally. Land use and land-use change: Land use refers to the total of arrangements, activities and inputs under- taken in a certain land cover type (a set of human actions). The term land use is also used in the sense of the social and economic purposes for which land is managed (for example, grazing, timber extraction and conservation). Land-use change refers to a change in the use or management of land by humans, which may lead to a change in land cover (IPCC, 2007). Management unit: The geographical area under consid- eration for the purposes of risk assessment and miti- gation. This may be national in scale, or at the district or local levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49e1a9e3-490f-4a5b-8f41-33605d5ca8a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "49e1a9e3-490f-4a5b-8f41-33605d5ca8a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf2fc94510a3a4a3d8c9d9848c404033eb33f20aca762002dc553019bfcdd292"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a18f30e-9b1c-4f42-b563-343fa17dd7ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4258a88f3a5c718be03c76cea202bb697b63d0421c9008c5d57b8718adef48e"}}, "hash": "4070c59337a69e557f05566877bf5fc1805eec80fc87c8d3e85390f04635e043", "text": "This may be national in scale, or at the district or local levels.

This is particularly impor- tant for public of\ufb01cials in ful\ufb01lling their responsibilities to save lives and property in the event of a disaster. Rapid-onset hazard: A hazard that impacts over a short time-scale (minutes-hours), sometimes cata- strophically (Bogardi, 2006). Resilience: The capacity of a system, community or society potentially exposed to hazards to adapt by resisting or changing in order to reach and maintain an acceptable level of functioning and structure. This is determined by the degree to which the social system is capable of organizing itself to increase its capacity for learning from past disasters for better future protection and to improve risk reduction measures (UN/ISDR, 2004). Retreat: Abandonment of coastal area and the landward shift of ecosystems. This choice can be motivated by the nature of assets to be protected (Bijlsma et al., 1996). Return period: The average time between occurrences of a de\ufb01ned event (IPCC, 2007). Risk: The probability of harmful consequences, or expected losses (deaths, injuries, property, liveli- hoods, economic activity disrupted or environment damaged) resulting from interactions between hazards and vulnerable conditions (UN/ISDR, 2004). Intensive risk: The risk of catastrophic disasters in hotspots, where people and economic activities are intensively concentrated in areas exposed to large scale climatic and geological hazards Extensive risk: The risk of low intensity asset loss and livelihood disruption over extensive areas, where people and economic activities are exposed to highly localized, principally climatic hazard events. Risk assessment: A methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analysing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulner- ability that could pose a potential threat or harm to people, property, livelihoods and the environment on which they depend (UN/ISDR, 2004). Run-up: The difference between the elevation of maximum tsunami penetration (inundation line) and the sea level at the time of the tsunami. Scenario: A plausible and often simpli\ufb01ed description of how the future may develop, based on a coherent and internally consistent set of assumptions about driving forces and key relationships. Scenarios may be derived from projections, but are often based on additional information from other sources, sometimes combined with a narrative storyline (IPCC, 2007). In the context of tsunamis, the scenario can be a char- acterisation of any or all of the parameters related to a tsunami event, including the source (earthquake magnitude), the wave height in the coastal waters, the run-up, etc. Sea-level change: Sea level can change, both globally and locally, due to (i) changes in the shape of the ocean basins, (ii) changes in the total mass of water and (iii) changes in water density (IPCC, 2007). Storm surge: The temporary increase, at a particular locality, in the height of the sea due to extreme mete- orological conditions (low atmospheric pressure and/ or strong winds). The storm surge is de\ufb01ned as being the excess above the level expected from the tidal variation alone at that time and place (IPCC, 2007). Structural measures: Structural measures refer to any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, which include engineering measures and construction of hazard-resistant and protective structures and infrastructure (UN/ISDR, 2004). Susceptibility: The state of being vulnerable to a phys- ical or socioeconomic condition. In these guidelines, the terms \u201csusceptibility\u201d and \u201cvulnerability\u201d are taken as synonymous. Tide gauge: A device at a coastal location (and some deep-sea locations) that continuously measures the level of the sea with respect to the adjacent land. Time averaging of the sea level so recorded gives the observed secular changes of the relative sea level (IPCC, 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83a802ba-d25a-4cea-b878-40d80d254a21": {"__data__": {"id_": "83a802ba-d25a-4cea-b878-40d80d254a21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Tsunami Risk Assessment and Mitigation for the Indian Ocean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a558b5c348fb3230fab29455a814db126703d95fe2775a450860be1bc316219"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a7dee7f-3e36-4f85-b844-a5efcfa7995b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/tsunami-risk-assessment-and-mitigation-indian-ocean", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e86b522de792d77b87c599ba7073253a2999f9d3d82149d2e5a227dad67cecc0"}}, "hash": "deec4316aa1dba854bc505b052393eb12d114bfc2033ba32eb8f8af70062168a", "text": "Uncertainty: An expression of the degree to which a value (for example, the future state of the climate system) is unknown.

Adriana VENNYARYANI ABOUT N-PEACE NETWORK The N-Peace network (Engage for Peace, Equality, Access, Community and Empowerment) is a multi-country initiative that operates in Nepal, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Afghanistan and the Philippines. N-Peace promotes the leadership of women as key actors in building peace and preventing confl icts, and provides a platform for engagement between different stakeholders on women, peace and security. This initiative is facilitated by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and supported by Australian Government Overseas Aid Program (AusAID). ABOUT THIS SERIES A fi rst batch of trainers were trained through a training of trainers carried out by UNDP and The Institute for Inclusive Security, as collaborators of the N-PEACE initiative. These perspective pieces shared by the N-Peace trainers forms the fi rst of a series of such refl ections. The overall conceptualization of this series is managed by the Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery team at the UNDP Asia Pacifi c Regional Centre.

With the milestone United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 adopted in October 2000, women\u2019s concerns for the fi rst time gained prominence as a core peace and security issue. A little over a year ago, several advocates working for peace, security and development came together from Sri Lanka, Timor-Leste, Nepal and Indonesia to mark the ten-year anniversary of this resolution, and to refl ect on the challenges that remain. It was then that the N-Peace network (Engage for Peace, Equality, Access, Community and Empowerment) was established. It operates as a multi-country initiative that links these countries, which may differ in terms of causes and the nature of confl icts and the socio-cultural contexts, but fi nd common ground on challenges that women continue to face.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d71f17c-9bbe-4761-afa0-996df0e9e66e": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d71f17c-9bbe-4761-afa0-996df0e9e66e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace and Security Vol. 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c46ee47ffd2e0c68388834b2b2c1f310ee1d1f07618e3129f65654d594263bb4"}, "2": {"node_id": "f02dd913-78a8-4a27-9ce4-e804de86571b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b40dd68f0ff7bb49d37f11d2a445471ec3b5d88412fdc3ddcffe57f14dbce5d9"}}, "hash": "2f927f0e11fe49d970beab35f4a20215ce3c07547a5b94f210e743496396d31d", "text": "These challenges range from being under-represented in decision making about peace and security issues to being under-resourced and suffering disproportionately during and after a confl ict.

Nicholas ROSELLINI Deputy Regional Director United Nations Development Programme Regional Bureau for Asia & the Pacifi c FOREWORD ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The N-Peace Facilitators from Regional Crisis Prevention and Recovery team at UNDP Asia Pacifi c Regional Centre would like to acknowledge the women from the fi rst pool of N-Peace Trainers for sharing their perspectives on peace and security. Each story represents a contribution to the Women, Peace & Security (WPS) agenda and personal journey towards building sustainable peace. A special thank you to the N-Peace Network Partner, the Institute for Inclusive Security, for carrying out the N-Peace Regional Training of the Trainers (ToT) based on its manual, A Curriculum for Women Waging Peace. Following this workshop, the N-Peace Trainers have adapted the curriculum to their own contexts, and with support from the network rolled out country-level trainings to further promote skills and knowledge to progress the WPS agenda with women at national and community levels. The N-Peace Facilitators would also like to acknowledge the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) for its ongoing support to all N-Peace network activities, including its capacity building initiatives. Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace and Security is the fi rst edition within a series of refl ections showcasing the voices of peace builders from the N-Peace network. Pinky Singh Rana is the Founder of SAMANATA-Institute for Social and Gender Equality, Nepal, and is an active board member of other national NGOs, namely SAATHI, the Rural Women\u2019s Development and Unity Centre (RUWDUC) and Safe Motherhood Network Federation. A fervent women\u2019s activist, Ms. Rana\u2019s forte lies in social research and training, and she is widely published on women\u2019s issues in Nepal. During the confl ict and the current post-confl ict transitional period in Nepal, Ms. Rana has been advocating for women\u2019s participation in peace building through the integration of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820 into government programmes, security forces\u2019 training manuals, training to security personnel and NGO programming at national and sub- national levels. Peace building in Nepal & Women\u2019s Participation I vividly remember the heartbreaking tears of Sita Magar, a confl ict affected victim unable to speak of her husband who was abducted while she was still pregnant. At present her son is seven years old, she has no news of her husband\u2019s whereabouts and, still traumatized, she can only cry when asked about his disappearance. Six years on after the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2006, which formally ended the insurgency, Nepali women continue to suffer from the impacts of confl ict. Worse still, many have no answers to the whereabouts of their husbands, sons and daughters. Many who were internally displaced, forced to leave schools, or compelled to look for non-agriculture based employment were exploited due to their economic conditions. Those involved as former combatants face rejection from their communities and societies. NEPAL\u2019S MARCH TOWARDS PEACE Nepal\u2019s march towards peace has been fraught with power struggles between and within political parties, reigning impunity, security sector re-structuring, rehabilitation of the People\u2019s Liberation Army personnel and struggles to address transitional security and justice concerns. Nepal\u2019s constitution building process is held hostage to party interests, and the fulfi llment of the peace agreements remain unrealized. Despite the CPA, splinter groups continue to create havoc across the country, resulting in continued violence.

Most activities to date focus on awareness raising and only few women are empowered as peace building and confl ict transformation leaders. EMPOWERING WOMEN TO REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL I have been involved in Nepal\u2019s women\u2019s movement for almost two decades. I have worked for various NGOs lobbying for women\u2019s issues and concerns, particularly those pertaining to sexual and gender based violence, and those necessary for their empowerment. Part of my work, both as a trainer and a researcher, aims to address issues such as violence against women and girls. During the confl ict and post confl ict transitional period, the impact on women and girls increased signifi cantly, in both the nature and the degree of violence. Although women\u2019s powers of resilience were tested and proven, the social, economic, physical and psychological burdens they suffered increased manifold. My decades of experience working to eliminate violence against women taught me that success can not be ensured without engaging the male members of families and communities. Recognizing this, I accepted an invitation to contribute to creating the training manuals on gender equality for the Nepal Army and Nepal Police, along with their training. I saw this as a unique opportunity to engage men and boys, many unknowledgeable of our fi ght, to eliminate violence against women and girls. My journey has led me down paths where I work with government, NGOs, and other like-minded organizations in key national strategies and local tactics essential for \u2018being heard\u2019.

I also serve as a member of the recently formed 1325 Action Group. From these undertakings, I have learnt that women \u2013 irrespective of age, class, caste, creed, and urban or rural \u2013 need to realize they can and should participate in decisions affecting themselves and their communities, societies and nation at large. There is a general unwillingness and lack of motivation among women to participate in peace building and confl ict transformation activities, primarily due to lack of confi dence, which is based on the society\u2019s discriminatory perspective of women. Training to empower women to realize their potential, and role models to prove they have the capacity to create change and ensure sustainable peace have proved to be effective. Continued awareness raising on women\u2019s rights and responsibilities are essential, but there is need to enhance their capacity for increased involvement in peace negotiations, political decision-making and increased participation scross all levels of government, non-government and civil society organizations at the community, district and central levels. \u201c There is a general unwillingness and lack of motivation among women to participate in peace building and confl ict transformation activities, primarily due to lack of confi dence \u201c Sagun Basnet is a Senior Programme Manager at NGO Equal Access Nepal, which works to educate and catalyze behavioral change for the promotion of development via innovation outreach and media strategies.

Advancing Women\u2019s Leadership as Peace Builders in Nepal The peace process in Nepal has been facing a number of hiccups. There has not been a time, in my observation, when the process has run smoothly and not hit an impasse.

The movements that brought back democracy three times in Nepal were initiated out of the dissenting voices and concerns of all the people which were not listened to and respected. Building peace requires an intervention, which listens to the voices and grievances of all sectors of society and addresses them accordingly. Women and women\u2019s issues have been integral during Nepal\u2019s peace building process. Women were at the forefront of Nepal\u2019s civil war (1996-2006) as freedom fi ghters, as homemakers, and as activists. Unfortunately, however, they were not represented in the same manner in the formal agreements of the peace process. Despite playing numerous roles in the peace process, women and women\u2019s issues have generally taken a backseat. Both in times of confl ict and peace, cases of direct abuse in terms sexual, physical and verbal exploitation have severely hindered women\u2019s capacities to realize their own potential. This in turn impedes on their ability to effectively engage in building and sustaining peace. Nonetheless, over the years the women\u2019s movement in Nepal has strengthened. With more women from the central to the grassroots becoming organized, aware of their rights, and actively seeking the fulfi llment of their rights, the movement has gained momentum. Various networks of women\u2019s organizations have also played a pivotal role in bringing together the collective voices of women, and consolidating their aspirations to jointly advocate for a policy-making environment that is non-discriminatory and receptive to women\u2019s issues. The women\u2019s movement has had many successes forming, empowering and engaging women in groups. Peace building programs need to further capitalize on women\u2019s groups in order to harness their role in reconciliation and the building of Nepal as a republic that is respectful of all people\u2019s rights.

Building peace is a demanding job, which often requires the unlearning of things that have been rooted in customs, practices, beliefs and history. Managing this demanding work \u2013 while facing restrictions from stereotyped beliefs and attitudes towards women \u2013 is a signifi cant challenge that pervades both home and work. At the household level, being a women engaged in building peace has affected my relations in a mixed manner. Some of the people in my household are proud, while some still do not appreciate why I need to be involved in such work. This view is couched in a broader societal construct in Nepal, where women\u2019s roles and voices in politics is still marginal and insignifi cant. And with peace building largely seen as a political undertaking, most people still don\u2019t consider that women have a signifi cant role to play in this fi eld. Despite the fact that Nepal is passing through a transitional phase, politically and socially, entrenched gender perspectives continue to pose challenges for women, where the male is regarded as \u2018the doer\u2019 and the female as \u2018the receiver\u2019. Even with these challenges, I still fi nd myriad sources of inspiration that drive me to carry out my work. I take inspiration from the people I work with and the potential for change that I strive to achieve. Though the stalemate in terms of development and peace building is far from inspiring, it serves as a reminder that more effort is always needed. \u201cI can be changed by what happens to me, but I refuse to be reduced by it,\u201d is a quote by American author Maya Angelou that captures my outlook. The sense of gratifi cation I feel when I realize that I have been able to make change and impact someone\u2019s life positively inspires me to continue working for peace. public attitudes that are supportive of women\u2019s roles in peace building are also needed for greater engagement to be realized. We also need more women peace builders brought to the forefront as positive role models so that more women are encouraged to get engaged, and so that men too recognize the high value in engaging women. STRATEGIES FOR ADVANCING WOMEN\u2019S LEADERSHIP My initial involvement in advancing women\u2019s rights began when I worked as a television journalist and sought to bring to light the concerns of marginalized groups, including women, via the media.

Having conducted research on these topics and shared knowledge generated by publishing articles, producing media programs (both radio and television) and developing and delivering trainings, I became increasingly convinced of the importance of educating the masses about the potential the women of my country hold. One of my published articles that analyzed the intersections of gender and the peace process, titled \u201cWomen and Politics: Is voting enough?\u201d stirred many reactions and debate over women\u2019s political participation in the peace process. Similarly, my trainings and radio programs have generated a lot of feedback from women aspiring to voice their issues and have themselves heard. In carrying out activities through my organization, we have used some interesting strategies to increase women\u2019s leadership potential and empower them to leverage their own capacities. One such approach is called the \u201ccascading training\u201d through which I have imparted trainings to many women in the communities, who in turn train many more women, resulting in community leaders who help in building peace in their own communities. This process has been successful in generating large numbers of women, who understand their own settings and communities and can serve as agents for peace. I have also trained a number of women to serve as community reporters working closely with FM radio stations, community leaders and confl ict affected women. Such trainings have deepened their capacity to report effectively on the critical issues of women, peace and security.

This initiative works to: provide services to Legal personnel on Gender Based Violence (GBV); develop gender friendly transitional justice mechanisms; promote the development of a National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325, and other gender focused programmatic activities. Prior to her current position, Ms. Sheikh worked for a Danish INGO to promote peace through community mediation and thereby reduce the impact of armed confl ict on women. Ms. Sheikh\u2019s professional experience also crosses into the environmental sector and she has spent over 10 years working in the area of natural resource management. Ms. Sheikh holds an MA in Sociology/Anthropology from Tribhuvan University, Nepal. A Journey Towards Equality To begin, I would like to share my own life experience. As a Muslim woman who was not allowed to step out of the house, not allowed to be engaged in a job and was practically given no choices to make decisions affecting my own life, I took a very hard decision as a young woman. I realized quite early on that I had to choose between \u2018do, and die.\u2019 I chose to do \u2013 to leave my house, thereby challenging my family, society, religion and culture. I was left completely alone to face diffi culties that would come with the many unknowns in the future. I learned that sometimes negative consequences prove to be inspiring in terms of making big decisions. In my case too, it was my mother\u2019s life that drew me to making the decision that I would not lead a life that was like hers. Given that I took these decisions to change my personal life, I would also want to see the same change for other women. WOMEN IN POST-CONFLICT NEPAL When I started working on peace building issues, I used to fi nd a lot of resistance from the men, especially those who held high-positions. It was not easy for me to infl uence their decisions nor convince them of the need to address women\u2019s priorities and needs. Being a woman and not from a high- caste did not help me in generating much support from them. Through the years I learnt that being radical was not enough, I had to also be convincing and technically well-versed with issues about which I was passionate. Hence, learning and strengthening my own capacities to be clear and articulate was an important part of my strategy to be able to leverage greater infl uence and establish longer term relationships. Nepal is currently in the initial stages of a transition. After a decade of armed confl ict, the footprints of confl ict are still visible in the country\u2019s infrastructure, in the ongoing but still incomplete reparation and reintegration processes and in the political instability. However, over the recent years there have been many signifi cant developments for women\u2019s rights in Nepal. The voices of women became stronger, as they united under a common agenda for their rights, to infl uence the formulation of laws, increase the participation of women in state institutions and involve more women in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8026d1d0-9ee3-4d79-80b1-86038c8cefb1": {"__data__": {"id_": "8026d1d0-9ee3-4d79-80b1-86038c8cefb1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace and Security Vol. 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88dee5895d3029ffee72ea4d5127e792f05bae4f00a89288b694eb50987da24a"}}, "hash": "88dee5895d3029ffee72ea4d5127e792f05bae4f00a89288b694eb50987da24a", "text": "the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and decision-making processes.

Hence, their only skill was cultivating land, fi shing and simple carpentering jobs. When they were freed by their landlords, they had nothing on which to survive. The government promised to provide them a piece of land, 10,000 rupees and some wood to construct a house. In fact, when they were provided this land, a milestone was realized when the land registration was made in the name of both the husband and the wife, giving more security to women in the community. But even during this process, I can remember several challenges, owing to lack of coordination and understanding among the Land Reform Offi ce, Forestry and Land Measurement Offi ce and other actors providing land registration certifi cates to ex-Kamaiyas. While this benefi t could not be made available to all the ex- Kamaiyas, it was gratifying to see at least a few thousand families receive land certifi cates in the names of both the man and woman of the family. Currently, I work as a Gender Specialist in a UNDP project focusing on access to justice issues. As part of my work, I engage with lawyers and police, especially related to protection against gender-based violence. Through this project, more than 2,000 women have received free legal service in 7 districts. This has also contributed to strengthening the role of the Police in preventing and responding to cases of domestic and gender based violence. In 2011, I worked on strengthening the interface between women police cells and lawyers to work together to solve GBV cases in the district. With better coordination among actors, the number of incidents is on the decline, and women have begun to have greater trust in the police and other state institutions. Maintaining law and order is one of the most important aspects of peace building. While making new laws and bringing about positive changes to old laws requires a lengthy process of advocating and lobbying, the critical challenge still lies in the implementation of these legislations. It has taken over three years in my current work for me to witness a change in the attitude and interest towards implementing laws by different actors. For all laws that hold potential to positively affect women, I plan to see through the implementation of these benefi ts in the years to come. evolved societies. Qualifi ed women are also now placed in the higher posts of the state, like ministers and leaders of constitution drafting sub-groups. Many I/NGOs, and bi- lateral and multi-lateral organizations in Nepal have also developed policies to hire women and fulfi ll gender balance in their own organizations. The general awareness about human rights and women rights issues has also seen positive results. Issues of violence against women have gained immense prominence with a Domestic Violence Act being formulated in 2010, and the year 2010 being declared Violence Free Year by the government. Toll free phones were installed to receive and register cases and complaints, and Women Development Offi cers have been provided with more authority to address these cases. Even in the area of education, girls enrollment in schools has been prioritized, with quotas being allocated in schools and universities to address the gender gaps. These are very positive developments, recognizing the fact that women\u2019s participation and empowerment cannot be enhanced unless an environment conducive for change is fostered. PEACE BUILDING GAINS FOR WOMEN I fi rmly believe that changes in the legal system during the peace building processes have benefi ted women greatly.

She is the editor of Ghatana Ra Bichar, a national weekly publication. Nepalese Women as Nation Builders I would like to share with you a short history of Nepalese women\u2019s active participation in civic and social causes. This is a history that is traced back to the days of a centralized feudal state expansion campaign in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Serving as warriors in the Battle of Nalapani in Deharadun (at present, in Northern India) in 1815, Nepalese women fought alongside their men folk in a heroic resistance against the British Army who were far better equipped, trained, and outnumbered the Nepalese. Despite their advantages, the British were able to seize Kalanga Fort only after three attempts, while incurring heavy losses. Similarly, women were mobilized to political effect during the anti-Rana movement by various anti-Rana political parties during 1947-50, culminating in the overthrow of the Rana regime in 1950. Again, in 1990 women actively participated in the democracy movement, which ended 30 years of one-party rule of the autocratic \u2018Panchayat\u2019 monarchy, replacing it with a monarchical parliamentary system. In all such movements, women were drawn from both the well-known political families, and were mobilized from the rural population. While historically, women have been considered weak and as caretakers only of the home and family, during periods of social unrest and confl ict, women demonstrated they can serve effectively in front-line combatant capacities. When the Maoists included women in the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA), only then did the Nepal Army institutionalize the recruitment of women into their policies. Presently, 1.75 % of the Nepal Army are women (1,624 out of 92,753). Traditionally, Nepalese society confi ned women between the domestic walls but confl ict helped to bring women into the mainstream, and made society aware of their valuable contributions. Women were also empowered by confl ict, when they were required to attend meetings in the absence of the male members of their families. Society\u2019s perspective on women began gradually changing. REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN IN LEADERSHIP ROLES Nepalese politics appears promising for women on paper, with the Interim Constitution providing protective policies and a reservation policy for the representation of women in various sectors. The reality is that neither the government nor any political parties have taken signifi cant action to implement this promise. Babita BASNET, Nepal Women have participated widely in political movements during times of crisis, but when the crisis is over, they are relegated again to the domestic arena \u201c \u201c 13 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security The Government and the current Constitution do recognize the socioeconomic disadvantages faced by women in Nepal and incorporate specifi c provisions to provide support to women.

They still don\u2019t want to recognize the potential of women in peace-making and nation building processes, believing that these issues cannot be addressed by women. From my experience, I found that women are better peace- makers than men. Rather than looking for everything in absolute black and white terms, women perceive shades of grey where negotiation is possible. Consequently, women perform better not only in preventing and rebuilding after confl ict within their home boundaries, but also as partners in national building. But, the reality is that this critical role of women in relation to confl ict transformation is hardly recognized. To support women in advancing their leadership skill in peace and security, I do my best as a trainer and a woman in civil society to provide spaces for women to share their grievances, as well as their achievements. I advise them professionally on alternative approaches to effective peace- making. I also counsel them at a very personal level on leading their day to day lives. I have always advocated for placing women in policy-making positions so that they can utilize their knowledge and skills to make change for other women. Having women in leadership positions also encourages other women to enhance their abilities and rise to higher altitudes in their own lives. Increasing women\u2019s capacity for leadership and creating an environment in which women can thrive as national builders requires national efforts from all stakeholders. Women must be oriented and trained to sustain their involvement in this process and they must be well represented in national peace-making mechanisms. Importantly, I would like to see that all current national policies are made gender sensitive. To end where I began, Nepalese women have a long history of commitment to civic and social causes. They have fought to protect their country, they have fought for peace, and they have fought for their rights within their country. It is time for all to shoulder the responsibilities of making sure women\u2019s capacity for leadership and potential to engage in nation building is fulfi lled. \u201c Increasing women\u2019s capacity for leadership and creating an environment in which women can thrive as national builders requires national efforts from all stakeholders \u201c Radha Paudel is the Founder and President of Action Works Nepal (AWON), an NGO that works in the most confl ict affected regions of Nepal, with the most vulnerable and often marginalized communities.

A Search for Social Justice I am a survivor of confl ict. Before the civil war in Nepal, I struggled growing up with gender and class discrimination since childhood. And so began my search for social justice. When the Maoist insurgency erupted in Nepal in 1996, I was working as a manager of a health institute. During the confl ict (1996-2006), there were parallel governments and everyone had to request a visa to enter and exit in the periphery of the district I was working in. Health institutions were unable to staff their organizations and medicines and stretchers were unavailable. Despite these problems and threats from both parties in the confl ict, I managed to stay in the rural villages, negotiate access to the people and I took lead role in setting up a blood bank and a hospital for surgery in Karnali. Here, I was exposed to many tragedies that marked me deeply. On one occasion I was caught in a 13 hour cross-fi re and was witness to the futile death of many people around me \u2013 from combatants to poor women and men, and elderly people. I still remember the 48 bodies of those who were less fortunate than I. This horrifi c incident highlighted to me how the confl ict affected so many of the most vulnerable people in Nepal. I therefore chose to continue my fi ght for both social justice and peace. An active campaigner, I chose to work with civil society organizations and networks that believe in democracy and women\u2019s human rights at local, regional and national levels, seeking to infl uence national policies and major political parties, and to create", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7ce8c9c-5f33-49df-b689-bd546c794f75": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7ce8c9c-5f33-49df-b689-bd546c794f75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace and Security Vol. 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56c1fab1de60cfc65fb72521ba0fb5ab93304e7175e623b11616328c5fffe4be"}}, "hash": "56c1fab1de60cfc65fb72521ba0fb5ab93304e7175e623b11616328c5fffe4be", "text": "a critical mass of activism at the local levels. For a long time, I had keenly analyzed Nepal\u2019s politics and society, and the changing status of both. Viewing these over time, I fi nally committed to work for our shared cause, due to a lack of progress in the peace-making and constitution-making processes. My underlying philosophy is that a gender responsive constitution and gender responsive peace process and its implementation, right down to grassroots level, is the foundation to sustainable peace and development. BARRIERS TO PEACE Being a women human rights defender and president of NGO Action Works Nepal (AWON), I play an active role in civil society towards building peace. I have therefore seen that there remain high barriers to implementing an enduring peace for my nation on cultural, political and economic levels. In rural Nepal, peace is largely hindered by cultural beliefs and practices. Radha PAUDEL, Nepal Before the civil war in Nepal, I struggled growing up with gender and class discrimination since childhood. And so began my search for social justice. \u201c \u201c 15 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security At national levels, progress is complicated by misunderstandings, mistrust, disputes, and institutionalized patriarchal practices among major actors and political parties. Discrimination with regards to gender, caste, religion, and class is still prominent even within formal institutions, which are largely captured by the elite. Accordingly, women who represent the poor, Dalit, disabled, victims of gender based violence, confl ict affected and other marginalized groups are hesitant to trust activities led by the state and political parties. Therefore, we organize and mobilize women at the grassroots level across Nepal through more than a dozen organizations with a mission to support democracy, women\u2019s human rights, justice, equality, sustainable peace and a new constitution. Nepal is in a fragile state of political transition and emerging from economic troubles, which distract political leaders from woman-centered policy issues. Policy tools including UNSCR 1325, 1820, and CEDAW used to drive this movement are not widely respected by the political leadership. Meanwhile, the traditional culture of impunity makes impossible the enforcement, prosecution and punishment of perpetrators who continue to commit discriminatory acts against women. Women and girls remain unsafe at home, in public vehicles, their workplaces, in educational institutions \u2013 everywhere. I point to an example as recent as August 2011, when women Master\u2019s degree candidates were openly sexually harassed during examination by the invigilator. Opposing this injustice, I took a leadership role in a public campaign on behalf of these women. As an activist for women\u2019s rights in this environment, even I continue to suffer physical and verbal abuse in Nepal\u2019s most modern urban environments. Moreover, I have received death threats for my campaigning work. So, imagine the environment of rural Nepal where women and girls suffer lives of tragedy in environments characterized by 9.3% literacy rates, 37-42 year life expectancies, near zero participation in civil society by women, and pervasive, repressive cultural taboos. Women face multiple problems in society and are additionally burdened by their family roles and responsibilities. Initially, women are very committed to join the campaigns I have coordinated, yet later they are unable to sustain their participation because of objections from family members, household obligations and lack of personal funds. Gradually, campaigns taper off and end without any meaningful progress because very few women are at work actively campaigning. On top of this, Nepal\u2019s patriarchal and hierarchical society, political instability, culture of impunity, caste and class inequalities and continuously changing coalition dynamics and divisions within parties themselves are additional challenging factors hindering and preventing progress in peace building for women. Nonetheless, I am not deterred. I am determined. The peace is achievable and possible but requires a holistic approach at multiple levels with rural responsive implementation. In the meantime, I will continue this search for social justice and sustainable peace that is truly experienced by the women of Nepal. \u201c My underlying philosophy is that a gender responsive constitution and gender responsive peace process and its implementation, right down to grassroots level, is the foundation to sustainable peace and development. \u201c Lily Thapa is the Founder and President of Women for Human Rights (WHR), a Nepal based NGO that works for the rights of widows and single women affected by confl ict in 73 districts across the country.

Widows\u2019 Rights in the New Nepal I was a young mother when my husband was killed while serving as a UN peacekeeper in the 1991 Gulf War. After my husband\u2019s death, I found myself a victim of the \u2018social death\u2019 to which many bereaved women are subjected in regions of South and Southeast Asia. I faced numerous challenges and threats, being a widow in my community. I committed myself to change the status of women, and especially widows, whose fates I share and understand quite well. At present, I lead an organization named Women for Human Rights (WHR), comprising 80,000 young widows, confl ict victims and victims of sexual and gender-based violence. These are the people who motivate me to work for peace and women\u2019s rights and the representation of women at all decision- making levels. I do this by infl uencing policy makers and the Constitute Assembly (CA) members. At the core of my work, I am focused on a critical problem: women\u2019s inability to infl uence their situations, which results in part from the fact that many have no sense of identity or relevance outside of being someone\u2019s wife, mother, or daughter. I am a catalyst seeking to break the bonds that limit women to the \u2018home-ridden state\u2019. I recognize this as a human rights issue: women\u2019s rights are human rights. My organization works with women\u2019s groups in many communities, who then work with local level political leaders, as well as the national level policy makers. These women\u2019s organizations have played a central role in promoting awareness of gender equality, and transforming what was earlier regarded as women\u2019s private concerns into a wider public discourses in Nepal. Since the Peace Accord in 2006, this broad women\u2019s network has been successfully giving support to larger communities, advocating against injustice and impunity and for peace and security. The key goal of women\u2019s organizations was to represent women in the political decision-making body throughout the post-confl ict period in Nepal. Through this wide network, we organized many demonstrations all over the country, demanding women\u2019s representation in the peace process, handing over petitions to the government, and organizing signature campaigns for peace. Many civil society organizations were made aware of the constitution building processes through the network\u2019s training programs. We are currently also lobbying political leaders to provide greater space for meaningful participation in the peace process by women, from the local grass roots level up to the policy decision-making level. In the women\u2019s alliances for peace we formed, I similarly play a role in infl uencing policy to incorporate women\u2019s issues.

A POWERFUL NETWORK OF COLLECTIVE VOICES From my experience, I have learned that to be empowered, women fi rstly need to be made aware of their roles and capabilities for peace building, and then to be capacitated to mobilize women in their own communities.

Promoting Non-violence in Post-confl ict Nepal Women need to be present and their voices heard during peace negotiation. While it is widely recognized that women experience confl ict differently to men, women\u2019s needs are often not addressed in peace negotiations. To address the different impacts of confl ict, women\u2019s involvement in negotiations and confl ict resolution is essential, not only because women feel the gravity of impacts, but in order to infl uence ongoing decision-making processes. Throughout peace building processes, which are regularly punctuated with spikes in political tensions, confl ict resolution and mediation strategies should continue to harness the voices of women at national and grassroots levels. This applies to Nepal and all other confl ict affected societies moving down the path towards peace. PROMOTING NON-VIOLENCE AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION SKILLS My experience working within civil society and with confl ict victims, particularly women, has highlighted the inordinate impacts of war experienced by women throughout the confl ict, and in its aftermath. My involvement in Nepal\u2019s peace process started when I was campaigning for a peaceful resolution of the confl ict through dialogue and negotiation. The campaign was launched by establishing the National Peace Campaign (NPC), and via this organization I have advocated for a peaceful resolution to the confl ict. Some of the activities I have carried out include developing the capacities of civil society stakeholders and political leaders on: confl ict analysis; dialogue; facilitation; mediation and negotiations. I have also been working to create awareness and develop skills around movements that promote non-violence. Though Nepal\u2019s peace process has been stalled and faced many setbacks, I have been working continuously to promote methods and skills for peaceful confl ict resolution and post-confl ict reconstruction since 2003. This has involved organizing small group dialogues and problem solving workshops on the contentious issues of the peace process with concerned stakeholders from civil society, young politicians, and regional and district level political leaders. The strategies aim to infl uence key persons who have been directly involved in negotiations and generate voices for a logical ending of impasses so to achieve milestones within the Peace Accord. Such efforts regularly target women to create broader awareness and strengthened capacities on confl ict-resolution and post-confl ict reconstruction.

I was inspired knowing that the large number of South Africans trained in the concepts, methods and skills of peaceful confl ict resolution and negotiations was a crucial advantage to the country\u2019s successful peace process. I realized the promotion of this school of thought and these skills were also needed in Nepal during the peace period.

In sharp contrast with previous peace talks by the Humanitarian Dialogue (HD) Centre, which involved meetings by proxy at the ambassadorial level, the Crisis Management Initiative headed by President Ahtisaari of Finland facilitated a mix of negotiation models including top level, small teams, and direct face-to- face negotiations. The negotiating teams were limited to fi ve persons on each side, assisted by support groups. The support teams were vastly imbalanced; six Ministries and two Embassies in Europe supported the Indonesian side, while we had only four inexperienced persons, including myself. As large as it was, the Indonesian Government side included no women, except for the Indonesian Ambassador to Finland, who left for Jakarta at the very start of the talks. The negotiation process was scheduled on a strict timetable to be conducted between January and August 2005. Being on a very small team, I was required to participate in every internal discussion concerning strategy and all decision- making processes. The pressures on our team were compounded by the massive earthquakes and tsunami that wrecked our communities back home. International tsunami assistance needed to proceed without hindrance by the confl ict and fear of safety for relief workers. With the Indonesian Government already categorically rejecting our offer of a ceasefi re, the process ended up focusing on very general points of an agreement, without delving into signifi cant details that factored in issues of women, religion, or voices of civil society. Throughout the process, at times I felt very alone working within the male dominated leadership of GAM. Yet, to their credit, everyone treated me with equal rights and respect. WOMEN\u2019S ACHIEVEMENTS THROUGH THE AGREEMENT Looking back now, with a clear vision of the opportunity that was entrusted to me as a woman, I cannot help but feel some guilt for not being assertive enough to insist that women\u2019s issues be dealt with separately in the fi nal agreement. I am disappointed that the players of the international community, who were well aware of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325), chose to neglect the issues of women, peace and security altogether instead of insisting that the Resolution be adhered to by all parties engagement in negotiations. Shadia MARHABAN, Indonesia we need to reposition our own argument from being about women\u2019s rights to it being about participation, and that only an inclusive process can be the bedrock to lasting peace. \u201c \u201c Shadia Marhaban is a co-founder and President of the Aceh Women\u2019s League (LINA), the only female member of the peace talks between the Free Aceh Movement and the Government of Indonesia in Helsinki (2005) that has ended their 30 years of war, and a co- founder and member of the Board of Directors of the Aceh-School for Peace and Democracy. As president of LINA since its inception, Ms Marhaban has been active in promoting women\u2019s involvement in peace negotiations and post-confl ict peace building and reconstruction. Through her organization she carries out trainings for 1400 former female combatants as well as other vulnerable members of the community. Currently she is a fellow at the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard University. 21 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security Considerable work is required to sensitise offi cials in these various agencies about international norms and standards on gender equality in general, and women, peace and security specifi cally. This is a timely issue, as the mandate to implement this agenda is still debated between the Interior Ministry and the Ministry of Law and Politics. To advance the NAP, the scope for engagement of civil society, from grassroots to the national level, needs to be broadened. Only then can the process progress and the women, girls and the wider community eventually enjoy the dividends of UNSCR 1325. WOMEN AND PEACE, NOT WOMEN OR PEACE The current and unfortunate reality in the world of peace mediation is that there is still an arrogant reluctance to engage women because of the stereotyped belief, even amongst well-established international organizations and high-profi le individuals that engaging women will slow down, or even potentially derail the peace process. The false rationale used to defend such an opinion is to question which is more important- achieving peace or women\u2019s inclusion in the peace process; as if there is only a choice of one, or the other.

Therein lays another challenge for women; to prove that excluding women excludes the possibility of creating sustainable peace. To this end, with regards to the contentious dogma, \u201cto engage, or not to engage\u201d, we need to reposition our own argument from being about women\u2019s rights to it being about participation, and that only an inclusive process can be the bedrock to lasting peace. To date, there has been no peace process where gender parity or anything approximating it has occurred. And until women remain peripheral, all integral decision-making will not refl ect the true needs of all people required to foster and maintain an environment for peace. It is time for the international community and governments that espouse the tenets of UN SCR 1325 to show leadership and walk the talk. Over a decade has passed since this watershed resolution; time can no longer be wasted. In order to secure signatures to an agreement, reputable international organizations, the European Union (EU) \u2013 as the guarantor of the Helsinki MoU \u2013 and even the UN itself opted to side-line women\u2019s issues within the process. Only later and outside of the negotiations process did I learn about the existence of UN SCR 1325 when I started dealing with female ex-combatants. Today, six years after the end of the confl ict, the Helsinki MoU is considered one of the most successful peace processes in the world. While it helped President Ahtisaari obtain the most prestigious recognition for his peace efforts, by winning the Nobel Peace Prize (2008), many women in Aceh still remain very much overlooked. For several women, their ability to access and exercise their basic rights has worsened since the confl ict, when even the male fi ghters depended on them for survival. To gain and strengthen their own power, Acehnese politicians now use the Sharia Law that was introduced by the Central Government during the confl ict to weaken the independence movement. During the negotiations, GAM negotiators rejected this law as it considered it unnecessary for achieving a sustainable peace; instead, we agreed that freedom of religion to be one of the 6 authorities remaining in the purview of the Central Government. UN SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTION 1325 \u2013 THE INDONESIAN CONTEXT Whilst Indonesian women have played an extensive role in managing confl ict at the community level in a variety of ways, their presence in confl ict resolution decision-making at higher political levels is virtually absent. Nonetheless, there have been some gains in this area, within the national policy landscape. Since 2007, the Indonesian State Ministry for Women\u2019s Empowerment and Child Protection (KNPP&PA) has undertaken a process of drafting a National Action Plan (NAP) on UNSCR 1325. UNSCR 1325 explicitly calls for the involvement of women in all stages of peace processes. In Indonesia, there is no signifi cant application of the resolution to policymaking on women, peace and security issues by the government. So far, the UNSCR 1325 agenda in Indonesia is largely centred on workshops and seminars organised by non- government entities resulting in little, or no impact on women\u2019s meaningful participation in actual peace, or confl ict processes. At this point in time, the NAP has been delayed due to a lack of cross-government support. The Ministry of Politics, Justice and Security and the Defence and Foreign Affairs agencies have yet to endorse the NAP, and acknowledge the need for such a plan to be situated in the context of violent confl ict.

UNSCR 1325 & PROTECTION In the era giving rise to the reformation, confl icts in Indonesia erupted in the period 1998 - 2000, occurring in Poso (1998-2001), Ambon (1999 and 2011), Papua (1998, 2011 and recently), and ex-East Timor (1999). Aceh suffered confl ict since 1976, escalating and eventually being declared a military operational zone in 1990, which did not offi cially end until the signing the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2005. Not only did the issue of women\u2019s vulnerability in Indonesian confl ict zones rise to international attention, but the issue was identifi ed as a key concern ina number of other countries suffering confl icts. Consequently, in late 2000 the UN Security Council approved Security Council Resolution 1325 (UNSCR 1325) emphasizing women\u2019s protection in confl ict areas and their roles in peace processes. As a UN Member State, Indonesia agreed to UNSCR 1325, but has not yet implemented it. Since 2006, there has been only small progress towards implementing legislation offering the provisions agreed to in UNSCR 1325. Adriana Venny ARYANI, Indonesia I bring light to what has happened to women in confl ict areas and how these issues should be dealt with to the parliament, government, military headquarters, and police headquarters. \u201c \u201c 23 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security The UN and its agencies, including UNFPA, have since begun encouraging progress towards legislation in Indonesia based on the resolution. Without the protections outlined in UNSCR 1325, widespread Gender-based Violence (GBV) violations continue to be perpetrated. Creation of the anti-Gender-based Violence Coalition (GBV Coalition), representing approximately 40 organizations, was as a direct response to the failure by the government to implement this legislation. Several other groups formed alliances, such as the Alliance for UNSCR 1325 in Aceh. These groups are working strenuously to implement national legislation that fulfi lls the promise of UNSCR 1325 via National Action Plan (NAP) on Women, Peace and Security, which in Indonesia is named; NAP on Women\u2019s Protection, Prevention and Empowerment in Confl ict Areas (RAN P4DK). WOMEN\u2019S PARTICIPATION In Indonesia, most peace processes do not include women. In the creation of the Malino II Agreement in 2001, women were excluded because the situation was still considered precarious. The 2005 agreement negotiated in Helsinski excluded the issue of GBV because it was viewed as a possible \u2018stumbling block\u2019 to peace. The fi rst and second Malino agreements also failed to produce these types of provisions in large because women\u2019s roles and gender issues were not signifi cant in these negotiations processes. We have a long way to go and in the future I hope to carry out activity to encourage an inclusive and meaningful peace negotiations in Papua and in other parts of the country. As activists, it is important that we target the decision-making processes if we want to infl uence the decisions being made on behalf of the women in this country. It is important for us to consider not just how many women are included, but how meaningful their engagement really is.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "58180fef-e24e-48f5-b304-65cd59e586fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "58180fef-e24e-48f5-b304-65cd59e586fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace and Security Vol. 1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fedcb8767573126c09b0b626758aea16b0d512c5a0c20b99b6827035eabcca99"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a648db1-c505-4b43-b911-d22bb4464788", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/womens-perspectives-peace-and-security-vol-1", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54e2dfd55f84a6631a706a143cde712a7279ad71c835ca215ad1516ede1d76b1"}}, "hash": "9b43d72585baeea00ec78be06205433c10e14f5d8804fffd3d93dc4a65f94815", "text": "Recently, we have had a victory in term of women\u2019s participation with the Law on Social Confl ict Management that was passed last April [2012].

She has more than 13 years of experience working in women\u2019s empowerment and peace building, and previously participated in the implementation of the peace agreement in Aceh by joining the Henry Dunant Center (HDC) from civil society, involved in the security monitoring team in North Aceh. She also worked for the National Human Rights Commission (KOMNAS Ham) and since the Memorandum of Understanding came into fruition in Aceh, Ms. Hasni has worked with women\u2019s groups to develop national UNSCR 1325 initiatives. She holds a MA in International Relations from Ritsumeikan University, Japan. Improving Women\u2019s Economic Recovery After fi nishing university, I worked as an NGO volunteer in Aceh. In this role, I witnessed immense suffering and many human rights violations of women as my work commenced whilst the confl ict in Aceh was still active. Strange as it seems, before the age of 17, I never knew of the dreadful human rights crimes perpetrated in Aceh. But after witnessing the real situation, I was determined to fi ght for women\u2019s rights and for peace. To this end, I wanted to create social programs and help poor women\u2019s economic plight. In the year 2000, I started encouraging several friends and colleagues in the NGO community to focus their work more on women\u2019s issues and priorities, and to advocate for women\u2019s equality and the enforcement of their rights in their communities. I also co-founded Jari Aceh, a Women\u2019s Support NGO, that works to advance women\u2019s human rights, education, economic development and promote gender equality to groups that we have now been coaching for almost 11 years. Nonetheless, after over a decade of working in this context, it is still apparent to me that the quality of women\u2019s lives in Aceh remains poor. Unfortunately, for the women of Aceh, the post-confl ict period has not been a signifi cant window of opportunity for us to \u2018build back better\u2019. The most urgent remedy should be improving women\u2019s education and economic stability. At Jari Aceh we feel that women\u2019s economic empowerment is critical for us in order to achieve increased participation in recovery and equality. I have seen that when women have greater economic independence and lives outside of the home, they can create changes that strengthen women\u2019s positions in their own communities.

Women\u2019s organizations in Indonesia and Aceh are very active in the promotion and protection of human rights, particularly in monitoring, advocacy, public awareness and education. With a growing recognition that women have more diffi culty in accessing justice, organizations have also become active in advocating for and providing direct support to women in need of justice. Women are increasingly mobilized to raise awareness about the bias against women by traditional institutions, since many are based on patriarchal powers which can issue justice in an arbitrary and unfair fashion. During our recovery, provisions to encourage women\u2019s political participation and give them a greater voice in creating policies at the local, regional and national levels have not happened. Women therefore need to play a larger role in demanding accountability and transparency in various areas of governance. While it is very important in local government, efforts are also needed at the national level, in creating greater partnerships with women\u2019s organizations. Sacrifi ces made by women are immense, but policies and regulations continue to discriminate against them. Women in Aceh are still left behind and do not fully participate in society at all levels. Seeing the suffering and unfairness of this situation inspires me to fi ght for women, especially for the progress of women at the grassroots, within small villages and communities, and to champion women\u2019s economic, social, political and legal equality in Aceh. \u201c With a growing recognition that women have more diffi culty in accessing justice, organizations have also become active in advocating for and providing direct support to women in need of justice. \u201c Maria Damairia Pakpahan is a Gender and Planning Monitoring and Evaluation Consultant working for Circle Indonesia (Cooperative for Civil Society Resources Development) since 2007.

A Peaceful Fight for Women\u2019s Rights As a young student activist during Suharto\u2019s regime, I became involved in advocating for addressing human rights abuses, from Aceh, East Timor and West Papua, and even Myanmar and Palestine. In 1992, my sister, who was then living abroad in exile, asked me to interview the leaders of Gerwani (Gerakan Wanita Indonesia Women\u2019s Movement), a major women\u2019s rights organization, for her thesis. Through these interviews I gradually developed a relationship with key Gerwani members and joined their numbers. With these women and the movement they collectively catalyzed, I shared the same sense of motivation and vision for women in our country. Indeed, one of my role models, Ibu (\u201cmother\u201d) Surastri Karma Trimurti, was a founder of Gerwani. Ibu Surastri was a remarkable woman who endured imprisonment during the Japanese occupation of WWII, attended the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence in August 17, 1945 as one of our nation\u2019s founders, and later served as Indonesia\u2019s fi rst woman minister, appointed as the Labor Minister in 1945.

WOMEN FRIENDLY LEGISLATION When Suharto resigned as the President, I became actively involved with student activists in creating a new Parliament, and subsequently campaigned to bring public attention to many fundamental rights abuses that plagued his administration. Maria Damairia PAKPAHAN, Indonesia A lot has changed over the years, but a lot more needs to be done, both to promote leadership capacities and to create a culture open to women\u2019s representation in decision-making roles at national and local levels. \u201c \u201c 27 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security In 1988, we were a small number of student activists who organized a direct action in the court in Salatiga, Central Java on behalf of a woman who murdered her husband following over 10 years of abuse. This very unfortunate incident exposed the suffering of a woman in a trauma-fi lled marriage and how these violent years of abuse affected her later actions. As activists, we felt it was important to underscore the role domestic violence had played in this case. We distributed pink heart-shaped brooches and raised awareness in the community about domestic violence. At that time, I travelled for 3 hours by bus to Salatiga from Yogyakarta to prepare public demonstrations. I remember knowing very little about organizing demonstrations. We talked with the media and stirred up a public discourse about women\u2019s issues and domestic violence in our campaigning. Through this experience, I learned about the ugliness of domestic violence. Our effort here became the fi rst direct action against domestic violence, and I realized that more people, both men and women, need to be mobilized to pay serious attention to these issues. It really made me wonder, how we can talk about peace and empowerment, while violence continues to be rampant within the home? We must address women\u2019s issues both in the public and private domains if we truly want to create peace in our communities. I also became involved in campaigning for legislation to support women, which I continue to do, today. For several years I have been a member of the Indonesia Women Coalition for Justice and Democracy (KPI KD), where I work to advocate for and support the creation of national laws which are pro- gender equality and women-friendly. We also work with the National Anti-Violence Against Women Commission to solve equality issues crated by Sharia laws that continues to be used in local regulations. I am always humbled when I refl ect on the diverse membership that I have the responsibility to speak on behalf of which includes; women from rural or urban areas, professional women, domestic workers, migrant workers, sex-workers, or housewives. I feel very proud to have this responsibility bestowed upon me. Through my work over the years, I have begun to realize that the change we are seeking will come when women are empowered and when they take up new leadership roles in my country. A lot has changed over the years, but a lot more needs to be done, both to promote leadership capacities and to create a culture open to women\u2019s representation in decision- making roles at national and local levels.

Reporting for the War Affected As someone who has grown up under violent confl icts in both the North and the South of Sri Lanka, and seen continuous deterioration of the relations between the Sinhalese and the Tamil communities, degradation of democratic governance, human rights and moral conduct and responsibilities, today I want nothing more than sustained peace and ethnic and national reconciliation in my country. Even as many peers, colleagues, friends and relatives left our country in despair, I never gave up my hope for a reconciled nation. I remain hopeful and continue working towards a creating a greater understanding of the impacts of war and violence on the different communities. EXPOSURE TO THE IMPACTS OF CONFLICT In my early career, I worked with a television production house called Young Asia Television (YATV), which at the time was fully funded by donors in support of its dedication for the promotion of environmental and social justice, human rights and peace building in society. To this end, the production house made high quality and informative television programs for diverse audiences. In this role I developed my journalistic skills as the supervising producer for two programmes (Sinhala and Tamil versions) dealing with confl ict related issues, whilst trying to promote ethnic reconciliation and confl ict resolution in its subtext. Through innumerable reporting assignments in war-affected areas I was exposed to the effects and horrors of war and violence on the civilian populations. This was indeed a life-transforming experience which stimulated and inspired me to utilize my journalistic skills to raise awareness about confl ict-affected communities and work towards peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. Instead of reporting on the events, I began a journey to affect events. What I have collected through my range of professional experiences \u2013 in journalism and peace building - is a deep contextual understanding about how Sri Lanka\u2019s violent confl ict has left its indelible and enduring imprints on the many different local communities and the nation as a whole. Using this knowledge to prevent confl icts, my reporting experience has been particularly helpful in preparing objective early warning reports in volatile areas, where early response actions have evidently prevented everyday disputes between individuals developing along ethnic lines. In all of the assignments I have worked on I report in great detail on the need for improvements in living conditions, as well as security and protection for affected women, highlighting the plight of women and reporting on rights abuses of displaced women in camp environments.

After experiencing untold horrors and being exposed to such atrocities, those who have been able to recover \u2013 albeit some better than others \u2013 and move on is deeply inspiring.

WOMEN\u2019S ISSUES IN THE PEACE PROCESS As in other war situations, in Sri Lanka too, women bore the brunt of effects that stemmed from the country\u2019s bloody 30- year civil war. Even after the end of the war, women from the North and East of the country continue to face critical challenges and dangers, including rights violations, which not only negatively impact on their own healing process but also make inter-ethnic reconciliation even more diffi cult.

They were kept detached from nearly all past efforts of peace negotiation and confl ict resolution. Politically, women\u2019s issues were not placed at the centre of the offi cial political decision making process. Most decisions that concerned women and children were made by male political representatives. Women were mere bystanders. There was no system in place to include women\u2019s ideas and perspectives at the grassroots level into the strategic decision making process. At the civil society level, numerous initiatives attempted to raise awareness of the critical role that women could play in the ongoing peace process. As a result, during the fi nal peace talks held between the government and the LTTE after the signing of a ceasefi re agreement in February 2002, a sub- committee was appointed to look into women\u2019s concerns and issues on an ongoing basis. As negotiations came to a halt in April 2003, with the withdrawal of LTTE from the negotiation table, nothing of signifi cance could be derived from the addition of a special sub-committee for women. At this point in time, there seemed to be a lack of understanding and appreciation among the general public about the specifi c ways in which women were affected by war and violence. MY COUNTRY TODAY Sri Lanka is yet to experience a post-confl ict situation. If I were to elaborate the mood of the country today, there is an emphatic push for a \u2018peace through economic development\u2019 strategy. People often question peace NGO employees, asking why they continue their work now that the war is over. Instead of becoming easier, the overall mood of the country has become even less conducive for peace building work and allows little space for a discussion to take place about inter-ethnic reconciliation involving different ethno- political groups. \u201c As in other war situations, in Sri Lanka too, women bore the brunt of effects that stemmed from the country\u2019s bloody 30- year civil war.

The Key to Empowerment Ampara District, situated in the East of Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic and multi- religious district deliberately crafted by the government\u2019s ethnic engineering projects. It was affected by the confl ict which polarized communities on ethnic lines, creating segregated supporting infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals and administrative and governance bodies. I have worked in this district for over 6 years now and know the context well. I am confi dent that I understand the experience of being a woman in Ampara, having seen the impacts of both the confl ict and entrenched patriarchal norms in my work towards building peace in this district. CHALLENGES FACED BY WOMEN IN AMPARA Traditional patriarchal system still infl uence the roles women play at home and in the community. Hence, there are challenges in the four spaces women occupy: within the home; productive space; community space; and, the community political space. The inability of women to negotiate childcare and domestic responsibilities, lack of alternative childcare support, and development interventions that do not focus on creating an enabling environment where empowered women can thrive, are some of the challenges women face in Ampara. Signifi cant reproductive pressures on women also limit the roles they can play to the space of the home. Though lack of education is often cited as the barrier preventing women\u2019s progression, positions within various organizations are not always occupied by men with higher qualifi cations. While the end of protracted civil war and recovery from the tsunami created job opportunities for women, the public presence of women was not well- accepted. This resulted in name calling and threats. Sexual abuse at work, transportation diffi culties, under-estimation of women\u2019s capabilities and resistance against women leaders are allied sources of de-motivation.

From working on women\u2019s capacity-building for decision-making roles or conducting training on non- violent confl ict-resolution, much of this work is focused on empowering individuals to contribute towards sustainable peace in their communities. I believe empowerment at an individual level requires the internal transformation of the individual, which then leads to personal empowerment. Yet, changing a person alone will not achieve empowerment. Creating an enabling environment where the changed individual can undergo transformation and grow is also necessary. This applies equally to men and women. To undergo transformation and achieve empowerment, women fi rstly need awareness of oppressive systems and then the knowledge and skills to change such systems while creating support mechanisms around them to face these challenges. Women\u2019s networks, from local to national levels and beyond, are effective bases to support empowerment. Within all communities the engagement of men is equally important so gender constructs can be re-evaluated together. Working with different ethnic groups, a challenge for me has been to create a trust where distrust is deeply engrained. For instance, to involve the participation of the rural community leaders in a project, who have previously been confi ned to one homogeneous locality due to their fear and distrust of other ethnic groups was a big challenge which took time and patience to work through. Being from the Sinhala community, I was only successful when working within different ethnic communities because of my total neutrality. I maintained a transparent methodology, listened attentively and helped everyone equally, which helped to build healthy and trusting relationships. Of course there are many layers to the challenges we have to face in this type of work to achieve transformation. Yet, there are equally many sources of inspiration. My mother has been a source of inspiration for me to work towards correcting social inequality and marginalization. Her fi ght against marginalization and social stigma that she personally faced in her life is the driving force for me to work against social exclusion in my lifetime. \u201c To undergo transformation and achieve empowerment, women fi rstly need awareness of oppressive systems and then the knowledge and skills to change such systems while creating support mechanisms around them to face these challenges. \u201c Ayodhya Amarajeewa works for Search for Common Ground in Sri Lanka.

BENEFITING FROM OTHER\u2019S EXPERIENCES \u2013 THE PHILIPPINES In the Philippines I studied different aspects of peace and confl ict transformation while trying to understand how to bring about social transformation through personal transformation. As a graduate student at the Ateneo de Manila University, I was invited to participate in seminars and lectures on the confl ict and peace processes in Mindanao. Military personnel, religious leaders from different denominations, and security sector reform advisors who were involved in the peace process were present in these seminars. During this time in Mindanao, I worked in a religious peace building organization called \u2018Silsilah Dialogue Movement\u2019 founded by an Italian priest. There I was able to learn how a Christian organization won the hearts of the Muslims in their common interest for peace and harmonious coexistence by denouncing violence from all sides and promoting dialogue to solve confl icts. This is where I saw how different aspects of day-to-day life had been used by this organization to transform confl ict in their communities. There is a lot to be learnt from the Philippines steps towards resolving a protracted confl ict. Women participate at all levels of the peace process. They have created a very strong network of confl ict transformation clusters. Different civil society groups have great support from these peace groups. Muslim women are at the forefront of the peace negotiations, and the President\u2019s peace advisor is a woman. The security sector reforms are being evaluated and discussed with men and women alike, and there are women experts employed by the government to work on the security sector reforms. Though there is an involvement of women as combatants in the leftist groups (even Christian religious groups), there is also media coverage and encouragement from the government, NGOs and civil society organizations for women to serve actively in the peace process. This led to lessening the violence in the respective communities with more progressive peacemaking resolutions. Ayodhya AMARAJEEWA, Sri Lanka Laws alone cannot foster women\u2019s empowerment and peace; the cultural context has to be shaped to absorb that change. For this to happen, we must inspire personal transformations. \u201c \u201c 33 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security From my time in Mindanao, I learned how the structural violence created by the government is mitigated by progressive and inclusive civil society groups and by their unity. While religion has been used as a reason for confl ict, many Mindanao people turned religion into a reason for peace. Women have initiated dialogue with other religious groups to minimize violent reactions by opportunistic groups, including both government and extremist. In turn, lessons learnt from the Philippines and the women working for peace have enriched my understanding of Sri Lanka\u2019s post-war experience. REFLECTIONS ON OUR POST-WAR CONTEXT Refl ecting on the Sri Lankan context, it is diffi cult to work in an immediate post-war situation when there is a victor and a defeated party, especially when that defeated party has factions who were formerly a threat to national security, and later accepted political fi gures. This kind of atmosphere affects apolitical peace activism. For me, the biggest challenge is working with politicized institutions and organizations with their own agendas. Because, most of the agencies and governments \u2013 including both those in Sri Lanka and the Philippines \u2013 have their agenda set, they come to the local community with their own approach, not necessarily to fi rst localize their approach to consider local needs. This also shows a shortcoming by not looking at both immediate and long term issues. There needs to be a simultaneous top-down and bottom-up approach, reaching local, national, and international levels. Both national policy advocacy and activism needs to align with the needs at the ground level. Then, very importantly, networking within the individual groups and across all the groups is essential to create a peace that is collectively pursued. As a friend of mine once said to me; \u201cWe don\u2019t need money to reach a sustainable peace, but rather the local peoples\u2019 collective faith to make the change happen.\u201d Laws alone cannot foster women\u2019s empowerment and peace; the cultural context has to be shaped to absorb that change.

Ms. Kanapathippillai holds a MS in Applied Statistics from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka, and has a wide range of experience in confl ict resolution and women\u2019s rights issues through non-government and government organizations. Prior to her current position, Ms. Jayavani worked for FORUT Sri Lanka and the Department of Local Government to assist and promote Internally Displaced Persons\u2019 (IPD) participation in livelihood transition processes. Women\u2019s Roles in Post-war Sri Lanka With the war coming to an end, Sri Lanka is now in the early recovery and transitional phases. Resettlement processes are ongoing, despite lack of facilities. Following the end of the ethnic war, gender roles have seen a considerable shift, with a sharp increase in the number of women-headed households. As part of the cultural and social fabric in Sri Lanka, married women are expected to fi rst consider their family duties, and are hence mostly prevented from involvement in other work outside of the house. Today, women continue to be considered as \u2018soft\u2019 entities who cannot handle technical, heavy and complex issues. It is interesting that women are given a high status in our religions, but rarely is this refl ected in other aspects for most of them. Hence, a real change in gender roles will require educating the masses on the potential that women hold for Sri Lanka\u2019s peaceful progress and recovery. While Sri Lanka is in a recovery and reconstruction period, if the government was serious about engaging women in these processes, then the basic issues related to their safety and security would be given more prominence in creating policies, as well as their implementation. In the aftermath of the Sri Lankan confl ict, especially in the northern and eastern provinces, many women lost their husbands during the war and are now trying to fend for themselves and their children, with the assurance of basic needs, shelter and safety still being elusive. Living in such constant fear, it is unsurprising that few women are able to engage effectively in the post-confl ict reconstruction processes. With the limitations on mobility, fear of harassment and the burden of supporting their families, the likelihood of their effective participation in society becomes limited for most women. This will change only when society begins to understand and respect the rights of women. WORKING WITH THE CONFLICT-AFFECTED When I fi rst started working in communities affected by confl ict, listening to horrifi c experiences and writing reports to seek assistance for such cases was very diffi cult. Gradually, I developed a deeper understanding of the issues in a post-confl ict situation, and the roles that women were playing \u2013 sometimes fi nding clever and clandestine ways to diffuse confl icts and build peace. I worked with civil society groups such as women\u2019s rural development societies, community centers, government organizations and local non-governmental organizations. While implementing a community women\u2019s empowerment programme to improve access to legal services called the Sarvodaya Legal Service Movement, I interacted with many women who came forward to express their problems and tell their personal stories of suffering. Later I also had the opportunity to work for the Equal Access to Justice Project, through which I organized mobile legal documentation clinics and gender awareness programmes.

She was born in Elephant Pass, but her birth had not been registered due to her parent\u2019s ignorance about registration processes. When she was two years old, her father left, leaving her mother to raise her till the age of 8 when people in the village started raising objections on her mother\u2019s morality and asked her to leave and live with her father, who was in Jaffna. She took a bus in search of her father and arrived to fi nd he had started a new family with another woman. Her father accepted her into his home and sent her to school for a few years, but then due to the confl ict she was displaced to Vanni. There she met a relative of her father\u2019s second wife, and became pregnant before marriage.

Until the child was delivered she was in constant fear or threat of harm to herself and her child. Due to the confl ict there, she was again displaced, and the birth of her own child remained unregistered, too. After release from an IDP camp, she came to Jaffna to her father, who worked as a fi sherman and helped support her, but he was getting old. She told me how important it was for her to learn some skills to get a job so she could survive and sustain her child, but she suffered many times from not having any papers and wanted to make it a priority to register her child\u2019s birth. Her pursuit to work and build a life was continuously set back by the position society placed her in as a single- woman from a poor background. Given that these issues and challenges must be faced by many women across Sri Lanka, I feel a great sense of duty and responsibility to help other women in my country who are less fortunate. While there are useful interventions taking place, real change for women can only be brought about when these initiatives are up-scaled and made sustainable. Building skills for livelihoods and support services for single women and female-headed households is critical to achieving a peace that is felt by all. I believe that giving the opportunity to women from different villages, towns or districts to connect, share and exchange their views could be very empowering, so that women can form bonds to collectively woke towards the recovery of our country together. \u201c Her pursuit to work and build a life was continuously set back by the position society placed her in as a single-woman from a poor background. \u201c Ana Paula Maia Santos is a member of FOKUPERS, a national women\u2019s organization working for women\u2019s rights based in Dili, Timor- Leste.

Prior to her current position, Ms. Paula worked as a Consultant for a UNDP Timor-Leste Gender Project. In this role she provided UNDP with a Socio- economic and Gender Baseline Study of two districts that are considered the poorest districts in Timor-Leste. Ms. Paula has over 9 years of experience working in the fi eld of women\u2019s rights.

Ms. Paula holds a BA in Women\u2019s Studies from the University of Hawaii, United States of America, and a Diploma in Economic Management from the University of Jember, Indonesia. The Fight to Empower Ourselves Being born in wartime was not easy. The war forced me and other young Timorese to leave school and work at early ages. I did not enjoy a normal childhood because I was a refugee and spent my early adulthood working with other women comrades helping women victims of violence. I also supported the underground movement during the resistance and the political confl ict periods towards the diffi cult birth of my nation, Timor-Leste. Experiencing the bitter killings and tortures in Timor-Leste, having friends and relatives who were raped and beaten to death in dark alleys, I disliked this thing called war. MY PATH \u2013 FROM CONFLICT TO POST-CONFLICT Witnessing all the pain and suffering of my people, my family and my women comrades during the occupation, I decided to join FOKUPERS in 1997. It was a time when young women gathered together to secretly help other women who had been tortured or had relatives that were killed and disappeared during the Indonesian occupation. During this crucial time, we advocated and mediated diffi cult issues, in an unpredictable environment, between Indonesian military members and the East Timor forces. After the 1999 massacres, as an Advocacy Offi cer of FOKUPERS, I convened and facilitated dialogues in the communities among families of victims and perpetrators. I was a member of a FOKUPERS team working within local communities preventing further confl icts from erupting. In the more settled post-1999 period, I continued working to provide support to Timorese people returning from West Timor who were placed in quarantine because they could not return to their villages. Some of these returnees were women who were raped and/or abducted to be sex slaves. FOKUPERS at that time searched for their families and helped facilitate their return, or settlement into shelters when that was not possible.

In the post-2006 period, I settled into the more day to day work of fi nding peaceful alternatives to better protect women, young girls and children in the IDP camps and to facilitate their return to their home villages. Ana Paula MAIA SANTOS, Timor-Leste Education, both formal and informal, is the foundation to empowering women. Women must be well-educated and well-equipped with knowledge and skill in order to have a voice at the peace table. \u201c \u201c 37 N-Peace - Women\u2019s Perspectives of Peace & Security protector. Wives are not generally free to express their thoughts and ideas. These obstacles are rooted in our culture. On the other hand, as a woman I think I am blessed with courage, skills and good heart to help other people and to empower other women. In this work, I learned a few things that were effective in moving women to the front of civil society, where we could infl uence the lives of our people. Education, both formal and informal, is the foundation to empowering women. Women must be well-educated and well-equipped with knowledge and skill in order to have a voice at the peace table. Increasing the number of women attending school and creating more informal education programs for those who were forced to leave school during the occupation and the internal political confl ict periods is vital. Personal courage and motivation are above everything necessary to keep moving forward. I would like to add that woman must fi ght against their laziness, and personal worries and anxieties without fear of becoming an enemy of others. GREAT LEADERS BEFORE US I believe Mahatma Gandhi serves as the ideal role model. His non-violence teachings and movements must become the example not only for people and the Government of Timor-Leste, but people around the world. I take inspiration from his quotes including this one: \u201cWhen I despair, I remember that all through history the ways of truth and love have always won. There have been tyrants, and murderers, and for a time they can seem invincible, but in the end they always fall. Think of it \u2013 always.\u201d Another quote by Dr. Adela A. Allen speaks to me about how we should embrace our differences, in gender, in culture, and in peace: \u201cWe should acknowledge differences, we should greet differences, until difference makes no difference anymore\u201d. My family, my women comrades and all the people of Timor-Leste are the main source of inspiration encouraging me to carry out my work. We, who are victims of war and who have suffered through these crucial times fi ghting for our country\u2019s independence and freedom from lives of violence, are the reasons to live. In preparation of the 2007 election, my work turned more to creating solutions through political action. I prepared women to participate in the election by providing capacity building and leadership skills. Getting women in the sub- district to successfully participate was not an easy task, requiring coordination with the Women Caucus, media and Church to infl uence the government, the politicians and the local district authorities. Currently, we are entering a new stage of national development, where our work is taking part in peace mediation and negotiation led by civil society and community-based organizations, as well as the traditional leaders of Tara Bandu (peace negotiation and mediation through traditional mechanisms). As well, we are supporting groups, working for peace with the government and other institutions. We continue working with groups of women in several districts who continue suffering internal political confl icts and domestic fi ghts in their villages, encouraging communities to solve violence with non-violent methods and economic activities. OBSTACLES TO EMPOWERMENT The greatest challenge I face in my work is the simple fact that I am a woman. As a woman, a mother and a wife, I am looked down upon by the community for opposing the traditional values and norms of our culture. A woman working in the public\u2019s eye is viewed with skepticism and doubted not only by her male counterparts, but by females who conform to traditional cultural values.

Ms. Bere graduated from the Nusa Cendana University of Kupang - Indonesia in 2003 with a Bachelor of Law. Promoting Laws for Women in Timor-Leste Since March 2004, I have dedicated myself to women\u2019s issues in Timor-Leste, focussed on gender justice, through court monitoring and legislative analysis. My objective is to make sure that all laws and court practices in Timor-Leste conform to international standards for non-discrimination between men and women, and that they provide protection to vulnerable people, such as children and women, who are especially at risk of violence during armed confl ict and post-confl ict periods. Over the years, I have grown a great deal professionally. But, my experiences working in this line of work, at this time and in this environment has also created opportunities for great personal growth, as an individual. CULTURAL CHALLENGES AS A WOMAN A challenge as a Timorese woman working in the post-confl ict situation has been the cultural restrictions placed upon us. Local cultural practices prevented women from speaking in the gatherings of elders (made-up of men only), as women were traditionally perceived as having nothing valuable to offer for the good of the community. Initially, because I looked so young, no one took me seriously. For example, when I spoke before community leaders about gender bias and the Law Against Domestic Violence, they said: \u201cWhy must we listen to this young woman, who doesn\u2019t know our culture? And, she is a woman \u2013 we don\u2019t need to listen to her.\u201d To earn their confi dence, I approached them in a non-confrontational and respectful way using my persuasive experience as a lawyer. I offered them real examples of women victims, and explained about our role as citizens to end discrimination between men and women, as stated in our nation\u2019s Constitution, and explained about the state\u2019s and local community\u2019s obligations to all of its citizens and members. After establishing a mutually respectful dialogue, the community leaders became more receptive to listening to these new ideas. Only then could I start speaking about the objectives and content of the programs we promote. A major benefi t to my work is that I now enjoy good relations within the local community and amongst other involved actors. Because of my active work with community leaders, people often invite me to join the elders when they discuss important family issues, like when a family member has died, or gets married. I hope this might serve as an example to younger women and girls, that women have a valuable place at the table with community and family elders.

APSCTL is a national NGO working across the sub-districts of Timor- Leste on peace building with women by providing training, undertaking research, and managing a set of programs, including scholarships for women and working with widows on enterprise development initiatives. Ms. Sequeira is also a board member of Rede Feto, a women\u2019s network in Timor-Leste. She is the author of multiple research publications on women and violence and is the author of several books on women in the resistance period. Ms. Sequeira holds a Bachelor Degree in Marketing from the University UNPAZ, Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste\u2019s Secret Strugglers I view my role in the peace building process as a facilitator. I organize community-based groups for discussions and identify their needs from those discussions. After necessary planning, my colleagues and I will then undertake advocacy responding to the community\u2019s priority issues. The outcomes I aim to achieve depend on the interests of the local people themselves. These community-based groups identify their own needs. They are the ones who work to develop and contribute to their families, to their communities and to their nation. My role is to assist and mentor them in a process that they own. Participatory, focus group discussions and learning by doing are the best methods to empower women to become more engaged in peace building. Civil society organizations should engage women in all programs and activities; government should support and give attention for women\u2019s programs, especially in rural areas. CREATING A LEGACY TO SUSTAIN FUTURE PEACE WORKERS Recognizing the role women have played in our struggle for independence and building peace creates positive role models and is important to women\u2019s empowerment. Believing a very personal history of Timor\u2019s struggle should be chronicled, I co-authored a book on women involved in the clandestine movement towards independence titled, Secrecy: The Key to Independence. The women in this book had not had the opportunity to tell their stories and talking about their histories raised in them painful emotions and feelings. Many of the women were angry about the way our government failed to recognize their contributions and felt betrayed by their former colleagues. Many women were still facing much hardship in their lives. I felt that I could not just talk to these women and hear and record their stories, but needed to follow-up on their issues through my advocacy on their behalves, and by supporting them in their own endeavors to create change. This book is a major contribution to sustaining peace building momentum in our country beyond ourselves. When the book was published, these women and many others were able to see the positive outcome of their contributions; that their lives were now on the public record and chronicled in a history that will inspire others, and particularly women. I was able to get close to these women and others like them as I am trusted because of my engagement in this process of peace building. The good practice that I believe that I have followed in my work has affected other people who Isabel M.Mar\u00e7al SEQUEIRA (Beba), Timor-Leste The outcomes I aim to achieve depend on the interests of the local people themselves....
