Together, during the period of enlargement over 60+ years they have built a zone of stability, democracy and sustainable development whilst maintaining cultural diversity, tolerance and individual freedoms. The European Union is committed to sharing its achievements and values with countries and peoples beyond its borders. IUCN is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of more than 1,300 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ The Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC) is an independent, non- political and non-for-profit international organization with regional mandate to assist the Central Asian states, regional and international stakeholders in addressing environmental and sustainability challenges across Central Asian region and Afghanistan. CAREC was founded in 2001 by a joint decision of the five Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), European Union and United Nations Development Programme, following the resolution of the IV Pan- European Conference held in 1998, Aarhus (Denmark). By promoting dialogue and collaboration among environmental stakeholders, CAREC has today become a leading regional knowledge hub in the field of environment and sustainable development recognized by national, regional and international partners. CAREC works through five thematic programs: Water Initiatives Support; Climate Change and Sustainable Energy; Environmental Management; Education for Sustainable Development; Environment and Health. www.carececo.org https://www.facebook.com/carececo/ https://twitter.com/recca_carec Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach Best practice nexus case studies The designation of any geographical entities in this publication, and the presentation of the material, do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN and the Regional Environmental Centre of Central Asia (CAREC) concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

Conclusions ................................................................................................................... 35 References ......................................................................................................................... 37 VI Executive summary To showcase how increased returns on investment opportunities can be achieved by applying a nexus approach, best practices of the Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus were collected in the form of several case studies within the frame of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. The best practice cases focus on water, energy and food security dimensions that advance socio-economic development and propose the nexus as a promising approach to resolving competition over limited resources. The selected case studies cover a range of WEF security concerns for a variety of key stakeholders linked with these sectors and are assessed through a Stakeholder-Problem typology that summarises challenges across the Central Asian region. Apart from lessons learned, each case study includes an explanation of its relevance to the region. This collection of case studies support a better understanding of the WEF Nexus approach and thus allows for the shortcomings of single sector approaches to be addressed. The selected case studies provide insights from other regions of the world and offer important lessons learnt that support the Central Asian region in designing interventions and planning for investments that help achieve WEF security. However, the case studies do not produce a comprehensive catalogue of methods, tools and approaches.

Introduction 1.1 What is the \u2018WEF Nexus\u2019 approach? Human existence depends on the availability of water, food and energy. These sectors are often governed and managed in isolation despite the fact that the use of and actions taken in one resource impact one or both of the others. The Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus has emerged as a way forward to provide options to mitigate stress on water resources posed by climate change, increasing population, economic development and urbanisation. Water is becoming increasingly scarce in relation to the demands upon it and the requirements for water are changing as economies diversify. At the same time, finance for much needed infrastructure is becoming increasingly more difficult to secure given the economic demands for more growth and development. Only a small amount of available funding is allocated for multi-purpose infrastructure (EIB, 2016 Budapest Water Summit). Multi-purpose infrastructure offers a convincing way forward, where social and environmental externalities are better integrated into infrastructure design and investment, and where more than one sector benefits from the investment. However, investments remain constrained by a combination of factors, which include the following: \u2022 Sectoral silo thinking on the part of policy makers and planners, often driven by institutional mandates, legal limitations and the often silo nature of conventional finance; \u2022 Inflexibility in development interventions and finance \u2013 often limited by well-meaning and solid experience in sectoral development approaches, but not cross-sectorally focused; \u2022 Government policies, which favour for example food self-sufficiency over food security, and consequently raise issues of sovereignty, which can challenge transboundary cooperation and the nexus through limiting cooperation and supply chains for example; and \u2022 An unwillingness to accept trade-offs or compromises that could speak to a greater and longer-term set of benefits, often limited by short-term political horizons and self- sufficiency concerns. Better understanding the WEF Nexus can support addressing the dilemma of single sector approaches and foster understanding of linkages between natural resource use, allows for the brokering of compromise, trade-offs or synergies between competing interests. Although its seeds first appeared at the Mar Del Plata Conference in 1977 where delegates concluded that \u201cgood water management must be part of broader governance and government at all scales, not a self-contained silo into which other parties are invited on sufferance\u201d, the \u2018nexus\u2019 grew on mainly academic thinking to identify and address trade-offs through the 2000\u2019s. The Bonn Nexus Conference in 2011 is seen by some as a landmark event, where broader political and commercial interest in the nexus was raised and the 6th World Water Forum in 2012 greatly influenced the discourse on the nexus amongst the different actors. The World Economic Forum and the Rio Conference have rigorously promoted the WEF Nexus, which is regarded as an ideal mechanism for better management of the three sectors to achieve water, energy and food security. However, for many, the nexus is still a new and untested idea. 2 The nexus is not a one-way discussion. Nexus thinking challenges the application of historical and local knowledge and highlights the need for greater integration of core elements of resource management and sectoral development, such as data collection, sharing and analysis/interpretation (Ozment et al, 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5612c9db-bb72-43ae-930b-73020a94e88f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5612c9db-bb72-43ae-930b-73020a94e88f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "141df32817c942d15ae445636f164169d89d64df955b93ed73c8ccf04176cdfe"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad3da757-f360-4622-b470-d8ce2522fa83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af41fb7bca2476f71e5ec498baf58e9a29c743080527b6c5ff3c5c831a33fa09"}}, "hash": "cd0b4358e760d9f92c4b44e0513d2b2e37eea544106908975e7a25ac1754923a", "text": "Through dialogue, opportunities can be created to bring together people with a variety of experiences from across sectors, to brainstorm and exchange knowledge, with the ultimate aim to move to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eda22c51-6997-417e-acbc-5fd2b31ec6eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "eda22c51-6997-417e-acbc-5fd2b31ec6eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a168e21fb4be00356c51d443d6d1471cfa23279e9d2205ab05d2ede8f0769309"}, "3": {"node_id": "3622bcde-055c-4853-9d94-7e70713b8b5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c1c33ad32cf411eb1ea3402b00be77dbc8b1b3645d7c81820be091f225a05ce"}}, "hash": "f0e3deaf89da5595a80cb3ad1d67eb5fce7dfbc3549187f83d5d31f3b3e652c7", "text": "developing and implementing practical actions. This is based on the belief that there is a competitive advantage for all institutions, public, private, etc., to better understand the cause and effect relationships they are involved in through both implementation of their mandates, and policy actions and reform. The increasing pressures on water resources mean that relying on \u2018safeguards\u2019 to protect social and environmental integrity are often not good enough. Through better identification of risks, sharing the risks and optimising the trade-offs that need to be made between sectors, advantages for all sectors can emerge. The three nexus opportunities can be defined as follows: \u2022 Trade-offs, whereby a preferred objective is traded for another, which may be absolute or seasonal (for example hydropower storage and release of water for energy generation at different times of the year); \u2022 Compromises, whereby a result, which is less than perfect for one or more stakeholders is accepted by all; and \u2022 Synergies, where one intervention covers multiple nexus objectives and as such would be the way that a \u201cwin-win-win\u201d can be achieved (e.g. an example might be natural infrastructure, such as a manufactured wetland that increases the supply of water for crop and energy production, while contributing to biodiversity and improving water quality and so could be invested in and managed by all benefitting sectors). The WEF Nexus approach focuses on considering and engaging the agricultural and energy sectors to ensure the recognition of impact, sharing of data, investment opportunities and trade-off identification to understand where development synergies can be identified. This becomes even more important in transboundary situations, such as is the case in Central Asia, where energy is traded across borders and rivers may be affected by energy generation due to hydropower storage. This reconciliation of different water needs and uses is important to: \u2022 Look beyond the basin, at appropriate scales of resource use to identify where investment is needed, where management improvements are required and where policy reform could be an option; \u2022 Identify potential additional benefits from co-management and coordination over different resources as opportunities for cooperation (for example, between water and energy use, in particular hydropower operators); and \u2022 Conduct (policy) focussed dialogue, building understanding and trust between stakeholders from different sectors that look to the future development of the resources and sectors they are responsible for. Finally, by looking for multi-sector, multi-purpose investment options to enhance development, increase production and economic growth, considering the inter-linkages between the water, energy and food/land management sectors, the nexus is likely to: \u2022 Reduce the pressure on line ministry budgets because investment costs are shared with others, as well as better risk identification and joint mitigation; 3 \u2022 Increase the economic returns on a given investment because of the multiple benefit streams that can result from multi-sectoral investments that focus on the multiplier effects on investment and improved management. Box 1: WEF Nexus vs. IWRM Due to historical confusion and challenge by some, it is necessary to explain why nexus is not the same as Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). There are several reasons why this is so: \u2022 IWRM is concerned with the allocation of water between competing uses \u2212 this makes it highly technocratic in nature and it hence resides in the domain of water managers occluding broader but key issues of policy and political economy. \u2022 IWRM does not address broader issues of resource and human security, for which different classes of stakeholders have different perceptions including for national governments, territorial or economic security. \u2022 IWRM is limited to the watershed and as such has tighter boundaries (i.e. river basins), whereas nexus transcends hydrological boundaries, which might be sectoral, geopolitical, economic (such as supply chains, both public and private) or civil- administrative in nature. \u2022 IWRM tends to be applied at the level of the basin or catchment, whereas nexus can be applied at any scale. IWRM has struggled to really get the impact across the economic, equity and environmental principles it is guided by and recent documented progress suggest IWRM remains off-track to achieve SDG 6.5.1 by 2030. Because the concept of IWRM is based at the river basin management level, this can often disengage some of the more powerful water management sectors, such as agriculture and energy. Particularly the energy sector is often disengaged from the basin, where it extracts water from, or impacts downstream flow, leading to a disconnect in resource use to economic benefits and trade-offs that can occur.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3622bcde-055c-4853-9d94-7e70713b8b5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3622bcde-055c-4853-9d94-7e70713b8b5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a168e21fb4be00356c51d443d6d1471cfa23279e9d2205ab05d2ede8f0769309"}, "2": {"node_id": "eda22c51-6997-417e-acbc-5fd2b31ec6eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0e3deaf89da5595a80cb3ad1d67eb5fce7dfbc3549187f83d5d31f3b3e652c7"}}, "hash": "8c1c33ad32cf411eb1ea3402b00be77dbc8b1b3645d7c81820be091f225a05ce", "text": "4 Yurts in the Kazakhstan Mountains, Almatay \u00a9 Shutterstock/Aureliy. 1.2 The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project is one", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e70e2ac3-3e28-46e5-8af1-652e44b49925": {"__data__": {"id_": "e70e2ac3-3e28-46e5-8af1-652e44b49925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb8c028f8452cfa11f523f3f5abcdc33a50258ed817fe8bc464ac2b382fcec3f"}, "3": {"node_id": "15cd3c9b-43d9-4400-8a58-6d44af0ea76b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf77bf14afccda402024fe8428008a1405b67838b0a6a4609094022d834c93fc"}}, "hash": "5e004e6c5bdffc19ccf7aa6b9d5b88ed49c3d5647b53a6f400fb11e41f7698a7", "text": "of five regional projects that together comprise the global \u201cNexus Regional Dialogue Programme\u201d funded by the European Union (EU) and the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).1 The Programme intends to strengthen the political processes needed at the regional and national levels to meet the increasing demand for water, energy and food. To do so, it supports regional stakeholders in the development of concrete dialogue and policy recommendations and action plans for future \u2018nexus\u2019 investments, with specific emphasis on multi-sector infrastructure and corresponding capacity development activities.

This in turn can help to support social and environmental development across the region. To this end, this document presents the nexus as a process, which takes place where competing interests of water, energy and food intersect and has been prepared for the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. Using case studies and sharing lessons learned from different countries, regions and river basins, the document demonstrates that the nexus can be used to reconcile competing interests: water, land and energy, or water, food, energy and the environment, or even water, energy and navigation. 2. Best practice case studies The case studies presented here suggest that the nexus offers a promising approach to the resolution of potential resource conflicts. At the same time, it also can expand development possibilities across the region in times of increasing competition over water, energy and food resources between stakeholders from climate change, increasing water needs and scarcity, population growth and economic diversification to promote growth and development. 2.1 Framework of analysis \u2013 typology of nexus relevance for Central Asia To this end, the following case studies focus on water, energy and food security in the region for a variety of key stakeholders linked to these sectors and security concerns. Table 1 presents a Stakeholder-Problem typology, which helps to contextualise the relevance of the case studies. It summarises challenges across the Central Asian region in providing water, energy and food security (as introduced above) for four main stakeholder groups, i.e. state entities, civil society, private sector and the environment (including its services). The Stakeholder-Problem typology indicates a range of inter-sector, sometimes transboundary competition between the water, energy, food and environmental sectors. Accordingly, the selected case studies cover the full range of security concerns across the stakeholder groups and contextualise the relevance of the case studies for the Central Asian region.

The basin is one of the most diverse and valuable natural resources in Africa, which is critical to sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in the region as it provides important environmental goods and services to the region and is essential to regional food security and hydropower production. Extreme climatic variability characterises the flows of the river and its tributaries and as a result, floods and droughts frequently devastate people and economies of the region, especially the poorest members of the population. Unilateral, post-independence development and political economy strategies of the riparian countries, as well as the diverse physical characteristics of the Basin, have led to mainly unilateral management of the water resources. To illustrate the benefits of cooperation among the riparian countries in the Basin through a multi-sectoral economic evaluation of water resources development, management options and scenarios to increase agricultural yields, hydropower outputs and economic opportunities \u2014 from both national and basin-wide perspectives \u2013 a multi- sector investment opportunity analysis (MSIOA) was conducted by the World Bank (Alavian et al., 2010). Using a total of 29 different scenarios, the analysis assessed the relative strengths and weaknesses of different combinations of investment concepts for hydropower, irrigation and 2 Adapted from Riddell 2015 8 floodplain restoration in the river basins \u2013 with domestic water supply and environmental stream flows prioritised as unaffected benefits/options in almost every case. Focusing down on eight scenarios, they represent a very clear and helpful illustration of how trade-offs work between the three nexus elements: water, energy and food (Figure 1 below). The figure illustrates changes in the production of one sector (energy) under a range of development scenarios, which include either no change or a single change in another sector, in this case irrigated area.

Scenario 2D is the same as Scenario 2A but with power generation fully coordinated throughout the transboundary basin. Scenario 3 assumes no further investments in hydropower, which is produced under non-coordinated conditions, but the irrigation potential is exhausted and an additional area of 774,000 ha with all demand for domestic water supply and flood restoration in the lower delta satisfied along with an allowance made for environmental in- stream flows. It indicates a significant trade-off against power generation and for growth of the agricultural sector. However, the expanded irrigation service would create an additional 250,000 jobs, which is another trade-off, especially as new value chains3 and improved livelihoods would likely increase demand for energy. From the baseline scenario, the methodology allows to present other situations, of which the most preferable fall into what the World Bank calls the \u201cdesirable development zone\u201d. These scenarios (5, 5A and 8) will be a nexus-oriented solution almost by definition as they are (i) aware of the impacts on different resource bases and sectoral needs and (ii) able to use scenarios as predictors of what is technically feasible and economically desirable. An important assumption of this methodology is that political will exists and the suggested scenarios are politically acceptable. Scenario 5 illustrates an option to allow for an additional 774,000 ha of irrigated area while a portion of the investment in new power generation would be traded towards increased agricultural production and employment (likely containing increased energy demand of newly employed agricultural sector workers and the value chains they are employed in). Scenario 5A is the same as Scenario 5, except that power generation is coordinated across the transboundary basin. Similarly, Scenario 8 shows a situation where, compared to the baseline, both hydropower generation and irrigation area increases. The difference to Scenario 5 is that hydropower dams are used for flood protection, whereby they are operated at less than full supply level during flood seasons in order to provide unused storage for flood attenuation purposes. It can be assumed that the economic benefits of flood protection more than outweigh the economic costs accruing 3 Some of which will produce waste material, which could be used for co-generation e.g., rice husks or bagasse (pulp waste following sugar cane extraction). Other agricultural waste, if composted, would reduce the need for energy intensive synthetic fertilisers, other waste still, could be used for biogas production etc. 9 to sub-optimal power generation (although avoided costs such as disaster prevention are harder to predict due to climate change uncertainties). Figure 1: Potential for energy generation and irrigation by development potential in the Zambezi River Basin 2.2.2 Lessons learned Three lessons emerge from this example: \u2022 Nexus can be applied in an iterative fashion, testing various combinations of results using scenarios and multi-sector dialogues to test approaches using common and agreed data and objectives (shared vision approaches); \u2022 Trade-offs can be applied at very large scales and so can be absorbed at scale and therefore mitigated against, provided this is recognised and understood; and \u2022 Changes in the operational rules of hydropower dams can increase benefits in other sectors, in this case irrigation and flood control, but may therefore create challenges to secure energy generation during dry periods.This can create opportunities for other renewable energy investments (Opperman et al., 2019) that can help stimulate economic diversification, new business opportunities, low carbon development and access to investment and modular systems that put less strain on ageing transmission networks. 2.2.3 Relevance to the region Although this case study presents potential scenarios, rather than an actual investment, it is highly relevant as it provides a common point of reference for all riparian countries. The complexities inherent in national economics and transboundary political relationships are not directly addressed in this analysis. Instead, this is left to the riparian countries to consider. The analysis 10 allows the countries to make informed decisions based on the results of this and other analyses that clearly show that significant contributions to water, energy and food security can be achieved by combinations of smartly sized and operated hydropower and expanded irrigation with additional flood management benefits. Most nexus research to date points to the need to better coordinate planning across sectors and in transboundary situations to minimise problems and maximise returns. In this case, this study was used to frame discussions amongst riparian states based on agreed data and science and capacity from the region to inform higher-level development discussions.

In the Upper East region of Ghana, benefits from natural infrastructure services provide communities from the Pwalugu region with an average annual income of US $1,360 per household (including base flow benefits across a population of up to 30,000 people). Natural seasonal flooding of the White Volta River supports a long standing and healthy flood recession agriculture economy, which in turn offers a range of livelihood activities that correspond to 53% of total annual household income. It also helps to fill seasonal freshwater depressions turning into breeding ponds that support fish farms as the floodwaters retreat. Flooding is also critical to recharge the groundwater on which people rely on for drinking water during the dry season. The river\u2019s annual hydrograph, i.e. alternating periods of river spate and base flow, drives a key part of the economic and social well-being of the population that has adapted to the flow of the river and who depends on the flooding for recession farming, floodplain cattle grazing and capture fisheries. These activities provide valuable incomes, support food security for villages close to the river and allow for trade across the region. A multi-purpose dam (the Pwalugu dam) proposed for the White Volta River in Northern Ghana, close to its border with Burkina Faso, is intended to produce up to 200 Gwh/year. If built according to its original design, the dam would impact downstream river flow and reduce flood events 12 important for local food production, resulting in competition between hydropower, irrigation needs, and local livelihoods. As part of IUCN\u2019s WISE-UP project4, to support decision-making and better understand the impact of the possible operating modes and construction of the proposed dam on different livelihood activities, the value and benefits derived from the river basin were monetised. A basin model combining different sources of data (hydrological, infrastructure data etc.) was developed to visualise the trade-offs and different impacts the operation and design of the proposed Pwalugu dam could have on relevant natural systems. These data and information were shared with a range of stakeholders in Pwalugu, including the River Authority, the Irrigation Board, the Energy producers, key government institutions, civil society as well as local stakeholders. Through a series of Action Learning workshops stakeholders were encouraged to collectively deliberate on which trade-offs to prioritise, based on reliable information of the impacts on other sectors. The Pwalugu Dam Steering Committee, formed of various stakeholders from the agricultural, energy and water management sectors to inform the dam design and planning process also engaged with the IUCN project, as some of these Steering Committee members were invited to participate in the multi-stakeholder learning workshops. Stakeholders were shown how to make informed choices over what priorities to include in the modelling process, and how decisions can be applied on which service(s) to optimise over others using the dam, natural system or combinations of the two as a set of \u2018hybrid solutions\u2019 (see Figure 2). The different coloured lines in Figure 2 represent different operation modes of the proposed dam (a to f) and indicate how the dam would perform under different scenarios for the five livelihood priorities.

This in turn, allows stakeholders to determine what is the best available blend of options, depending on their needs and wishes, the policy options that allow these developments, the current allocation regime for water resources and the economic returns from the different options. These tools can help identify where possible 'tipping points' exist, i.e. where the increases in one benefit relative to another are too extreme. For example, where energy generation may severely impact fish catch, or where energy generation may affect the generating capacity of downstream hydropower by looking at the broader hydraulic system. As such, quantifications developed using approaches like this provide important data for negotiation between different sectors and resource users. 2.3.2 Lessons learned The results of the Pwalugu modelling exercise that was done collaboratively with multiple stakeholder groups demonstrates that trade-offs, compromise and even synergies can emerge from a nexus approach when multi-sectoral opportunities and impacts are assessed in detail. Indeed, early stakeholder engagement and the application of an iterative modelling approach, like the one done for the Pwalugu dam, can be crucial to find common ground and understanding as the basis of nexus negotiation. In this real-life case, the dam has not been developed yet, because the marginal economic benefits of the potential energy production through the dam did not outweigh the downstream impacts on the environment and livelihoods of people. Instead, a formal irrigation scheme was introduced that was considered a more economically viable investment. Other lessons learned include the following: \u2022 Although modelling of this kind may result in controversial or unpopular recommendations, it is nonetheless a powerful tool for the quantification and visualisation of Water-Energy- Food interactions. \u2022 Cross-sectoral cooperation and an understanding of political economy is critical during nexus dialogues to understand which institutions have the power to make decisions and the mandate to determine allocations of water resources. Often, it is the energy sector that has the legal mandate to do this and not the water or agricultural decision makers. These power dynamics and relationships were mapped and explored during repeated Action Learning consultation meetings. These consultations were designed to understand where the \u2018room for manoeuvre\u2019 existed between stakeholders in order to come to acceptable agreement, recognising the positive and negative impacts of, in this case, the proposed dam. Datasets and information need to be available for all stakeholder institutions involved to build understanding across sectors and stakeholders. Frequent consultations are needed to open up new areas for potential collaboration in decision- making, which can help to improve understanding. \u2022 Understanding the implications (positive as well as negative) of trade-offs and compromise supports the identification of an optimal nexus solution. It is possible to overcome competition between sectors and conflicts over allocation of resources through the sharing of data and identification of opportunities for trade-offs and compromise. 14 2.3.3 Relevance to the region The case study presented above elaborates the use of an analytical tool rather than an actual nexus investment. Nonetheless, it is relevant to the Central Asian region as it offers a tool to use real-life data and situations to illustrate the concrete impacts a proposed dam could have on a variety of livelihoods that depend on the natural resources. At the same time, the modelling demonstrates that significant contributions to water, energy and food security can be achieved by the adoption of multi-purpose operating rules at hydropower dams \u2013 acknowledging trade- offs, finding compromise and nourishing synergies. This is relevant to problems a.3/4/7/10 and 12 and c.3 (see \u2461 in Table 1). 15 Fisherwoman in Boeung Chhmar Ramsar Site \u00a9IUCN/Pheakdey Sorn. 2.4 Case Study 3: Multiple sector use of irrigation infrastructure from across Asia 2.4.1 Description Various studies have shown that paddy fields can contribute to reducing flood risks.

It is interesting to also understand that yields are often dependent on cropping calendars. The farmers consider planting rice at sub-optimal times in order for the fields to be empty during the period when floods are more likely. This is being tested in Vietnam\u2019s Mekong Delta (Khanh Triet et al., 2018). Once again, this represents a trade-off between rice yields and the risk of flood damage. Similarly, in addition to Thailand\u2019s existing modality of flood management in planted rice fields \u2013 which is usually a peri-urban flood management measure \u2013 manipulation of the growing season is also being tested. Instead of shifting the growing season, short season rice varieties are being evaluated as a flood management measure. Participating farmers grow rice, which is ready for harvest after 2.5 months6 after which the paddies would 5 However, the effectiveness of paddy fields in flood reduction is highly dependent on the irrigation method used, with water saving approaches such as alternative wetting and drying or the System of Rice Intensification being most effective. 6 As compared with the five month rice that is more typical in Thailand. 16 temporarily convert into a floodwater retention area. This helps the state to manage annual monsoon inundation without having to invest in large-scale infrastructure alternatives. This clearly goes beyond the random use of the paddy field for flood management, but rather represents an intentional use of the available infrastructure to deliver a public good using private land. This approach is actually nothing new. It uses traditional knowledge from before more intense agricultural practices and demands for land increased. This re-familiarisation with land management approaches not only shows the value of this traditional knowledge, it also helps to use land for multiple purposes, from agriculture, flood retention and fishing. From a nexus perspective, this approach highlights the use of fishery benefits as a synergy and not a trade-off. Nothing is lost as a consequence of this approach, but better management to prepare for a broader range of benefits that can be realised from the same piece of land is required. Furthermore, the gene pool integrity of the capture fishery also improves as a result of increased connectivity of relevant freshwater habitats, which re-distributes nutrients and sediment across the land. In principle, there is no reason why this approach should not be used on any sort of agricultural land. However, three factors suggest why wetland rice fields are best suited for this: i) the rice fields, being delineated by bunds, are better able to hold flood water (especially if the bunds are built higher than necessary); ii) the drainage of wetland rice area is not expected to keep fields dry; and iii) waterlogging is less of a problem in wetland rice areas than in dryland and other cropland areas. 2.4.2 Lessons learned Two lessons emerge from this example: \u2022 Nexus can re-purpose existing, single sector infrastructure to achieve trade-offs or synergies between competing sectors. Maximising benefits does not always require investments in large infrastructure, but may be achieved through supplementary infrastructure solutions at a smaller scale. This builds flexibility into existing systems that are often designed for large-scale control and introduces adaptable management into agriculture. Benefits can be derived from improved management and investment in people and organisations, rather than just large-scale infrastructure that comes with high capital, operational and management costs. \u2022 Lost traditional practices and knowledge may re-emerge as highly relevant due to a nexus analysis that allows for a broader perspective on how to solve problems. Sectors, which may create negative development impacts have the ability and mandate to mitigate those problems fully. This in turn may have cultural benefits in terms of societal acceptance of \u201cnew\u201d ideas and can empower communities to better manage resources, and localise decision-making. This can help to remove institutional blockages where communities are unsure as to who to turn to and where institutions do not have the expertise or soft skill sets to engage with farmers and communities. For nexus thinking and water management to be fully mobilised and put into practice, farmers need to be empowered. 2.4.3 Relevance to the region This case study is relevant because: i) rice production is significant in Central Asia (see Table 2); and ii) flood risk is increasing across Central Asia. As such, the use of rice fields for flood 17 management is relevant to problems a.1/2 and 13 in the typology (see \u2462 in Table 1).

The river basin is characterised by high demographic growth, high poverty levels (more than 50% of the population live on less than US $2 per day), and a high dependence on agriculture for income and food security. In the basin, the quantity of water available is not only a concern because of economic and climate change impacts, including drought across the region. Competing interests related to water distribution and allocation of water among its different uses and different sectors create challenges and demand trade-offs. Indeed, there is a high interdependency between water, food and energy needs. The river basin is a key regional energy provider with several hydropower dams in operation and planned (Figure 3). At the same time, the river is also used for navigation, fishing and trade, making many people reliant on the health of the river system and its surrounding riparian ecosystems. 19 Figure 3: Existing and planned dams in the Senegal River basin (Source: OMVS) The Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du fleuve S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (OMVS) is the transboundary management authority responsible to manage the river system. Since its creation in 1972, OMVS has put in place several legal, institutional and political mechanisms to foster regional cooperation in order to develop the shared basin sustainably. Its mandate is to promote food self-sufficiency in the basin, reducing economic vulnerability to climatic fluctuations and external factors, accelerating economic development, and securing and improving the incomes of people living in the basin. Through unique and innovative regional Conventions (ratified at the regional level in 1978 and 1982), OMVS introduced joint ownership of water infrastructure and basin management for equity of allocation. This included both the allocation of the costs and the benefits based on the needs of the different Member States, and included the capacity of the states to put to use the benefits provided by the river and hydraulic infrastructure. With this, the conventions recognise that developing a river basin provides economic, social and environmental benefits, but those benefits could only be realised and distributed equitably if the costs of that development were also shared. Furthermore, the conventions also acknowledge that those benefits could only be realised if Member States had the capacity to use those benefits, thereby, incentivising countries to develop their capacity to do so. The Water Charter is another key regional legal agreement, setting the participatory framework for equitable benefit sharing, reconciling environmental conservation and social and economic development (with a focus on the nexus basics of energy, agriculture and land use, and water supply). In addition, OMVS established robust institutional arrangements through the creation of different governance bodies, such as the Conference of the Heads of State, the Council of Ministers, the High Commission (Secretariat), the specific technical operating entities (dams, navigation), the 20 Permanent Water Commission, a Donor Advisory Committee, the Basin Committee and decentralised consultative committees. These legal, institutional and political tools, based on the early adoption of principles and practice on benefit and cost sharing, have helped to establish a positive framework for regional peace and cooperation for the management of resources of the basin. Key to this has been maintaining constructive, open and permanent dialogue among countries (even during the conflict between Senegal and Mauritania in 1989-90). Balancing multiple interests across different scales in a transboundary basin and promoting cross-sectoral processes and dialogues to ensure well informed decisions requires large human and institutional capacity. The macro benefits, such as energy, water supply and food security for the capitals and for national level navigation are evident, but challenges remain.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa41d845-44c2-404d-9ed5-e7eed80040d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa41d845-44c2-404d-9ed5-e7eed80040d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c365cea0e460d28a8b4616b1e75b5b4c11b4e95470c16a8ab5c3cf6a2e2ba7f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0494e90b-4c68-4c45-b4ed-2778f27fcdbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "223c54b72dfb979fdd6a5515f30ba75c4ace035df9284196f6b23fc2f299c35a"}}, "hash": "ba29f8d260defdace1379ce37dcb4d0c717ecf4b726dddd418ffedaa470517c0", "text": "Issues concerning the sustainable management of the basin persist, once infrastructure and other development options \u2018open up\u2019 benefits, making sure those benefits continue requires different ways of controlling expectations from countries and stakeholders.

Hence, the management of aquatic invasive plants, water quality concerns and equity of access to water resources and the benefits from the river still dominate discussions amongst communities, institutions and countries. Furthermore, water, soils and biodiversity impacts, especially on the fishery sector, remain a priority to achieve sustainable economic and human development. Mobilising large amounts for investment purposes, as in any river basin, continues to be a challenge, though OMVS and the collaboration between countries has significantly helped to secure financial resources for the basin. 2.5.2 Lessons learned The case study presented above shows that effective and balanced management of the river and the broader basin across different uses and different scales builds on existing benefits from the management of the river. The Water Charter of OMVS played a critical role in raising awareness of decision makers about the shared nature of the water resources. The introduction of this Charter was only possible because existing institutions and structures (such as OMVS itself) promoted shared ownership and were afforded the power and necessary financial resources by its Member countries. Good data collection, strong engagement with stakeholders and concrete implementation of activities on-the-ground, beyond planning processes, has enabled OMVS to stir the conversation away from questions and issues of water alone, and instead focus on the benefits of the river across multiple sectors and, therefore, achieve benefits along the WEF Nexus. To progress further, looking to better analyse trade-offs and identify synergies is key in the Senegal basin. Determining a more balanced set of investments combining built and natural infrastructure will help to alleviate pressures on the natural flows and ecosystem services the river provides and this may potentially increase the investment interests in the basin. 21 2.5.3 Relevance to the region This case study is relevant to typology problems a.3 and 7 (see \u2463 in Table 1), but also presents important lessons on transboundary water governance and dialogue leading to agreement. What is most interesting with this example is the focus on benefit sharing from improved management of shared water resources. There are currently no joint ownership principles present in Central Asia equivalent to those applied in the Senegal River Basin. However, a number of bi- or multi-lateral agreements exist that consider joint water management policy or the coordination of the use of water resources, operation and maintenance of water facilities of interstate use. Central Asia can learn from the experiences of OMVS and the modes of management adopted by riparian countries of the Senegal River Basin to consider a form of cooperation fit-for-purpose in the particular context of the region. 22 African woman farmer \u00a9Shutterstock/Rafal Cichawa. 2.6 Case Study 5: Agribusiness as natural infrastructure in the Southern African region 2.6.1 Description The sustainability of the entire water economy of the Southern African region relies on Lesotho\u2019s highlands, a critical source of the water tower, which supplies almost one million square kilometres. The soil needed to regulate flows into the Orange/Senqu river is being eroded at an alarming rate. Reasons are mainly over-grazing and pasture lands that are located in inappropriate land areas. One estimate suggests that Lesotho\u2019s soil flows into South Africa at a rate of 1.3 tonnes per second. A UN forecast suggests that at current rates of erosion, all the soil will have gone by 2040, leaving only bedrock. The consequences would be dire to the regulation of water flows and the deposition of the soil are a major risk to downstream dams. In response, a private company has embarked on a commercially funded approach that opens up non-traditional pathways to ensure water, food and possibly energy security in unconnected rural areas. The company sells bamboo seedlings to the government, which distributes them to communities in the degraded areas. The root systems of bamboo are shallow, massive, fibrous networks that are very effective in holding soil in place. Planted along streams or irrigation gullies it can help to stabilise the soil, which in turn reduces water loss in high value horticulture or fodder production and channels water for livestock to areas that are better suited pasture lands. In turn, the company buys back the mature bamboo stalks from the producer groups and uses them in different value chains as a valuable resource in a heap of industrial applications. The arrangement between the company and the government provides a commercial return for the company and supports the government\u2019s effort in its restoration strategy for a severely degraded landscape that has major impacts on regional water and energy security. 23 2.6.2 Lessons learned The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbc2fef6-5c46-4cd3-964d-be3c10f5d88f": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbc2fef6-5c46-4cd3-964d-be3c10f5d88f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/increasing-returns-investment-opportunities-applying-nexus-approach", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a63fd451546ec3287c30d59bc0fa3182fd86689897d1ad39fe968a2d0913de8e"}}, "hash": "a63fd451546ec3287c30d59bc0fa3182fd86689897d1ad39fe968a2d0913de8e", "text": "private sector can play a central role to realise sustainable development along the Water- Energy-Food Nexus.

Similar to the case study presented above, enterprises could play a key role supporting governments in their efforts to adopt integrated, economically and ecologically sustainable interventions to ensure water, energy and food security in light of climate change. This would be a viable option, especially since governments often lack the capacities and resources to solve nexus problems. To date, the development of such public-private ventures in the region is hampered by various factors, such as fragmented knowledge of business administration with regard to human resources, marketing, financial management and weak legislative and regulatory frameworks, as well as a low level of regional economic cooperation. 24 Rhine river in Rheinland-Pfalz, Germany \u00a9Shutterstock/Dmitry Eagle Orlov. 2.7 Case Study 6: Multi-stakeholder cooperation in the Rhine Basin 2.7.1 Description Europe\u2019s Rhine River is the continent\u2019s most intensively used river. It drains water from nine countries, and flows through four. Some 60 million people live in the basin of whom 50% depend on it for drinking water. In addition, it includes 6 major industrial hubs, while almost 50% of its adjoined land area is used for agriculture and 30 million tonnes of goods are shipped up and down annually. Such intense and diverse use has inevitably resulted in conflict: between water supply, agriculture and the energy sector, which uses the water in its cooling towers; on issues of agricultural, industrial and urban pollution; and heat pollution from the energy sector. Several nexus-informed approaches and tools are being applied, all of which are institutional in nature and aim to achieve a win across all relevant sectors: \u2022 International cooperation draws upon the legal basis provided by the Convention on the Protection of the Rhine as well as various European directives and regulations requiring coordinated implementation in the entire watershed, such as the European Water Framework Directive, the European Flood Management Directive, the Eel Regulation and others. \u2022 Through the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR), nine states and regions in the Rhine watershed closely co-operate to harmonise the many interests of use and protection in the Rhine area.

This is largely attributed to the working and expert groups that have clearly defined mandates on all relevant technical issues arising from the implementation of the Convention on the Protection of the Rhine and from European law. This example shows that nexus solutions are not limited to capital investment. Institutional capacity building and dialogue, alongside well-enforced regulatory frameworks also have an important role to play. In addition, this case demonstrates the potential benefits that can accrue to the establishment of mutually agreeable transboundary government structures.

Though there are some transnational organisations and structures in the region who are functioning within their mandate to coordinate water use, distribution and allocation, their legal framework is mostly limited to the water sector, with minor overlaps with other sectors. The Interstate Commission for Water Coordination of Central Asia acts as a high-level political platform that decides on water distribution annually. However, since its mandate is limited, it cannot cover all aspects of rational water use, hence, some level of reformation is required to add additional elements to its mandate and to ensure that transboundary cooperation is not only water-centric. 26 Water hyacinth at Lake Naivasha, Kenya \u00a9Shutterstock/Deborah Benbrook. 2.8 Case Study 7: Multiple benefits of water Hyacinth control in Southern Africa7 2.8.1 Description Water hyacinth is one of the fastest growing plants, blocking sunlight from entering the water and preventing native vegetation from growing. This reduces the oxygen levels in the water, affecting fish and other aquatic life. Its rapid growth can dramatically reduce water movement, block infrastructure and channels and absorb nutrients essential for aquatic ecosystems. As it dies and decays it further depletes the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water and can become a breeding ground for mosquitos. To address the issue of water hyacinth invasion in South Africa, several iterations towards nexus-driven solutions were developed. The first iteration acknowledges the potential energy and food security benefits of the invasive plant. It suggests the drying of the biomass for direct burning as a source of energy and composting the rest for use as a manure to support agricultural food production. However, this was found to under-use the full potential of water hyacinth. A second iteration suggests to feed the biomass into a digester. The resulting methane could be used as a source of energy and the waste product could be used as fodder for livestock. The third and final iteration suggests to feed all the biomass to livestock, contributing most significantly and directly to food security. Livestock excrement was then fed into the bioenergy digester, which generated more methane than in the second iteration. By the time that 7 This case study was presented on 24 May 2017 during the third, nexus themed day of the 7th SADC River Basin Workshop (Msibi 2017). 27 the digestion was complete, the digested material had been converted into high quality, organic fertiliser, which was used to increase crop yields, contributing once again to food security. 2.8.2 Lessons learned A solution to a problem in the management of water resources can open up pathways towards energy and food security. As with Case Study 4, this case study confirms that nexus can be applied at a small scale to provide localised multi-sector sector solution pathways at the local community level that entail commercial opportunities that transform problems into solutions for other sectors. 2.8.3 Relevance to the region Because water hyacinth is not (yet) a problem in Central Asia, this case study has no immediate relevance to a problem in the region. However, it has very significant crosscutting relevance. It is an example of how a nexus approach can use a river basin solution to provide solutions to other challenges in the basin, which can be solved by taking into account other sectors. At the same time, some invasive vegetation, such as reeds and typha grasses that pervade the large public irrigation systems in Central Asia cause similar challenges in water flow. 28 Irrigation sprinklers in the Salinas Valley of central California, USA \u00a9Shutterstock/David Litman. 2.9 Case Study 8: Solving inefficient irrigation in Indonesia 2.9.1 Description8 The Jati-Lahur reservoir and hydropower station is situated some 75 km to the South West of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.

However, the farmers opted for a second approach, where they increased rice yields on the existing area and reduced their total water use. As shown in Figure 6, downstream flows increased, contributing to improved capture fishery benefits. Additionally, water saved by the farmers became available to industry surrounding Jakarta. Additionally, the farmers received compensation for the difference in water use compared to their permitted amount. As a result, the economic productivity of water use in the basin, physical yields and overall food production increased, while competition for water decreased. 8 Adapted from Riddell, 2018 29 Figure 4: A Schematic Showing Baseline Conditions in the Jati-Lahur Basin Figure 5: A Schematic Showing an Expanded Irrigated Area in the Jati-Lahur Basin Figure 6: A Schematic Showing the Results of improved water use in the Jati-Lahur Basin 2.9.2 Lessons learned The lesson that can be derived from this case study is that significant multi-sector synergies can be achieved through a bottom-up farmer led approach. The support of government and its regulatory agencies to issue a permit for allocation of water resources was key to make farmers consider water management options. In this case, targeted training helped to improve farmers\u2019 understanding of irrigation and yield production, and the broader basin opportunities from \u2018trading\u2019 30 a portion of their water permit to industry, maximising the value of water to the basin and the broader economy. This approach demonstrates that for the nexus to be fully realised, a combination of human capacity development, governance improvements and collaboration among sectors was needed to realise the full value of water opportunities. 2.9.3 Relevance to the region In the above presented case study, the physical water management system did not change. Instead, what changed was the awareness and skills of farmers and the governance of the water allocation system. This example is relevant to typology problem a.5 (see \u2467 in Table 1). Inefficiency in water use for irrigation is a key issue in the Central Asian region. Irrigation efficiency can be defined in several ways. Engineers with a vested interest in programme budgets tend to favour increases in physical water efficiency. But in light of an absence of measures and incentives to re-allocate excess water of the assumed farming system, there is a risk that farmers will use the excess water to irrigate farming systems that are even so slightly profitable rather than allowing for more water to flow back into the hydrological system. However, the assumed return of water to its sources, such as stream, river or built canal, in reality often means a decrease of water security downstream. Most importantly, whilst efficiency is marketed to save water, re-use water and increase agricultural yields, often what it results in is a decrease in the productivity of water at the broader basin level. 31 3. Nexus and non-nexus scenarios for Central Asia 3.1 Scenario development methodology The future is unknown. Even so, policy makers, planners, decision makers and national development partners sometimes require a broader \u2018horizon view\u2019 to inform their decision- making. Looking beyond single sectors brings greater understanding of the trade-offs and, therefore, where opportunities for synergies can be best utilised. Although scenarios become little more than storylines of a possible future, scenarios are a powerful way to raise awareness of likely outcomes of different courses of action or indeed of non-action. Scenario analysis provides a useful point of departure for follow-up discussions and deliberations across sectoral silos. The scenarios are aligned along two key axes: (i) the extent to which institutions are strengthened and mandated to adopt a more transboundary approach and (ii) the extent to which planning remains trapped in silos or has been redirected onto a more multi-purpose, multi-sector basis. A scenario approach based on these two axes is presented below as Figure 7. In the context of Central Asia, the hydropower potential of the Aral Sea Basin plays a key role. Infrastructure developments in the region that have transboundary impacts on several sectors are generally realised unilaterally. This can lead to unwanted tensions and affect the livelihoods of populations of neighbouring countries. By reflecting on the case studies presented above and the four scenarios addressing nexus issues to a greater or lesser extent, it is hoped that key actors in the region are motivated to examine innovative solutions and to adopt nexus thinking. 3.2 Scenarios for Central Asia9 3.2.1 Scenario 1: costly inaction Weak national institutions in the water, energy and food sectors continue to operate and invest in silos.

As a consequence, economic growth slows down or even declines while water, food and energy security deteriorate for a growing population base, with prices for food and energy increasing in indirect proportionality to supply. In the absence of affordable recurring cost recovery caused by tightening public and societal finances, built infrastructure becomes dilapidated and unserviceable. This leads in turn to increased direct pressure on natural infrastructure, such as watersheds and wetlands. Consequently, floods and landslides become more frequent and severe; pollution increases while public health decreases putting more demand on public finances and crucial environmental services continue to decline. 3.2.2 Scenario 2: wasted skills In this scenario, institutional capacities have been strengthened and transboundary cooperation increases, not least with respect to the sharing of the costs and benefits accruing to basin level 9 These descriptions have been partially derived from Pohl 2017. 32 infrastructure. But silo thinking still prevails, such that trade-offs, compromise and synergies remain elusive. For example, the operating rules of hydropower dams remain prioritised towards power generation and dams are kept as full as possible. Although energy security might increase, institutional hegemony means that water remains immobile in the economic sense10 and becomes ever scarcer in relation to the growing demands upon it. Agricultural productivity remains at a low level or even declines while pollution increases, while habitat and biodiversity continue to decline along with ecosystem services. Figure 7: Four possible future scenarios in Central Asia 3.2.3 Scenario 3: going it alone Nexus thinking at the national level has increased water, energy and food security at the national level, economic returns on public infrastructure will be steadily improving and the recurring costs of operation and maintenance will be easier to finance, either by state transfers or by increasing affordable service charges. With a lack of consideration and establishment of transboundary 10 Water is said to be economically mobile when surplus water can be allocated or reallocated in a way that reduces its opportunity cost. 33 institutions at the regional level, competition for water resources will increase, constraining regional growth. This in turn could lead to instability, limited economic mobility of water and possibly destabilising economic migration. 3.2.4 Scenario 4: harmonised growth In this optimal scenario, well trained and well-equipped institutions are cooperating across both sector and national boundaries. As a result, water, energy and food security is increasing throughout the region, which itself becomes more stable. Economic growth and diversification will be facilitated, leading in turn to increasing and diversifying livelihoods, reducing poverty, reducing pollution and burgeoning regional trade. Utilisation of natural resources will become more productive and more sustainable in terms of social equity, economic growth, sustainable habitats and valuable ecosystem services. 3.3 Ways forward in the context of Central Asia The scenarios described above make a strong case for nexus thinking at national level as well as at the regional level. Increasing resource insecurities, especially related to transboundary waters of the Aral Sea Basin, not only pose threats to national security concerns, and with that the well-being of the population, but also to the socio-economic development of the region as a whole. Though water may not be the main cause of tensions among Central Asian states, it is often considered one of the underlying stress points due to its importance for basic human needs and economic survival. The feedback from stakeholders in Central Asia and the results of an analysis of the regional institutional situation11 both stipulate nexus interventions from two levels: (i) At the national level, nexus perspectives need to be strengthened and incorporated into national policies, strategies and plans; capacities and bottom-up approaches need to be built and local solutions to regional nexus problems sought.

Conclusions The case studies presented above present an opportunity for Central Asia to learn from global experiences on nexus and may inspire action and help identify opportunities in the region to solve some of the issues faced by Central Asia as identified in Table 1. The case studies do not, however, produce a comprehensive catalogue of methods, tools and approaches. In fact, there is an expanding body of research on nexus methodologies and approaches, but these mainly stay within academic circles.12 Similarly, the UNECE publication on methodology development for the nexus in transboundary basins13 offers some practical advice for countries to follow as step-wise engagement across sectors. UNECE has already completed an assessment of the water-food-energy-ecosystems nexus in the Syr Darya basin.14 Previous work in Central Asia identified possible nexus projects including: Payment for Ecosystem Services; Building an Integrated Basin-Wide Information System; Strengthening Regional Economic Integration; A Network of Training Centres for Improved Irrigation Capacity Building and Service Provision; and a Network of Nexus Knowledge & Innovation Centres. Further information on these can be found in the report: Triggering Cooperation across the Food-Energy-Water Nexus project in Central Asia.15 However, every nexus intervention needs to be designed and planned within the specific context. Even though, case studies provide important insights, they need to be supplemented by concrete 12 There are a myriad of different studies and approached to determine or \u2018assess\u2019 the nexus, all using different approaches.

This is to help ensure that stakeholders are empowered to take practical steps towards applying nexus thinking in concept design and to identify and agree what could be possible for investment planning and implementation in existing approaches, not just new ones on the horizon.

These can focus on resource efficiency, new technological possibilities and investments, and from here can determine the governance reforms needed or the pilot opportunities to trial new approaches. Central Asian countries could explore how to design effective investments across sectors, so that they can benefit from efficiency improvements derived from the application of the nexus approach. The case studies above demonstrate the great potential for solutions that can generate increasing returns on investments in monetary terms and the possibility of reducing costs through the nexus approach, although sometimes, increased investment is needed to gain greater returns. Efficiency gains are also possible for existing as well as new infrastructure, provided effective multi-sectoral negotiation of trade-offs takes place. Efficiency gains exist also in policy reform and through greater inter-sectoral discussion that breaks down the hierarchical barriers that can exist between sectors. This can help to unlock approaches that can achieve multiple goals through a single investment, boosting economic gains as well as increasing social and environmental benefits. There are many ways to not agree about the nexus. What becomes clear is that it would be a competitive advantage for all institutions, public, private, etc., to better understand the cause and effect relationships they are involved in through both implementation of their mandates, and policy actions and reform. Through better identification of risks, sharing the risks, and optimising the trade-offs that need to be made between sectors, advantages for all sectors can emerge. 37 References Albrecht, T.R., Crootof, A. and Scott, C.A.

To safeguard socio-economic development in the region, comprehensive action by key institutions and stakeholders is indispensable. Through the EU-funded Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project, IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) together with the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC) support states in investment planning that ensures water, energy and food (WEF) security. Planning and realising such investments, however, is only possible if the relevant capacities and skill sets are available. In this context, an assessment was conducted to provide recommendations for targeted capacity building for WEF Nexus planning and implementation of strategies, programmes and projects at national and regional levels. Key stakeholders carried out a self-assessment of existing institutional capacities covering (i) governance and decision-making; (ii) institutional frameworks and processes; (iii) knowledge creation, information and data sharing; and (iv) monitoring. The use of a Nexus Capacity Score Card, supplemented with information gathered during training workshops, nexus dialogues, the nexus study tour and other stakeholder engagements in Central Asia, allowed capacity building needs to be identified. Based on the assessment, a capacity building plan was developed, illustrating institutional, organisational and individual capacity building actions in the short-, medium- and long term to create an enabling environment and foster the integration of nexus thinking into Central Asian investment planning. Currently there is no agreed definition of Water-Energy-Food Security Nexus for Central Asia. This contributes to the observed unequal representation of the three WEF sectors in existing dialogue platforms at the regional level. This also means that opportunities for benefit sharing across sectors and countries, taking into account socio-economic gains and losses of different interventions, are not identified clearly enough. Elaborating an institutional framework that builds on existing structures and integrates all nexus principles will be key. One way forward will be to strengthen the work of national Intersectoral Working Groups (IsWG), established in the frame of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project, and other dialogue platforms, as well as to broaden stakeholder engagement, including private sector, civil society, farmers, international organisations, investors, etc. in such platforms. To take the nexus dialogue forward in Central Asia, it is critical to identify relevant and ensure the adequacy of national and regional organisations. Existing platforms will need to be mapped and relevant ministries and Basin Water Organisations (BWOs) need to strengthen their capacities in multi-sectoral planning and decision-making. Similarly, the role of the private sector as an investor in nexus interventions needs to be considered carefully.

The project aims to create an enabling environment to facilitate sustainable and climate-resilient investments for increased water, energy and food security in Central Asia. Strengthening regional capacities to enable multi-sectoral planning and decision- making is key to reaching this goal. The Project works in three areas: 1. Dialogue and cooperation; 2. Capacity building; 3. Support for the selection of multi-sectoral investment projects. This report supports project activities associated with building institutional1 capacities for the effective application of nexus approaches in Central Asia. The training workshops organised under the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project and participants\u2019 feedback collected during those workshops as well as nexus dialogues provided additional insights into capacity building needs and the desire for new skills in the region. A lack of institutional capacity is often at the core of fragmented legislation and incoherence in policy. However, the discourse on the WEF Nexus, especially in Central Asia, has not sufficiently addressed institutional capacity needs, despite the significance of an enabling institutional environment and governance frameworks for multi-sectoral planning and decision-making. While human capacity building should go hand-in-hand with a broader capacity development plan on the nexus, institutional capacity needs are generally much more difficult to assess and to address. Yet, strong institutions are crucial to ensure the long-term sustainability and mainstreaming of nexus perspectives. Whether states and stakeholders cooperate on nexus challenges and whether recommendations on how to strengthen institutional capacity will be accepted, depends on the availability of a holistic approach for holding regular multi-sectoral", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8a41830-cea8-4ed8-bbba-2368e44d7dc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8a41830-cea8-4ed8-bbba-2368e44d7dc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building an enabling environment for water, energy and food security dialogue in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b204c0e69d703cf704b5fbf6a009440c1be53eb02a6a591175034f75259e930a"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a6fe8cd-bc13-4420-bfc1-d9a2e251d55e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57ee2cdc3fa5cddab12ded1076ef83403378d7922b4785e03248b24dec882738"}}, "hash": "c77b34433e24d562da53cd1cf870f8697746519b6b29b663d62175b93bdd1d97", "text": "dialogues, building a knowledge base through nexus assessments and analysis, sharing of best practices and mutual learning as well as engagement at political and policy levels. In addition, demonstrating the applicability and value of the WEF Nexus in the context of Central Asia (e.g. through pilot projects) will be key. To this end, IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), in collaboration with the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC), supported stakeholders from key organisations and bodies in Central Asia to develop a Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia. This Roadmap enables a strategic discussion on particular nexus challenges and helps identify appropriate actions that promote the application of nexus perspectives in the region. 1 Institutions here are understood as the body of rules, including policies, rules, incentives, practices, etc., that govern decision-making 2 2 Purpose This capacity needs assessment identifies opportunities for institutional capacity development to strengthen multi-sectoral planning and implementation in order to create an enabling environment for nexus perspectives in Central Asia. Specifically, the assessment aims to: \u2022 Offer an overview of conditions, institutional drivers and constraints for multi-sectoral cooperation in terms of technical, financial, regulatory, planning, monitoring, knowledge, etc.; \u2022 Assess current institutional capacities in Central Asia for multi-sectoral cooperation through the Nexus Capacity Score Card; \u2022 Identify institutional capacity gaps based on the Nexus Capacity Score Card and feedback from stakeholders during nexus dialogues and training events; and \u2022 Provide recommendations for institutional capacity building measures, in particular relating to the effective design, implementation and monitoring of nexus investment projects. The assessment should not be viewed as a static capacity building plan, but rather as a catalogue to develop appropriate activities and strategies that can be further adjusted if necessary, following an iterative approach. Recommendations drawn from this assessment aim to inform future nexus activities in the region and facilitate strategic targeting of capacity building efforts. They serve as a guide, which can be tailored to specific needs in light of new information or the level/scale of a given intervention. 3 Methodology This assessment gathered primary and secondary data through desk research, semi-structured interviews and face-to-face consultations with officials of relevant international organisations, representatives of regional and national bodies as well as selected national and regional experts, members of regional and national ASBP-4 working groups, representatives of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Basin Water Organisations (BWO) and other relevant stakeholders and experts. A self-assessment tool, a Nexus Capacity Score Card2 (Annex 1), was used to gather quantitative data on existing capacities and to produce a baseline for the analysis. Additionally, such self- assessment helped to create ownership and acceptance of key findings by stakeholders. This assessment builds on the Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia3 report. Together they provide a strong basis for identifying priority areas and actions for designing multi-sectoral investment projects, stakeholder engagement via nexus dialogue platforms, collaboration with EC IFAS and short, medium- and long-term capacity building needs. 2 Based on IUCN report \u201cTowards Strengthened Conservation Planning in South-Eastern Europe\u201d. 3 See Meyer, K., Issakhojayev, R., Kiktenko, L. and Kushanova, A.

Appropriate, tailored and targeted institutional capacity building facilitates the creation of an enabling environment for effective negotiation of trade-offs, joint decision-making, financing and implementation of strategies, programmes and projects that incorporate nexus perspectives and approaches. Important prerequisites to bring about and maintain such an enabling environment are: \u2022 All WEF sectors are represented in capacity building efforts, in particular energy; \u2022 Key stakeholders are ready to move beyond the water domain; \u2022 Political will to champion nexus thinking and pursue integrated approaches exists; \u2022 WEF sectors, states and other relevant actors (e.g. private sector, civil society, donor community, etc.) are ready to cooperate and embrace institutional change.

Nexus thinking requires a holistic perspective that takes account of: (i) planning and implementation frameworks; (ii) existence of dialogue and cooperation platforms; (iii) data and information needs and; (iv) scientific evidence-base. Political commitment is integral in pursuing such comprehensive and inclusive perspectives. Therefore, the assessment on hand uses a set of Nexus Principles5 (see Box 1) to guide decision makers towards the adoption of nexus thinking during planning and implementation processes, hence ensuring multi-sector cooperation. For the purpose of this assessment, \u201ccapacity building\u201d refers to the process of developing and strengthening institutional frameworks as well as the skills, instincts, abilities, processes and resources of key institutions and stakeholders through a nexus process that enables them to: \u2022 Understand the nexus concept and principles in the context of Central Asia; \u2022 Identify priorities, synergies, trade-offs and opportunities of benefit sharing between WEF Nexus sectors; \u2022 Recognise challenges inhibiting multi-sectoral dialogue, negotiation and decision-making and determine means to overcome them; \u2022 Share best practices, benefit from mutual learning and co-create knowledge, data and information that is shared between sectors and countries; 4 See Meyer, K., Issakhojayev, R., Kiktenko, L. and Kushanova, A. (2019). Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia. Belgrade, Serbia: IUCN. 5 These Nexus Principles emerged as part of IUCN involvement in nexus activities in the Mekong River Basin and the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. Learnings from the former were instructive in developing the Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia and a related training workshop: Brunner, J., Carew-Reid, J., Glemet, R., McCartney, M. and Riddell, P., (2019). Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok Transboundary River Basins. Ha Noi, Viet Nam.

A nexus process is best introduced and bolstered iteratively, requiring political will and ownership of key stakeholders, in order to facilitate changes at institutional and policy levels. While capacities of key individuals are important and steps to strengthen them should be undertaken, this assessment focusses primarily on institutional capacities, thereby, adopting a long-term view to applying nexus perspectives to achieve lasting and sustainable socio-economic development while protecting ecosystems in Central Asia. Thus, a broader definition of capacity building is applied here, taking account of the wider context, while narrowing down specific recommendations on how to move forward. BOX 1: NEXUS PRINCIPLES Principle 1: There is no single \u201cnexus\u201d; rather there is a range of \u201cnexi\u201d. Principle 2: Nexus is often construed as a response to perceptions of insecurity by the state, civil society, private sector and by those responsible for environmental sustainability and productivity. Principle 3: Nexus is about compromise. Principle 4: Nexus is about trade-offs. Principle 5: Nexus is about synergies. Principle 6: Water is widely considered the senior nexus element. Principle 7: Nexus is not the same as Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Principle 8: Nexus may be our last chance to achieve sustainable and equitable investments in water, agricultural and energy infrastructure. Principle 9: Nexus makes economic and socio-economic sense. 5 5 Results of the Nexus Capacity Score Card Key stakeholders, who are either directly involved in the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project or who have an interest in the WEF Nexus in Central Asia more broadly, were asked to self-assess institutional capacities through a Nexus Capacity Score Card (Annex 1). The Score Card is structured around four dimensions of capacity needs to make multi-sectoral approaches and the WEF Nexus a reality in Central Asia (Figure 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "304fae02-f845-42ab-aaf3-e74dd767ecec": {"__data__": {"id_": "304fae02-f845-42ab-aaf3-e74dd767ecec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building an enabling environment for water, energy and food security dialogue in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f0f3ee294ebbb80f3aa2970af0a78bdaf4d5f9377318315f6962fc1947d33f06"}, "2": {"node_id": "8342f886-da42-484c-8a46-aabf4582dde1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec243de76240c38615f091aa5d4b03bc8d1bf19cbfc291985bbf59c8a189c169"}}, "hash": "43d8d41a40e0f5c70063280b1db5077ccc76f02df600137b38606159a2c3d994", "text": "The scores from the 13 respondents were then presented to the members of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project\u2019s Regional Steering Committee (RSC) for their feedback and validation6.

Comments provided by the respondents pointed to broad acknowledgement of the contribution of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project towards promoting a nexus approach in Central Asia. However, more concrete and hands-on actions are needed to facilitate the implementation of joint projects on the nexus and to identify adequate mechanisms for the financing of regional nexus projects involving several countries of the region. Regardless of past attempts of multi-sectoral engagement at national level, coordination as well as an adequate institutional framework that could facilitate this process are currently missing. Additionally, discussions remain largely in the water domain. Whereas multi-sectoral cooperation may take place at individual project level, the absence of an effective, unified regional institutional and legal framework means that single sector planning, decision- and policymaking prevail. At the same time, not all WEF sector perspectives are represented adequately. Particularly energy sector perspectives are often not taken into account sufficiently. The only multi-sectoral cooperation strategies are the \u201cSchemes for the integrated use and protection of water resources of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya River Basins\u201d. However, these are neither comprehensively implemented by all Central Asian countries, nor do they follow all nexus principles as highlighted above. Going forward, new regional legal instruments regulating cooperation will need to be adopted, taking into account and complementing existing transboundary water resource management frameworks. Dimension 2: Institutional frameworks and processes Based on the scores on the institutional frameworks and processes dimension, basic institutional frameworks in support of multi-sectoral nexus dialogue, planning and decision-making already exist. The most significant need for capacity building within this dimension was found to be the definition of clear nexus criteria and indicators that inform the planning and implementation of multi-sectoral investment projects that address water, energy and food security challenges. There is a lack of clarity on how to develop multi-sectoral nexus projects. This is attributed to the lack of an adequate institutional framework to facilitate dialogue and negotiation that address and reconcile WEF Nexus sector interests and challenges adequately and comprehensively. There is a 7 demand for capacity building on different types of methods and tools to support such dialogues and negotiations, such as trade-off analysis, the calculation of economic benefits, multi-criteria decision- making, etc. In addition to that, knowledge of and skills to design, plan, implement and monitor multi- sectoral programmes and projects in the region is insufficient.

In addition to the lack of collaboration and sharing of data, available data is often incomplete or inaccessible. Multi-sectoral cooperation to establish effective data sharing arrangements and protocols is needed to ensure that information and data are reliable, adequate and accessible. Awareness and knowledge about data analysis tools, such as nexus models, scenario development and other tools, is low among stakeholder, but will be key to enable multi-sectoral planning and decision-making. Furthermore, existing information on issues and challenges related to water, energy and food interlinkages is not used systematically during planning processes. To avoid duplication of data collection efforts in the region, ensure efficiency in planning processes, promote the co-creation of knowledge among WEF sectors and across Central Asian states and close the gap between existing knowledge, tools and their utilisation, mutual peer-to-peer learning events and regular multi-sectoral dialogues are indispensable. Dimension 4: Monitoring The monitoring dimension scored the lowest when compared to other dimensions. While institutional mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation are weak in general, the area that received the lowest score is the ability to effectively adapt and respond to change and environmental risks. The evident lack of monitoring capacity in Central Asia also relates to the absence of criteria and indicators in the planning process as mentioned above. Although some promising political and economic development reforms that promote regional integration can be observed, national policies still need to be adapted and revised to adequately reflect regional realities and cross-sectoral linkages. Change remains slow and institutions generally lack the flexibility to accommodate new risk factors or changes affecting the WEF sectors. Improved, well-organised monitoring mechanisms will be needed to identify necessary modifications of policies and priority interventions. In addition, enhancing capacities on building consensus, developing relevant legislation and transferring best practices will be crucial. 8 6 A Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia Nexus investments in Central Asia are possible if institutions and key stakeholders gain the necessary capacity and skills to integrate nexus thinking into planning approaches, negotiations, cooperation frameworks and implementation of projects. During the implementation of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project, the need to provide guidance in structuring a nexus process became apparent. As a result, a roadmap that provides clear and targeted outputs and outcomes was developed during the study tour in May 2019. The Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia (the \"Roadmap\") details necessary steps towards achieving water, energy and food security and therewith contributes to the creation of an enabling environment for WEF Security Nexus in the region (Figure 2). The Roadmap contains priority areas for cooperation and necessary outcomes and outputs to be achieved in order to advance nexus thinking in Central Asia (Table 2). Applying a structured approach, the Roadmap helps to catalyse cooperation, build trust among sectors and countries and subsequently prepares stakeholders for the implementation of investment projects that embed nexus thinking. The broader outcomes and findings of Phase I of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project are reflected in the Roadmap, acknowledging the achievements to date and paving the way for future actions. The Roadmap also presents a framework for monitoring progress. Therefore, the overall goal of the Roadmap is to facilitate concrete steps to balance sectoral interests through regional cooperation to increase water, energy and food, including agriculture, security to achieve sustainable socio-economic development in Central Asia. The Roadmap answers to the following key questions: \u2022 What is required to catalyse the shift towards nexus thinking? \u2022 Which key sectors and stakeholders should be involved? \u2022 What needs to be understood and who needs to understand it? \u2022 What political messages can secure nexus buy-in and who needs to convey, believe and act on these messages? Table 2: Expected outputs and outcomes of the Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia OUTPUTS OUTCOMES 1) A schedule of indicative nexus investments (through six-step process) prepared 1) Key stakeholders understand nexus principles 2) Nexus principles mainstreamed into planning 3) Stakeholder agreements in place 2) Institutional capacity building undertaken 4) Institutions committed to and aligned with nexus principles 3) A dossier of investment options prepared 4) A nexus financing model (for Central Asia) developed 5) Increased water, energy and agricultural security in Central Asia 9 Box 2 highlights the measures necessary to move nexus thinking from a theoretical concept to practice. The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project design addressed a number of these measures, as highlighted in blue in Figure 2.

These five measures rely on the results of a nexus assessment, which helps to clarify opportunities and challenges in support of achieving Outcomes 1-3 of the Roadmap. A typical nexus assessment comprises six steps: 1. Understanding the basin in terms of: a. current natural resource use; b. status of the basin\u2019s ecosystems and ecosystem services; c. basin demography; d. economic productivity of water in the basin; e. nature and extent of competition for and conflict over water; and f. which stakeholders are winners and which are losers, now and in the future. 2. Diagnosis of the current policy framework pertaining to the three nexus sectors to understand sector objectives; identify potential conflicts between them both cross-sector and transboundary. 3. Analysis of the threats that any such conflicts identified in Step 2 represent in terms of how a single sector benefit for one nexus sector may represent a threat to one or more of the others. 4. Decision on which nexus to focus on, so that all sectors associated with the benefits and threats are included (note that nexus is not limited to three sectors). 5. Identification of key stakeholders and understanding the constraints relevant to each of them using a stakeholder-problem typology.7 Possible nexus options that might mitigate or alleviate the perceived threats are then considered. 6. Mapping of nexus investment opportunities against all possible combinations in terms of sector (water, energy, food, environment), objective (e.g. ecosystem rehabilitation, expansion of irrigation, hydropower development) and threat (e.g. overpumping of 7 See IUCN (2019).

Here, it is essential to understand that investments can be supported by complementary non-nexus or nexus-neutral measures8 and can consist of both natural and built infrastructure defined as follows: a. Natural infrastructure constitutes investments in the conservation, adaptation or modifications of natural landscape features \u2013 examples could be natural or constructed and include wetlands, reforestation, restored floodplains, catchment stabilisation, etc. More specifically, investment in natural infrastructure is done with the landscape, either to conserve or enhance natural landscape functions. b. Built infrastructure is the multi-purpose, civil works infrastructure needed to attenuate or otherwise manage flooding and/or increase water security and water supplies for energy and food security (both production and livelihood based) and for the environment. It may comprise dams, reservoirs, water harvesting facilities, facilities needed to increase the physical efficiency of water use, drains, re-use/recycling facilities and even inter-basin transfers. Therefore, investments in built infrastructure are done to the landscape, changing its natural functions. Nexus interventions also require adequate financing. Therefore, mapping nexus investment opportunities is critical. However, a clear understanding of blended finance mechanisms has not yet manifested itself in Central Asia. Blended financing constitutes one way to mobilise private sector capital for public infrastructure by reducing risks and creating benefits for the state, development partners, private sector and communities (these could include water utilities, industries, etc.) depending on the mix of financing options selected. In the context of Central Asia, the links between nexus and financing options that show favourable cost-benefit ratios and could lead to higher returns on investments in multi-purpose solutions have not been explored enough and are generally not well understood. This hinders using all available financing options. Initial feedback on the Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia showed that, despite clear evidence that understanding of nexus principles is growing among stakeholders in the region, there is still a lack of practical and targeted strategies for developing nexus solutions and influencing the all-important policymaking and decision-making processes along with any necessary reform of relevant legal frameworks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dce33b6-10b7-474d-ac86-f0604e81d8b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dce33b6-10b7-474d-ac86-f0604e81d8b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building an enabling environment for water, energy and food security dialogue in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72adb7c3d0d0e537597b15d63fe7f0a24c42d6e625423ad0a235f43c05a5debb"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa8d65e0-d4c5-4818-a23e-96b1e1d07c0e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07da84ea6c7abca9ee30444c19f24dddda08204b63e476ea15d14ffc71671a44"}}, "hash": "572f31b97a71cd066a0e452b2df478b10c1a5c21f719547caeb0b824ac5cacd7", "text": "Additionally, the lack of a clear problem statement and inadequately defined objectives hamper discussions on possible nexus solutions or specific investment projects.

The Roadmap can support stakeholders in deepening their understanding of nexus perspectives and principles and offer guidance to create an enabling institutional environment supported by relevant stakeholder agreements, regulations and policies. The capacity building plan (Table 3), the recommendations derived from the institutional analysis9 as well as available organisational and individual capacities support the implementation of small- scale demonstration projects to prepare for the implementation of nexus investment projects. Doing so will allow Central Asian countries to strategically expand their dossier of investment options. Coupled with possible nexus financing models that are tailored to specific interventions, Central Asia can create a strong foundation towards greater water, energy and food, including agriculture, security. Nevertheless, and most critically, Central Asian states need to demonstrate their readiness to move along the Roadmap by adopting relevant agreements, policies and strategies. 9 See Meyer, K., Issakhojayev, R., Kiktenko, L. and Kushanova, A. (2019). Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia. Belgrade, Serbia: IUCN. Figure 3: Moving from dialogue to action \u2013 next steps 13 7 Conclusion In the context of the complex geopolitical setting of Central Asia, a structured approach based on practical steps is crucial to move nexus dialogues into action. The Nexus Roadmap for Central Asia acts as a guide to help define nexus problems and subsequently design relevant investment projects. However, targeted support and capacity building will be needed going forward. This should be done in a holistic manner, considering both institutional and individual capacity building needs. Additionally, Central Asian states will have to demonstrate their readiness to move along the Roadmap by adopting relevant agreements, policies and strategies, which would enable agreement of a long-term action plan on the WEF Nexus. There is a need for a step-by-step approach to introducing nexus thinking in Central Asia, starting with an understanding and official recognition of the need and usefulness of the WEF Security Nexus for the region. Capacity building efforts should enhance institutional frameworks as well as empower key stakeholders and decision makers by providing them with the required knowledge and skills. Figure 3 and Table 3 offer an overview of actions that need to be taken in the short-, medium- and long-term. It is expected that CAREC and IUCN through Phase II of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project funded by the EU, will be able to guide stakeholders through this process and develop tailored and detailed action plans, including indicators and clear timeframes in line with the recommendations below. 8 Recommendations Capacity building activities should form an integral part of the structured process that promotes nexus thinking in Central Asia and supports the creation of an enabling environment for new investments and implementation of nexus", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ad7d245d-25b2-4fea-a6c2-042e878b423c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ad7d245d-25b2-4fea-a6c2-042e878b423c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building an enabling environment for water, energy and food security dialogue in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd390692390083a4725141110e084209033891f4660e714878349abf6374d4a6"}, "3": {"node_id": "8ed9af40-1c41-4937-b16b-d23cadcccbc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e665b85a07a8d88649b781014338fdfa764e1d5a7d68d30cb0711e6fd1dc646c"}}, "hash": "954481f6abcb4081bb914f9b8176ecf742f13ff695a925ad5df50c518d74e2f7", "text": "projects. The following recommendations reflect the findings of the Nexus Capacity Score Card as well as feedback received during training workshops, RSC meetings, the study tour and other engagements with stakeholders in the region. Recommendations for building institutional, organisational and individual capacities as well as capacities to create an enabling environment have been integrated into the capacity building plan. The recommendations further present required actions in the short-, medium- and long-term and specify whether they are of high or low priority (Table 3). The short-term and some of the medium-term capacity building actions may inform the design of Phase II of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project and, thereby, continue supporting Central Asian countries in adopting nexus perspectives. As a critical first step, it should be explored whether existing national and regional organisations and institutional frameworks should be strengthened and reformed, or whether new forms of cooperation need to be established. This will greatly influence the execution of the capacity building plan. Additionally, since individual capacity building actions target different types of stakeholders and organisations, they should be tailored in accordance with the requirements of the respective intervention (e.g. pilot project) and scale. Just as important is to come to a consensus on a regional definition of WEF Security Nexus in Central Asia, including the definition of priority areas for the short- and long-term.

The aim of the Project is to create a multi- sectoral enabling environment to facilitate sustainable and climate-resilient investments for increased water, energy and food (WEF) security in Central Asia. Part 2 of the interview consists of a capacity score card to provide a baseline evaluation of existing capacities in quantitative terms. Key stakeholders involved in multi-sectoral dialogues were asked to rate current institutional capacities for multi-sectoral investment planning, negotiation and implementation. Respondents were asked to score existing capacities based on a 4-point scale: 3 \u2013 This element of an institutional framework for multi-sectoral planning, decision-making and implementation is very well implemented. 2 \u2013 This element of an institutional framework for multi-sectoral planning, decision-making and implementation is quite well implemented, but there are some important gaps. 1 \u2013 This element of an institutional framework for multi-sectoral planning, decision-making and implementation is overall inadequately implemented. 0 \u2013 This element of an institutional framework for multi-sectoral planning, decision-making and implementation is not at all or minimally implemented. This assessment draws on the experiences, perceptions and knowledge of the key stakeholders, actors and experts involved in the water, energy and agriculture sectors at national and regional levels. After collecting and analysing the data, the areas with the lowest scores will be discussed with Members of the Regional Steering Committee. The results of the capacity score card and the subsequent discussions will serve as the basis for a capacity building action plan and inform training seminars offered as part of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. The process of collecting data will take place either through a self-scoring exercise via an online survey system or facilitated by an interviewer (the interviewer should introduce her/himself and introduce the process as well as answer any questions that interviewees may have before the start of the interview). It should be made clear that the confidentiality of interviewees will be protected. PART 2 Nexus Institutional Capacity Score Card10 This is Part 2 of the interview focussed more specifically on existing capacities as well as institutional 10 Based on IUCN report \u201cTowards Strengthened Conservation Planning in South-Eastern Europe\u201d. 20 capacity needs. Since this part of the interview includes filling in a score card, there are a number of options: 1) The interviewee can self-score and then the interviewer can ask follow-up questions; 2) The interviewer fills in the score card together with the interviewee, who asks follow-up questions along the way; 3) It is also possible to conduct it as a group exercise, where individuals self-score and then go into more detail during small group discussions. It would be useful to understand the perspectives of different sectors, hence, if self-scoring and group discussion is the preferred option, then the general information section from Part 1 should be added to the score card and facilitators should take note of who says what during the group discussion. For each outcome/indicator, one of the four possible statements of the score description should be chosen. Depending on the answer, the score can be calculated and the current capacity assessed. Interviewees should provide evidence or any additional comments that explain their chosen score or may offer suggestions for building that particular capacity. It should be made clear that the confidentiality of interviewees will be protected. Prior to starting the scoring and interviews/discussions, any questions that interviewees may have about the process, scoring or use of the results should be answered.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5009a2c-3470-4c39-b39b-1a535c8f105d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5009a2c-3470-4c39-b39b-1a535c8f105d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Building an enabling environment for water, energy and food security dialogue in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae72aa899c0004ff7dde021162b00426ef7514438ee02d25f43e04908aa48482"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa044a0e-2526-44dd-892b-42623b80bbe1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/building-enabling-environment-water-energy-and-food-security-dialogue", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d207e00f2ee25285800064605dde7ff90a235ce2cac295c4f9d79f2c28f929f1"}}, "hash": "d7abe91099f78cbe6c95786818af4c490fbdf1ae59893ad506aea07abb94e96e", "text": "21 NEXUS CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT SCORE CARD COUNTRY NAME OF INTERVIEWEE: NAME OF ORGANISATION/MINISTRY/DEPARTMENT: AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY/EXPERTISE (WATER, ENERGY, FOOD/AGRICULTURE/LAND-USE, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IF OTHER PLEASE SPECIFY): GENDER: Outcome Worst State Marginal State Satisfactory State Very Good State Evidence/Comme nts (Score 0) (Score 1) (Score 2) (Score 3) 1.

Briefly explain what will happen next and how the data may be used (confidentiality of the interviewee will be protected; the data will be used to strengthen the institutional capacity to develop, select and implement multi-sectoral investment projects on the WEF nexus; lessons learned will be published). If there is any need for follow-up questions or enquiries, the interviewee may be contacted again. 26 Ethics framework for stakeholder engagement The following are a set of minimum requirements and principles to be respected when engaging with stakeholders during this capacity needs assessment. In particular, they establish the standards to be applied during design, data collection and analysis. These ethics principles ensure the credibility, reliability and transparency of applied methods as well as contribute to preserving the integrity, rights and confidentiality of key stakeholders. - A focus on mutual learning in order to build understanding and capacity of those involved rather than making this assessment a purely technical exercise. - Transparency in the design, purpose and use of analysis and resulting data, including clear communication with stakeholders concerning the purpose of the interview, questions and the intended uses of the results. - Respect for the rights and interests of stakeholders, particularly with regards to culture, customs, fundamental values and the right to or not to participate. Assessments must be appropriate, representative and respectful, ensuring accessibility (e.g. language translation), meaningfulness and usefulness. Due regard should be given to the welfare, beliefs and customs of those involved, including respect for divergent perceptions and views. In particular, measures should be taken to avoid harm, including by consideration of the political sensitivity of the assessment and its results. - Full disclosure and free, prior and informed consent, meaning that interviewees have the right to consent to, decline or withdraw from participation in the analysis. - An unbiased approach of the interviewer when conducting interviews to ensure the necessary openness and respect for stakeholder views, perceptions and opinions. Additionally, the analysis should be based on reliable and quality data and observations, providing credible results. Credibility is achieved if interviewers ensure their objectivity, independence and impartiality, meaning that vested interests of the interviewer do not interfere with this analysis. - Due credit and acknowledgement of contributors, respecting intellectual ownership, while ensuring confidentiality of individuals and groups. - Gender representation and participation should be ensured to the extent possible. This may be a challenge in Central Asia, where key stakeholders and decision makers are traditionally male. 27 Annex 2 - Nexus Capacity Score Card results Dimensions and areas Cumulative score (max. possible score = 39) Average score Score as % of maximum Governance and decision-making 1.

Together, during the period of enlargement over 60+ years they have built a zone of stability, democracy and sustainable development whilst maintaining cultural diversity, tolerance and individual freedoms. The European Union is committed to sharing its achievements and values with countries and peoples beyond its borders. IUCN is a membership Union uniquely composed of both government and civil society organisations. It provides public, private and non-governmental organisations with the knowledge and tools that enable human progress, economic development and nature conservation to take place together. Created in 1948, IUCN is now the world\u2019s largest and most diverse environmental network, harnessing the knowledge, resources and reach of more than 1,300 Member organisations and some 15,000 experts. It is a leading provider of conservation data, assessments and analysis. Its broad membership enables IUCN to fill the role of incubator and trusted repository of best practices, tools and international standards. IUCN provides a neutral space in which diverse stakeholders including governments, NGOs, scientists, businesses, local communities, indigenous peoples organisations and others can work together to forge and implement solutions to environmental challenges and achieve sustainable development. Working with many partners and supporters, IUCN implements a large and diverse portfolio of conservation projects worldwide. Combining the latest science with the traditional knowledge of local communities, these projects work to reverse habitat loss, restore ecosystems and improve people\u2019s well-being. www.iucn.org https://twitter.com/IUCN/ The Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC) is an independent, non- political and non-for-profit international organization with regional mandate to assist the Central Asian states, regional and international stakeholders in addressing environmental and sustainability challenges across Central Asian region and Afghanistan. CAREC was founded in 2001 by a joint decision of the five Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan), European Union and United Nations Development Programme, following the resolution of the IV Pan- European Conference held in 1998, Aarhus (Denmark). By promoting dialogue and collaboration among environmental stakeholders, CAREC has today become a leading regional knowledge hub in the field of environment and sustainable development recognized by national, regional and international partners. CAREC works through five thematic programs: Water Initiatives Support; Climate Change and Sustainable Energy; Environmental Management; Education for Sustainable Development; Environment and Health. www.carececo.org https://www.facebook.com/carececo/ https://twitter.com/recca_carec 3 Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia Institutional gap analysis Kristin Meyer, Rustam Issakhojayev, Ludmila Kiktenko and Aksulu Kushanova 4 The designation of any geographical entities in this publication, and the presentation of the material, do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of IUCN and the Regional Environmental Centre of Central Asia (CAREC) concerning the legal status of any country, territory, or area, or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

The formation of strong frameworks and institutions with the financial and technical capacity to ensure integrated and coherent planning and decision-making that pave the way for dialogue among Central Asian states is crucial. The Water, Energy and Food (WEF) Nexus perspective allows to identify synergies and minimise trade-offs in achieving water, energy and food security in the region. In the frame of the EU-funded Regional Nexus Dialogue Programme, the Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC) and IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) are currently implementing the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project: Fostering Water, Energy and Food Security Nexus Dialogue and Multi-sector Investment. The overall aim is to strengthen regional capacities for multi-sectoral planning as well as mainstream the nexus approach to prepare the ground for investments in integrated approaches promoting water, energy and food security in Central Asia.

To date, the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) is the only intergovernmental structure dealing with water and environment at a regional level by advancing transboundary cooperation in Central Asia. The need for an integrated approach towards water, energy and food security is recognised at the highest political level and the relevance of WEF security, which lies at the heart of socio-economic and human development, very well acknowledged. However, the existing institutional arrangements and frameworks do not allow for effective multi-sectoral cooperation and planning that would balance the interests of various sectors in a sustainable manner. Reasons were found to be manifold: - At the national level, Central Asian countries claim independence and sovereignty over internal resource endowments, especially water, as a key driver of their national socio- economic development. Policies to govern the use of those resources follow mostly sectoral approaches and focus on resource allocation rather than benefit sharing. Besides these policy challenges, Central Asian states are also faced with poor governance frameworks and weak institutional capacity. - At the regional level, IFAS has a limited institutional capacity and other institutional arrangements that exist in the region are not conducive to nexus perspectives in planning, negotiation, decision-making and implementation processes. Furthermore, prevailing structural challenges include the lack of an adequate core budget due to the member states' failure to fulfil their financial obligations and a resulting dependence on international donors VIII for technical assistance funds and access to grants to implement activities, especially for ASBP. However, the IFAS Member States have shown willingness to maintain and reform IFAS as an important regional forum to develop mutually acceptable mechanisms on the integrated use of water resources and environmental protection. As a result, single-sector interests (primarily water) still dominate regional dialogues. Despite these challenges, the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project has been successful in its impact on the draft ASBP-4 concept, which now includes specific reference to the WEF Security Nexus and the nexus approach more broadly, and also promotes the development of investment plans that do not rely on grants alone, but explore new types of investments. However, the institutional analysis pinpoints to a number of challenges that need to be overcome in order to secure nexus thinking in regional planning processes, especially in the context of ASBP-4: - There is an obvious lack of information and data sharing between Central Asian states. This is attributed to a prevailing lack of trust among the states as well as differences in the availability of reliable data in the first place. It is vital to identify opportunities and information needs and to develop the necessary information and data sharing protocols to enable informed WEF Nexus decision-making. - The concept of nexus is still new and key decision makers lack experience with it. Full buy- in by all states would require improved understanding of the WEF Nexus approach and demonstration of its relevance and applicability through concrete actions and best practices in the context of Central Asia. - There is a recognition that established multi-sectoral platforms are necessary to put the nexus approach into action in the future, especially at regional level. However, reforms are needed to ensure that the political and institutional environment enables nexus thinking, planning and investing, both nationally and regionally. - Sources of financing for regional investment projects are a major concern for key stakeholders. The absence of a unified and robust ASBP fund causes the region to rely on other funding sources, including international technical assistance and private sector investments. However, the analysis shows that the initiatives that are taken at the regional level are often based on political rather than economic or environmental considerations and priorities. Putting a greater focus on making ASBP investment projects bankable may catalyse blended investments, including from the private sector.

The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project addresses the challenges faced by water, energy and food sectors in Central Asia and identifies investment opportunities that account for the inherent synergies and trade-offs that allow for achieving shared benefits. The overall project aim is to create an enabling environment to facilitate sustainable and climate-resilient multi-sectoral investments for increased water, energy and food security in Central Asia, namely through: 1. Dialogue and cooperation; 2. Capacity building; 3. Support for the selection of multi-sectoral investment projects. Integral to achieving the set goals, is the strengthening of regional institutions for multi-sectoral planning and decision-making. To this end, it is crucial to better understand existing institutional arrangements that facilitate or impede dialogue and cooperation among the key sectors and stakeholders1. National and regional processes for multi-sectoral investment planning as well as related methods provide the basis for defining and carrying out priority activities of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. In order to maximise benefits in all three WEF Nexus sectors and to achieve water, energy and food security in the region, it is paramount to take a multi-sectoral approach to planning, decision-making and cooperation. Strengthening the regional nexus dialogue and supporting multi-sectoral planning allows to augment the reach of a single-sector investment. Regular dialogues increase the understanding of inherent interdependencies between the water, energy and food sectors, paving the way for negotiating trade-offs and to profit from synergies. The ultimate goal of thinking of water, energy and food sectors as a nexus is to amplify the impact of and returns on investments and to advance socio-economic development, while preserving vital ecosystem functions. For Central Asia, where the demand for water, energy and food is increasing, the nexus approach has great potential to contribute to economic growth, improve livelihoods and human well-being and to lead to the sustainable management of natural resources, thereby, fostering sustainable development. 1 See also stakeholder analysis: https://carececo.org/en/main/ckh/publications/stakeholder-analysis-report/ 2 2 Purpose and expected outcomes This institutional analysis looks at existing institutional arrangements, provides insights into barriers and opportunities of the practical application of the WEF Security Nexus in Central Asia and considers options for improved multi-sectoral dialogue and cooperation. To understand the existing regional institutional arrangements in Central Asia, the focus is put on institutional frameworks that contribute to the development and implementation of regional investment projects under the new Action Program to assist the countries of the Aral Sea Basin (ASBP-4), a key mechanism to solve water, socio-economic and environmental issues in the Aral Sea Basin. More specifically, the purpose of the analysis is to: - define parameters for effective multi-sectoral investment planning and implementation; - describe existing institutional arrangements; - identify opportunities, challenges and areas that require strengthening within the scope of the WEF Security Nexus; and - provide recommendations for effective multi-sectoral investment planning, implementation and mainstreaming. The findings of this analysis support the mainstreaming of the WEF Security Nexus in Central Asia into regional planning processes, while taking into account the regional institutional context, especially when it comes to ASBP-4. Furthermore, with its focus on institutional arrangements, the analysis serves as the basis for a capacity needs assessment2 carried out within the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. Both studies support the Project in reaching its overall goal to strengthen multi-sectoral dialogue, investment planning and implementation. 3 Methodology The information presented in this analytical report was gathered through primary and secondary data collection, including desk research, semi-structured interviews and face-to-face consultations with officials of relevant international organisations, representatives of regional and national bodies, as well as selected national and regional experts, members of regional and national ASBP-4 working groups, representatives of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Basin Water Organisations (BWO) and other relevant stakeholders and experts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d2e731b-ac7c-4479-a7a1-de7112882172": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d2e731b-ac7c-4479-a7a1-de7112882172", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "422e01da3123c21dd4c96359345b062747a8ac895be7dc85b0ca379655c77ef4"}, "2": {"node_id": "da42f345-fbf1-417a-9a8b-7a1689829b18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "91dea10134986afbaf2b40953506bbf2400147c42b5c83483953e6ed5cccce48"}}, "hash": "93519b6f7b68345aab433098cc10d7b14dfeb0a3cf718f25fff0c80db2cc0784", "text": "Where possible face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions were conducted, especially during the Central Asian International Environmental Forum (CAIEF), meetings of the ASBP-4 working groups, Intersectoral Working Group (IsWG) meetings and Nexus Project Regional Steering Committee (RSC) meetings.

Belgrade, Serbia: IUCN. 3 4 Regional context This section provides an overview of the regional context and sets the scene for the subsequent analysis of institutional modalities for the application of nexus approaches in Central Asia. 4.1 Geography and climate Central Asia comprises a vast geographical area with diverse political, socio-economic and environmental conditions. Spanning from the Caspian Sea in the west to China in the east and from Russia and the Siberian forests in the north to Iran and Afghanistan in the south, it encompasses five countries \u2013 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan (Figure 1). Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are covered by large deserts, while Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are characterised by mountains and high passes. Treeless, grassy steppes stretch across vast areas of Central Asia and form part of the Eurasian Steppe, extending all the way to Eastern Europe. Most of the desert areas are unsuitable for agricultural use, except along the margins of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river systems. All five countries are landlocked with no direct access to the sea, with Uzbekistan being a double-landlocked country. Figure 1: Map of Central Asia; Source: GRID-Arendal Central Asia has a continental climate characterised by low and irregular precipitation, contributing to the region\u2019s aridity. Intensification of agricultural activities, population growth and water scarcity have increased the populations\u2019 dependence on the two major rivers, Amu Darya and Syr Darya, over the years. Central Asia has a total surface area of approx. 4 million km\u00b2. Approx. 75% of the land area is classified as agricultural land (Table 1), illustrating the socio-economic significance of and dependence on the agricultural sector in the region. Temperatures vary greatly, with hot summers and cold winters. In recent years dust storms, caused by strong winds and increased desertification and salinisation of soils in the Aral Sea bed, have become more frequent. In 2017, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were added to the list of countries with high exposure to climate extremes (FAO, 2018), mainly droughts and heat spells. Projected changes in the climate are expected to have devastating effects on resource availability, precipitation patterns, 4 river flow regimes, water volumes and soil quality \u2013 threatening water, energy and food security of the region. Table 1: Overview of Central Asian states\u2019 surface area, land area and agricultural land area in km\u00b2; Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator * Data from 2018 / ** Data from 2016 4.2 Historic and political significance of water During Soviet times, water allocation and natural resources use was centrally controlled, following an ambitious plan to expand the irrigation capacity of the downstream countries of the Syr Darya and Amu Darya\u201d and increase their agricultural outputs.\u201d3 Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan made water available to downstream countries during the irrigation season. In exchange, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan provided coal, gas and electricity during the winter season. These policies intensified freshwater extraction for agriculture in the region, making it the largest water consumer (90%). While export of agricultural products contributed to the economic growth of some countries in the region, agricultural intensification had a devastating effect on ecosystem health and the availability of water resources, desiccating the Aral Sea (once the world\u2019s fourth largest inland water body). Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the resource sharing arrangements between all five Central Asian states have become obsolete. Central Asian states strived for political and economic sovereignty, which meant that states largely managed these shared resources independently. In doing so, particularly the use of water resources and the management of the Aral Sea Basin with its two major rivers has become highly contested in the region, especially due to its relevance for agriculture and hydropower generation. These developments greatly influenced the geopolitical situation of the region and impeded transboundary cooperation.

The Amu Darya and the Syr Darya are the two major rivers7 of Central Asia (Figure 3), supplying about 90% of river water to the region.8 The Amu Darya has an annual flow of about 70\u201280 km\u00b3 and originates from the Pamir Mountains and glaciers at the border of Tajikistan and Afghanistan. It is 2,540 km long, with a catchment area of over 300,000 km\u00b2 that extends through the territories of Tajikistan (74%), Afghanistan (13.9%) and Uzbekistan (8.5%). The Syr Darya has an annual flow of 35-40 km\u00b3 and originates in the Tien Shan Mountains in Kyrgyzstan. With a length of 2,790 km it is the longest river in Central Asia. Just like the Amu Darya, the Syr Darya has a catchment area of over 300,000 km\u00b2 that extends through Kyrgyzstan (75.2%), Uzbekistan (15.2%), Kazakhstan (6.9%) and Tajikistan (2.7%). Both rivers flow into the Aral Sea, the Amu Darya from the northwest of Uzbekistan and the Syr Darya from the west of Kazakhstan. A large canal system diverts water from both rivers for irrigation.

Water endowments and annual freshwater withdrawal vary significantly from country to country (Figure 4). Turkmenistan is endowed with less than 1% of the total renewable internal freshwater resources of the region, which amounts to approx. 194.5 billion m\u00b3. Uzbekistan has the second smallest endowment, with 8.5% of the total available freshwater in the region. The estimated freshwater withdrawal of the region is 121 billion m\u00b3. Freshwater endowments and withdrawals are uneven, causing some countries to withdraw more freshwater than their internal supply and leading to high levels of water insecurity.

Kazakhstan with 28%, Kyrgyzstan with 44% and Tajikistan with 71% are currently water secure, though variabilities between dry and wet years influence the availability of freshwater resources. Nevertheless, the data presented provides a case for regional resource-sharing arrangements to balance freshwater availability against user demands to meet irrigation needs, protect freshwater resources and generate benefits for all five states, i.e. contributing to WEF security. To date, the imbalance of freshwater endowments remains a source of tension between states, with priorities of upstream countries clashing with those of downstream countries of the Aral Sea Basin.

It remains to be seen how international commitments, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and global pressures on markets to move away from fossil fuels, will influence trade and the choice of energy sources for the states in the region. 4.4.3 Agriculture and food production As shown in Table 1, approx. 75% of Central Asia\u2019s land area is agricultural land, but only 7.46% of the total land area in Central Asia is arable and 4.76% is covered by forests.12 Around 90% of freshwater withdrawals go towards agricultural activities, which points to its importance for social and economic development. Almost a quarter (24.8%) of the total employed population works in the agricultural sector, making it an important source of income. Agricultural activities are particularly significant for Tajikistan, as they provide 51% of all employment in the country (Table 4). According to a recent FAO report on the state of food security, the percentage of people in Central Asia suffering from severe food insecurity increased from 1.3 million to 2.5 million people between 2014 and 2017 (FAO, 2018). However, the overall percentage of people who suffer from food insecurity (or moderate food insecurity) is much higher. Additionally, intensive irrigation practices and climate change increase vulnerabilities and hamper socio-economic development with considerable impacts on all three nexus sectors \u2013 water, energy and food \u2013 with women and youth affected most. 11 The United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA); the Central Asia Water & Energy Programme supported by the World Bank, the European Union, Switzerland and the United Kingdom 12 Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Turkmenistan Uzbekistan Coal Gas Oil Hydroelectric Other 10 Table 4: Employment in agriculture disaggregated by gender Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Tajikistan Turkmenistan Uzbekistan Male (agriculture) 19% 25% 40% 6% 18% Female (agriculture) 17% 27% 69% 11% 26% Employment total (agriculture) 18% 26% 51% 8% 21% Unemployment total 5% 7% 10% 3% 7% Note: Gender (% of male and female employment, rounded to the nearest percent), employment in agriculture (% of total employment, rounded to the nearest percent) and total unemployment (% of total labour force, rounded to the nearest percent), data from 2018; Source: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ (modelled ILO estimates) 4.5 Gender considerations In Central Asia, women play an important role in the agriculture sector and for food production.13 They contribute equally, or in the case of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan substantially more than men to the labour force in the agricultural sector, often through low-skilled and low-paid labour (Table 4). Additionally, women in Central Asia are frequently responsible for feeding their families and for child rearing. However, issues of women\u2019s health, education and employment are rarely discussed and addressed. Therefore, gender perspectives should form an important part of nexus analysis to ensure a more complete and accurate assessment of the socio-economic environment in the region as well as to understand the impacts of resource insecurities on local communities. 5 The Water-Energy-Food Security Nexus To overcome any inconsistencies and achieve security in all three WEF sectors without compromising security in other sectors, political negotiation is required (Weitz, et al. 2017). Nexus provides a structured approach to the analysis of interrelations, helps identify critical bottlenecks and opportunities for benefit sharing and facilitates institutional processes conducive to multi-sectoral decision-making. The fact that Central Asian states view resource security as a matter of national and economic security can catalyse such multi-sectoral cooperation at national and regional levels. The WEF Security Nexus can offer a number of entry-points to minimise social, economic and environmental risks, meet the demand for water, energy and food, increase social and environmental resilience and prevent negative impacts of isolated, single-sector decisions on other sectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "682bf33f-f3f2-4931-83ab-e903dfd09e92": {"__data__": {"id_": "682bf33f-f3f2-4931-83ab-e903dfd09e92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa7eeb52ece0e83897e6f8f987a1f620da11fe922067736c0762147c3247c3a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "5998c4f4-e50a-45b1-a4a0-ee40c198e744", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5514535d7f9180fae204c53e02dec3f8447ff463ad216a5ee23b776df16f1ef"}}, "hash": "840659d5a21b9f2892eaa8b54da1a70531a9f774b158487d603c3e3b43e526ad", "text": "The 13 http://www.gender.cawater-info.net/publications/pdf/stulina_senecal_e.pdf Box 1: Benefits of Water-Energy-Food Nexus dialogues and planning \uf0e8 Increased understanding of nexus linkages, including interdependencies between resources, sectors and policy processes \uf0e8 Building of trust between stakeholders and sectors \uf0e8 Sharing of data and best practices \uf0e8 Forum for dialogue between diverse stakeholders \uf0e8 Mutual learning and cooperative problem-solving \uf0e8 Development of comparable standards and indicators \uf0e8 Benefit sharing and protection of ecosystems 11 nexus approach is a powerful communication tool, serving a as a catalyst to explore synergies for mutually beneficial and efficient use of human, financial, technological and other resources and provides opportunities for integration and negotiation of trade-offs.

With climate change, population growth, urbanisation and other global trends negatively affecting livelihoods and ecosystems in Central Asia, it has become ever more critical to manage scarce natural resources with a view to the impacts on other sectors and neighbouring countries. Regional imbalances could be reduced if nexus thinking was applied during negotiations of critical trade-offs between water, energy and food, including agriculture, that affect the entire region. The nexus approach, through multi-sectoral dialogues, planning and decision-making processes, opens new opportunities for managing limited resources more effectively and efficiently to achieve water, energy and food security. Additionally, it provides a framework for negotiation and identification of suitable solutions to generate mutual benefits, increase returns on investments and subsequently support the socio-economic development of Central Asia as a whole, with gains for each individual sector and country. There are numerous opportunities that allow Central Asia to benefit from nexus thinking, multi- sectoral dialogue and negotiation as well as the use of nexus methods and tools to facilitate socio- economic development goals. Employing nexus thinking and viewing issues from the perspectives of the three WEF sectors will catalyse innovation, new investments and help overcome a number of the challenges in increasing water, energy and food security in Central Asia. 5.1 Defining security Nexus thinking is key to addressing current and future insecurities of the interdependent WEF sectors. \u2018Security\u2019 is more than the mere availability of a resource. Instead, questions of resource access, the capacity to use resources rationally and sustainably, institutional arrangements, including how sectoral policies affect other sectors, and the social fabric in terms of power dynamics need to be considered as well (Biggs, et al., 2015). In this context security in each sector is defined as follows: - Water security means \u201censuring the availability of adequate and reliable water resources of acceptable quality, to underpin water service provision for all social and economic activities in a manner that is environmentally sustainable; mitigating water-related risks, such as floods, droughts and pollution; addressing the conflicts that may arise from disputes over shared waters, especially in situations of growing stress, and turning them into win-win solutions.\u201d (Global Water Partnership (GWP), 2012). - Energy security, as defined by Leese and Meisch (2015) means \"access to clean, reliable and affordable energy services for cooking and heating, lighting, communications and productive uses.\" Lele et al. (2013) add that energy security means that energy availability is mostly uninterrupted and affordable. - Food security is achieved \u201cwhen all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d (World Food Summit, 1996). Apart from food products having to be available and accessible as well as affordable, it is also necessary to 12 simultaneously ensure stable production chains and consumption of food (i.e. the capacity to use the food that has been produced), while avoiding food losses (Smil, 2000). Regional historical, geopolitical and socio-economic realities in Central Asia are highly relevant in achieving security, especially in the water and energy sector. To generate the necessary political backing and ownership, all factors influencing water, energy and food security need to be examined in the choice of strategic nexus activities. Since Central Asia is projected to experience growing water stress, water security can only be achieved where win-win solutions are adopted and benefits are shared between all riparian countries of the Central Asian region. Multi-sectoral approaches and nexus thinking that move beyond water-centric Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) approaches provide a framework and instigate processes that allow for the negotiation of such win- win scenarios. Giving due consideration to various water users and diverse interests, while also operating within the limits of ecosystem sustainability will be key. Competing water uses should be examined thoroughly, so that resources crucial to the socio-economic prosperity of the region can be managed sustainably and provide benefits to future generations. The provision of reliable and clean energy often requires large investments and careful deliberation of various available options. As was highlighted above, hydropower, coal and gas are the largest sources for energy production in Central Asia. In order to achieve energy security in the future, diversification will be required, especially where no renewable energy resources are used. However, hydropower has been a frequent source of tension in the region because it interrupts river flows and water volumes, affecting ecosystems downstream as well as irrigation practices.

Alternatives, such as biomass or other renewable energy sources could form a part of a nexus discourse in Central Asia as they build stronger links between the three resources, but also cater to the specific needs of each individual sector in light of climate change and vulnerability predictions. In Central Asia, food production depends largely on the availability of water resources, especially due to the region\u2019s aridity, high frequency of heat spells and climate change induced glacier melt across the region, making food security a major concern. Some countries may be able to increase their food imports, while others continue to struggle feeding their growing population. The increase of severe food insecurity and undernourishment of the Central Asian population should not be underestimated. In addition, it is worth remembering that a large part of the population relies on the agricultural sector as a source of employment and income, which may affect the economic access to sufficient and nutritious food and demonstrates the strong links to the socio-economic development of the region. Since the attainment of security objectives in one sector may cause potential threats for the other two sectors, the environment and the socio-economic development of Central Asia, nexus thinking is required. 13 5.2 WEF Nexus in Central Asia for increased security and reduced risks Globally14 it has been recognised that greater regional integration across water, energy and food sectors yields positive results for livelihoods and socio-economic development more broadly (Granit, et al., 2012). In Central Asia, however, the WEF Nexus concept is still in its infancy despite the fact that geographical specificities and imbalanced resource endowments make regional cooperation ever more expedient and critical. The concept of IWRM has already been integrated and found broad recognition in Central Asia, forming an important part of transboundary river management. Although IWRM can offer some useful tools, it will be insufficient to rely on a water-centric paradigm to solve issues of water, energy and food security in Central Asia. The limited scope and scale of the IWRM approach may lead to solutions for the water domain that do not adequately involve energy and food sector perspectives. The WEF Nexus brings all three sectors to the negotiation and decision-making table. It considers broader security issues, takes a multi-sectoral rather than water-centric approach, opens a multitude of pathways to arrive at solutions, drawing on the collective experiences and perspectives of the three WEF Nexus sectors and relevant actors and addresses the specific problem area rather than limit itself to a watershed. Nexus can be applied at any scale, as it involves a wider range of stakeholder perspectives, strengthens synergies, manages trade-offs and supports the negotiation of solutions that promote benefits for all involved sectors and states. Nexus approaches, thus, help overcome challenges and potential institutional barriers that prevent holistic and integrated planning, decision-making and implementation of interventions. For Central Asia, the nexus approach is particularly relevant in balancing competing interests of countries that want to utilise water for their hydropower potential to achieve energy security with those of the other countries that rely on water for irrigation and other uses. Cooperation between sectors and between riparian countries of the Aral Sea Basin is indispensable in these scenarios. In addition to limited natural resources, Central Asian countries struggle to attract crucial investments for regional priority projects. Countries have unequal access to available sources of finance, such as loans/credits, or capacity to tap into blended finance.15 Nexus is an approach that creates opportunities and maximises returns on investments in multipurpose solutions, thereby, producing 14 For example: Southern Africa under the Southern African Development Community (SADC) has embraced the WEF nexus since its 6th Multi-Stakeholder Water Dialogue on Water, Energy and Food Nexus that was held in 2013. Since then, the nexus has grown as a viable planning and decision-making approach in the region. Dialogues currently focus on institutionalising nexus within SADC governance frameworks. They are also supported by the EU/BMZ Regional Nexus Dialogues Programme. 15 Blended finance is defined as \u2018the strategic use of development finance and philanthropic funds to mobilize private capital flows to emerging and frontier markets\u2019 (OECD, 2015) Box 2: Why is there a need for nexus in Central Asia? \uf0e8 Global changes increase socio-economic and environmental risks/vulnerabilities \uf0e8 Sectors and states compete over limited natural resources \uf0e8 Competition over limited financial resources and difficulties to attract investments \uf0e8 Water-centric policy and decision-making hampers problem definition beyond the watershed \uf0e8 Need for alternative pathways to arrive at solutions that achieve multiple objectives \uf0e8 Bottlenecks in political economy and siloed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee84bef3-9c63-40e8-add3-bfe199cbd9af": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee84bef3-9c63-40e8-add3-bfe199cbd9af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66b93abf03c378802505d423a251847f0441e0ac899d94508b5a2b5f43aa06bc"}}, "hash": "66b93abf03c378802505d423a251847f0441e0ac899d94508b5a2b5f43aa06bc", "text": "budgetary arrangements \uf0e8 Lack of benefit-sharing analysis across sectors and states \uf0e8 Transboundary impacts of sector policies, decisions and investments 14 increased benefits for all sectors and countries at lower costs. Difficulties in attracting new types of investments may be attributed to the narrow definition of regional challenges \u2013 often based on one sectoral perspective. This is particularly the case for transboundary water issues, as these are a major area of regional cooperation for Central Asian countries. To solve WEF security challenges, problem definition needs to move beyond the limitation of the watershed to the problemshed.16 Going beyond water sector solutions will enable Central Asian countries to tap into an entirely new array of options, scenarios and opportunities, such as hybrid approaches that stem from the experiences and expertise of the different sectors and stakeholder groups involved. Underexplored partnerships, such as those involving the private sector, may become lucrative and facilitate building necessary synergies to achieve multiple objectives, while strengthening cooperation. The definition of a problemshed enables decision makers to break out of silos and to explore unconventional opportunities to overcome any constraints, such as rigid, sectoral planning approaches, including stringent budgetary arrangements. In addition to mitigate the impacts policies, decisions and investments in one sector have on other sectors, the WEF Nexus also helps to identify opportunities for benefit sharing in transboundary contexts. Regional cooperation in Central Asia focusses mostly on water allocation issues. In order to analyse the effects of national and regional sector policies on other sectors and the region in a systematic manner, the scope of regional cooperation needs to be broadened to include all relevant aspects of the WEF sectors. This requires political will, negotiation and compromise. It needs to be further clarified whether Central Asian states have the capacity and are ready to collaborate on such broader nexus issues. Concrete nexus challenges in Central Asia have been identified (Table 5) on previous occasions and the results of the stakeholder questionnaire below demonstrate that these issues are still pertinent. Though the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project has started to take steps to overcome some of these challenges, more needs to be done to embed nexus thinking in Central Asia. Achieving WEF security also implies managing mutual and increasing risks stemming from a growing population, poverty and lack of employment, climate change, the growing dependence on global markets, the deterioration of vital ecosystems and the changing international governance landscape. Table 5: Nexus issues in Central Asia; Source: project document, table developed in a consultation meeting held on 7 July 2016 in Gland, Switzerland Real life issues Policy and governance related issues \u2022 Lack of food security: inability of households from the 2-3 lowest quintiles to afford a balanced food basket \u2022 Lack of energy security: significant imbalance between peak demand for electricity in winter times upstream and existing generation capacity \u2022 Lack of water security: i. lack of irrigation water in some areas during vegetation period, ii. low coverage of rural population by centralised (piped) and reliable potable water supply, and iii. lack of protection of human life and economic assets from water-related disasters (e.g. floods, mudflows and landslides) \u2022 Lack of incentives for improving resource use efficiency (water, land, energy) \u2022 Limited policy coherence \u2022 Lack of preparedness to make political decisions \u2022 Lack of cooperation, coordination and consultation for planning between ministries \u2022 Lack of cooperation at operational level \u2022 Lack of financing for investment projects on multi-purpose water use \u2022 Implementation of investment projects 16 A problemshed is defined as an \u201cissue network\u201d that is not tied to hydrologically defined boundaries, but rather considers the specific challenges at hand (Mollinga, Meinzen-Dick, & Merrey, 2007) 15 \u2022 Issues are exacerbated by factors, such as: i. Fast demographic growth in Central Asia ii. Increased climate variability and change iii. Increased risks of external shocks (e.g. volatility of prices for food and energy commodities on the world markets) and macro-economic risks (e.g. public budget deficit, reduced remittance etc.) \u2022 Lack of recognition of ecosystem services \u2022 Lack of institutional mechanism for the implementation of the nexus approach at national, regional and basin levels \u2022 Lack of coordination of donors Heightened risks or crisis often prompt political action, expedite investments, revitalise transboundary cooperation and catalyse innovative solutions.

Well-structured and functional institutions determine priority issues, provide the necessary context, govern the involvement of stakeholders, influence cooperation modalities and decision-making processes and ultimately affect expected outcomes. Institutional arrangements that favour sectoral planning and policymaking may contribute to resource use conflicts and create contradictions of policy objectives. If institutions are conducive to multi-sectoral approaches that build on mutually agreed principles, rules and processes, incentives will emerge that bring stakeholders together to agree on common goals and objectives related to interdependent sectors and resources (Granit, et al., 2012). In the context of Central Asia, this can be seen with the emergence of a regional multi-sectoral investment programme, the ASBP governed by IFAS. At the national level, some policies, laws and strategies in the water, energy and food sectors do refer to the other two sectors, but fragmentation remains an obstacle. Where the interdependencies between these sector policies are not considered and aligned, overall security may be threatened, including adverse impacts on socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. Additionally, top-down political approaches influence decision-making, both at national and regional levels, and may impede multi-sectoral, transboundary cooperation. Therefore, national and regional institutional frameworks governing water, energy and food sectors need to be assessed in relation to overlaps and inconsistencies between each of the WEF sectors in order to reveal where one sector objective may undermine that of the others (Cai, Wallington, et al. 2018). A cursory policy diagnostic reveals that Central Asian countries claim independence and sovereignty over their internal resource endowments, especially water, which is also the basis for national socio-economic development. The Law of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan on Water, the Water Code of Turkmenistan and the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Water and Water Use specifically refer to international cooperation in relation to water uses, while the Water Code of Tajikistan defines water as the exclusive property of the state. All states promote the rational use of water. Broadly speaking, national policies of Central Asian states are largely based on political considerations related to security and self-sufficiency (Rakhmatullaev, et al. 2018). Food security is 16 a matter of national security and a major contributor to increasing socio-economic development. This includes a transition to sustainable agriculture, access to food by the local population and as a means for poverty reduction. Tajikistan and Turkmenistan specifically underline the objective of securing domestic food production to safeguard their national sovereignty and Kazakhstan emphasises its objective to achieve independence from food imports. The Law on National Security of Kazakhstan mentions food security, while Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan have specific laws on the issue.17 Central Asian states are most concerned with socio-economic development, including improved living standards, and with retaining sovereignty in the quest for national security. However, the mostly sectoral approaches and focus on resource allocation rather than benefit sharing remain a major barrier to addressing modern challenges, especially at regional level. Instead, nexus perspectives may be more expedient when framed around common risks, such as droughts, water scarcity, a starving population or climate change. Alternatively, showing how benefits from achieving a common goal may increase can also increase the likelihood that regional institutions promote multi-sectoral approaches and cooperation. In Central Asia, national multi-sectoral cooperation is not enough in many instances because water, energy and food, including agriculture, are inextricably linked beyond national borders. Cooperation with the aim of achieving WEF Security Nexus at regional level can produce new opportunities. However, for these opportunities to emerge, common challenges need to be clearly defined and trust built. This needs to be supported by an enabling institutional environment. It is clear that bilateral and multilateral agreements enacted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union could not replace the benefit sharing arrangements that existed prior to 1991. Additionally, they are frequently not implemented and, thus, fail to deliver on their ambition. Water allocation principles present one legacy of the Soviet era, which remained largely unchanged (Rakhmatullaev, et al. 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1ab4f8e-0955-499d-8fb1-4a4bfaf57cc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1ab4f8e-0955-499d-8fb1-4a4bfaf57cc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bd1baeb3f5f6d0c911efcabfd39bd90f4c5c939e5a36f0e343b5ee5d407759c"}, "2": {"node_id": "528ac3c6-55ef-47c1-a6ff-907e0852beb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59a323253a0f3eec2a7d18cb9acc1365e9ba99cacca44f42c38ed08acdb5f04a"}}, "hash": "98b43cdf07fabfea130901c373cf6dcb918bd2dbf17ae8d3bf7a33237a71b2bf", "text": "2018).

Though the agreement establishes an institutional framework for coordinated solutions and policy in the interests of economic growth, raising living standards and regulating the use of water jointly and equitably, it does not address the linkages between water, energy and food, including agriculture. Instead, it is primarily concerned with ensuring the rational use and protection of water \u2013 more specifically the allocation of shared water resources between the five Central Asian states. In the agreement, states recognise that only integration and joint coordination of actions will enable favourable conditions to deal with socio- economic problems, mitigate and stabilise ecological stress. Yet, the narrow scope of such actions remains a key obstacle. Here, nexus thinking provides an opportunity to broaden the discussion and apply a comprehensive systems perspective. 17 Kazakhstan: Law No. 527-IV ZRK \u201con national security\u201d; Kyrgyzstan: Law No. 183 \u201con food security\u201d; Tajikistan: Law No. 671 \u201con food security\u201d; Turkmenistan: Law No. 29-II \u201con food security\u201d 17 Establishing cooperation, institutional and governance frameworks that do not only mobilise joint decision-making and action between the WEF sectors, but also foster agreement between the five Central Asian states is of utmost importance for the region\u2019s future. But it remains a great challenge \u2013 especially politically. Albeit a recognition of the interdependence of water, energy and food security objectives, regional agreements and cooperation frameworks largely focus on strategies and interventions in the water domain. Instead, the ultimate aim of cooperation and multi-sectoral planning approaches should be to increase water security, energy security and food security, foster cohesive economic development and improve social welfare and environmental protection. 6.1 International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) Although the region still grapples with its Soviet past, Central Asian states acknowledged the need for collaboration on pressing regional issues. One major achievement was the establishment of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS) in 1993 by the heads of the five Central Asian states. Originally formed to address the Aral Sea crisis, IFAS has developed into a much broader organisation dealing with issues that affect the socio-economic development of the region and the people who depend on ecosystems and natural resources for their livelihoods. IFAS offers cooperation platforms not only related to water resources (Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC)), but also on sustainable development issues (Interstate Commission for Sustainable Development (ICSD)). The geographic scope of IFAS includes all five Central Asian countries. However, it should be noted that in 2016 Kyrgyzstan froze its membership, making it more difficult for IFAS to operate. A number of structural challenges faced by IFAS include (i) the rotation system and the need of EC- IFAS members to move to the host country; (ii) lack of adequate core budget and members not fulfilling their obligations regarding the allocation of agreed funds to IFAS18; (iii) the reliance on political will and dependence on favourable geopolitical conditions to carry out its functions and operate effectively (e.g. lack of response to meeting invitations)19; (iv) competition between bodies of IFAS (e.g. ICWC claiming independence from IFAS); and (v) dependence on donor interests due to reliance on grants to implement its activities, especially for ASBP. Despite its limitations, there are opportunities to reform IFAS, modernise approaches and adapt institutional arrangements to meet present-day challenges of the region, including advancing water, energy and food security through nexus thinking. IFAS continues to serve an important function, as the main platform for dialogue and coordination on water, energy, food, including agriculture, and environmental issues among all five Central Asian countries. Additionally, IFAS provides a forum for high-level decision-making and facilitates meetings of Heads of State of the five Central Asian countries to discuss cooperation frameworks. Central Asian states have repeatedly confirmed the role of IFAS as a forum to develop mutually acceptable mechanisms on the integrated use of water resources and environmental protection, while taking account of the interests of all states in the region (IFAS, 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "137c2ef3-a386-4c32-9343-9cb103b97930": {"__data__": {"id_": "137c2ef3-a386-4c32-9343-9cb103b97930", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f2ffddad314f0e75d89440c0311e25524b66d33fa61d26d4b078b3ebed8b991"}, "2": {"node_id": "b147209d-525e-4d1a-b1d5-bea6578b14ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "beda4ed6e77fd40bbddd9645f11a52bfcdfa2a06c861ce5b0f91087bbd19be99"}}, "hash": "39410fea253bdaae5caf6adaf78a9eb186bd99565ba727a901c8df1b70ddec70", "text": "The array of agreements, decisions and statements adopted in the framework of IFAS confirms the readiness of Central Asian states to cooperate.

The most important decisions concerning the strategic directions for activities of the Fund are adopted by the Council of Heads of State of Central Asia. The main objective of the fund is to finance joint practical measures, programmes and projects for saving the Aral Sea, ecological rehabilitation of the Aral Sea surrounding areas and the Aral Sea Basin as a whole, taking into account the interests of all riparian states in the region. The main goal of IFAS and its organisations is to work towards integration and cooperation in order to use existing water resources more effectively and efficiently, to ensure sustainable development and adapt to climate change in the region.20 The structure of IFAS and its governance approaches have not been updated since its establishment, albeit attempts and support from international development agencies. The recent UN resolution on \u201cStrengthening regional and international cooperation to ensure peace, stability and sustainable development in the Central Asian Region\u201d21 adopted in June 2018 demonstrates that efforts are being made to overcome the shortcomings of IFAS and reinvigorate attention from the international community to the situation of the region as well as attract the needed investments. The structure of IFAS shows that water and sustainable development issues in the region are highly politicised, because all activities and actions of IFAS organs need to be approved by Heads of State of the five Central Asian countries. With Kyrgyzstan\u2019s membership still frozen, IFAS struggles to facilitate cooperation and deliver on its mandate. IFAS itself strives to be an active regional organisation that promotes conflict-free resolutions to complex water problems, while taking into account the social and economic situation of the region. One key element of achieving this goal is to strengthen regional cooperation. A main task is the \u201cfinancing and crediting of joint practical actions and perspective programs and projects for the Aral Sea saving, ecological rehabilitation of Pryaralye22 and of the Aral Sea Basin as \u0430 whole with account of the interests of all the states of the region.\u201d (EC IFAS, 1999a, p. para. 1.1) IFAS aims to enable the implementation of projects that improve the management of shared water resources. However, the Fund has not been able to successfully attract funding for many of the programmes and projects critical to the sustainable development of the region. Instead, project proponents largely depend on their own capacity to convince donors, international financial institutions (IFIs) and other investors to provide the necessary funds for project implementation. 6.1.2 ICWC \u2013 Interstate Commission on Water Coordination23 On 18 February 1992, the Ministers of Water Resources of five Central Asian states signed the \u201cAgreement on cooperation in joint management, use and protection of interstate sources of water resources\u201d.

The Ministers of Water Resources of the five Central Asian states are members of ICWC. Quarterly meetings are held to determine regional water resources management and development and ensure the stability of natural and hydro-ecological processes.

CMC provides expertise on the use, protection and accounting of water resources. 6.1.3 ICSD \u2013 Interstate Commission on Sustainable Development24 The Interstate Commission on Sustainable Development (ICSD) was established in 1994 by a Decision of the Interstate Council for the Aral Sea. According to its Statutes, the main purpose and mandate of the Commission is to coordinate and manage regional cooperation on environment and sustainable development in the countries of Central Asia. For this purpose, ICSD is tasked to develop the Regional Environmental Action Plan (REAP), a programme on regional nature conservation aimed at: \u2022 developing a regional strategy for sustainable development and support implementation programmes and plans for sustainable development associated with it; and \u2022 coordinating activities to implement obligations of Central Asian states under environmental conventions of transboundary dimension. ICSD consists of 15 members \u2013 three representatives from each country, including the heads of agencies dealing with environmental conservation, the deputy ministers of economy and representatives of the scientific community. The Chair of the Commission is elected on a rotational basis from the Ministers of Environment for a term of two years. Its executive bodies include the Scientific Information Center (SIC ICSD) and the Secretariat. SIC ICSD has branch offices in all countries of Central Asia, represented by units of national environmental agencies. In addition, ICSD has initiated within its structure the establishment of the regional mountain center and the regional center for renewable energy. A Public Board operates under ICSD. For many years, the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) for Asia and the Pacific, based in Bangkok, supported ICSD activities. UNEP provides assistance for the development of the ICSD work programme and significant financial support to projects and activities carried out under its auspices. The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project also supported meetings of ICSD during the 24 Regional Dialogue among Central Asian Environmental Institutions (analytical paper). 20 most recent iteration of REAP. Although ICSD covers the entire Central Asia region, its scope of activities is limited to the Aral Sea Basin. ICSD also facilitates the harmonisation of the legislative and methodological basis for the protection of the environment and the establishment of a regional data bank on protection of the environment. Whereas the mandates of ICSD and ICWC overlap in part, the mandate of ICSD extends far beyond the water domain. Indeed, the first integrated \u201cstate of environment\u201d assessment for Central Asia, REAP, and the Framework Convention for the Protection of the Environment for Sustainable Development in Central Asia, signed by three countries in the region, were developed under the auspices of the ICSD with support of UNEP. 6.2 Aral Sea Basin Programme (ASBP) The Aral Sea Basin Programme (ASBP) 25 is a mechanism to solve water, socio-economic and environmental issues in the Aral Sea Basin, thereby, fulfilling a core objective of EC IFAS. ASBP is a key long-term action programme for the region that includes a list of both national and regional projects in the field of sustainable development with a particular focus on managing water resources and protection of the environment. Reflecting on the goals of the WEF security nexus, this is very much in line with nexus thinking. However, ASBP has traditionally been a water-centric, unstructured and underfunded programme that mostly relied on the international donor community to provide grants. The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project has supported IFAS to turn ASBP-4 into a broader investment programme to catalyse innovative, blended solutions. ASBP was created to strengthen regional collaboration and address challenges of mutual interest. Because IFAS mainly relies on donor or grant funding, many projects that were included in the last three programmes could not be implemented. This points to some of the shortcomings of ASBP, including a focus on national projects, the lack of standardised criteria to ensure quality of proposals, limited regional cooperation to implement projects, a reliance on grants and the international donor community to provide the necessary funds, the absence of effective project monitoring frameworks and a general lack of capacity within IFAS.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ada3729-73f8-42b2-b6c3-5e7c4b7ffd0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ada3729-73f8-42b2-b6c3-5e7c4b7ffd0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8d6eea187a5e5d806c985d5afc8f6cf2d62163cbe15c9f34e6dd93c009ae917"}, "2": {"node_id": "21ee4994-2b1e-45d4-b75d-403d5918ac47", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4168f59d228c358def7bfd21120582764ae1fea8f9a79ac4599b1b63c7e8a2f"}}, "hash": "dd4eb298dc562339e52f27079dece65edefe2b3c4b8495c155315a405c694942", "text": "Three programmes were implemented in the past: ASBP-1 (1994-2002), ASBP-2 (2003-2010) and ASBP-3 (2011-2015).

After the first two iterations of ASBPs, a number of lessons learnt were collected. These included the realisation that the donor community should be more involved in the preparation of ASBP as well as supporting the programme financially. Furthermore, while ASBP-1 and 2 mainly addressed technical issues, greater attention was given to social, political and institutional concerns in ASBP-3. The review also revealed that cooperation at various levels of decision-making and between ministries of the Central Asian countries remained weak and, therefore, undermined effective implementation. Additionally, \u201cdonors recommend[ed] the establishment of a regular joint process for taking stock and reviewing the progress on the implementation of the approved ASBP-3\u201d (IFAS, 2012). ASBP-4 focusses on four main directions: (i) integrated use of water resources; (ii) environmental protection; (iii) socio-economic development; and (iv) improvement of institutional and legal instruments. The list of projects that is eventually included into ASBP-4 is negotiated first among 25 http://www.ifas.kz/en/page/asbp_149 21 national, followed by discussions with regional ASBP working groups. Project proposals are screened at national level with the help of experts supported by the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project and other donors. Successful proposals that fulfil the agreed selection criteria are then submitted to the regional ASBP working group. National ASBP working groups are made up of representatives of key ministries from all relevant sectors enabling multi-sectoral dialogue on priorities. At regional level, regional ASBP working groups bring together EC IFAS representatives, ICSD, ICWC, working group experts and a small number of representatives from international organisations, including CAREC. Donor meetings are also organised in parallel, in order to attract investments for projects selected under ASBP. In the iteration of ASBP-4, particular attention is paid to providing a clearer set of criteria for the selection of projects and on matters of practical implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the results generated by the programme. The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project was successful in its impact on the draft ASBP-4 concept, which now includes specific reference to the WEF security nexus and the nexus approach more broadly. In the proposed selection criteria, countries are asked to propose projects that are cross-sectoral and consider benefits for other sectors of the economy. Additionally, the current iteration of the programme will no longer rely on grants only, as it has started to explore new types of investments \u2013 hence, making ASBP-4 an investment programme. With negotiations of ASBP-4 ongoing, it is anticipated that the WEF security nexus will feature more prominently and that multi-sectoral projects will be proposed. It is encouraging that the Heads of State in their Joint Communique of the Heads of the Central Asian States noting the importance to elaborate the Aral Sea Basin Programme (ASBP-4) made particular reference to water-energy linkages, emphasising the integrated and rational use of water and energy resources in Central Asia. They further noted the importance of hydropower facilities, particularly with respect to transboundary watercourses, and reiterated that any interventions in this regard should comply with international principles and standards. 7 Questionnaire results A questionnaire was used to conduct semi-structured interviews (Annex 1 \u2013 Questionnaire) with key stakeholders to gain a better understanding of existing regional institutional arrangements in Central Asia. Aimed at identifying regional institutional opportunities and challenges, the following topics were covered: 1) WEF Security Nexus awareness and understanding; 2) ASBP planning process; 3) Selection and implementation of regional ASBP investment projects; 4) Building an enabling environment in Central Asia. Sixteen individuals were interviewed for the purpose of this analysis. They included representatives from national ministries, regional organisations, especially the two BWOs and other national and regional experts working in sectors closely related to water and natural resources management. Some of the respondents were part of the national expert community engaged by the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project. The findings from the interviews were supplemented by desk research and information obtained during national and regional dialogues, to ensure a more complete, comprehensive and accurate picture of the situation in the region. 22 7.1 WEF security nexus awareness and understanding Acceptance of its importance and a deep understanding of the nexus concept are crucial for effective dialogue and meaningful negotiation to take place.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "977fb02b-1b69-4e15-93a9-ca4cf8f244a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "977fb02b-1b69-4e15-93a9-ca4cf8f244a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a06489a28d09f5d59839b56e161da93afcfd996327c5da9a5b6bfc74a61fc471"}, "2": {"node_id": "c1f39b5d-37b9-4119-925c-67eaa93dcab8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e13929bf49a7291d4ba216e178ef58b67ac8ca6d906b9f9fdeb78aafb3bbe42f"}}, "hash": "b1204c45b2f554f332e431da77eb7d4b6b63ac3373ef791f72840bc6fd0628f5", "text": "According to the data collected (Figure 7), respondents believe they have sufficient understanding of the WEF Security Nexus and recognise its value for the region.

The nexus concept, however, is still new and experience with using it is virtually non-existent in Central Asia. For the nexus to be institutionalised, political will and a favourable institutional environment are necessary, especially at regional level. While respondents recognise the lack of information and data sharing, they also highlight that this varies between countries. It is vital to identify opportunities and information needs and to develop the necessary information and data sharing protocols that would enable informed WEF Nexus decision-making. While there are some attempts at national level of different ministries to work together, there are no clear rules and procedures as to how mutual exchange should occur and how this may influence sectoral policy and decision-making. Additionally, many countries prioritise single- sector economic growth without much coordination, which would have the potential to increase benefits and prevent negative impacts on other sectors. Figure 7: WEF security nexus awareness and understanding In the comment section, respondents made reference to the efforts of the Central Asia Nexus Project to establish national and regional dialogues to gradually increase WEF Nexus understanding. There is a recognition that these multi-sectoral platforms that have been established are necessary to put the nexus approach into action in the future, especially at regional level. However, from these dialogues it became apparent that full buy-in will become only possible, where the success of the application of the WEF Nexus approach can be demonstrated through concrete actions and best practices in Central Asia. Therefore, while the principles and theoretical underpinnings of the nexus approach are sufficiently understood and best practice cases from other regions serve as important background and conversation starter,26 there is some uncertainty as to how Central Asian countries 26 See IUCN (2019). Increasing returns on investment opportunities by applying a nexus approach: Best practice nexus case studies. Belgrade, Serbia: IUCN. 23 can benefit in practical terms. This, in turn, influences the willingness of stakeholders to embrace and commit fully to the nexus approach. 7.2 ASBP planning process (national/regional) When looking at the ASBP planning processes at the national and regional level, respondents indicate that multi-sectoral dialogue does not form a priority of ASBP planning and that single-sector interests (primarily water) take priority (Figure 8). Additionally, socio-economic development is awarded greater importance than environmental sustainability, which may affect the types of projects selected for inclusion in ASBP. Figure 8: ASBP planning process (national/regional) While most national ASBP working groups include representatives from all sectors, at regional level there is a lack of multi-sectoral dialogue in general. It is not always clear whether negotiation on concrete trade-offs is possible in practical terms, even when all sectors are represented. It was noted that private sector involvement has the potential to enhance the overall positive impact of ASBP. Private sector investments seek to optimise outcomes and may, therefore, maximise financial returns. However, the lack of an effective platform and sufficient institutional capacity required for the development of a common vision for multi-sectoral planning constitutes a major barrier to achieving benefits for all WEF sectors in the region. Horizontal and vertical coordination and collaboration is required, in which mutual understanding becomes possible. Furthermore, respondents highlighted that not all WEF ministries are included in all ASBP processes and that the energy sector in particular remains underrepresented. This can be attributed to the four priority areas of ASBP and the general purpose of IFAS, which was not established to act as a regional integrating organisation, but rather as a facilitator to address matters of regional water management. 24 7.3 Selection and implementation of regional ASBP investment projects The study at hand suggests that there is a lack of strategic vision of the ASBP process, which hampers the effectiveness and implementation of selected projects. Additionally, expectations of donors and IFIs do not always align with regional priorities or are generally not clear to stakeholders (Figure 9). Some respondents called for more regional focus of ASBP and to take a more strategic approach regarding project selection, especially considering that many projects in the last programme (ASBP-3) were never implemented. Other respondents called for sound criteria that would encourage regional challenges to be addressed more coherently, rather than building ASBP solely on national interests.

There is also a need to build capacities for the development of project proposals, the implementation of projects and more generally for the management of the entire project cycle. It was suggested to create a permanent, regional body, within the structures of IFAS, with responsibility for the development, implementation, management and monitoring of ASBP-4. This body would work for the duration of ASBP-4. Alternatively, this role could be carried out by established structures of EC IFAS, who could encourage each country to develop ASBP implementation plans. Sources of financing and opportunities for regional investment projects are a major concern for Central Asian countries (Figure 9). Respondents noted that private sector financing and investment could be utilised more strategically. Since there is no unified ASBP fund, the region relies on a combination of funding sources. Placing a greater focus on making ASBP more attractive from an economic point of view, may catalyse blended investments, including from the private sector. It was highlighted that initiatives at the regional level are often based on political rather than economic decisions and considerations. Additionally, there is a gap between the types of projects that are of interest to donors and IFIs and those projects that are deemed by the countries of Central Asia as having national or regional priority. 25 7.4 Building an enabling environment in Central Asia Respondents confirmed that political readiness, trust and commitment of countries is a key prerequisite to achieve greater policy coherence and facilitate constructive negotiation at the regional level. An effective dialogue platform and a clear institutional framework would allow Central Asian countries to meet on a regular basis, exchange information and develop joint strategies and plans. There is a need to update the institutional, regulatory and legal frameworks in Central Asia, which also includes improving the organisational structure of IFAS. A clearer, more strategic and transparent approach could mean more projects that are economically attractive, socially significant and politically acceptable and unbiased. Multi-sectoral dialogue could contribute to more effective balancing of interests between WEF sectors based on consensus between all Central Asian countries, thereby, promoting more efficient use of natural, financial and technological resources. However, practical steps and activities that transform WEF discussions into concrete actions in the regional context (i.e. through pilot projects) are indispensable. Positive results of practical applications will strengthen regional cooperation and catalyse expansion of project proposals. The following factors have been identified as those most prohibitive to multi-sectoral dialogue for the planning of WEF investment projects at the regional level in Central Asia: \u2022 unfavourable political and institutional factors; \u2022 low levels of mutual understanding and trust; \u2022 lack of knowledge, institutional and technical capacities; and \u2022 need for more open data and information exchange. It was also mentioned that the concept of an open dialogue without conditions is new to the region. According to some respondents, \u201cdependence on the past\u201d persists, in addition to \u201cthe game of showing off\u201d. Multi-sectoral dialogues generally lack a clear structure, criteria or strategic vision. Additionally, negotiations are often driven by self-interest rather than broader regional goals. 7.5 Additional observations Environmental protection and the achievement of water, energy and food security through multi- sector approaches at regional level appears to be a challenge that has not been sufficiently considered. This can be attributed, at least in part, to a lack of clarity of what the purpose of ASBP is. Representatives of national working groups do not have a clear view on how to increase impact and effectiveness of the programme and attract investments toward implementation of those projects. In this regard, respondents noted challenges regarding priority setting at regional level, starting with problem-definition. ASBP should serve as a means to develop and coordinate priority tasks in each sector and for each regional priority area. In this way, following up on concrete project development could be better aligned with priorities of donors and IFIs. Agreeing on which problems to address at the regional level could, thus, significantly enhance the effectiveness of ASBP, increase its impact as well as the likelihood of project financing and implementation. A prevailing lack of trust among states may be a factor hampering cooperation and information exchange between countries. Furthermore, multi-sectoral dialogue is affected also by vast differences in the economic situation of the five Central Asian countries, which greatly influences investment opportunities and financial capacities. Respondents highlighted that economic growth and environmental sustainability are interconnected and acknowledge that regional cooperation will 26 become increasingly important for the advancement of the region\u2019s socio-economic development and the protection of vital ecosystems. Yet, genuine multi-sectoral dialogue that applies nexus perspectives remains sporadic.

The regional dialogues organised as part of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project, however, are seen as the first step towards increasing knowledge and information exchange, building the necessary trust between the WEF sectors and between countries and to explore innovative investment options. Respondents recognise these efforts and generally perceive them as useful and positive. However, participants of these dialogues and within the ASBP process mostly represent the water sector, or are experts from the water domain. This impedes the inclusion of energy and food sector perspectives. Instead, discussions often continue to revolve around pure water management or IWRM challenges. This may be attributed to the fact that water issues constitute a major link to other sectors of the economy as well as the environment. Additionally, diverging national interests continue to obstruct the formation of a common understanding at regional level on how to balance various interests and priorities. Underlying reasons for underrepresentation of some sectors are attributed to a lack of interest, incentives and prohibitive institutional arrangements. 8 Conclusion Participants of the Project\u2019s national and regional meetings, as well as those who responded to the questionnaire indicated that the activities of the Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project have increased awareness on the WEF Security Nexus, the necessity of collaboration between WEF sectors and between countries and possible applications of nexus thinking in the region. Nexus approaches offer equitable, needs-based and sustainable solutions that promote the sharing of resources. It provides a structured approach to analyse interrelations, helps identify critical bottlenecks and opportunities for benefit sharing and facilitates institutional processes conducive to multi-sectoral decision-making. The imbalance of freshwater endowments remains a source of competition between Central Asian states, especially where priorities of upstream compared to downstream countries of the Aral Sea Basin diverge. Interdependencies and competition can be addressed through well-designed, structured and multi-dimensional regional investment programmes that take into account lessons learned from ASBP, but is wider in both geographical and thematic scope. Regional organisations working in the area of environmental protection and have political leverage can act as key facilitators. The nexus approach, as a powerful communication tool, can then be utilised to bring all relevant sectors and actors onto the negotiation table to design institutional frameworks that enable all perspectives to be considered in the planning and decision-making process. The Central Asia Nexus Dialogue Project was able to influence the development of the draft ASBP- 4 concept, which includes specific references to the WEF Security Nexus and the nexus approach more broadly. Countries are now asked to propose projects that are cross-sectoral and consider benefits for other sectors of the economy. Additionally, the current iteration of the programme will no longer rely on grants alone, but started to explore new types of investments. There is still a need to take a step-by-step approach to introducing nexus thinking and application in Central Asia. Efforts should be made to demonstrate the benefits of the nexus approach in concrete terms, especially through application in small scale pilots. Then steps can be taken towards creating an enabling environment to move towards larger multi-sectoral investments. The institutional environment and governance structures are particularly important if the WEF Nexus is to be fully 27 rooted in Central Asia. However, this will depend largely on the willingness of key actors of the three WEF sectors and individual states to cooperate towards a common goal of achieving sustainable development that ensures water, energy and food security. The required commitment will only develop over time, as capacities and institutions are strengthened. Especially, IFAS has to position itself more clearly as an organisation that has the mandate and capacity to bring together the diverse interests of its members. 28 9 Recommendations The following recommendations represent immediate steps that should be taken to ground nexus thinking in Central Asia and enable institutional changes conducive to multi-sectoral planning and decision-making. They have the potential to strengthen the WEF Security Nexus in Central Asia and create the necessary institutional enabling environment. \u2022 Understanding the WEF Nexus approach: - Agreement on a common regional definition of WEF Security Nexus; - Regular and open dialogues involving all three WEF sectors at both national and regional levels, utilising existing platforms and tools; - Frame WEF Security Nexus around national economic security objectives; - Carry out a detailed national nexus assessment and policy diagnostic; - Collect best practice examples from the Central Asian region; - Assess interdependencies between national and regional policies. \u2022 Demonstrating WEF nexus application in Central Asia:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b4be081-1704-42f2-871b-74b4f46beba2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b4be081-1704-42f2-871b-74b4f46beba2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regional institutional arrangements advancing water, energy and food security in Central Asia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4494d7d42e3a3d8e35648e08bc2ec20284939d4c4bf9122c266d8ee9c5c6bd33"}, "3": {"node_id": "a5c9c751-4523-4637-a7bc-0f87b3f9f12a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/regional-institutional-arrangements-advancing-water-energy-and-food", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "285b9216cc47c579bca0080ac1cfcd0c37c86efe1dc382478587dac41c3dfffd"}}, "hash": "c7ae628c8c11e9007a397d72ff3af58df978690927a422285f671f25a19c2396", "text": "- Develop a strategic vision and clear action plan to move nexus from dialogue to action; - Establish a technical nexus working group to develop and implement pilot nexus investment projects; - Design, plan and implement small-scale nexus projects to demonstrate the benefits of the nexus approach in Central Asia. \u2022 Overcoming water-centric planning and decision-making: - Increase the involvement and representation of all WEF sectors; - Jointly define problems, negotiate trade-offs and identify solutions at regional level; - Inclusion of various stakeholders, including resource users, into the project design. \u2022 Enabling political and institutional environment: - Strengthen national and regional coordination mechanisms and legal frameworks for multi-sectoral planning and decision-making; - Develop national and regional knowledge and data sharing platforms; - Identify the role and assess capacities of regional institutions in promoting the nexus approach and its application; - Enhance national policy coherence for better regional coordination and cooperation. \u2022 Multi-sectoral investments: - Review nexus project selection criteria; - Provide guidance on design and implementation of nexus investment projects; - Explore innovative investment opportunities, including blended financing, by developing a financing model for Central Asia. 29 References Albrecht, T.R., Crootof, A., & Scott, C.A.

In particular, the questionnaire was completed by stakeholders involved in IFAS and the ASBP-4 process (members of regional and national ASBP-4 working groups), international agencies involved or supporting ASBP, former IFAS and/or ASBP working group members, the Amu Darya and Syr Darya Basin Water Organisations (BWO) and other relevant stakeholders and/or experts. Interviews took place between May and September 2018. Where possible face-to-face or telephone interviews and/or focus group, discussions were conducted. The Central Asian International Environmental Forum (CAIEF), meetings of the ASBP-4 working groups, Intersectoral Working Group (IsWG) meetings and Regional Steering Committee (RSC) meetings served as opportunities for setting up relevant stakeholder meetings and for conducting interviews. Russian-English translation was provided. Where this was not possible, questionnaires were sent via email to stakeholders/experts. However, face-to-face or telephone interviews were preferred as these allowed queries by respondents to be addressed and follow-up/ clarification questions to be considered. Overview of respondents: Interviews were conducted with a total of 16 individuals \u2012 nine representatives from national ministries, five from regional organisations, including basin water organisations, one from an international organisation and one national expert. Of the nine national representatives, three are from Kazakhstan, four from Tajikistan, one from Turkmenistan and one from Uzbekistan. Kyrgyzstan did not participate in the questionnaire due to their membership in IFAS being frozen. Three of the respondents are female and thirteen are male. It was striking that eleven of the sixteen respondents (approx. 69%) named water as one of their key areas of responsibility and/or expertise. This is significant as the nexus debate largely remains in the water sector. This is particularly the case in Central Asia, where water allocation challenges and the reasonable utilisation of water resources characterised by security concerns due to water scarcity, continues to be a major priority for the region. The involvement of other sectors is often not possible, due to geo-political challenges.

The RRHP comprises a 130m high dam on the Rufiji river at Stiegler\u2019s Gorge, creation of a 100km long, c.914km2 reservoir plus a power plant, a transmission line, workers camps and access roads, all of which will be within the Selous Game Reserve, a natural World Heritage Site. This review follows a similar format to, and builds upon, the independent technical review of the Project EIA commissioned in April 2019 by IUCN, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 2019). The c. 50,000km2 Selous Game Reserve (SGR) is an IUCN category IV protected area1. It has been a natural World Heritage Site since 1982 but has been on the List of World Heritage in Danger since 2014 due to intensive poaching. In 2018, the threat from the Project was added to the justification for the continued inclusion of SGR on the List of World Heritage in Danger. This review assesses the degree of alignment of the Rufiji Assessment with 1) widely-accepted international standards, in particular environmental assessment of large hydropower projects, as set by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), 2) Tanzania\u2019s National Guidelines for Strategic Environmental Assessment dated June 2017, and 3) IUCN guidance on environmental assessment in World Heritage sites. This review finds that, in almost every way, the Rufiji Assessment does not meet the expectations of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). It does much to try to justify the RRHP, without looking objectively at the economic, environmental and social costs, benefits and risks of developing the RRHP \u2013 let alone giving similar consideration to the costs, benefits and risks of a range of other potential options to achieve desired outcomes (such as power generation) which is the whole point of an SEA. Given the advanced stage of project planning, this means the Rufiji Assessment cannot deliver the credible input into strategic decision-making that an SEA is intended to provide. The Rufiji Assessment falls substantially below widely-accepted international good practice SEA standards and IUCN guidance on environmental assessment. Likewise, the Rufiji Assessment appears to fall short of national policy guidance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e6da56da-ded3-4be3-8c14-157c88e46670": {"__data__": {"id_": "e6da56da-ded3-4be3-8c14-157c88e46670", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Independent technical review of the \"Strategic environmental assessment for the proposed Rufiji hydropower project\" in Selous Game Reserve World Heritage site, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4615938f5a732aca18a8e9f1911abeea17714caae9c3647983701f310416e53a"}, "2": {"node_id": "bccded62-0675-40a5-93b3-f6d09cb7d17f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf3e4952a456b7142908906f4510cee06cf5d91b4b1bb216510d1460901faaaf"}}, "hash": "79bef302f1722c588fc144e46fb742011983fce96d26e26c97ace7360e8d4b9a", "text": "Likewise, the Rufiji Assessment appears to fall short of national policy guidance.

Key stakeholders were consulted, but there seems to have been little effort to address their concerns. In summary, the Rufiji Assessment falls far short of normal standards of SEA for projects of this magnitude and complexity and neither does it seem to be embedded in a true strategic decision- making process. The Rufiji Assessment therefore does not provide a sound basis for decision-making about the RRPP. It certainly gives no confidence that the RRHP would be the best environmental, social or economic option to address the energy and development needs of Tanzania. 1 Background and approach Scope and context This rapid technical review assesses the \u201cStrategic Environmental Assessment Report for the proposed Rufiji Hydropower Project\u201d, dated April 2019 (\u201cthe Rufiji Assessment\u201d) that relates to the planned Rufiji River Hydropower Project (RRHP). The RRHP comprises a 130m high dam on the Rufiji river at Stiegler\u2019s Gorge, creation of a 100km long, c.914km2 reservoir plus a power plant, a transmission line, workers camps and access roads, all of which will be within the Selous Game Reserve, a natural World Heritage Site. The c. 50,000km2 Selous Game Reserve (SGR) is one of the oldest protected areas in Africa. It is an IUCN category IV protected area2 with some zones (in particular those near Stiegler\u2019s Gorge and in the seasonally flooded wetlands just downstream of the proposed dam) designated for photographic and visual tourism and managed sport hunting in other zones; no other consumptive resource use is allowed. It has been a natural World Heritage Site since 1982 but has been on the List of sites World Heritage in Danger since 2014 due to intensive poaching. In 2018, the threat from the Project was added to the justification for the continued inclusion of SGR on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Selous was inscribed on the World Heritage List under Criterion (ix) - outstanding example of ongoing ecological and biological processes and criterion (x) - the most important and significant natural habitats for conservation of in-situ biodiversity. The review assesses the degree of alignment of the Rufiji Assessment with: 1. Widely-accepted international standards, in particular for environmental assessment of large hydropower projects, as set by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). Assessments meeting these standards are required by major financiers for hydropower projects. 2. Tanzania\u2019s National Guidelines for Strategic Environmental Assessment dated June 2017 (URT 2017). 3. IUCN guidance on environmental assessment in World Heritage sites. Documents reviewed This review focuses on review of the following document: \u201cStrategic Environmental Assessment Report for the Proposed Rufiji Hydropower Project\u201d prepared by Tanzania Electricity Supply Company (TANESCO) Limited, and submitted to the Director of Environment, Division of Environment, Vice President\u2019s Office, April 2019 (URT 2019). The review also draws upon available scientific and third-party literature, where necessary (as cited). Benchmarks for the review Much national and international guidance exists on good practice in Strategic Environmental Assessment and safeguards for large hydropower projects. The most widely-accepted standards and guidance for SEA are those published by OECD (2006) and UNEP (Abaza et al. 2004). Likewise, a wealth of guidance has been published on safeguards for large hydropower.

Table 1 : High-level review of the Rufiji Assessment against the most relevant principles in widely-accepted international SEA guidance and hydropower environmental assessment guidance Principle Source* Review findings Establish clear goals OECD, UNEP, WCD \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment includes nine objectives (pp 5-6), which are quite clear and broadly appropriate. However, these objectives are not then used systematically as a basis for discriminating between alternatives in the rest of the Assessment. Early consideration in order to identify the most appropriate approach to meet objectives and to avoid impacts through good site selection and Project design IFC, UNEP, WCD \uf0b7 Any SEA should, by definition, precede EIA for any specific Project for which it aims to aid decision- making. The Rufiji Assessment was conducted after EIA and late in the decision-making process, as a contract has been signed for construction and site preparation has already begun. The Rufiji Assessment is therefore not part of a credible strategic decision-making process. Be integrated with existing policy and planning structures OECD \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment has a chapter reviewing a variety of national policies and frameworks, but in most cases does not explicitly assess the degree of alignment with these policies and frameworks. 3 Principle Source* Review findings \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment does not refer to any national or regional conservation action plans nor evaluate how the Rufiji Project would affect them. \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment does not assess or demonstrate alignment with the General Management Plan for SGR but instead implies that the General Management Plan would require substantial revision in the light of RRHP impacts. No justification is provided for this assessment. Be flexible, iterative and customised to context OECD, UNEP \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment seems to have been conducted through a rapid, linear process, rather than informing iterative changes in design. \uf0b7 The RRHP is highlighted as being a national-level project, and most of its power will be exported beyond the Rufiji basin. Given this context, it is inappropriate to restrict the Assessment scope to the basin level (particularly when considering alternatives). Comprehensively analyse the potential impacts and risks of the Project IFC, OECD, URT, UNEP, WCD \uf0b7 In general, the Rufiji Assessment is based on very limited underpinning data and frequently does not even attempt to provide a plausible justification for claims that are made. This applies for example to very significant claims about the potential consequences of negative impacts (e.g., the claim that the reservoir would result in \u201ca significant positive change for the benefit of wildlife in the SGR\u201d; page 98) and about potential positive benefits (e.g., the claim that the RRHP may have a positive impact on livelihoods in the Rufiji delta, page 81, or the claim that the reservoir will enhance, rather than damage, tourism potential, page 96). Without robust and objective underlying data, these claims are speculative wishful thinking, and do not contribute to a comprehensive analysis of impacts and risks. \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment focuses on positive Project impacts (e.g., Table 1), with limited, incomplete and apparently inappropriate consideration of potential negative Project impacts.

However, changes in fish movements are only ranked at a level of 2 of 5 (Table 7.1), owing to inappropriate scoring of the extent, duration and reversibility of such changes (even ignoring the potential magnitude of this impact). \uf0b7 Some assessments are factually or scientifically incorrect. For example, the Rufiji Assessment considers there to be highly significant positive changes to aquatic habitats in the reservoir area as a result of the Project. The justification for this unlikely statement (p 98) is based on an incorrect understanding of aquatic ecology and biodiversity conservation \u2013 loss of native habitat (a stretch of river) and replacement with unnatural habitat (a reservoir) is usually significantly negative for biodiversity conservation, particularly in the tropics (e.g., Turgeon et al. 2019). This is particularly true for reservoir stratification, which is well documented to cause major in-reservoir and downstream impacts to aquatic biodiversity (as has long been identified as a risk for a reservoir in this location: e.g., Mwalyosi 1988). \uf0b7 Despite the proposed Project being in a natural World Heritage Site, there is no clear attempt to assess impacts on the Site\u2019s Outstanding Universal Value, an issue also identified with the Project EIA (IUCN 2019). 5 Principle Source* Review findings \uf0b7 Where impacts are quantified, the scale of analysis is inappropriate and misleading. For example the Rufiji Assessment repeats the statement that the RRHP reservoir will flood only 1.8% of the SGR, whereas the proportional impact on riverine vegetation and on the Rufiji River will be vastly greater. Comprehensively analyse the potential impacts and opportunities of 1) alternative Project designs and 2) alternative projects to achieve the same objective IFC, OECD, URT, UNEP, WCD \uf0b7 There is no assessment of alternative Project designs, e.g. reducing the reservoir size. \uf0b7 The relative impacts of alternative projects are only cursorily assessed, whereas such material usually represents the majority of an SEA. \uf0b7 In particular, non-hydropower energy generation alternatives are dismissed solely on economic grounds, without consideration of any potential for them to have lower environmental/social impacts than hydropower, or indeed to have potentially greater benefits. In addition, the potential economic costs of RRHP are not considered. \uf0b7 It is stated that \u201c\u2026there are a number of potential sites for hydropower plants in Tanzania\u2026\u201d, but no assessment is made to compare relative costs and benefits of these alternatives. \uf0b7 No consideration is given to demand-side management or improvements of existing infrastructure as any part of an alternative option to the Rufiji Project. \uf0b7 A significant part of the alternatives analysis section (pp 85-86) is given not to discussion of Project alternatives but to challenges the Project is likely to face from water shortages. Provide explicit justification for the selection of preferred options and for the acceptance of significant trade-offs IFC, OECD, UNEP, WCD \uf0b7 A no-power option is rejected with good justification. \uf0b7 However, extremely limited justification is given for the selection of the preferred option against any realistic alternatives. For example, the Rufiji Assessment states that \u201c\u2026there are a number of potential sites for hydropower plants in Tanzania, [for some of] which feasibility and detailed planning have been conducted\u2026\u201d and identifies a few very brief justifications for selecting the RRHP 6 Principle Source* Review findings (pp 83-84), but does not assess whether a set of other hydropower (and/or other electricity generation) projects could meet or exceed these justifications while generating similar electricity capacity and other benefits. \uf0b7 There is no risk assessment to identify the relative risks of attempting to reach all goals via this single Project, versus multiple smaller options. The latter may potentially be more expensive, but considerably less risky. \uf0b7 Trade-offs (i.e., negative impacts and economic costs of developing Rufiji) are given limited attention in the Assessment, let alone evaluated, accepted or justified.

This is also required by Tanzania\u2019s National SEA Guidelines (e.g., Table 2 in URT 2017). However, while cumulative impacts are mentioned in the 7 Principle Source* Review findings Rufiji Assessment, their assessment (e.g., Table 7.3) focuses on impacts which may accumulate over time (an incorrect understanding of the meaning of cumulative impacts in environmental assessment) rather than assessment of this Project in the context of other projects/actions (as is correctly identified as a need in the Assessment ToR on p 155). This is therefore a major gap compared to international good practice guidance and recent Tanzanian national policy. Involve key stakeholders and encourage public involvement IFC, OECD, URT, UNEP, WCD \uf0b7 A range of key stakeholders appears to have been consulted during development of the Rufiji Assessment, but 1) the timeline (8th January through 1st February 2019) is incredibly short for meaningful consultation for a project of such a scale and complexity, 2) there are no apparent responses to many significant stakeholder concerns that were raised (but have been left ungrouped and un-assessed in Appendix V), and 3) it does not appear that the final Rufiji Assessment has been shared with stakeholders for review. \uf0b7 It appears that stakeholder comments were sought only on the Rufiji project, rather than on a range of potential project options as is appropriate to an SEA. \uf0b7 Broader public involvement does not appear to have been sought, despite this being requested in the Assessment ToR (pp 148-149) and despite the potential for \u201c\u2026significant negative impacts on the livelihoods of many thousands or tens of thousands of people dependent on the downstream Rufiji River\u201d (IUCN 2019). \uf0b7 The status and role of the World Heritage Committee and IUCN (which has a formal Advisory Body role under the World Heritage Convention) as stakeholders are both downplayed and no real attention or response is given to the concerns communicated repeatedly by either of these bodies, for example in WHC decisions 36 COM 7B.5 of 2012, 41 COM 7A.17 of 2017and 42 COM 7A.56 of 2018, and in the 2014 and 2017 IUCN Conservation Outlook Assessments for SGR. 8 Principle Source* Review findings \uf0b7 The consultation took place in a context where a decision to proceed with the RRHP had already been taken and where senior members of government reportedly stated that individuals opposing the project would be jailed. However, the consultation does not appear to have taken any special measures to allow stakeholders to freely express their concerns and opinions (e.g., allowing anonymous submission of comments). It is therefore doubtful whether the full range and strength of concerns could plausibly have been identified. Include an effective, preferably independent, quality assurance system OECD \uf0b7 The Project developer contracted Sokoine University of Agriculture as consultants to conduct the Rufiji Assessment. However, there is no apparent independent review or assurance mechanism. Be transparent throughout the process, and communicate the results OECD \uf0b7 The quality of the core impact assessment (Table 7.1) is difficult to assess, as environmental impact scores are not defined (e.g., what are level 1 vs. 2 spatial aspects?) but (as outlined above) many scores seem inappropriate. * Principles adapted from: (IFC 2018a); (OECD 2006); URT (2019); UNEP (Abaza et al. 2004); (WCD 2000).

Alignment with IUCN\u2019s World Heritage Advice Note on Environmental Assessment Table 4 (below) uses the assessment presented above (Table 2) to summarise the degree of alignment of the Rufiji SEA with the principles of IUCN's World Heritage Advice Note on Environmental Assessment. Alignment is weak in most areas. 11 Table 4: Review against the principles of IUCN's World Heritage Advice Note on Environmental Assessment. For further details please see Table 1 above. Principle Review findings 1: Rigorous environmental assessment early in decision-making process \u2022 The SEA has too many gaps and flaws to be considered rigorous. It has also not been conducted early in the decision- making process, as it was produced subsequent to the Rufiji EIA and after a contract was awarded and works had begun. 2: Appropriate experts \u2022 An appropriate set of stakeholders was consulted. However, insufficient information is provided to assess whether the individual experts consulted had appropriate World Heritage, protected area and biodiversity knowledge. 3: Impacts on OUV assessed, including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts \u2022 The impact assessment ranking is not fully defined, and thus not transparent or repeatable. Few data are presented to justify impact rankings, which consistently appear too high for positive impacts in relation to negative impacts, and at times are demonstrably incorrect. \u2022 Assessment of impacts is at an inappropriately low level of resolution. Significant sources of secondary data do not seem to have been used (or not used to an appropriate extent), and primary data is very limited. \u2022 Impacts on OUV are assessed, but not at an appropriate level of resolution: impacts to individual features contributing to the OUV are rarely assessed individually; nor are they quantified.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db185c87-6cc1-4ae1-ad10-264af75e568e": {"__data__": {"id_": "db185c87-6cc1-4ae1-ad10-264af75e568e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Independent technical review of the \"Strategic environmental assessment for the proposed Rufiji hydropower project\" in Selous Game Reserve World Heritage site, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73eb4e052f1f239c88ff0472d915a627517a0074cb2806cc83f31cc15b593a06"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cb27ab6-a026-4bf0-84ba-5c56b05e7893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "459565217d04525172adda335035345700158a9ac2c2913351254cffa2bd2588"}}, "hash": "3212d6800bcd226010cb5f19eb421a4a69816df13a8ea6b7e47ce0a9c6731df7", "text": "\u2022 Readily available published assessments of potential impacts have been ignored, and the following major potential impact types are not assessed at all: the effect of a disrupted flood regime on fisheries and wildlife, the barrier effect of the 100km long reservoir for mobile terrestrial species, impacts of downstream erosion (scouring etc) and all indirect impacts (e.g., induced access and in-migration which can lead to increased poaching for example). \u2022 The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5dc10fb-3ba8-40bb-a96a-d8dbac5e5a88": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5dc10fb-3ba8-40bb-a96a-d8dbac5e5a88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Independent technical review of the \"Strategic environmental assessment for the proposed Rufiji hydropower project\" in Selous Game Reserve World Heritage site, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/independent-technical-review-strategic-environmental-assessment-proposed", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60c92479abaae9070b887e8e855680a06eea7f2d244ae76e6487091b65e927fb"}}, "hash": "60c92479abaae9070b887e8e855680a06eea7f2d244ae76e6487091b65e927fb", "text": "potential economic costs of the RRHP (for example to upstream fisheries or downstream farmers) have not been considered. \u2022 There is no assessment of cumulative impacts of the Rufiji Project alongside the many other developments occurring in the Rufiji basin, many of which will clearly contribute to cumulative impacts, for example upstream hydropower 12 Principle Review findings projects. Assessment of cumulative impacts is critical to SEA so this is a major gap. 4: Analysis of alternatives \u2022 Analysis of alternative scenarios is the core function of most SEAs. In the Rufiji Assessment, analysis of either alternative project designs or alternative scenarios is cursory. It is stated that a number of alternative hydropower projects exist, but barely any further discussion or assessment is given. Non- hydropower electricity generation alternatives are dismissed solely on economic grounds, without consideration of relative environmental and social costs/benefits. No consideration is given to demand side management or improvements to existing infrastructure. 5: Mitigation Hierarchy \u2022 SEA should focus on the avoidance stage of the mitigation hierarchy, by assessment of alternative projects and selection of those which have the highest benefit: cost ratio (in economic, environmental and social terms). However, the Rufiji Assessment pays only cursory attention to the economics of alternative projects, and does not assess their relative environmental and social impacts at all. \u2022 SEA can also inform the minimisation stage of the mitigation hierarchy, by evaluation of alternative project designs, but the Rufiji Assessment does not conduct such an evaluation. \u2022 Mitigation measures are discussed for some impacts of the RRHP, but many other important impacts remain unmitigated, including the barrier effects of the dam for fish and of the 100km-long reservoir for mobile terrestrial species, in-direct impacts such as increased poaching due to induced access, impacts on upstream fisheries etc. Many of the mitigation measures proposed are speculative and unlikely to be effective (see IUCN 2019 for details). 6: Chapter on World Heritage with clear conclusions about impacts on OUVs \u2022 A small section on World Heritage status is provided within the chapter on policy, legal and institutional frameworks. However, the conclusions about impacts on OUVs are based on a biased and incomplete impact assessment and focus on highlighting potential positive impacts (e.g., on hippopotamus) without discussion of negative impacts. \u2022 Even the most fundamental impacts on OUV are ignored or not ranked as significant, such as disruption of the dynamic flood regime that is the basis for World Heritage listing under criterion (ix), and the loss of a significant land area for many 13 Principle Review findings of the species for which the site is listed under criterion (x). There is no discussion of the impacts on the integrity of the property (including ecological function and connectivity and unimpeded ecological and evolutionary processes). \u2022 The chapter does not clearly describe the responsibilities and obligations of the United Republic of Tanzania as a State Party to the World Heritage Convention. \u2022 The clearly, publicly stated and very specific concerns of the World Heritage Committee and of IUCN in their role of formal Advisory Body to the convention3 are neither acknowledged nor addressed. 7: Public disclosure and thorough public consultation \u2022 No information on public disclosure is available, so this cannot be assessed. \u2022 There does not appear to have been any effort at public consultation beyond selected stakeholders. \u2022 The stakeholder concerns that were raised are not addressed. \u2022 Stakeholders do not seem to have had the opportunity to comment on the draft document. 8: Environmental Management Plan \u2022 A strategic environmental management framework is presented but details of how it will be implemented, including the scope of required operational management plans and how it will be funded, is not provided. Degree to which the Rufiji Assessment fulfils the criteria of a Strategic Environmental Assessment There are varying definitions of Strategic Environmental Assessment. In essence, SEA is an earlier- stage, broader-scale, higher-level way of assessing options for achieving development goals than a project-focused Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). SEA is a decision-making support tool, that is implemented before the decision to proceed with a particular project or project variant is made. \uf0b7 3 For example in WHC decisions 36 COM 7B.5 of 2012, 41 COM 7A.17 of 2017and 42 COM 7A.56 of 2018, and in the 2014 and 2017 IUCN Conservation Outlook Assessments for SGR. 14 Table 5 (below), summarises the key differences between SEA and EIA (following OECD 2006) and assess the degree to which the Rufiji Assessment represents an SEA. In almost every way, the Rufiji \u201cSEA\u201d (TANESCO 2019) is closer to representing an EIA than an SEA.

The core failure of the Assessment is to focus on justifying the Rufiji project, without looking broadly at the economic, environmental and social costs, benefits and risks of developing the Rufiji project versus a range of other potential project alternatives for meeting the stated objectives and policy goals. Table 5: Assessment of alignment of the Rufiji \u201cSEA\u201d (TANESCO 2019) with definitions of EIA and SEA (OECD 2006) EIA SEA Rufiji \u201cSEA\u201d Applied to specific and relatively short-term (life- cycle) projects and their specifications. Applied to policies, plans and programmes with a broad and long-term strategic perspective. EIA-level: firmly focused on the Rufiji project, with almost no consideration of alternative options to meet defined policy goals. Takes place at early stage of project planning once parameters are set. Ideally, takes place at an early stage in strategic planning. Below EIA-level: developed at a late stage of project planning after a decision was made, a contract signed and works begun. Considers limited range of project alternatives. Considers a broad range of alternative scenarios. Insufficient for SEA-level: considers a range of project alternatives, but so briefly as to represent only a token gesture (only three pages of a > 200-page document). This is a core part of an SEA and therefore is a major gap. Usually prepared and/or funded by the project proponents. Conducted independently of any specific project proponent. EIA-level: funded by project proponent and prepared by proponent\u2019s consultants. Focus on obtaining project permission, and rarely with feedback to policy, plan or programme consideration. Focus on decision on policy, plan and programme implications for future lower- level decisions. EIA-level: focuses on justifying Rufiji project rather than consideration of range of alternatives to achieve policy goals. Well-defined, linear process with clear beginning and end (e.g., from feasibility to project approval). Multi-stage, iterative process with feedback loops. EIA-level: simple linear process. 15 EIA SEA Rufiji \u201cSEA\u201d Emphasis on mitigating environmental and social impacts of a specific project, but with identification of some project opportunities, offsets, etc. Emphasis on meeting balanced environmental, social and economic objectives in policies, plans and programmes. Includes identifying macro-level development outcomes. EIA-level: emphasis firmly on assessing impacts of the Rufiji project, with no consideration of potential value of project alternatives in meeting policy goals. Limited review of cumulative impacts, often limited to phases of a specific project. Does not cover regional-scale developments or multiple projects. Inherently incorporates consideration of cumulative impacts. Below EIA-level: no assessment of cumulative impacts of multiple projects, sectors and wider developments This is a core part of an SEA and therefore is a major gap. Conclusions The analyses documented in the previous sections identify many significant and substantial gaps. The Rufiji Assessment falls fundamentally short of both international and national guidance for SEA. This is of particularly serious concern, given the scale and complexity of this Project, its location in a globally-important natural World Heritage Site, and the significance of the Project\u2019s potential environmental and social impacts. In particular: \uf0b7 The Rufiji Assessment is not clearly embedded in a strategic decision-making process; rather it seems more like an attempt to justify a decision that has already been made; \uf0b7 The cumulative impacts of the Project and other landscape developments are not assessed; \uf0b7 Assessment of project alternatives \u2013 whether hydropower or other energy production \u2013 forms the bulk of most SEAs, but is given extremely cursory attention in this Assessment; \uf0b7 The environmental and social benefits and costs of project alternatives are not outlined and assessed; neither is there a robust assessment of the economic viability of the RRHP; \uf0b7 There does not appear to have been any open public consultation. Selected stakeholders were consulted, but there seems to have been little effort to address their concerns. The Rufiji Assessment cannot be considered an SEA; in most ways, is closer to representing an EIA than an SEA.

It certainly gives no confidence that the RRHP would be the best environmental, social or economic option to address the energy and development needs of Tanzania. 17 References Abaza, H., Bisset, R. & Sadler, B.

Free the Bears works with governments and non-governmental partners to build, manage and sustain bear sanctuaries and field programmes aimed at ending the suffering of captive bears whilst protecting wild bears across Southeast Asia and India. As part of its mission to protect, preserve and enrich the lives of bears throughout the world Free the Bears has supported the rescue of over 900 bears and currently provides care for over 200 bears in Southeast Asia, including 80 rescued sun bears in the Cambodian Bear Sanctuary, the world\u2019s largest sanctuary for sun bears. The IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group (BSG) is one of more than 140 Specialist Groups established by the Species Survival Commission (SSC), within the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The goal of the BSG is to promote the conservation of bears and their natural habitats across their distribution worldwide. The BSG is comprised of ~180 members including professional biologists and conservationists from governments, non- governmental organisations (NGOs), universities, museums, zoos and other captive facilities. The BSG is not an advocacy or animal welfare organisation. The purpose of the BSG is to pursue science-based conservation of bears. The IUCN SSC Conservation Planning Specialist Group (CPSG) is a global network of conservation professionals dedicated to saving threatened species by increasing the effectiveness of conservation efforts worldwide. For over 30 years, CPSG has accomplished this using scientifically sound, collaborative planning processes that bring together people with diverse perspectives and knowledge to catalyse positive conservation change.

The IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC) is a global network of over 8,500 experts working together to halt the decline in biodiversity and ensuring that SSC is an unmatched source of information and advice to influence conservation outcomes. In addition to assessing the status of species across the globe and the drivers of biodiversity loss, taxa-specific Specialist Groups within the SSC work to identify the conservation actions required to reduce or prevent species extinctions. Most conservation actions occur at a local or country level, but for species with wide geographical ranges, the strategic design and coordination of actions must occur at a range-wide scale. Strategic conservation planning is a key priority for the SSC as it allows us to invest our limited resources wisely for the greatest impact. The Conservation Planning Specialist Group (CPSG) has a mandate to increase the quantity and effectiveness of planning across the SSC network, which we also see as helping to deliver on Target 12 (on preventing the extinction of threatened species) of the Convention on Biological Diversity. By taking a collaborative, inclusive and science-based approach to planning, we can deliver the most effective conservation action to protect future generations of threatened species. The challenge is to ensure that conservation planning translates into action. Participation of all relevant stakeholders \u2013\u2013 government, academia, civil society and the private sector \u2013\u2013 is key to achieving successful conservation outcomes. This is of particular importance for species whose range spans across several countries, where the threats, socio-economic factors, and the political context vary. Moreover, the inclusion of diverse stakeholders in the planning process is more likely to yield innovative and workable ideas, as well as support during implementation. Southeast Asia is a recognised hotspot for species declines. The sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) is an endemic, forest-dependent umbrella species of Southeast Asia, whose populations are under increasing threats from forest loss and poaching: conservation strategies to aid this species are likely to benefit many others in the region. Hence, the development of a conservation action plan for sun bears, detailed here, should be relevant to many conservation activities in the region. This plan was developed following the 1st International Symposium on Sun Bear Conservation & Management, and a subsequent action planning workshop, facilitated by the CPSG in collaboration with the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group. The symposium and planning workshop brought together sun bear experts, field researchers, conservationists and government representatives from throughout the sun bear\u2019s range and beyond, to share the latest information on this threatened species, and to determine which actions are most urgently needed and most likely to achieve its long-term conservation. The result of those efforts is a comprehensive strategy that will guide conservation of this species throughout the next ten years. In a world where resources for conservation are severely limited, creative and intelligent strategies will determine our success in averting biodiversity loss. I encourage all responsible government agencies, researchers, donors and practitioners to examine the recommended actions summarised in this document and put them to practice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "05765cb6-3575-48f0-a12f-c7da00ee27c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "05765cb6-3575-48f0-a12f-c7da00ee27c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e58156254902b4fcaf00827567ae5da44464859516c39b4886cd717752ff1933"}, "2": {"node_id": "756881e5-e8cc-4743-adf0-3fab063b57c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b800f4af194015e4c1dba8f4d603dbb6c61130c2d9788456573369e51af4f52"}}, "hash": "5bd5bd7fc48cd9ffb5d140748811fedd7dcebf33399e52299e12bd6ab279367f", "text": "5iv AAF Animals Asia Foundation ASEAN Association of Southeast Asian Nations AZA Association of Zoos and Aquariums, North America BOS Bornean Orangutan Survival BSBCC Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre BSG Bear Specialist Group (IUCN SSC) CIFOR Center for International Forestry Research CITES Convention on International Trade in Endangered Spe- cies of Wild Fauna and Flora CPSG Conservation Planning Specialist Group (IUCN SSC) CZA Central Zoo Authority, India DNA Deoxyribonucleic acid EAZA European Association of Zoos & Aquaria EIA Environmental Investigation Agency ENV", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c42ba53f-bf1f-4b07-b19d-842b2cf355dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "c42ba53f-bf1f-4b07-b19d-842b2cf355dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f60c37360e41f276342d03210b712e59522afdabb8a16d0cedafec3e868ffbdd"}, "3": {"node_id": "02352794-5fb3-4977-8388-50d1e910aabb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c2b0df3025c2310d71b804db791e0cbc2372053018901ac895aa5574cc077d1"}}, "hash": "fb60397a919dbb88ae971d97d8349749e725538b8ab910704fe2470cae8dfaf5", "text": "Education for Nature-Vietnam FSC Forest Stewardship Council FTB Free the Bears GC-MS Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry GFW Global Forest Watch GIZ Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammen- arbeit HCV High Conservation Value (Forest) ID Indonesia/Republic of Indonesia IN India/Republic of India ISPO Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil IUCN International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN SSC IUCN Species Survival Commission IWT Illegal Wildlife Trade JAZA Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquaria KH Cambodia/Kingdom of Cambodia KPH Kesatuan Pengelolaan Hutan -

It is not coincidental that four of these threatened species range into the tropics, where the threats are particularly severe. The chief threats to bears in the tropics include forest clearing and conversion, road building, poaching, and conflict with people. These threats are amplified because they act synergistically: for example, roads and shrinking forest patches provide greater access to poachers; additionally, diminished or degraded habitat reduces food availability for bears and increases the interface with humans and agriculture, which together prompt bears to seek human-related foods and increase their likelihood of being killed as a consequence. Where should we start in addressing these threats? Which are most consequential, which are most practical to solve, and what process should we use to set priorities for the conservation of these species? What do we want the future to look like? Here we answer these questions for the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus). This species has been the focus of only a handful of studies in the wild \u2013\u2013 beginning just 20 years ago \u2013\u2013 and has attracted little world attention in terms of its conservation, despite being a charismatic bear. Yet it is believed to be in steep decline in many parts of its range due to loss, degradation and fragmentation of its forested habitat, combined with direct", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dffab4df-eb9f-490c-887b-12836203fbb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "dffab4df-eb9f-490c-887b-12836203fbb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0c91474820583a1e449553fd6b149880f1da90e3b6e5db594eeec6d0eb30b00"}, "3": {"node_id": "57f97c98-056d-432c-a94f-661790218c8e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50b4df62bd9adb2337fc2e1dc986a8409b83a13f28a05dc3054dc5fc97fab7f2"}}, "hash": "5a75213a14282cf7008c306e40ef53b4684ff81adabe6c4848a1ff2109814b8c", "text": "killing. The species ranges only through Southeast Asia, in 10 or 11 countries, from northeastern India east to Vietnam, and south through the Malaysian Peninsula and into Sumatra and Borneo. Within this range there are still many areas with suitable habitat where its existence is uncertain; it was thought to be extirpated in Bangladesh, but was recently rediscovered in a small patch in the south; it is unknown whether any populations persist in southern China. Not only is the status uncertain, but many looming questions about the main drivers of this species\u2019 decline remain unanswered or confusing. This obviously complicates formulation of a conservation strategy. For example, whereas some studies have indicated that sun bears are reliant on primary forest, a number of recent camera trapping studies (not directed at sun bears) have detected them at relatively high rates in secondary (regenerating) forests. In the southern parts of their range, widespread forest conversion to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) has been a paramount concern. Whereas these expansive plantations have clear adverse effects on sun bears insofar as reduced availability of useable space, shade, cover, and food diversity, it has been shown that bears consuming abundant oil palm fruits along plantation edges are often atypically heavy; conversely, in these open areas, they are also more vulnerable to being killed by people. Some direct killing of sun bears may occur incidentally while hunters are seeking other species, with guns or snares, but targeted killing also occurs. Sun bear cubs are sold as pets, and the gallbladder/bile of this species is a valuable commodity that is illegally traded on a global scale. Participants in the 1st International Symposium on Sun Bear Conservation & Management, held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from the 4th \u2013 6th September 2017. Credit: Free the Bears/Lim Thona 1 Ironically, though, whereas Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus) possess a unique compound in the bile with proven medicinal benefits for humans, sun bear bile is dominated by a different bile acid, which is not unique to bears. Further complicating these issues is the fact that monitoring of sun bear populations is almost nonexistent. A few efforts have been made to assess density, relative density, or presence/absence from camera trapping, sign surveys, and interviews of local people. But no real monitoring programme has been implemented. Therefore, evaluations of population trend have generally been gleaned from expert opinions and interviews with local people, or a subjective assessment of the threats and how they must be affecting the bears. Consequently, even if conservation programmes were implemented, it would be difficult to ascertain their effectiveness with such sparse baseline data. Process of Plan Development With this as a backdrop, the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group, Free the Bears, and TRAFFIC Southeast Asia organised the 1st International Symposium on Sun Bear Conservation & Management to gather the collective knowledge and opinions from sun bear experts relevant to the conservation of this species. The 3-day symposium, which was held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, September 4\u20136, 2017, brought together 100 delegates from over 50 organisations, including researchers in the field (although there are very few), conservationists, people working in captive care centres with sun bears, and governmental representatives. Building on the work from the Symposium, 25 delegates worked collaboratively over the following 2 days to draft a 10-year range-wide conservation action plan. In accordance with IUCN guidelines, as many country-specific representatives were included in this process as possible, within budgetary and logistical constraints. Moreover, we followed the One Plan Approach of the IUCN SSC Conservation Planning Specialist Group (CPSG) in terms of integrating in situ and ex situ components. A small team of editors, with later input from the wider group of symposium participants, worked for over a year to develop the final document. The document includes an extensive but not exhaustive status review. This is meant to provide justification for the conservation actions, including research needs, especially where information is lacking or conflicting.

The plan details 19 objectives and 63 actions aimed at attaining 5 overarching goals: (1) eliminating illegal exploitation; (2) protecting and restoring habitats and populations; (3) devising and employing reliable monitoring methods; (4) maximising ex situ contributions to conservation; and (5) increasing cross-sectoral support and collaboration for sun bear conservation. Many of the objectives (14) involve reviewing, compil- ing, and interpreting existing data, or conducting re- search to obtain new data (7), so as to better understand the issues and the likelihood of success of the possible solutions. Alongside filling these knowledge gaps, the plan proposes a series of direct actions (6), prioritisation of actions (4), or initiatives to motivate actions by oth- ers (15). Each action in the plan has an associated list of people, organisations, or types of organisations respon- sible for carrying it out, a general timeline, a list of what we already have to aid in performing the action and what we need, and indicators of progress. Implementation of the Plan Implementation of this plan over the next ten years is the initial step in reaching the long-term vision for the conservation of this species. The plan will be coordinated by a Sun Bear Action Plan Implementation Task Force, which will be housed under the Sun Bear Expert Team of the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group. The task force will comprise both issue (goal)-based and range-country focal points who will serve as contacts for anyone wishing to conduct or assist with recommended actions. The Task Force will have an appointed coordinator, supported for the first two years by Free the Bears. This is the first global conservation action plan for a terrestrial species of bear. Inevitably, implementation of this plan will require adoption by range countries, and some range countries may develop companion country- specific plans. Some countries in Asia have already adopted country-specific conservation action plans for other species of bears (Taiwan and India, both in 2012), but thus far these have spurred few actual actions. It is our hope that by starting globally, with a comprehensive plan, and with the commitment of a dedicated group to implement this plan, we can coordinate a set of actions that will drastically improve the status of this species as well as our understanding of it.

The first field studies on this species were only started in 1997. In part, this can be attributed to the relative difficulty in conducting ecological field research on this rather rare and elusive forest-dwelling species, which lives in areas that are tough to work in and often hard to get to. Many field techniques used for other bear species have shown limited success with sun bears because they are hard to capture (they are wary of traps and the remoteness of field sites restricts safe placement of traps), they are difficult to radio-collar, and no reliable technique has yet been developed to snag their short hair (for DNA-based population estimates). Sign surveys have been confounded because much of their range overlaps with Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus), and often the sign of these two species cannot be reliably distinguished (unless very fresh). Although sign transects can be used to quickly confirm sun bear presence in the Sundaic part of their range (i.e., Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and Sumatra), where other bear species do not occur. Sun bears are rarely seen, and even then are confused with Asiatic black bears, so interviews with local people have rarely yielded definitive information. Recently, camera-trapping has provided more reliable information on presence (sometimes in places they were thought to have been extirpated), occupancy, density, habitat selection, response to human activities, and use of plantations. However, because this species is rarely the direct focus of camera trapping studies, the data are commonly \u201cby-catch\u201d results from studies of more high-profile species, such as tigers (Panthera tigris) and elephants (Elephas maximus). Likewise, conservation efforts for sun bears often tend to derive as by-products of initiatives directed primarily at these other species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8adc766-6906-4c4b-83fd-3cfcba51e740": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8adc766-6906-4c4b-83fd-3cfcba51e740", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2472b80747b2c8fecd0e6dedf9d3392262bd31c83942932ff9538224ba1308ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "b9bc8db9-b746-401a-8a82-50f8d363e28f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d659133564492517cb9c9ff356877e023ccfb8defe992822766e3e23045edf9"}}, "hash": "9d9ca1b64e67c08b864fc5c9c0f231caaf662909022ae877077ff175d8c4f513", "text": "In September 2017, sun bears were front and centre when one hundred researchers, conservationists, government representatives, population managers, and managers of captive facilities from across the globe convened in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for the 1st International Symposium on Sun Bear Conservation & Management.

Although sun bears remain the least-studied bear species, research and conservation efforts have advanced greatly in the past few years and the symposium achieved what would have been inconceivable ten years ago: over 30 presentations and more than 20 hour-long panel discussions and workshop sessions dedicated solely to the conservation and management of sun bears. A diverse array of topics was covered, including: updates to the IUCN Red List Assessment and range map; genetic analyses; assessing wild sun bear populations; health and welfare; thermoregulation and metabolic rates in captive sun bears; trade and use of sun bears in traditional medicine; education and behaviour change; status review and threat assessment of ex situ sun bear populations; and habitat requirements of in situ populations. Among the participants were representatives from, or those knowledgeable about, all sun bear range states, except China, which has just one recent record of an individual barely over the border from Myanmar (Li et al. 2017). Sixty percent of participants are currently involved in sun bear conservation projects, while 43% are involved in sun bear research. Participants represented both in situ and ex situ sun bear populations and were affiliated with several international conservation and management bodies, including: the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group (BSG); BSG Sun Bear Expert Team; BSG Captive Bears Expert Team; regional zoological associations (EAZA, AZA and ZAA); and regional Bear Taxon Advisory Groups. INTRODUCTION Rescued sun bear at the Cambodian Bear Sanctuary. Credit: Free the Bears SECTION 1 4 The symposium was designed to capture the collective knowledge and expertise of those in attendance in order to inform the development of this conservation strategy. A two-day conservation planning workshop was held immediately after the symposium, facilitated by the IUCN SSC Conservation Planning Specialist Group (CPSG). The planning process followed the CPSG\u2019s One Plan Approach, which promotes integrated in situ and ex situ species conservation planning. The approach considers all populations of the species, inside and outside their natural range, under all conditions of management, and engages all responsible parties from the very start of any species conservation planning process (Byers et al. 2013). The 25 participants of the planning workshop were divided into thematic working groups tasked with developing conservation actions related to: Trade and consumption; Habitat protection and improvement; Population monitoring; Ex situ management; and cross- sector collaboration. First, each group listed key threats related to their topic, which were informed by the discussions during the symposium. Then, each group made a list of objectives that would reduce these threats, over the next 5\u201310 years. Finally, specific actions required to achieve the objectives were identified. For each action, working groups detailed what we had available to start, what we still needed, and who would likely do the work. Results of the planning workshop were extensively fleshed out to create a draft document, which underwent a series of reviews and editing over several months, first by a core editing team, then each themed section was reviewed by the members of the relevant working group, and finally the draft action plan was reviewed by participants of the symposium plus other sun bear biologists and conservationists who were unable to attend the symposium. This action plan for sun bears is the first range- wide conservation action plan for any of the world\u2019s terrestrial bear species. It is intended to guide targeted conservation interventions, as recommended by the IUCN Species Survival Commission, and serve as a guide for development of national or local sun bear conservation action plans. Despite the diversity of threats, and the variety of opinions and solutions that existed amongst participants, everyone was united by a common desire to see the sun bear survive and thrive in its natural environment as an important part of the forest ecosystem. In addition to recommended actions, this document contains comprehensive information on the status of and threats to in situ and ex situ sun bear populations, details of national focal points for the implementation of the action plan, and a map of current sun bear-related projects. It is intended to be used as a freely available resource and reference document for all those interested in the conservation of sun bears. Audience The sun bear\u2019s range stretches across eleven countries. Sun bears live in a host of different protected areas, in forested areas under varying management levels outside protected areas, and along the borders of plantations. It was not possible to involve all relevant local stakeholders (e.g., all national governments, protected area staff, industry representatives, non- governmental organisations, community groups, ex situ facility representatives) in the planning workshop.

The Focal Points will serve as contacts for anyone conducting or wishing to conduct recommended actions within range states or working group themes. The Focal Points will report annually to the Action Plan Implementation Coordinator for the duration of the action plan (2019 \u2013 2028). The Implementation Coordinator will be recruited from within the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group\u2019s Sun Bear Expert Team which has a mandate to coordinate global sun bear conservation. The coordinator will serve a term coinciding with that of the Specialist Group membership and will report annually to the Bear Specialist Group Co-chair(s). An implementation progress report will be submitted annually by the Implementation Coordinator for publication in International Bear News, the newsletter of the Bear Specialist Group and the International Association for Bear Research and Management (https:// www.bearbiology.com/publications/iba-newsletter/). The various actions in the plan relate to both wild and captive sun bears and will be implemented by a wide range of people and organisations, including students, university departments and researchers, government departments, and non-government organisations. The Implementation Task Force will act as a central hub for this diverse array of activities, keeping track of current and past projects conducted under the umbrella of the action plan. Individuals and organisations carrying out projects and actions are encouraged to notify and communicate their progress to the Implementation Task Force. The Sun Bear Expert Team has representatives in most sun bear range countries, and these representatives along with other Focal Points will be responsible for monitoring and maintaining communication with projects occurring in their respective countries.

HISTORY & TAXONOMY In 1819, Thomas Stamford Raffles, then Governor- General of Bencoolen, a province in southern Sumatra, received a pet sun bear, purchased for him from a villager. Although these bears were then common on the island, and common as village pets, the species had not yet been described to science. That pet bear became the basis for the first scientific description of the species. \u201cHe was brought up in the nursery with the children; and, when admitted to my table, as was frequently the case, gave proof of his taste by refusing to eat any fruit but mangosteens, or to drink any wine but Champaign\u201d (Raffles 1821). Raffles provided the scientific name Ursus malayanus, but did not suggest a common name other than \u201cBruang\u201d, the local name of the species. Horsfield (1824) provided a fuller description of this species, based on a specimen from Sumatra that Raffles had forwarded to a museum in England. A year later, Horsfield (1825) distinguished what he called the \u201cMalayan bear\u201d from a newly acquired, similar- looking specimen of a \u201cBear from Borneo\u201d. He named this bear Helarctos euryspilus, literally meaning \u201csun bear with wide birthmark\u201d. It is clear from Horsfield\u2019s account that the Helarctos generic name referred to the animal living near the \u201chot sun\u201d of the equator. Hence the common name, sun bear, does not derive (as often thought) from the shape of the mark on the chest, which sometimes looks like a sun, and is distinct from that of the crescent- shaped white marking on the Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus), which in some areas is called the \u201cmoon bear\u201d. Presently only one species of sun bear is recognised, under the name Helarctos malayanus, with the Bornean form considered a subspecies (H. m. euryspilus), having some distinct morphological characteristics (Meijaard 2004). Some taxonomists consider the mono-specific generic name to be erroneous, and have suggested that it should be Ursus. Genetic studies have been insufficient to resolve either the generic name, or specific/ sub-specific name of the Bornean sun bear. 2. MORPHOLOGY & PHYSIOLOGY Sun bear conservation and management is informed by the distinctive morphology and physiology of this species. Sun bears are the smallest extant member of Ursidae, and the Bornean subspecies is generally considered to be smaller than the nominal form. Weights among sun bears also vary by the availability of foods: wild bears with access to oil palm fruits tend to be heavier (Table 1), whereas those subsisting on wild foods during periods of fruiting failure are very thin, and may even die of starvation (Wong et al. 2005, Fredriksson 2012). The heaviest wild sun bears for which there are data were males on the mainland with access to oil palm fruits (average ~75\u201380 kg).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e5ce2f3-bced-4100-9e3c-7843996a31a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e5ce2f3-bced-4100-9e3c-7843996a31a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b7680198d53ed4429c0c9fa17f9849776ee1bc1fa09b0e52fa7dde0e8a1c676"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ba64aed-4269-480f-96ce-fde062a161de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1be107a940e5c2e41fb0dd3cf81800bfd4be7436540b3ccbe0895cdf968f2a11"}}, "hash": "5f9aa129acabab4e1ac045ee238a97ed60b3cec63c520864b1c32593a5e76706", "text": "Males in Borneo consuming only wild foods averaged ~40 kg while Bornean females averaged only ~25 kg when weighed mainly during lean fruiting periods (Table 1).

Weights of these bears recorded throughout the year over the course of 13 years (>5,600 weight measurements) revealed that adult females varied little seasonally, whereas males exhibited a pronounced (but as yet unexplained) fluctuation, with a decline (~12%) during March\u2013May (J.P.

Credit: BSBCC/Seng Yen Wah 11 Morphology of the sun bear skull and teeth is generally consistent with an omnivorous diet. However, among Ursidae, sun bears exhibit a unique combination of a heavily domed skull, short and robust lower jaw, short nose, and low position of the eyes, giving them a stout appearance (Figueirido et al. 2009). Sun bears also have the longest canine teeth relative to skull size among bears; in fact, their canines do not differ in size from those of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) despite their body mass being 5\u201310 times smaller (Christiansen 2008). Sun bears also have an unusually high bite force (Christiansen 2008). The robustness of the sun bear skull and dentition are adaptations for tearing into hard substrates for food, such as logs and termite mounds, and especially stingless bees, whose nests are excavated by chewing through the wood of living trees (Fredriksson 2012). Their exceptionally long tongues (Pastor et al. 2011) is another adaptation for feeding on insects, particularly stingless bees. The hind limb musculature and tendon structure of sun bears is uniquely well-suited for climbing trees (Sasaki et al. 2005), and probably for holding onto the trunk while chewing into the wood. Sun bears inhabit a warm, humid climate, which is characterised by low seasonal and diurnal temperature fluctuations ranging from 23\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C (Fredriksson et al. 2006). They have shorter guard hairs than other bears throughout the year (De and Chakraborty 2006) and do not develop insulative fat layers. However, no data are available regarding their body temperature and metabolic rate. Thermographic measurements obtained in European zoos revealed that the thermoneutral zone of sun bears lies between 24\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C (Schneider 2015). Above 28\u00b0C sun bears avoid direct solar radiation (Schneider 2015). This may be one reason that in the wild, when using open areas, like plantations, they do so mainly at night (Nomura et al. 2004, Cheah 2013). There are no reports of sun bears hibernating. Similar to several other members of Ursidae, females appear to be spontaneous ovulators capable of multiple estrus periods in a year and of embryonic diapause and delayed implantation (Spady et al. 2007; Frederick et al. 2010, 2013; although see Frederick et al. 2012 for a pregnancy without delayed implantation). Sun bears are the only species in Ursidae capable of reproducing at any point during the year (Schwarzenberger et al. 2004; Spady et al. 2007), although wild populations may exhibit some seasonality in reproductive activity (Hesterman et al. 2005). Relatively little is known about disease threats to sun bears, with a small number of published case reports arising from captive individuals (e.g., Ursid herpesvirus, neoplastic disease, reproductive tract pathology; Blake and Collins 2002, Goeritz et al. 2006, Lam et al. 2013). There is a paucity of data pertaining to disease occurrence in wild sun bears, with no published reports in the literature.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da0b0db6-0d6f-4233-8729-a18c28b28fe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "da0b0db6-0d6f-4233-8729-a18c28b28fe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a1370ed70b254c6fd8134fabccd581e22087ae4e22f96d2bfa35d036b4f0e4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "10234a77-eae9-4dec-a898-c8a26274703a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d13a1c413781b5aaa085e23fb5af4d3b33e0a744025facb3e541d81a4031173f"}}, "hash": "5fbbe0cbcc0cb5be4a41e29c53b203845c8fcee56cea00228479904f8f3d2807", "text": "Starvation and predation of wild sun bears have been encountered by researchers in Borneo (Wong et al. 2005, Fredriksson 2005a, Fredriksson et al. 2007).

The southern-most range limit is Indonesia; there are no records of sun bears ever occurring farther east than Borneo. Records of sun bears exist from the Island of Java from middle-late Pleistocene (Erdbrink 1953) but there is no evidence of occurrence there within historic times. Table 2. Sun bear geographic range divided by country, region (mainland versus Sundaic = Borneo and Sumatra), and subspecies (H. m. euryspilus only on Borneo). Areas were calculated from a range map drawn by in-country experts (Fig. 1); these values and corresponding percentages are thus less accurate than portrayed by the (rounded) values on the table. Areas were categorised as likely present, possibly present, or extirpated. Relative areas may not reflect population size. a The best estimates of occupied range are likely between the values for \u201cpresent range\u201d and \u201cpresent plus possible range\u201d (some of the possible range is occupied). b Criteria for differentiating present versus possible range was likely different among different country experts, explaining why in some countries, all range was categorised as either pres- ently occupied or extirpated (none classified as possible). c Extirpated range based on lack of presence data and habitat thought to be unsuitable. Percent of former range extirpated in each country is based on comparison to a historic range map (~500 years ago), largely from Erdbrink (1953). The span of values excludes or includes the possible range as being extirpated. 14 Presently, sun bears occur patchily across 32\u201340% (1.1\u20131.4 million km2) of their former range; the higher estimate includes all areas where no data exist but where country experts indicated they could possibly occur, based on possible suitability of habitat (Figure 1; Appendix IV; Table 2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "02b8bef7-bbc5-40a7-80c0-5b122dc0d17d": {"__data__": {"id_": "02b8bef7-bbc5-40a7-80c0-5b122dc0d17d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "08833c4c862538dfa26fe3d3f05817ea6c5be11729c9c7078885172c9c1a7779"}, "2": {"node_id": "fd2a5188-cb34-4e41-a1b6-15584e0f6750", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51d45cba71648f30b505611b118bd32d66d3916cc6a58bd89914782fa99e30e2"}}, "hash": "fb05cf2356afd4c7c1c12eb6082837fa8215c5c8146e7fa6c18d7d664de2eddb", "text": "Sun bears once occurred in what is now Singapore, but were extirpated due to the widespread deforestation in the 1800s and early 1900s (Corlett 1992, Brook et al. 2003). The continued existence of this species in China remains uncertain. Surveys in the most likely regions (remnant lowland natural forests) of Yunnan Province detected no evidence of sun bears, although one small border area (<600 km2) could not be surveyed (Wen and Wang 2013). In 2016, video footage of a sun bear was obtained from a camera trap in this area, indicating the presence of at least one bear, <1 km from the Myanmar border (Li et al. 2017). It is unknown whether there is a transboundary population, or just a few individuals living near the border. Nevertheless, this represents the first confirmed record of the species in China in 45 years. Other recent reports of sun bears in China (Zhou et al. 2017, Bai et al. 2018) were misidentifications of Asiatic black bears. Sun bears were thought to be extirpated in Bangladesh, with the exception of a few vagrants from neighboring countries (Islam et al. 2013), until confirmed records (dead animals and camera-trap photos) were obtained in the Chittagong Hill Tracts during 2014\u20132016, including a female and cub (Anwarul Islam, WildTeam, personal communication 2015; Creative Conservation Alliance 2016; Hasan Rahman,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d341cae3-f922-4b3c-b2e7-1f9dbf64595e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d341cae3-f922-4b3c-b2e7-1f9dbf64595e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b61d7b86d45fa59d0df8ca502711cdca9a961f2556aa281dcdbabe6ea8045d1"}, "3": {"node_id": "99684150-a9ff-433f-95d1-946895408bd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63e60eb7fe32b3a27205152525b01e847c6645c9c4b9713bfbb723364281a553"}}, "hash": "cd540af39b909be785856d1440d04b3ed6de2b0e8ddb12b938db433ac3020a0e", "text": "personal communication, 2017).

This is particularly evident in Thailand, where bears are mainly limited to a patchwork of protected areas separated by expanses of agriculture (Kanchanasakha et al. 2010), comprising only ~15% of the historic range. The range extends westward to northeastern India, where isolated populations have been confirmed in portions of five states (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland) and suspected in one other (Meghalaya) (Chauhan 2006, Chauhan and Jagdish Singh 2006, Choudhury 2011, Sathyakumar et al. 2012, Sethy and Chauhan 2012, 2013, 2016). There are no records of sun bears north of the Brahmaputra River in Assam (Choudhury 2011), but they extend northeastward into Arunachal Pradesh and northern Myanmar. Eastward on the mainland they extend into Vietnam. The sun bear\u2019s range is sympatric with Asiatic black bears across mainland Southeast Asia to about 9\u00b0N latitude (in peninsular Thailand), south of which Asiatic black bears do not occur. Sun bears occur southward in Peninsular Malaysia, and then into the Sundaic region of Sumatra and Borneo. About 35\u201344% of the range occurs in the Sundaic region (Table 2). Indonesia comprises about one-third of the total range area; Myanmar is second in terms of range area (Table 2). 4. ABUNDANCE In mainland Southeast Asia sun bears appear to exhibit a natural population gradient, increasing from the north to south across Southeast Asia (Steinmetz 2011). Population density and abundance appears to be highest in the Sundaic region. This gradient of abundance was apparent in historical times (Higgins 1932) and is also reflected by the relative frequency of fossil records (Tougard 2001, Meijaard 2004). Very few rigorous population or density estimates exist for this species. A camera-based mark-recapture survey in Thailand estimated population densities of 4.3 (95% CI 1.6\u201311.6) and 5.9 (95% CI 2.3\u201315.4) sun bears per 100 km2 in two sites within Khao Yai National Park (Ngoprasert et al. 2012). In southern Sumatra, in Harapan Rainforest, a camera-based study estimated a density of 26 bears per 100 km2, 4\u20135 times higher than density estimates from Thailand (Lee 2014, unpublished data, cited in Scotson et al. 2017a). However, the methods used to estimate density in Thailand and Sumatra differed (capture-recapture versus \u201cideal gas\u201d-model, respectively), so it is unclear whether results are truly comparable. It is also unclear whether the Sumatra estimate met the restrictive assumptions of the gas model (Hutchinson and Waser 2007, Rowcliff et al. 2008, Nakashima et al. 2017).

STATUS & POPULATION TREND IUCN RED LIST CATEGORY: Vulnerable (assessed 2008, 2016) IUCN RED LIST CRITERIA: A2cd+3cd+4cd Sun bears are believed to be declining across most of their range. Although lacking direct empirical estimates of population trends, country experts from the Bear Specialist Group made subjective estimates of rates of population decline over three time periods (30 years in the past, a 30-year window overlapping the present, and 30 years into the future) based on dwindling geographic ranges, loss and degradation of habitat, and high levels of exploitation. Weighting each country\u2019s estimate of population change by the country\u2019s areal proportion of the geographic range yielded an overall estimated decline of ~35% for the past 30 years, and ~40% or more for time periods including the future (Scotson et al. 2017a).

Assessments of rates of decline for this species have been based mainly on expert opinion. Some empirical estimates support these assessments. In Thailand\u2019s Khao Yai National Park camera trap photo encounter rates for sun bears declined by over 60% from 0.73 per 100 days (1999\u20132003) to 0.27 (2003\u20132007) (Jenks et al. 2011). But other populations seem to be doing better: photo encounter rates were stable in Kuiburi National Park and Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary (R. Steinmetz, unpublished data). An earlier systematic mammal status assessment survey of local people in Thung Yai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand, estimated that sun bear numbers declined by more than 40% in a 20-year period (1984\u20132004), but improved protection and community engagement since then appear to have had a positive effect (Steinmetz et al. 2006).

In Indonesian Borneo (Kalimantan), sign transects were used to monitor relative abundance of sun bears in a burned forest during 2000\u20132010. In an adjacent unburned forest, sun bear sign density remained stable. In the burned forest, sun bear sign density was near zero post fires, but within 10 years reached 65% of the sign densities in the unburned forest (Fredriksson 2012). 6. HABITAT USE Sun bears are recognised as a forest-dependent species; however, there remains a lack of understanding as to the relationship between habitat (types and age of forest and understory) and sun bear density. Two broadly distinct categories of tropical forest comprise their natural range, distinguished by differences in climate, phenology, and floristic composition: (i) seasonal evergreen and deciduous forests with generally a 4\u20135 month dry season on mainland Southeast Asia north of the Isthmus of Kra; and (ii) aseasonal evergreen rainforests in Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo. A principal distinction is that the aseasonal rainforests experience synchronised masting events, followed by inter-mast periods with little fruiting. During these inter-mast periods, sun bears rely largely on insects. However, they seem unable to maintain body mass for extended periods on a diet of insects, and some die of starvation (Wong et al. DATA GAPS on sun bear populations: There are no reliable population estimates for any range country, and also no empirically-based estimates of rates of population change. All current estimates of rates of decline are based on expert opinion. Because populations are not actively monitored, it is difficult to assess the real effects of threats or of conservation actions designed to reduce threats. Population surveys have been conducted using sign, camera traps, and interviews in a number of sites in almost all of the range countries (see section on Population Monitoring), but differences in the ways the data have been collected have hampered a thorough assessment of spatial differences in population size/density (but see Steinmetz 2011) or population trend. 17 2005, Fredriksson et al. 2007). Such large swings in fruit availability do not occur north of the Isthmus of Kra, and sun bears there are less reliant on insects (Steinmetz et al. 2011, 2013). In Bornean lowland forests, fruits of the families Moraceae, Burseraceae and Myrtaceae make up more than 50% of the fruit diet (Fredriksson et al. 2006), whereas in western Thailand fruits of Lauraceae, Fagaceae, Leguminosae, Labiatae, and Sapindaceae are the most commonly consumed (Vinitpornsawan et al. 2006, Steinmetz et al. 2013). North of the Isthmus of Kra, sun bears and Asiatic black bears co-occupy many of the same habitats on a fine scale, and consume many of the same fruits (based on claw marks on fruit-bearing trees; Steinmetz et al. 2013). Sun bears seem to avoid montane forests occupied by Asiatic black bears, although sun bears have been observed at elevations over 2,000 m in Myanmar and Indonesia (Augeri 2005, Htun 2006, Wong and Linkie 2012) and up to 3,000 m in India (Choudhury 2011). Data on sun bear use of disturbed habitats remains equivocal, and views on this topic appear to be evolving as more information becomes available. There is good evidence that sun bears attempt to avoid roads, settlements, and other sources of human activities (Augeri 2005, Linkie et al. 2007, Nazeri et al. 2012, Wong et al. 2013, Guharajan et al. 2018), and their use of newly-logged areas is low (Brodie et al. 2015).

(2009) reported that sun bears were camera-trapped at significantly higher rates in a forest logged under sustainable forest management (SFM) and reduced-impact logging (RIL) than at an adjacent site subjected to conventional logging practices. Unexpectedly though, within the SFM\u2013RIL site, sun bears were camera-trapped at a higher rate at sites that were logged 2\u20138 years before than at sites not logged for 20 years (Samejima et al. 2012). In a forest in Indonesian Borneo, 1\u20133 years after switching from conventional to RIL logging, sun bears selected sites with more intact forest (defined by a low extent of pioneer tree species that tend to grow in forest openings); but in a forest converted to RIL logging 6\u20138 years before, they were camera-trapped at a much higher rate overall, and showed no significant selection for more intact forest sites (Jati et al. 2018). In Malaysian Borneo, camera traps in more intact lowland forest tended to obtain more sun bear photos, but occupancy was only negligibly higher in the section of forest where logging had been controlled under RIL and certified under the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) than two adjacent forest blocks that had been more aggressively logged (Sollmann et al. 2017). Brodie et al. (2015) indicated that sun bear abundance was significantly reduced after logging in Malaysian Borneo, but rebounded after 10+ years of regeneration. Also in Malaysian Borneo, Wearn et al. (2017) reported that sun bear abundance was similar or slightly higher in a previously-logged forest than in old-growth forest. Adila et al. (2017) observed high species abundance, with sun bears being one of the most-commonly photographed large mammals, in a previously-logged peat swamp forest in Peninsular Malaysia that was not logged for ~20 years, even though much of the area continued to be burned and some was converted to oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). In a degraded, previously logged site in Sumatra, sun bears were camera-trapped at rates equivalent to unlogged sites, and within the logged site they showed no preference for parts of the forest that were less degraded (Lindsell et al. 2015). At another site in Sumatra, Linkie et al. (2007) observed higher occupancy of sun bears in a degraded hill-forest than in primary forest; 4\u20136 years later, occupancy in the degraded area precipitously declined, possibly due to continued high rates of deforestation, whereas occupancy in primary forest increased despite that site undergoing deforestation (Wong et al. 2013). Sun bears have been observed in plantations (oil palm, sugar palm), agricultural lands (sweetcorn, cucumber, pumpkin, sesame), orchards (coconut, durian, banana, jackfruit, snakefruit, pineapple, apple), narrow remnant 18 riparian forests surrounded by a deforested landscape, and near forest edges (Nomura et al. 2004, Augeri 2005, Fredriksson 2005b, Cheah 2013, Sethy and Chauhan 2013, Yaap et al. 2016, Guharajan et al. 2017). Some bears may benefit nutritionally from supplementing their diets with human-related foods (Nomura et al. 2004, Cheah 2013; Table 1), especially when fruits are scarce in the forest. However, sun bears using plantations and croplands typically do so mainly at night, avoiding both people and the hot sun, and returning to the adjacent forest for cover and shade by day (Nomura et al. 2004, Fredriksson 2005b, Cheah 2013, Sethy and Chauhan 2013). Despite this seemingly tenuous existence, sun bears seem to be able to persist in small strips of forest bordered by plantations as long as human-caused mortality is low (Yaap et al. 2016; Guharajan et al. 2017, 2018). 7. MAJOR THREATS Sun bears are threatened primarily by deforestation and commercial hunting, both of which occur to various degrees, and affect many species throughout the region (Scotson et al. 2017a, Duckworth et al. 2012).

DATA GAPS on sun bear habitat needs: Some data suggest that sun bear occurrence declines with reduced tree cover after logging, and is not restored for many decades. Other recent camera trapping data indicate that the species is more adaptable than once thought to certain kinds of forest alteration. Most camera trapping studies, though, are not targeted to sun bears, so there may be specifics to each case that are important but not understood. Sun bears evidently use the edges of oil palm plantations, and benefit nutritionally from eating the fruit, while doing little damage to the trees. However, plantations remove necessary cover and thermal protection, and reduce what is normally a diverse diet to just this singular fruit. Also, bears are more vulnerable to being killed in a plantation. It is unknown to what extent plantations can be made more bear friendly, without creating a mortality trap. Sun bear with apparent snare injury, captured near the Vietnam-Laos border. Credit: Centre for Environment and Rural Development, Vinh University 19 Poaching for consumption and commercial use of sun bears is a much greater threat than retaliatory killing: it was reported by regional members of the IUCN SSC Bear Specialist Group to be a moderate to major threat in all range countries except Brunei (where there are no records of international trade, but some local hunting of bears for medicinal purposes; Cheema 2015). Trade in sun bear parts has been reported in a host of studies (Meijaard 1999, Nea and Nong 2006, Nguyen 2006, Htun 2006, Tumbelaka and Fredriksson 2006, Wong 2006, Foley et al. 2011, Sethy and Chauhan 2011, Burgess et al. 2014, Krishnasamy and Shepherd 2014, Lee et al. 2015, Willcox et al. 2016). Sun bears are valued primarily for their gallbladder (see next section on Use & Trade) and paws; live cubs are also sold as pets or, to a lesser extent, to stock bear bile farms. It is widely believed that the extent of killing and trade is much larger than indicated by the actual records of dead bears. Snaring is widespread across Southeast Asia (Gray et al. 2017), which impacts sun bears either indiscriminately or through targeted poaching. This is evidenced by individuals missing paws, typical of snare injuries, in both high priority conservation areas and in plantations (Scotson and Hunt 2012, Cheah 2013, Krishnasamy and Or 2014, Or et al. 2017). Moreover, the prevalence of snaring is often significantly underestimated, effectiveness of anti-poaching patrols overestimated, and the factors associated with the extent of snaring in any particular area not well understood (Steinmetz et al. 2014; O\u2019Kelly et al. 2018a,b). Harrison et al. (2016), in a recent review paper, described what they called \u201ca wave of unsustainable hunting that has spread across Southeast Asia over the past 20\u201330 years.\u201d They asserted that government agencies and the international conservation community \u201cfail to appreciate the scale and extent of overhunting, much less respond appropriately.\u201d Whereas in many other parts of the world, human-dominated landscapes can support thriving populations of wildlife, including bears, this is not usually the case in Southeast Asia because of extreme over-exploitation and poaching. In part, this over-exploitation is due to the commercial value of some of the wildlife, including bears. Nevertheless, Steinmetz et al. (2010, 2014) showed in one area that if poaching can be alleviated, as via a thoughtful, locally-adapted community outreach programme or an enhanced patrolling effort, wildlife populations can quickly bounce back (as recently documented for tigers (Panthera tigris) in some areas; Pusparini et al. 2018, Lamichhane et al. 2018). Deforestation compounds the effects of poaching, partly because logging is associated with increased roads and access. Highlighting this point, Gaveau et al. (2014) used a map of logging roads to estimate the extent of logging impacts on Borneo. Bryan et al. (2013) calculated that the combined length of new logging roads built just in Malaysian Borneo and Brunei during 1990\u20132009 would circle the earth nine times.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a4713a5-f435-4912-942a-18aa428bffa5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a4713a5-f435-4912-942a-18aa428bffa5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6327fd1782c82181295a327aaa8de05508eeb0c6ec27a110f19af36d9ef62494"}, "2": {"node_id": "595ec981-2dfa-4090-8ca6-8b2083b8633a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5242fc67c029be810a404b6efb1d142c409fae457f6b00666f6d77e7c22e859"}}, "hash": "47d4405d871a2bafc15681aa55cd5ef60394649c089545088c6627826e47783f", "text": "These roads increase access for poachers, and also add human disturbance, which the bears attempt to shun.

This loss is driven by logging, fires, expansion of oil palm, rubber, and fiber (e.g., Acacia) plantations, and mining activity. Illegal road & logging in sun bear habitat. Credit: Dewi Kurnia 20 Within sun bear range, the Sundaic region has had the highest rate of deforestation (Miettinen et al. 2011; Margono 2012, 2014), where logging and conversion to fiber and oil palm are the chief drivers (Stibig et al. 2013, Abood et al. 2015). Gaveau et al. (2016) estimated that one-third of the forested area on Borneo was deforested during the period of industrial plantation expansion, 1973\u20132015; by 2015, half of the deforested area of Borneo was in oil palm or timber plantations. Margono et al. (2012) estimated that nearly half the remaining primary forests of Sumatra were cleared or degraded during 1990\u20132010. Indonesia was second only to Brazil in terms of area of net forest lost, with Myanmar third (FAO 2016). However, whereas forest loss rates have diminished in Brazil, the opposite occurred in Indonesia. By 2012, the rate of primary forest loss in Indonesia was estimated to be nearly double that of Brazil (Margono et al. 2014). Cushman et al. (2017) estimated a loss of 23% of forested area of Malaysian Borneo and 15% of Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) during the decade 2000\u20132010, and predicted that these same rates of loss would continue through the next decade. Moreover, forest loss in Brunei, which has historically been less (6% for 2000\u20132010) would increase to 16% during 2010\u20132020. Conversion of natural habitat to oil palm plantations is particularly extensive on Borneo and Sumatra (Miettinen et al. 2011; Wicke et al. 2011; Margono et al. 2012, 2014). Protected areas have not been exempt from deforestation: 40% of the forest lost in Indonesia during 2000\u20132012 occurred in protected areas where logging is restricted (Margano et al. 2014). Indonesia and Malaysia, countries considered to be the remaining strongholds for sun bears (Figure 1; Table 2), are the top two producers of palm oil in the world, providing 85% of the global supply; Thailand, another sun bear range country, is (a distant) third in world production (https://www.indexmundi.com/ agriculture/?commodity=palm-oil). Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia (in that order) are also the world\u2019s top- three rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) producing nations. Monoculture rubber plantations that provide little or no nutrition for sun bears are rapidly spreading in mainland Southeast Asia (Fox and Castella 2013, Ahrends et al. 2015), whereas the common rubber agroforestry systems of insular Southeast Asia, which often include fruiting trees conducive to use by bears, are being replaced by more lucrative oil palm. Sun bears living adjacent to oil palm plantations may feed upon the fruits (judged by their use of the plantations and their scats containing oil palm seeds; Nomura et al. 2004, Cheah 2013, Yue et al. 2015, Guharajan et al. 2017, Wearn et al. 2017). Paradoxically (given the high rate of forest loss in Southeast Asia), three sun bear range states (Laos, Vietnam, and India) are among the top ten countries in the world reporting the greatest annual net gain in forest area (FAO 2016). This shift, from a net loss to a net gain in forest area, called a forest transition, involved a number of factors, including protection of natural forest and planting of primarily fiber and rubber plantations.

During 1997\u20132006, over 20% of the total land surface area of this region was affected by fires (Langner and Siegert 2009). During 2015, fires burned over 2.6 million hectares in Indonesia, especially the peatlands of Sumatra and Kalimantan (World Bank Group 2016). Once the forest has burned, there is a higher propensity for it to burn again (Hoscilo et al. 2011). Because much of the seed bank is destroyed by fires, ultimately, many such repeatedly-burned forests become degraded scrublands. Given the diversity of fruits in the diet of sun bears in forests that have not been disturbed by humans (Stein- metz 2011, Steinmetz et al. 2013), it is expected that the extensive loss, degradation, and fragmentation of low- land forests, including removal of many fruit-producing trees, will negatively impact this species. Much of what is considered prime sun bear range is outside protected areas, and thus susceptible to human intrusion. 21 DATA GAPS on threats to sun bears: Whereas there is little doubt that sun bears are threatened both by habitat pressures and poaching, the relative impact of these two forces is difficult to ascertain for this species. Recently, such an assessment was conducted for Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), and the results were not as normally assumed: between 1999 and 2015, half of the orangutan population was affected by logging, deforestation, or industrialised plantations, and this loss and degradation of forest caused precipitous local declines in orangutan numbers; however, the largest overall decline in numbers occurred in selectively-logged and primary forests (where most orangutans live), apparently due to poaching (Voight et al. 2018). This analysis was possible because estimates exist of orangutan numbers through time; such population information is lacking for sun bears. Habitat alteration is much easier to measure than poaching pressure. Remote sensing has enabled large- scale, verifiable quantification of loss (or sometimes gain, or conversion to other types) of tree cover, as well as measures of increased human development and road access. Poaching is much more elusive by its very nature. What we know of sun bear poaching stems from accumulated confiscation records (although these often include a mixture of Asiatic black bears and sun bears \u2013\u2013 see next section on Use and Trade), abundance of snares and other sign of poachers, and evidence of significant population declines of sun bears in areas where forests remain largely intact (Crudge et al. 2016). Whereas every range country has laws prohibiting the killing of sun bears (Appendix III), and CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) prohibits international trade, the country-specific regulations of logging, burning, forest conversion, and road building and other infrastructure development, and how these may impact sun bears, are less clear. The extent to which these regulations are violated, and how often violators are prosecuted, are also unknown. There is disagreement as to what habitat features are most important for sun bears (in terms of their use, reproduction, and survival), and what patches of forest are still occupied by sun bears (Nazeri et al. 2012, 2014). Even at a very large scale, there are many areas within the broad sun bear range where their presence is uncertain (see Figure 1 and Table 2). This greatly complicates assessment of the state of this species, and prioritisation of sites to reduce threats. 8. USE & TRADE Bear bile has been a component of Traditional Medicine (TM) in Eastern Asia for millennia. The first written account of such use was recorded in the first pharmacopeia of China in 659 A.D. (Feng et al. 2009). Bear bile is used in TM for reducing fever and inflammation, detoxifying the liver, dissolving gall stones, arresting convulsions, diminishing swelling and pain, and healing sprains, fractures, hemorrhoids, as well conjunctivitis and other eye ailments (Feng et al. 2009, Li et al. 2017). The medicinally active ingredient of bear bile is ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ae1b736-1368-4412-9e62-694971368916": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ae1b736-1368-4412-9e62-694971368916", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8d813c073c9a2d5d4a76cc17376ef1e275870a4e57666adb6e7bff1b112127e"}, "2": {"node_id": "fdbc6fc8-991f-42b8-8191-4d742d52f3d6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1f26d26eb64d405cfd31b38e21ab14eaf5a191ca9a7e982fbd9953e6a0391b1b"}}, "hash": "92bc1fb48d13f819d0dcee9327573c32f3621e6c23e5f639e037bb60012a4db5", "text": "In controlled, clinical trials, this compound (and its associated conjugates) has been shown to have many of the medicinal properties claimed in TM, as well as some medical benefits beyond those of TM (Feng et al. 2009, Gamboa 2011).

A number of herbal alternatives to bear bile exist in the Chinese pharmacopeia, and are often prescribed by TM practitioners in combination with bear bile, and could be viable substitutes for bear bile (Appiah et al. 2017). Evidence suggests that UDCA in bear bile, which is a potent inhibitor of cell death (apoptosis) (Rivard et al. 2007), may serve to protect bears during hibernation (Sol\u00e1 et al. 2006). Asiatic black bears produce especially high levels of TUDCA (tauroursodeoxycholic acid), a conjugated form of UDCA which is rare in the bile of species other than bears (Hagey et al. 1993). Historically, the Asiatic black bear has been sought after for its bile more than any other bear species, possibly because of the high levels (Wang et al. 2011) and medicinal benefits 23 of TUDCA. By contrast, sun bears, which do not hibernate, have low levels of TUDCA but high levels of a different bile acid, TCDCA (taurochenodeoxycholic acid) (Hagey et al. 1993); this compound may also have some medicinal (anti-inflammatory) benefits (Mao et al. 2018), but is found in other animal species besides bears. One study found that Asiatic black bear bile did not contain TCDCA (Wang et al. 2011). Sun bears, which historically had a marginal extent in China, have not had the same long history of exploitation for bile as Asiatic black bears. Accordingly, when the farming of bears to extract bile to produce medicine commenced in China, sun bears were not included in the industry (and presently it is not legal to farm sun bears in China). Nevertheless, more recently, sun bears have become involved in the commercial trade in gallbladders and bile, despite no studies confirming the medicinal effectiveness of sun bear bile. Sun bears were also included in bear bile farming in Southeast Asia, specifically in Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, although they composed just 2-4 % of the farmed bears in this region (Foley et al. 2011, Livingstone and Shepherd 2014, Livingstone et al. 2018, Crudge et al. 2018). Nevertheless, there is no indication among the bear farming countries of Southeast Asia that sun bear populations have fared any better than Asiatic black bears (the main target for bear farms) (Crudge et al. 2018). Increased demand, stemming from burgeoning human populations and increasing wealth, coupled with more efficient hunting of wild bears and increased ability to sell and transport products has led to the over-exploitation of these Asian bears, mainly for their bile. Bear bile is sold in various forms including whole gallbladders, raw bile, pills, powders, flakes, and ointments (Foley et al. 2011). Trade in bears is further fuelled by increasing demand for bear parts for the consumption of wild meat, particularly its paws in the form of an expensive soup; having nothing to do with TM (Burgess et al. 2014, Anon. 2015, Willcox et al. 2016). Bear paws are considered a delicacy and health tonic when soaked in wine and are reportedly in high demand in countries like China and Vietnam (Burgess et al. 2014, Willcox et al. 2016). Other bear parts (claws, teeth, skin, skull) are also coveted as trophies or souvenirs. All international trade in bears, their parts or derivatives, including bile (whether wild or farmed) is regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Despite this, a wide and complex network of international bear bile trading exists, with much cross- border trade within Southeast Asia, and exports to China and to non-Asian countries (Foley et al. 2011, Burgess et al. 2014). The actual extent of this illegal trade is difficult to judge, given that seizure data are an unknown fraction of the total trade, and because gallbladders and bile are not easily differentiated to species (not just among bear species, but also other species whose parts are traded as imitation bear parts (Peppin et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "871226f1-0ba9-4a8c-b5c5-81061137bb8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "871226f1-0ba9-4a8c-b5c5-81061137bb8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc8374077705be018f1b19982ea10e8bc6127d3c462d3c9d88847fd24cf4b57a"}, "2": {"node_id": "c283e839-4911-4512-b78a-917a1b1c87f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c51a1def3ec885299e2076b8393431b99943e48549545c7dd684cb8ee303a22c"}}, "hash": "89f30400292d0fd6b9782e390d802bb8e19b8dedc034bf976edf5462971bca71", "text": "2008).

Nijman et al. (2017) interviewed self-declared bear poachers in Myanmar, and learned that poaching was almost always a side-occupation, bears were mainly poached using snares set for a variety of species, and poachers typically took about one bear per year and consumed some of it but sold the valuable parts (gallbladder, paws, skin); most respondents said that selling the gallbladder was the prime reason to poach bears, with little fear of being caught, and most thought that hunting pressure reduced bear density over the past 5 years. In one area, targeted bear poaching, involving long lines of iron traps, started after a Chinese logging operation became active. Poachers indicated, though, that most bears caught were Asiatic black bears, and in a separate survey in Myanmar, it was found that <1% of bear parts being traded were from sun bears (Shepherd and Nijman 2008). Nijman et al. (2017) recommended not just better law enforcement efforts but also a concerted attempt to disrupt trade networks that foster and fulfill demand for bear parts. In the state of Arunachal Pradesh in northeast India, Asiatic black bear parts (gallbladders, skulls, teeth, claws, paws, skins) were likewise sought and traded more than those of sun bears, based on interviews with local people and parts found for sale (Sethy and Chauhan 2011). However, sun bears comprised a larger portion (11\u201315%) of the bear parts found or bears poached than in neighbouring Myanmar. The study site in India marks the northern limit of sun bears, where they would be expected to be less common than Asiatic black bears, whereas the Myanmar data were from throughout the country, which includes places where sun bears were more common than black bears (based on camera-trapping data: Steinmetz 2011). Hence, the difference in results between these adjacent countries may reflect differences in hunter selectivity or hunting methods. TRAFFIC and other organisations have attempted to ascertain the levels of trade in bears and their parts through surveys of TM outlets and bear bile farms. In Vietnam there was a decline in open availability of bear parts in physical outlets between surveys in 2012 and 2016, but commercial trade in bear bile and gallbladders remained prevalent (Willcox et al. 2016). A survey of online outlets such as Facebook, found that bear products were openly advertised in Vietnam (Nguyen 2016). A survey in Malaysia, where only sun bears are native, reported that nearly 50% of TM shops sold bear gallbladders or bile (in the form of pills, liquid, or powder) in 2012; even though most acknowledged that it was illegal, the sale of bear parts remained widespread (Lee et al. 2015). Some of the bile in Peninsular Malaysia was sourced from other countries (including farmed bile), so was likely predominantly Asiatic black bears. However, almost all traders interviewed in Sabah and Sarawak (on Borneo) claimed that they sourced their gallbladders locally, meaning that if they were indeed bear gallbladders (and not some other species that traders sold as bear) they were all sun bears. There are reports of increasing poaching of sun bears in Malaysian Borneo (Or et al. 2017). Tom-tom, wild-born hybrid sun-moon bear rescued from illegal wildlife trade in Cambodia. Credit: Free the Bears 25 Sun bears are also involved in the exotic pet trade (Burgess et al. 2014). For example, in Cambodia, 141 sun bears (plus 51 Asiatic black bears and one hybrid (Galbreath et al. 2008)) were confiscated or relinquished during 1998 \u2013 2017, an average of 7 sun bears per year. In the first five years of this period, the majority of confiscated bears had been kept as pets or in restaurants and tourist attractions in and around Phnom Penh, the capital city. In subsequent years, confiscations increasingly occurred in the rural provinces, often directly from hunters and traders (Nev Broadis, Free the Bears, unpublished data). Confiscation rates have decreased in recent years, although given the prevalent high value of bears, this may be due to declining bear populations and trade becoming more secretive, as opposed to reduced demand.

Large seizures have large effects on the data, making it difficult to interpret. Total number of seizures, body parts, or bears gives no indication on the effect on the wild population. Every wild population can sustain some offtake without declining, but estimation of the sustainable offtake requires a reliable population estimate, which does not exist for any sun bear range country. Also, it is not known what fraction of the total human-caused mortality ends up being seized. Unlike Asiatic black bears, where the medicinal effects of bile are proven, it is unclear whether sun bear bile has significant medicinal effects. It is possible that sun bear bile is akin to rhino horn in having no pharmacological benefit, but trade is sustained through cultural beliefs (Cheung et al. 2018). However, whereas use of Asiatic black bear bile in Traditional Medicine traces back over 1000 years (Feng et al. 2009), widespread use and trade in sun bear bile as a medicinal product is much more recent. It is unclear whether bile users know the difference, or if traders simply substituted a look-alike wild bear bile from the same geographic region. Notably, sun bears were rarely used in bear farms, suggesting that those selling farmed bile perceived a difference. 9. EX SITU STATUS Sun bears have been held in captivity under a wide range of circumstances, conditions and motivations for at least 200 years. For the purpose of this review the ex situ sun bear population has been assigned to three separate categories, and the population status for each category will be assessed separately: \u2022 Category 1: coordinated ex situ populations held outside of the bears\u2019 natural range-states. \u2022 Category 2: bears held within natural range- states as part of legally recognised ex situ populations, including recognised sanctuaries, government wildlife rescue centres, and zoos recognised by regional/global organisations (SEAZA, WAZA, ZIMS). \u2022 Category 3: bears held within range states and outside of government programmes (e.g., pets, illegally held captive bears, roadside zoos, tourist attractions, bear bile farms etc.). CATEGORY 1 POPULATIONS Four separate programmes have been established to coordinate ex situ sun bear populations outside of their natural range. They are managed within the framework of the following regional zoo associations: \u2022 Association of Zoos & Aquariums (AZA) in North America \u2022 European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) \u2022 Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquaria (JAZA) \u2022 Zoo and Aquarium Association (ZAA) in Australasia In EAZA, JAZA and ZAA studbooks are kept for the species, while in North America the population was managed more intensively in a Species Survival Plan (SSP) until 2012 when, following poor breeding results and a discouraging population viability analysis, the species was no longer recommended for cooperative management within AZA. The roles currently assigned by the population managers to these individual programmes differ between regions but in all regions, 26 Sun bears have been kept in North American zoos since 1874. However, successful breeding did not start in any region until the 1960s. Studbook management of these populations was initiated decades later in the 1990s (Table 3), when the numbers of sun bears were already beginning to decline. Among the Category 1 populations, the biggest drop in population size \u2013 from a maximum of 88 to 26 sun bears currently - was observed in the North American population. Declines of a lesser degree are also seen in the populations held in Europe and Japan (see Table 4). The decline in populations in the two regions with the longest breeding history is attributed to the relatively low reproductive output, which was outweighed by the death rate associated with the aging of the populations (Table 4). the species should play a role for education and conservation education.

However, to give the wild-born sun bears the chance to reproduce, several new pairings are recommended for the population. In order to ensure new pairs are reproductively viable, it has been recommended that reproductive health examinations are carried out on animals prior to transfers. The numbers of sun bears actually founding the ex situ populations were small with 14 wild-born founders in Europe, 7 wild-born founders in both the AZA and ZAA populations, and 6 in Japan. The latter were imported from China and it is not known whether these were captive- or wild-born individuals. Wild-born animals from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Sumatra (Indonesia) contribute to the EAZA population. All are currently still assigned to the H. m. malayanus sub-species. Only part of the Category 1 sun bear population, comprising individuals in North America, belongs to H. m. euryspilus from Borneo. In all populations a certain percentage of ancestry is unknown. CATEGORY 2 POPULATIONS Category 2 populations are sun bears held within recognised sanctuaries, wildlife rescue centres, zoos or similar facilities in their natural range states. Often these centres are owned by local governments and may have external support from non-governmental organisations. These animals make up a significant population of around 300 individuals, many of which are wild-born (Table 6). Table 5.

Krishnasamy, TRAFFIC Southeast Asia, personal communication, 2018). These populations fulfil a number of roles including support for wildlife law enforcement efforts, conservation education for local communities to reduce demand for bears and poaching as well as awareness raising about the situation of sun bears in the wild and their threatened ecosystems. With the exception of the Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre (BSBCC) captive breeding is not one of the goals of these sanctuaries due to populations growing via the receipt of confiscated and relinquished bears. 31 Bear rescue centres can play a role in raising local awareness. Credit: KWPLH/Pro Natura Foundation CATEGORY 3 POPULATIONS An unknown number of sun bears are held in captivity across their natural range outside the coordinated programmes \u2013 this includes animals held as pets, illegally held captive bears, roadside zoos, tourist attractions, and bear bile farms. Despite legal protection aimed at preventing the capture of wild bears, large numbers of sun bears continue to be held in a variety of exploitative situations that do not contribute to, and almost certainly have a negative impact on, the conservation of the species. Sun bear cubs, often captured as a by-product of illegal killing of adult bears, remain popular as pets in many range countries. Since before the time of Raffles (1821), local people have had a particular fascination with keeping cubs of this bear species as pets. Sadly, once the cubs have outgrown their owners\u2019 attention they are often confined to small, unsuitable cages that do not allow for a full range of natural behaviours, or are sold into the trade to be killed and butchered for their body parts. It is highly likely that the number of sun bears being kept in roadside zoos, temples or as tourist attractions greatly outnumber the populations being held in managed breeding programmes or government- affiliated sanctuaries. Due to the illicit nature of this form of captivity the true numbers of bears being held across their range are impossible to know. However, experts estimate that within each range country there may be anywhere between a few individuals (Cambodia and Laos) to several hundred such captive sun bears (Indonesia and Thailand).

However, these projects have limited geographic scope and can face difficulties in maintaining long-term funding, political support, and most importantly, cooperation by local communities. In one study in Cambodia, looking at anti-poaching effectiveness, it was suspected that most snares were never found (O\u2019Kelly et al. 2018b). It has long been assumed that snaring pressure corresponds directly with forest access: more in the dry season, more in small patches of degraded forest with increased road access, and closer to villages. O\u2019Kelly et al. (2018b), though, indicated that these assumptions are not necessarily correct \u2013\u2013 poachers attempting to avoid being caught worked during the wet season, used thick forests for cover, and often set snares away from their village, looking for places with high animal densities, and hence high returns (O\u2019Kelly et al. 2018b). No clear relationship between anti-snaring efforts and poaching was found in this study. The challenges to effective wildlife law enforcement have prompted some to advocate for increased demand- side interventions. However, recent studies have shown that such efforts also commonly fail, especially if the drivers of demand and consumer preferences are not well understood, and methods for reaching and influencing the public are not appropriately targeted (Drury 2011, Davis et al. 2016, Harrison et al. 2016, Ver\u00edssimo et al. 2018). It is perplexing that, whereas killing sun bears for their gallbladders is a chief threat, there is as yet no direct evidence that their bile (unlike that of Asiatic black bears) is medicinally effective.

In preparation for the 1st International Symposium on Sun Bear Conserva- tion & Management, an announcement was made requesting information on the details and locations of all sun bear related projects.

Or follow the link https:// goo.gl/zuQmZ4 33 PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF HABITAT Significant efforts have been made to reduce the rate of tropical forest loss, a necessity for the conservation of sun bears. The most recent Global Forest Resources Assessment of the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO 2016) indicated that the rate of tropical forest loss since 2010 was only half that of the 1990s (Keenan et al. 2015). Likewise, the rate of planting forests in the tropics has nearly doubled since the 1990s, although Southeast Asia has lagged behind (Payn et al. 2015). Additionally, there are now more inventories (and these inventories are far more accurate because they can be checked with satellite imagery; Romijn et al. 2015), management plans, national targets, and international as well as stakeholder pressure to conserve forests, for a variety of reasons (MacDicken et al. 2015). Indeed, at least on paper, the area of protected forest has increased in Southeast Asia (Morales-Hidalgo et al. 2015), and forest area in this region is projected to increase significantly by 2030, according to some estimates (d\u2019Annunzio et al. 2015). This is not to say that significant forest conversion to agriculture is not still a major issue. Additionally, it is clear that in Southeast Asia, primary forests are still being degraded (as from fire) at an alarming rate (van Lierop et al. 2015), likely diminishing habitat quality for sun bears. Whereas conservation efforts should certainly focus on saving sun bear habitat, there is still much uncertainty as to what \u201cprime\u201d sun bear habitat is, and also how much effort should be invested in protecting logged, burned, scrubby, small, or severely fragmented habitat. We know that sun bears consume a diversity of fruits when they exist in dense, old-growth forests, but this species also has evolved to persist through inter-mast periods with a paucity of fruits. Likewise, recent studies have shown them to occur in recovering logged or burned forests.

But it is not clear what exactly should be done to make these monoculture plantations more sun bear friendly. Establishing \u201cset-asides\u201d or plantings of new forest patches may be encouraged within plantations. However, embedded \u201cbear-friendly\u201d habitats may entice bears to use the plantation more, and thereby increase their potential as a hunting- mortality trap. POPULATION MONITORING There have been few efforts to monitor changes in sun bear populations or even to assess relative spatial differences in sun bear population size and density. It is difficult to know if conservation efforts are effective if there is no reliable measure of the response of sun bear populations. Likewise, it is difficult to prioritise where conservation actions are most needed if sites cannot be distinguished in terms of a quantifiable measure of status or threat (e.g., rate of population decline, population size and connectivity, type and extent of threat and whether it is increasing or decreasing, prospects for long-term viability). Ideally, some baseline population estimate or index would be established, and population changes tracked through time in a number of sites. An alternative or additional approach would be to compare an index of population size/density across sites and identify attributes of these sites that explain high versus low sun bear populations. Nevertheless, data exist from a number of surveys that were designed to gauge some aspect of population status. Three principal methods have been used \u2013\u2013 sign surveys, camera trapping and local interviews \u2013\u2013 although comprehensive recommendations on when to apply which method, or how to best implement or interpret each method, do not presently exist. Sign surveys have been conducted at sites in Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, India, and Bangladesh (Augeri 2005, Scotson et al. 2008, 2009, Namyi 2009, Powell 2011, Teo et al. 2011, Fredriksson 2012, Ngoprasert et al. 2011, Islam et al. 2013, Steinmetz et al. 2011, 2013, Sethy and Chauhan 2016, Guharajan et al. 2018). The basic design is for a group of two or more people to walk a straight line (transect) through a forest, and search for bear sign within a certain distance (typically 2-5 m, but up to 10 m) either side of that line, yielding an index of sign density (which presumably relates to bear density). Each tree is inspected for claw marks and ripped or chewed wood (from sun bear excavation of stingless bees), and the ground is 34 searched for insect digging (and occasional scats or tracks). Chief difficulties include: (a) inaccuracies in distinguishing bear sign from that of other species, especially for species that dig for insects or roots; (b) ambiguities in distinguishing sign of sun bears and Asiatic black bears (Steinmetz and Garshelis 2008), where the two species co-occur; (c) decay rates that vary by type of sign, weather, growth rates of trees, etc.; (d) untested or inconsistently applied methods used to age sign (Fredriksson 2012, Steinmetz and Garshelis 2010); (e) inconsistent methods for quantifying sign when it occurs in clumps (e.g., series of closely-spaced diggings); (f) uncertain procedures for summing the amount of sign encountered when there are multiple types of sign (e.g., adding the number of claw marked trees and number of diggings); (g) lack of methods for dealing with inter-observer differences in sign detection; (h) lack of methods for assessing the proportion of sign not detected; and (i) lack of understanding of how sign density relates to bear density, and factors that may confound this relationship (e.g., density of fruiting trees, amount of fruit and distribution among tree species). For these reasons, there have been few attempts to compare sign density of sun bears over a broad geographic scale. However, Fredriksson (2012) used consistent methods to monitor re-use of a burned, recovering forest by sun bears over time. Guharajan et al. (2018) used sign density to compare amount of sun bear use of small patches of forest adjacent to oil palm plantations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "10a94092-3962-49f0-8b35-87eb43eb5ba3": {"__data__": {"id_": "10a94092-3962-49f0-8b35-87eb43eb5ba3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Sun bears : global status review and conservation action plan, 2019\u20132018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0adf7b8d9ba8bdde5c55779e2026c1f2a7878f95af93d601015c4683596beb8c"}, "2": {"node_id": "92d7dea9-7439-430f-a621-82cd9d16ab1c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/sun-bears-global-status-review-and-conservation-action-plan-2019-2018", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c42d0ce03e5cef0949e5d18adb9eadcbef5581692ee90e89853ef7dd91fc72d"}}, "hash": "433612ae07f1317f842ce1bea77726f758bff4a90d424457b17375109a5ab90a", "text": "Since sun bear sign is generally related to feeding, sign surveys not only provide an indication of presence, but also use (i.e., not just passing through).

Additionally, sun bear (or sun bear and Asiatic black bear)-focussed camera trapping studies have been conducted or are in progress in a number of the range countries (India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia) to assess relative density or occupancy by habitat (Linkie et al. 2007, Ngoprasert et al. 2012, Sethy and Chauhan 2016, L. Gaffi, R. Guharajan, H. Rahman, personal communication, 2017), and when repeated, may indicate change in distribution or population density (Wong et al. 2013). Interviews of local people are a particularly useful way of assessing population change over time, and perceived drivers of population change. In a study of Asiatic black bears in China, Liu et al. (2009, 2011) showed that a combination of village interviews and sign surveys reliably indicated bear presence or absence, and was useful in gleaning opinions of population trends (comparing past and present) and reasons for these trends (e.g., changes in habitat, extent of poaching). Sethy and Chauhan (2011, 2012, 2013) interviewed villagers in northeastern India to gain information about sun bear presence, crop damage, attacks on people, and trade in bear parts. Recently, Crudge et al. (2016) employed village interviews around protected areas in Vietnam to gauge presence, relative density, and population trends of bears, and related this to bear farming. An important caveat of interviews, though, is that often local people are unable to reliably differentiate sun bears from Asiatic black bears. Also, their perceptions of population change may be linked more to their perception of the presumed drivers (e.g., improved habitat leads to increased population; observed cases of poaching leads to a decrease) than to actual encounter rates with bears. CONTRIBUTIONS OF EX SITU FACILITIES Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have established rescue centres in partnership with government authorities in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China with the primary aim of providing sanctuary to bears confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade (Table 6). For example, since 2002 in Cambodia, a dedicated Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team, made up of Forestry Officials and Military Police and funded by international NGOs, has confiscated more than 200 sun bears and Asiatic black bears that were previously kept illegally as pets, tourist attractions or destined for restaurant trade or bear farms (M. Hunt, Free the Bears, personal communication, 2018). An argument can be 35 made that without a place for these bears to go after confiscation, less effort would be dedicated toward law enforcement, and hence there would be more opportunity for the trade in live bears to flourish. Rehabilitation of ex-captive sun bears to restock depleted populations is another potential conservation role. However, this is rare and fraught with challenges, as most potential release sites are still threatened by forest loss and poaching, and most good forest habitats still retain sun bear populations. Few rehabilitation attempts have been monitored over a sufficient period to judge success (or the reasons for failure) \u2013\u2013 the aim being that released sun bears become functioning parts of a viable population. In most rehabilitation attempts that have been monitored so far, sun bears were either killed by resident bears, found starved, or moved out of the forest and have been killed after coming too close to settlements or orchards. In Cambodia, a pilot project to rehabilitate two sun bears that were confiscated from the illegal wildlife trade ended after both bears were trapped in snares within two months, despite over two years of intensive snare-patrolling in the area prior to the release (M. Hunt, Free the Bears, personal communication, 2018). Efforts are now underway in Sabah to assess the fate of sun bears released after a prolonged period of rehabilitation (S.T. Wong, Bornean Sun Bear Conservation Centre, personal communication, 2018). Camera trap image of a sun bear.

Likewise, centres support capacity building of local conservationists, and facilitate in situ and ex situ research and conservation (Table 6). INCREASING CROSS-SECTORAL SUPPORT Throughout their range sun bears face a multitude of direct and indirect threats, each with its own complex set of drivers and contributors. Their forest habitat is destroyed or degraded in many ways, including legal and illegal logging, forest fire, agricultural conversion, and infrastructure development, motivated by livelihood development or economic growth. Hunting of sun bears may be driven by demand from urban centres for high value parts, by livelihood needs of rural hunters, or may be the result of indiscriminate hunting methods such as snaring. Threats are compounded by low levels of wildlife law enforcement. Efforts to mitigate these threats are hampered by: (a) lack of empirical data on which to base recommendations for improved polices; (b) the immensity of the challenge versus the limited resources available to address all threats across the range; and (c) general lack of awareness among the public and policy makers as to the conservation importance of sun bears and the steps that can be taken. Overcoming these constraints will require a strategic approach to increasing efficiencies in the application of limited resources, as well as increased understanding and collaboration across all relevant sectors and stakeholders. STRATEGIC PLANNING The plan outlined here delves into the complexities of sun bear conservation. Some actions are direct, based on what we know, or what we think we know. Other actions involve data-compiling or even full-fledged research efforts, to better guide later conservation efforts, with the aim of achieving the overarching vision for sun bear conservation. As highlighted in the status review above, there remain many data gaps for this species. In some cases conservation actions can proceed under the assumption that enough is known to get started. But it is clear that effectiveness would be enhanced if conservation can be more precise in terms of targeting the most pressing threat(s), which may be poaching in some areas and habitat loss or degradation in other areas, or some interaction between the two (e.g., increased access due to logging promotes greater poaching). Additionally, even these two broad threats may be best solved in different ways in different areas, depending on the specific problem (e.g., whether the habitat alteration is due to logging or conversion to oil palm; whether the poaching is indiscriminate or targeted to bears), and the willingness and capacity to solve it.

Credit: Free the Bears 39 OVERVIEW The following section outlines a range-wide conservation strategy and action plan for sun bears, for the period 2019 \u2013 2028. This brings together the results of targeted discussions by workshop participants (Appendix I) at the 2017 Sun Bear Conservation Planning Workshop and the recommendations for actions that arose from those discussions. These discussions were informed by outputs from the preceding International Symposium on Sun Bear Conservation & Management, where an initial vision and operational goals were drafted, and where discussions of threats and conservation opportunities were captured and summarised (see Appendix II). Over the two-day planning workshop, and following a series of scene-setting presentations, participants worked collaboratively on: \u2022 A VISION for the long-term future of sun bears; \u2022 Operational GOALS which, if achieved, would realise the vision; \u2022 The nature and dimensions of the ISSUES currently impacting the viability of the species across its range; \u2022 A series of OBJECTIVES aimed at addressing these issues; \u2022 ACTIONS to be taken in pursuit of these objectives, including recommendations on where and how each action should be taken and who would be best placed to take it. After discussing as a group all of the potential issues impacting on the viability of the species across its range, working groups were formed around the themes of: Trade and consumption; Habitat protection and improvement; Population monitoring; Ex situ management; and cross-sectoral collaboration. These themes ultimately became aligned with five operational goals. Working groups discussed the issues relevant to their theme with the aim of linking each issue to sun bear viability in the wild. Additionally, groups identified the underlying causes or exacerbating factors of each issue, wherever possible citing supporting evidence, clarifying assumptions and noting important information gaps. Once issues were described, objectives aimed at addressing them were developed and brought to the wider group for discussion and prioritisation.

The following summarises the outputs of these discussions and the agreed-upon Vision, Goals, Objectives and Actions. 40 Vision Sun bears thrive as a functional component of all natural ecosystems in which they occur in each of the eleven range countries. Human societies coexist with wild sun bears throughout the range with political and cultural appreciation of their intrinsic value as living beings. Wild sun bear populations are no longer threatened. Captive sun bears are maintained under high welfare standards and contribute to conservation through advocacy, education, research, and where appropriate, release back to the wild. Conservation of sun bears aids in the conservation of other species and ecosystems in Southeast Asia. Goals Goal 1. Eliminate illegal exploitation of sun bears. Goal 2. Protect and restore sun bear habitats and populations across the species' natural range. Goal 3. Devise and employ methods to reliably monitor trends in sun bear populations. Goal 4. Maximise the contribution of ex situ sun bear populations to conservation. Goal 5. Increase cross-sectoral support and collaboration for sun bear conservation. Participants developed the following 25-year vision and goals for sun bear conservation: 41 ISSUES OF POTENTIAL RELEVANCE TO THE EFFECTIVE CONSERVATION OF SUN BEARS Increasing wealth Drive for social status Tradition enforced by marketing Preference for wild meat Gifts to curry favour with employers Corruption Crime syndicates Crime syndicates Limited government resources Conf icting government priorities Lack of political will Lack of public support/pressure Public apathy Lack of education & awareness Lack of alternative livelihoods By-catch from subsistence hunting Logging Habitat loss, fragmentation, degradation Hunting or poaching Insuf cient government support to some communities Poor or selective enforcement Cultural love of hunting Increasing hunting impact as wealth increases (seen everywhere) Exclusion of potential allies (indigenous peoples & local communities) Inaccurate hypotheses underpinning action Not knowing how to solve the problem Demand for construction materials Unsustainable shifting cultivation Encroachment Plantation expansion Conversion to industrial plantations Land grabbing Corruption Contradictory laws & regulation loopholes Climate change Forest f res Forced resettlement Large-scale construction including dams Laws not always transparent Lack of knowledge/understanding Human population increase Lack of time, skills, money Lack of understanding between government agencies Lack of accountability in industry Inherent complexity of the problem - too daunting Inadequate or inappropriate conservation action Viability of Sun Bears in the Wild Demand Income needs of local people Global traf cking Pets, hotels Contradictory laws & regulations - loopholes for indigenous people exploited by others Increased access & opportunity Figure 3.

IMPROVE ENFORCEMENT EFFECTIVENESS FOR LAWS PERTAINING TO HUNTING, TRADE AND USE OF SUN BEARS AND THEIR PARTS Rationale: Uncontrolled hunting of sun bears is considered a major threat to the survival of the species. In most instances it is illegal, and it is necessary to address this issue in order to improve the conservation status of the species. Weak laws and policies (e.g. low penalties, insufficient regulation for trade, loopholes, etc.) enable the illegal trade and hunting of sun bears to persist and limits the effectiveness of law enforcement actions. Successful law enforcement requires data by which to monitor and evaluate success, and on which to base management strategies and set targets for future interventions. (Action 2.1) Most TM samples that potentially containing bear bile are mixed with essential oils or plant derivatives. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) can be used to analyse a short sequence of DNA even in samples containing only minute quantities. However, the presence of other substances can hinder the PCR from working and the process for their removal introduces uncertainty to the results. Therefore, wildlife law enforcement may benefit from having alternative methods, such as antibody tests or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), to detect if a sample contains bear bile. (Action 2.5) It is assumed that having knowledge and information on the severity of sun bear crimes will motivate law enforcement and the judiciary to strengthen convictions (higher frequency and severity of penalties imposed). This requires documenting the extent of the illegal trade in sun bears, their parts and products that is occurring in physical and online markets in order to identify key traders and trade routes, and monitor trends.

PROTECT AND RESTORE SUN BEAR HABITATS AND POPULATIONS ACROSS THE SPECIES\u2019 NATURAL RANGE OBJECTIVE 3. REVIEW DATA ON FOREST COVER AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICES TO PRIORITISE AREAS AND GALVANISE SUPPORT FOR CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS Rationale: Forest cover is declining rapidly in Southeast Asia. This poses a major threat to sun bears because it reduces the area of habitat and increases fragmentation, creating smaller, discon- nected patches that are more susceptible to additional threats like poaching, climate change, and fire. Some countries have established national targets for forest cover. A review of existing national policies and standards is needed to highlight areas for improvements that would ultimately benefit wild sun bear populations. (Action 3.1) Forest loss varies by country within the range of sun bears. Compiling current rates of forest loss for each range state will help to identify areas within each country most at risk and therefore help prioritise conservation interventions. Additionally, comparison of forest data against national targets will indicate which countries are most apt to intervene. (Action 3.2) People may derive benefits from saving rather than cutting forests. Identification of such benefits may increase political and public will, as well as financial resources through payment for ecosystem services, for protecting sun bear habitat. (Action 3.3) Greater awareness of forest loss among the authorities and the public may lead to increased interest in maintaining intact forest and greater protection of sun bear habitat. (Action 3.4) No. Action Priority Responsibility Indicators of progress What we have What we need 3.1 Review existing policies in order to identify national targets and commitments pertaining to forest cover (loss/gain). 1 year Student, consultant, contractor, or volunteer.
