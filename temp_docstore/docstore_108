Production base The market dynamics for the Kenyan fish- eries sector are complex, and it is not the aim of this report to detail the entire pro- duction base. For example, Kenya produces aquatic animals through both wild-capture and aquaculture (farmed) methods. These activities occur both inland and in marine environments. Furthermore, Kenya produc- es an array of animal types, including finfish, mussels, octopi, crabs, oysters, and more. Some products are for the export market, some are for high-value domestic consump- tion (involving transport across the country), and some are for local coastal consumption. In line with the objectives of the study, and with priority value chain outputs in mind, this report focuses specifically on: ma- rine-based, finfish aquaculture for the local coastal market. As such, the production base analysis for this value chain details avenues that address demand for finfish in the local (coastal Kenyan) market. In 2019, overall fish production (wild-capture fishing and farming combined) in Kenya was just over 146,500", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fab3c65d-a200-4c10-8d08-21ce10668c3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fab3c65d-a200-4c10-8d08-21ce10668c3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9381dce216f3f1f2a9ac595004685a0143c69da2a1a5e1ca1414634bdea224d9"}, "3": {"node_id": "612d7128-c0bc-4118-beef-729e5a0f05ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a294cf5940a920badf73e765904cff30c28d473d99957ae01dab6a3b02911f69"}}, "hash": "262f65f09a7a882dad63d6ff16f551fbb7108dd398949ceecfe29c3b6fadd4af", "text": "tonnes,50 with nearly 25,700 tonnes (around 17%)150 coming from the coast.

However, fish consumption at the local level is driven by some 80,000 small-scale artisanal fishers, utilizing some 17,000 artisanal fishing vessels.50 Along the coast, it is men who do the dangerous work of artisanal fishing. Kenya\u2019s fish stocks are becoming more and more depleted, putting pressure on the traditional artisanal fishing ecosystems that support local fish consumption. Anecdotal reports indicate that it is not uncommon for a local fishing boat in the coastal county of Kwale to go out to sea and return empty. Challenges to artisanal fishing include de- pleted fish stocks, worsening sea conditions for small vessels, and increasing need for local landing sites to which fishers can bring their catch. In spite of being introduced into Kenya for decades,152 mariculture has failed to take root due to insufficient investment and inadequate technical expertise. Previous attempts at coastal aquaculture have not yielded positive, sustaining results. However, the sector has received a boost under the KEMFSED project (Kenya Marine Fisheries and Socio-Economic Development Project), which promises to build a national mari- culture resource and training centre.153 In response, Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute (KMFRI) is currently pilot- ing marine-based cage farming as a poten- tial solution to the fish supply deficit along the coast. Two of the pilot cages are housed in Kilifi County, and a third is positioned in Kwale county, with plans to establish another 152 Holeh, G.M., Ochiewo, J.O., Tsuma, S., & Mirera, D.O. (2020).

There are several construction models being tested, but the preferred method in Kwale County consists of a floating wooden structure that is anchored to the ocean floor. A sample layout would include com- partments made of netting that descends 2-3m into the ocean waters. Including two separate compartments enables farmers to separate smaller fish from larger fish. Construction can take around 2 weeks and requires tools and inputs like culture nets, wood, floaters, concrete sinkers, ropes, nails, bolts, and a canoe. Third, farmers secure fingerlings from the wild. At present, local fishers are paid 10KES for each fingerling (a juvenile fish weighing approximately 1g).

Farmers are responsible for the fingerling input cost. In this case, one cycle of fingerling inputs costs 160,000KES (just under US$ 1,500). As more cage systems are deployed across the coast and more fingerlings are required, the need for sustainable sources of seed (fingerlings) becomes of the utmost importance. Future endeavours might utilize government-led hatchery facilities or integrate a specific hatchery area within the cage chamber to ensure scaled operations are not detrimen- tal to wild populations. 156 Calculated from: Ayub, S. (2020). Current minimum wage in Kenya 2020. Tuko Kenya. https://www.tuko.co.ke/281305-current- minimum-wage-kenya-2020.html As a final step, fingerlings are placed inside the compartments and allowed to grow. Growing cycles take 5-6 months, meaning a structure could support 32,000 fish in a year. Wild seaweed is collected and used as food, although experts are researching if a business case exists for buying supplemen- tal food to encourage nutrition and growth. In either case, responsible scaling of the marine-cage-farm sector requires sustaina- ble, non-disruptive feed solutions (whether collected or purchased). During the growth stage, facility staff feed and monitor fish stocks for size and health, routinely check the netting system and anchors, do neces- sary repairs, and ensure security is in place 24 hours/day to protect the harvest. The facility usually sees two people working full-time, one technical manager for daytime shifts, and a security guard at all hours. Beyond staff salaries, farmers are responsible for col- lecting required tools for daily operations like snorkels, brushes, and a record book. Fish are ready to be harvested when they reach 300-400g, and the facility prepares for harvest by purchasing buckets and a weigh- ing scale. At harvest, farmers are obligated to pay a tax to the BMU of 2KES/kg of fish sold. Even with the most conservative profit and loss estimates, a cage farm operating at full capacity under this model stands to make a profit in the first cycle that would pay for the construction costs. During a normal cycle, if the collective profit is spread across a farmer group of 10 people, monthly payments per group member already exceed the mini- mum wage for Kenyan rural labour.156 Cage farming is appealing to fishers be- cause the system eliminates the exercise of Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 56 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya searching for fish schools, and the harvest timing can be controlled. At present, local fishers have a limited window in which to sell their daily catch, otherwise the fish spoil and the effort is wasted. Marine-based fish farming disrupts the current value chain as farmers can produce an exact purchase volume, fresh and of high quality, on de- mand. Assuming 10 farmers were to produce together at full capacity using the Kwale County piloted farming method, rough esti- mates show that the production and harvest capacity per cycle would be more than double the average volume of wild-capture during the same cycle period. Reports from aquaculture cage farming on Lake Victoria also indicate that a fully-stocked cage farm with good management can produce more fish per cycle than what artisanal fishers are seeing with dwindling stocks.157 Furthermore, farming and harvesting can occur year round, which is particularly helpful during rainy sea- sons when the weather makes deep-water fishing dangerous and unproductive. During the months when traditional catch is low, prices increase, so fish farmers stand to take advantage of seasonal pricing. Finfish farming comes with drawbacks, of course. The initial upstart cost requires an investment and cash flow that is prohibitive for an individual farmer. Securing a group loan, encouraging private sector-investment for an outgrower-style model, or identifying less-expensive local building options might make construction more accessible to the fishing community. While farmers benefit from always knowing where their fish are, so does everyone else; fish farming stocks are at great risk of theft.

There are around 50,000 fish traders in Kenya, with 300,000 people employed upstream. The sector also supports the 2 million people in- directly employed,50 effectively touching the lives of over 5%158 of Kenya\u2019s total population. This complex value chain,93,155 with its multitude of actors, service providers, and value-addition remains fairly consistent between artisanal finfish wild-capture and finfish farming for the local market. Production differs (as detailed in Section 6.2), but the basic premise remains the same: the first-stage market actor collects finfish from the water. Fish from the wild and from aqua- culture installations both enter into the mar- ket through the local landing site. Traders converge at the landing site to purchase the day\u2019s catch, as their power within the value chain precludes fishers from selling directly to the market. An important difference to note is the trader relationship with artisanal fishers. Often, traders are the owners of the boats and equipment, and they enter into Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 57 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya exclusive purchasing agreements, generally at market price, with fishers in exchange for leasing the vessel. Farmers who operate without in-kind support from a trader would disrupt this element of the value chain as they would be free to sell to anyone at the landing site. The end market can take many forms. Working backwards, consumption occurs, generally, in one of three locations: at home, in the market, or in a restaurant. Customers who purchase fish to take home to cook usu- ally purchase from a market vendor. Locals who consume freshly-prepared fish in the market purchase a plate from someone like a \u2018mama karanga,\u2019 a woman who processes (by frying) fish on-site for immediate con- sumption. These simple businesses are often relatively informal and occur in the open-air. This business model was among those neg- atively affected by the COVID-19 government curfews, as legal operating hours were dras- tically slashed. At the landing site, a fisher might sell to a trader or directly to a mama karanga, but a mama karanga can also purchase her fish from other stakeholders en-route to mar- ket. Vendors and restaurateurs might also purchase their fresh supplies from the fish brokers, who are intermediaries between the traders and the market-level actors. As such, the value chain for local coastal fish con- sumption can follow several routes, including multi-stakeholder chains (like a fisher - trad- er - broker - market - consumer path), simple chains (like a fisher - vendor - consumer path), and all paths in-between. Common species sold for local-market preparation are rabbitfish and milkfish, and they generally are sold whole and unprocessed through the trader- and broker-levels. Most of the local-level market action happens in daily cycles, as challenging infrastructure and a lack of cold storage limit the potential to retain freshness for extended periods. Tana River government records indicate that, in 2015, up to 20% of fish harvests were lost to poor post-harvest processing.31 The limited freshness window also means that market action is restricted to local geographies, as transportation even to cites like Mombasa require heavy investment in equipment and cooling-enabled vehicles. Some local gov- ernments have provided coolboxes for use throughout the value chain, to help mitigate the challenges of keeping fish catches fresh in the coastal Kenyan heat. As prices vary market-to-market and across seasons, dissecting the exact amount of value retained by each actor becomes an impossible task. However, one example re- corded among fishers, traders, and brokers in Kwale County shows that, after buying from the fishers for an average price of 200 KES/kg, traders sold to brokers at a price of 300 KES/kg. The broker then sold the fish at 350 KES/kg.

Coastal county governments have ear- marked support for mariculture in their County Integrated Development Plans, ranging from establishing marine fisheries96 and hatcheries,30,97,99 to specifically promot- ing cage fish farming.97 Government is also involved from a policy level, including the production of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to get authorization from the National Environment Management Authority (NEMA). At the national level, the government has prioritized the operational- isation of fish quality control laboratories.50 This national-level support underscores the way the government is currently supporting initiatives that \u201cimprove management of pri- ority fisheries and mariculture and increase access to complimentary livelihood activities in coastal communities.\u201d50 These efforts are targeted at governance measures that can ensure \u201clong-term sustainability of fish stocks.\u201d50 6.4. Key challenges and threats For finfish farming to offer a viable alterna- tive to wild-capture fishing, it must address the key challenges that threaten potential success. Value chain analysis: finfish cage farming 59 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya First, construction and initial setup are costly investments. Community mobilization, pri- vate sector or government intervention, or access to appropriate financial instruments is crucial. Unfortunately, the Kwale County Fisheries Director maintains there are no suit- able loan products currently available.93 The farming facility itself also proves to be a risky investment when all of the valuable stock is vulnerable; theft or damage to the facility can mean the difference between a full farm and a completely empty farm. Additionally, the upstart time (at least 7-9 months before the first harvest) can be discouraging for cash-poor farmers who are investing time, energy, and resources while waiting for a payout. Additionally, as fish farming incurs additional costs (like fingerlings, feed, and security), farmers must believe in the value proposition that appears to increase costs without a noticeable market-price benefit. At the local-market, a farmed fish is the same as a caught one. Proof-of-concept must be established for mobilization and community engagement to take hold. Even with community participation, a history of failed development projects proves that col- lective management and group-ownership consistently pose a challenge that impedes long-term success.

Farmers should also be prepared for resistance from traders who currently dominate. Environmental conditions also pose a long-term threat through climate change issues as water temperatures rise and seas become rougher and more dangerous. Fish farming also poses a safety threat, from both sun safety and water safety perspectives. Working on a fish farm structure in deeper water requires adequate swimming ability, appropriate safety equipment, as well as sufficient protection from the sun. Because women traditionally do not have deep-wa- ter training, the sector faces a challenge in making the practice as inclusive as previous pond-based coastal fish farming projects. Certain financial requirements, like capital for investment or land ownership, might fur- ther alienate potential female fish farmers.

Fish farming ventures in coastal Kenya also depend on a system of governance and reg- ulation that is properly planned and properly enforced. At present, the lack of strong re- source management plans poses a threat to the viability of fingerling and seaweed-feed activities. Finally, for a fish farming to truly be a success, their implementation must have a positive impact on the environment. However, the \u201cweak regulatory environment \u2026 around common resources\u201d can lead to \u201cenviron- mental degradation.\u201d162 Assessments from Lake Victoria show that a dramatic increase in scale (170%163 increase in the number of cag- es between 2016 and 2018) has contributed to negative ecological outcomes. Proper site selection, spacing, and waste management systems are critical for the environmental sustainability of a cage system, especially at scale. Additionally, addressing issues around fish bio-wastes could not only drive value and investment in the sector164 but could also reduce environmental harm caused by the value chain. At the coast, Kenya has an opportunity to build and enforce regulatory systems before fish farming booms. 161 Njiru et al., 2019, as referenced in: Rampa, F., & Dekeyser, K. (2020).

Key strengths and opportunities The finfish farming value chain benefits from the strong local demand and the established coastal market for fish. Declining wild stocks make a strong business case for mariculture production. Positively, the Kenyan landscape boasts strong government enthusiasm for fisheries. Local governments are actively supporting the local-market fish value chain in general, as evidenced through provision of supplies.

Increasing wild catch sustainably requires a commercial or government in- vestment in fishing equipment and vessels and better resource management (like the use and enforcement of quotas, more coast guards, and more landing site inspections). On the other hand, fish farming offers high rates of productivity, greater oversight around sustainability of practices, and guar- anteed supply, even during traditionally low- catch seasons. Finally, from a livelihoods perspective, invest- ing in fish farming reduces the volatility and risk of depending on unpredictable, unsafe daily trips to the sea. Fish farming is safer, more stable, and closer to home. For systems that use continual (week-by-week) seeding, farmers can enjoy a continual cash flow, even in seasons that are traditionally unfit for wild-capture. Planning harvests can reduce waste in the finfish value chain, making farm- ers into good stewards of their Blue natural capital resources. By reducing the amount of fishing in Kenya\u2019s coastal waters, finfish aquaculture enables wild populations to re- generate. Farmers also have the opportunity to reinvest some of their developed stock into LMMA or MPA zones to help repopulate struggling species, increase biodiversity, and build better marine ecosystems.

Recommendations 7.1. Way forward for Kenya First and foremost, developing a clear strategy is paramount to ensure success for efforts in the Kenyan Blue Economy. A comprehensive understanding of how Blue Entrepreneurship advances the national agenda will act as a roadmap that outlines plans for when other players join the sector. The opportunity exists to build rapport and support the Blue Agenda by engaging with the government on current initiatives, like the Jumuiya ya Kaunti za Pwani (JKP) Jumuiya Innovation Labs,55 for example. Furthermore, strategic planning must acknowledge and balance the overarching considerations that will impact potential systemic changes for coastal communities; addressing communi- ty and gender dynamics, critically analysing incentive structures, developing good habits for ecosystem management, and investing in extensive measurement and knowl- edge-sharing is essential for all interventions. Finally, the strategy for any venture includes a thoughtful value proposition for participat- ing in ecosystem conservation and rehabil- itation. For any undertaking, it is critical to clearly demonstrate a link between investing in the ecosystem and household-level bene- fits like higher yields, better returns, or more income. Wealth from natural habitats can only be derived from healthy habitats. This report outlines recommendations for the three selected value chains: seaweed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming. The following highlights recom- mendations for individual value chains as well as for the farmer program pilots, the suggestions for which are largely cross-cut- ting with some customization based on specific factors and value chain needs. Seaweed farming The following recommendations promote success within the seaweed farming value chain. Critical for Kenya\u2019s competitiveness as a global seaweed exporter is a growth strategy aimed at maximizing scale. At present, Kenya is not a significant player in the WIO region\u2019s seaweed market, and investing in inclusive mechanisms that attract new farmers and encourage timely planting and harvesting, thereby drawing new exporter attention, is key to success. Proposed strategic levers The research revealed three critical levers to support this vision for the sector: A. Increase production to reach current export capacity B. Draw new exporter entrants to the sector C. Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods Recommendations 64 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya A. Increase production to reach current export capacity The current market chain relies on a solitary buyer and exporter of seaweed, who has recently (within the past 3 years) started building operations in Kenya. The exporter\u2019s stated current capacity is 300 tonnes per year, but present exports are only reaching 80 tonnes per year.90 There is a ready-market to absorb another \u00b14x current farm-level production. At the most basic level, seaweed production hinges on planting as many ropes as possi- ble during the spring-tide, waiting for those seedlings to develop, and harvesting at the appropriate maturity level, some 6 weeks later.

This volume is well within reason, as evalu- ations from Zanzibar seaweed farms show \u201cthe average production per farmer would have been about 100 kg per month.\u201d173 Even closer to home, some Kilifi County farmers interviewed report they were able to achieve 1, 2, and even up to 3 tonnes per year per farm. Increasing production to achieve current export capacity requires no new investment in farm setup or farmer-base expansion; instead, scale hinges on developing a value proposition that encourages farmers to do timely planting and harvesting. However, investing in covered drying facilities close to the farm areas would support production in a number of ways. First, farmers are con- strained by the time and labour required to carry heavy loads for drying. Second, provid- ing a covered space for drying saves labour time, as seaweed that comes into contact with rainwater must be re-processed (that is, taken back to the ocean to be submerged and revitalized in the salt water and then transported and dried again). Covered dry- ing facilities in close proximity can improve efficiency by decreasing production time, as well as reduce post-harvest losses, or more specifically, post-harvest loss of farmer time and labour. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed farmers to produce at maximum capacity \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Improve efficiency with covered drying facility to reduce labour and time required \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for ongoing farmer support and new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Tanzania (specifically Zanzibar) is Kenya\u2019s biggest regional competitor, producing over 103,000 tonnes of seaweed in 201983 \u2022 With similar ecosystems and with an extra 100km of available coastline, Kenya has the capacity to develop its seaweed production volumes and be competitive in the WIO region Recommendations 65 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Inclusivity: \u2022 As over 90% of current Kenyan seaweed farming is done by women, expansion opportunities stand to include even more female farmers in the sector \u2022 Furthermore, opportunity exists to encourage household participation for value-add tasks (like carrying heavy loads and transportation) B. Draw new exporter entrants to the sector High production volume is the best way to flag Kenya as a viable market and encourage new exporter entrants. The influx of new market actors is expected to drive competi- tion and provide farmers with more choice, stronger agency, and higher prices. Kenya has the opportunity to develop production volumes that draw new exporters to the sec- tor. Presuming three is the optimal number of permanent exports, and using C-WEED\u2019s export capacity as an indicator, Kenya must increase current production over 11-fold. Expanding the farmer network, potentially using outgrower models, is the most realistic source of this extra volume. For the exporter, asset investment (like an aggregation/stor- age facility and a commercial-grade baler) is required, in addition to operating costs (like transportation and labour). However, from the perspective of investing in new-farm setup, it is estimated that a seaweed plot op- erating at even moderate productive capac- ity (300kg for 6 weeks) could earn enough revenue to pay for initial farm upstart after only one cycle. This value proposition can encourage additional exporter entrants to support farm setup and expansion efforts. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for seaweed exporters to enter the Kenyan market \u2022 Sensitize communities and expand production base to include additional farming locales \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 An uptick in post-pandemic global price will unlock better margins for incoming exporters coming into Kenya \u2022 As the Kenyan national and coastal governments are prioritizing seaweed as a sector, enabling environments for foreign investment are expected to be favourable Inclusivity: \u2022 Expanding competition among seaweed purchasers is expected to elevate farmgate price, enabling more Kenyan farmers to join C. Scale farming of higher-value species with new production methods The Spinosum (Eucheuma denticulatum) seaweed currently being exported from Kenya is a durable species but with low pric- es. The Cottonii (Kappaphycus alverezii) spe- cies yields a value 3x that of Spinosum, but because of its sensitivity to weather shocks (in particular, higher ocean temperatures and resulting ice-ice disease), Cottonii is much less suitable for near-shore cultivation.

Develop processing and aggregation services at the farmer level to draw more of the market value to the smallholder A. Pilot inclusive farming model to generate proof-of-concept for both local-government and farmer engagement As a first step in developing the sea cucum- ber farming value chain, potential market actors must be convinced of the value and the potential success. Therefore, the entry point of the sector is piloting a sea cucum- ber farming model that works. Upstart investment to the pilot is minimal, including only enclosure supplies and security staff payments. As no hatchery system exists in Kenya, a critical component to the farming pilot is the establishment of a sustainable model for short-term wild-capture of finger- lings. Left with no alternative, the pilot must rely on the ocean for seed resources, but this behaviour must be thoughtful, sustainable, and with only a short-term view in mind. The goal of the pilot is not to exploit the limited wild sea cucumber stocks, but instead, the goal is to prove the business case that will spur private investment in hatchery systems. Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for sea cucumber farmers and local government, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model Recommendations 69 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Kenya\u2019s coast already proves conducive to sea cucumber growth (as evidenced by historically-documented wild stocks) \u2022 As a top producer in the WIO region, Madagascar represents the strongest competition in the sea cucumber market; however, with growing global demand and an unlimited export potential, it seems there is room for unencumbered growth without negative competitive impacts Inclusivity: \u2022 In other countries, sea cucumber production represents an inclusive opportunity (60-80% of farmers are female) \u2022 Seaweed farmers often make the best sea cucumber farmers, as they already spend their time in the ocean, know the tides and the currents, are used to working with commercial partners, and are already aware of the value of these animals B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sea cucumber juveniles Access to fingerlings (that is, access to a close, operational hatchery) is essential for long- term success of a sea cucumber farming industry. Wild-capture fingerling collection is not sustainable in the long-run, so invest- ment in inputs production will unlock sector transformation. Using the SEAFDEC132 model as an example, one community-based hatch- ery, at an investment cost of US$ 30,000 has the potential to generate 300,000 to 500,000 juveniles per year. Factoring in survival rates of sea cucumbers in enclosures, it can be estimated that a fully-functioning commu- nity farm (with access to a fully-functioning hatchery) could raise 100,000 to 150,000 exportable sea cucumbers in that year. At maximum production, and even at the con- servative end of current farmgate prices for fresh sea cucumbers in Kenya, the facility could pay for itself within the first year of operation. Realistically, a community or a pri- vate investor could expect to recoup facility costs by Year 2 or 3 of the project. For every operating year after that, 2 cycles of revenues from sea cucumber sales would cover oper- ating costs of the facility, and the remaining revenues (3 cycles) going toward enclosure upkeep, security, and farmer profit.

Long term sustainability requires investment in fingerling access (through hatcheries) and responsibly-sourced feed. Investing in finfish farming using cage structures in marine sites has the potential to disrupt the current value chain by increasing and controlling production, avoiding restrictive market re- lationships, and reducing pressure on local environments. Proposed strategic levers The research revealed three critical levers to support this vision for the sector: A. Pilot and scale inclusive community- owned farming model to generate proof-of-concept for farmer-owner engagement B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sufficient and sustainable access finfish fingerlings C. Engage with partners (like government, NGOs, research institutions) to build an enabling environment that supports and protects the finfish cage farming industry as it comes to maturation Recommendations 73 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya A. Pilot and scale inclusive community- owned farming model to generate proof-of-concept for farmer-owner engagement The marine-based cage-farming industry is emerging, with KMFRI pilots proving the concept and refining the technical expectations for success. However, it is the investment from private-sector entrants taking up the idea that will drive this value chain to scale. Potential systems include examples of Lake Victoria aquaculture mod- els, whereby groups of farmer-owners pool resources (or access group credit) to invest in construction, stocking, and human resource costs. While keeping small roles (like feeding, records support, or post-harvest processing), the group-ownership model necessitates payment for a site manager, a technical expert charged with rearing the fish to market size, as well as security to keep the stock safe. By designating the responsibility to paid employees, the business model elim- inates the \u2018tragedy of the commons\u2019 effect of group ownership without designated accountability. While government pilot facilities have garnered input costs upward of 600,000 KES for construction, it is estimated that locally-sourced and locally-negotiated construction could be much less expensive. Even with relatively conservative estimates, a cage farm operating at half capacity could repay construction costs after 3 cycles; in a best-case scenario, the facility would be paid off in the first cycle of production. Some Lake Victoria cage models have achieved production levels nearly triple that found in the KMFRI pilots. As finfish mari- culture develops, leveraging best practices from inland systems is likely to increase pro- ductivity of cage systems in the ocean. The Kenyan coast is home to nearly 200 landing sites, the entry points for all marine catches, including mariculture production. Even in a future scenario with 5 cages for each landing site operating at full capacity, fish production would only abate little more than 1% of the annual Kenyan fish deficit. Production potential is then limited by scale (sustainably increasing the number of cages stationed in the ocean), access to inputs (fin- gerlings from a hatchery), and down-stream market constraints (like cold chain and transportation, as the local coastal market is not expected to absorb large-scale increases in production). Opportunity: \u2022 Develop business case for farmer- owners, and by so doing, develop business case for hatchery investment \u2022 Sensitize communities and pilot production model \u2022 Mobilize technical assistance for new farmer upstart Competitive Position: \u2022 Artisanal fishers reliant on wild-capture methods are the main competition among fish destined for local coastal markets \u2022 While farming comes with the burden of facility investment and ongoing costs for inputs and operation, the advantages include: guaranteed production, control over harvest, and ability to operate in poor-weather seasons when prices are higher Recommendations 74 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Inclusivity: \u2022 The deep-sea nature of the cage structure can be prohibitive for female inclusion, as can the capital requirement for investing in the group model \u2022 Interventions should identify drivers of female participation (\u00b125%) among Lake Victoria group-ownership models B. Invest in scalable hatchery model for sufficient and sustainable access finfish fingerlings Current cage systems rely on wild-caught fingerlings as seed for production. From both ecological and supply perspectives, this inputs-system is unsustainable. Critical for long-term success of finfish mariculture is sufficient access to fingerlings.

Engage with partners (like government, NGOs, research institutions) to build an enabling environment that supports and protects the finfish cage farming industry as it comes to maturation The marine fishing industry is already well-established across coastal Kenya; local communities have depended on wild-cap- ture fishing as a source of food security for hundreds of years. While certainly with some costs and risks, these fishing practices, and the associated market structures, are relatively low-cost and deeply entrenched. Marine-based cage farming faces a signif- icant challenge of being competitive in an established market with established norms, especially as there is no price differential at market for farmed fish over wild-caught fish. However, there simply are not enough fish left in the wild, and artisanal fishing cannot continue as-is. Without a shift toward innova- tive practices, local coastal fishing will suffer as supply dwindles, competition from im- ports increases, and actual fishing activities Recommendations 75 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya become more dangerous. New practices that increase sustainable production (like cage farming) are needed, as the strain on the environment (from depleted wild stocks and from unstable ecosystems causing a loss of biodiversity) puts the entire underwater food chain at risk.

It is wise to be prepared for upstart issues (like long upstart time and high upstart costs, particularly for the sea cucumber and finfish farming ventures), as well as mobilization issues (like farmer motivation) and entrepreneurship issues (like farmer professionalisation and business mindset).106,175 Farmer pilot programs also face implementation challenges, particularly around comprehensive technical expertise (like mariculture best practices, growing conditions, site selection, and training) as well as inputs supply and knowledge (like seed, particularly for the sea cucumber and finfish farming ventures). From a govern- ance standpoint, present challenges include access (like sea-use rights), regulation (like over- or under-regulation by the national and county governments), community involvement (like local governance chal- lenges), and security (both for high-value items like sea cucumber and finfish and for easily-damaged farm plots like seaweed). Unpredictable market dynamics threaten any farmer pilot program, and each of the se- lected value chains faces unique challenges. For example, the seaweed value chain is at risk for a potential price drop due to the influx of supply, generated as many tourism-based economies have focused on farming during the COVID-19 pandemic.176,89 Sea cucumber is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a5a64bf-f771-4ad3-a232-f95788b06f7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a5a64bf-f771-4ad3-a232-f95788b06f7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a94c72fe82ac93a8990a93546a3ef31ae688fc283632a65ec1cb0d52e697d55a"}, "3": {"node_id": "824d6909-e7e7-4819-8060-e9245fc447cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b02354e51e92de96cffd191c018714cd47070aec91e0d49d751ab3c3d7013513"}}, "hash": "a50ab2fb571123eae16e21358dd1583e1506665f3b0ba84c0218750604d03a1a", "text": "a high-value item, so market dynamics Recommendations 79 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya are affected by poaching and side-selling. Meanwhile, the domestic finfish markets in Kenya are dominated by traders, so the live- lihoods impacts for fishing and fish-farming households is constrained. Finally, climate change poses an ongoing risk to all select- ed value chains, as rising sea levels, ocean warming, and acidification will continue to alter coastal ecosystems, threatening the long-term stability of investment. To combat these and other challenges, TechnoServe leans on its extensive expe- rience working with a variety of farmers, stakeholders, and value chain market ac- tors. As such, we recommend the following guidance for embarking on farmer pilot programs: \u2022 Begin with sector and community engagement: Initiate farmer pilot program efforts by building relationships and engaging key stakeholders (like government, community, and private- sector partners) to build rapport and gain trust, support, and contextual understanding. Successful interventions will build on existing momentum and enthusiasm as they plan interventions, timing, and support structures that optimize outcomes. In particular, engage government initiatives (like seaweed infrastructure and storage facility construction, sea cucumber research and hatchery planning, and finfish research, hatchery facilities, and infrastructure), both supporting and integrating these efforts for long-term sector-wide success. \u2022 Do thorough Kenya coastline mapping to ensure proper site selection: When identifying priority geographies across the Kenya coastline for farmer pilot programs, explore: \u2022 Space and access factors: Investigate any existing Locally Managed Marine Areas (LMMAs) or Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and assess any potential to leverage these zones and their sea-use access rights. Identify existing governance structures and gaps. Determine if the area is accessible by foot during the spring-tide (particularly important for seaweed and sea cucumber farming). \u2022 Social factors: Prioritize communities that are primed to engage in alternative livelihoods activities. For example, mobilization potential increases if communities are already equipped with mindset and skills of performing non- traditional farming exercises (like collecting octopus). Additionally, build on momentum that exists if communities already demonstrate ecosystem management practices (for example, protection zones or timed fishing closures). Furthermore, selected value chains (like seaweed and sea cucumber) that are expected to target and engage female beneficiaries are more likely to succeed in geographies that are enthusiastic about household-level or collective farming and/or areas that demonstrate support for entrepreneurial and financially- independent women. Finally, a farmer pilot program for fish farming is likely to have better social motivation in areas where wild-catch success is dwindling or limited, as Recommendations 80 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya these areas are more likely to accept the required investment of energy and money in order to develop innovative solutions to local fishing challenges. \u2022 Ecosystem factors: Identify priority geographies whose ecosystems are conducive to program requirements. The mapping phase also includes an investigation of predominant weather patterns and key environmental issues, enabling smart investment in weather- resistant construction. Ecosystem requirements are specific for each of the selected value chains and include the following: \u2022 Seaweed: Villages in Kwale county that are already showing success with seaweed farming indicate that seaweed crops grow best in intertidal zones that are protected from high-energy wave activity and boast relatively regulated water temperatures. Areas with seagrass meadows are often conducive to seaweed farming. \u2022 Sea Cucumber:106,115 Successful sea cucumber farming sites in Madagascar meet the following specifications: 1) \u00b160% coverage by seagrass 2) 15+ centimetres of fine sediment 3) high salinity (no freshwater input) 4) constant water coverage, even during low tide 5) relatively regulated water temperatures 6) protection from high-energy waves and natural predators. Note: capitalizing on ideal ecosystem overlaps, Blue Ventures scaling programs have successfully paired sea cucumber farming pens (closer to shore) side-by-side with seaweed farms (farther out to sea). \u2022 Finfish Farming:155 Current and future cage farming efforts in Kenya are most likely to succeed in ecosystems with relatively regulated water temperatures, protection from rough waves, sufficient current and waterflow to wash the chambers, and suitable ocean depth (\u00b15m during low tide, \u00b113m during high tide). \u2022 Solidify finance and planning to secure inputs during the program setup phase: Ensuring sufficient funding for program setup is critical, as long-term community-level sustainability depends on proof of concept and noteworthy revenues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "824d6909-e7e7-4819-8060-e9245fc447cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "824d6909-e7e7-4819-8060-e9245fc447cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a94c72fe82ac93a8990a93546a3ef31ae688fc283632a65ec1cb0d52e697d55a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8a5a64bf-f771-4ad3-a232-f95788b06f7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a50ab2fb571123eae16e21358dd1583e1506665f3b0ba84c0218750604d03a1a"}}, "hash": "b02354e51e92de96cffd191c018714cd47070aec91e0d49d751ab3c3d7013513", "text": "Programs that benefit from ample startup investment enable success and stability for ongoing business activities that are not dependent on ongoing intervention. \u2022 Secure comprehensive technical expertise: Engage top-quality technicians and industry experts with sufficient local context when choosing innovations and designing curricula.

Then, engage stakeholders who can most Recommendations 81 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya effectively convey this knowledge and train local communities in best practices. For example, the Kenyan government has proven experience training farmers in seaweed (with the help of local and international NGOs) and finfish farming practices. Meanwhile, Blue Ventures has prepared a transferable toolkit of resources174 for interested parties, and the organization has even availed itself to run comprehensive trainings that outlined sea cucumber deployment in Zanzibar, Tanzania.177 \u2022 Facilitate proper governance: Critical to the success of any farmer pilot program is a robust governance structure. At the local level, it is wise to engage communities with setting up and maintaining governance structures, making locally- informed resource management a collective and responsive effort. Resource management strategies might include no-take zones or no-take periods, and community involvement will address potential conflicts with sea-use and marine resources (particularly important for conflicts between seaweed farms and destructive fishing boats). Other programs have found success by entrenching environmental regulations and ecosystem management support into farmer lease agreements,106 for example, including a mandatory collective fund from farmers to pay back into the LMMA / MPA where they are operating. Additional benefits can 177 Vincent, I. & Razafimamonjiraibe, H. (2020, Feb 10). Farmers of the Sea \u2013 Sea Cucumber Farming as an Alternative to Fishing. Reef Resilience Network. https://reefresilience.org/case-studies/madagascar-sustainable-livelihoods/ be found in supporting government and local entities as policies and regulations (like monitoring, population and stock measurement, and market restrictions) are being crafted for emerging sectors. \u2022 Select beneficiaries: While carefully sensitizing communities and thoughtfully selecting beneficiaries for the farmer pilot programs, sector actors can lean on TechnoServe\u2019s 3-pronged approach for female engagement. Ensuring selection is inclusive and representative of all local people and people groups enables buy-in and long-term project success. Some models recommend clan or tribal mapping, then selection quotas are distributed among local leaders for assessment and final decisions.115 \u2022 Consider ecosystem impacts: According to IUCN objectives, a farmer pilot program will not be successful if it does not improve the natural environment. Therefore, any project upstart must carefully assess and monitor proposed interventions and their potential impacts within the selected ecosystems. For example, an increase in the presence of seaweed from farming initiatives might disrupt the amount of UV light that reaches the ocean floor. Additionally, farming practices have potential to disrupt naturally- occuring seagrass meadows, and loose seaweed can negatively impact coral health. Structures like Recommendations 82 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya finfish cages are bound to affect the environments in which they are placed, so it behooves sector actors to examine ecosystem impacts (like UV light and current flow) along with protection measures that might be required. Of course, some ecosystem impacts will, by design, be positive. For instance, providing an undisturbed habitat through seaweed farming has been shown to increase fish populations. This effect in itself must be monitored as changes in animal populations might impact or motivate different community behaviours; all opportunities and incentives must be carefully monitored and addressed. Similarly, providing farmed solutions as alternatives to sea cucumber and finfish wild catch give the ecosystems an opportunity to rest and regenerate. However, as species repopulate, these habitats will likely see increased fishing and dangerous diving activities. Communities might consider regenerative options (like introducing a \u2018throwback\u2019 percentage, where a portion of each harvest is given to the wild for environmental rehabilitation). \u2022 Work with permanent market actors: Engaging key market stakeholders (like traders, processors, and exporters) enables early-stage buy-in and support that can not only maintain energy in the value chain beyond donor funding windows but also distribute benefits across communities. Specifically, current seaweed farming assets (like ropes and boots) are donor-sponsored, and farmers have yet to understand useful life and associated costs. Without market engagement of suppliers and distributors, the projects cannot be assured of farmer financial stability and sustainable livelihoods benefits. Additionally, engaging an array of permanent market actors in the finfish value chain can develop a value proposition that redistributes agency and control away from traders and back to smallholders.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c602c88-c776-4dc2-83f3-f9365135de61": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c602c88-c776-4dc2-83f3-f9365135de61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8bf398a033063cfae7c3e4fe399d04d93f9ae55ae5d4ccea7dda249de9423a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "c62abaec-1d22-4f06-95bd-e0e87907d871", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcea73b9e391d33c3bd916165988b9fa827372931cbcb2eeb3a13532cdaff845"}}, "hash": "d08a223a58f3a173ebff0ae7d02de1c3981d078c83c5536520c84f300cc1067d", "text": "\u2022 Develop comprehensive monitoring and measurement systems during the trial periods, and make data-driven adjustments: Driving sustainable growth for the Blue Entrepreneurship sector requires diligent measurement and mindful adaptation, and it is advantageous to set up innovative, thoughtful models that can be scaled.

By ad- dressing Blue Entrepreneurship with innova- tion and ground-breaking problem-solving, Kenyan coastal communities will benefit from more cost-effective designs, systems that produce maximum output, and con- tributions to global learnings. In addition to scaling up existing enterprises and making them more inclusive, it is imperative to generate and incubate new industry ideas and pair them with teams that have industry expertise at various stages of concept and launch along with access to appropriate investment vehicles. Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture (IMTA) An intriguing concept, and one such innova- tion, might be research into and deployment of marine-based integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) systems. These systems involve farming carefully-selected, mutu- ally-beneficial plants and animals in close proximity in order to \u201ctake advantage of synergistic interactions among species\u201d178 and use a diverse poly-culture approach to restore and conserve coastal ecosystems. With careful site-selection and technical un- derstanding of species interactions, market actors can pioneer models that promote coastal livelihoods and benefit marine ecosystems through harmonious layers of nature-based solutions. 178 Chopin, T.

Opportunity exists to enhance communities and all Blue Entrepreneurship efforts by providing cross-cutting general business training for coastal industries. Providing financial literacy, savings and investment, governance, and management training not only boosts the ef- ficiency of the Blue Economy as a whole, but it helps protect communities and programs from specific risks across seaweed, sea cu- cumber, and finfish farming value chains. Similarly, this type of support benefits coastal communities as they adapt and re- emerge from COVID-19 tourism shutdowns. Spearheading a mindful approach that focuses on environmental and livelihoods resilience will influence Kenya\u2019s tourism sec- tor strategy in a way that builds the industry back better than it was before. IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions To supplement monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) efforts associated with all pilot interventions, all initiatives, actions, and measurements should utilize the IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based Solutions16 before, during, and after execution. The Standard enlists eight criteria to provide \u201cclear param- eters for defining NbS and a common frame- work to help benchmark progress.\u201d Ensuring all efforts align with a recognized standard of care will avoid unintentional harm to ecosys- tems while also building systems that have potential for meaningful impact at scale. Recommendations 84 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya 7.3. Conclusions This scoping study explored an array of functions and sub-functions with the Blue Economy in Kenya and identified three key value chains for priority engagement: sea- weed farming, sea cucumber farming, and finfish farming. This report details dynamics of each value chain and mechanisms for engaging at the community livelihood level, bridging the gap and promoting Kenya\u2019s Blue Entrepreneurship sector. Included rec- ommendations provide a strategic outline to develop the Blue Economy across Kenya and the Western Indian Ocean region by mobilizing investments that promote en- trepreneurship, foregrounding strategies to scale positive environmental impacts and enhance ocean biodiversity, and building on existing momentum that benefits peo- ple, the ocean, and the climate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "653032eb-2055-434b-b9bf-4b67c29f57ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "653032eb-2055-434b-b9bf-4b67c29f57ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Deep-sea Atlas of the Eastern Mediterranean", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e4aa00a2463bcaefcaf4766449948cb501d363b0754d6c5017fa617699e668c"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c8ec3f4-3a18-439e-8945-ef67a9c3936c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/deep-sea-atlas-eastern-mediterranean", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c46539580f82604b51809c7c65aa8d2d0719824318c024855ec774193c5103f0"}}, "hash": "6c1ddcf49b970b8857c3d05e39fee66005d43c23544ac94a31aebc76712993ab", "text": "Appendix 85 Blue entrepreneurship scoping study in Kenya Appendix 179 https://www.kmfri.go.ke/index.php/cb-profile/gatunga 180 https://www.kmfri.co.ke/index.php/component/comprofiler/userprofile/dmirera 181 https://www.nema.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=228&catid=2&Itemid=324 182 https://www.kmfri.co.ke/index.php/cb-profile/smwangi 183 https://www.the-star.co.ke/counties/coast/2019-05-31-coast-regional-bloc-eyes-blue-economy/ 184 https://www.kmfri.co.ke/index.php/cb-profile/bnyonje Appendix 1: Stakeholder interviews The research team conducted stakeholder interviews with the following industry experts, representing local communities, government agencies, NGOs, and others.

Nature-based Solutions (NbS) offer an integrated solution to both climate change and disaster risk reduction challenges; however, to fully deliver on this potential, an understanding of the baseline and identification of opportunities for mainstreaming this innovative approach are required. Considering the administrative, institutional and political structure of B&H, one of the critical obstacles for better planning and understanding the risks posed by climate change and disaster is the lack of analyses that would enable the assessment of impacts and improve long-term planning and adaptation.1 This scoping study, based on the current context in B&H, mapped relevant stakeholders and policies to identify barriers, opportunities and suggest recommendations to secure a just transition to a sustainable future. The following main challenges and related opportunities were identified to be used as a framework for further consultation with relevant stakeholders. \u25cf The key sectors identified for future NbS interventions include agriculture, forestry and water resources; \u25cf The shortage of synchronised, up-to-date and accessible data, especially regarding environmental monitoring at all levels, is a key barrier to understanding the context of NbS in B&H, and a key shortcoming of B&H regarding the EU climate policy. Recommendation: Develop new platforms at the entity levels, coordinated and properly correlated at the state level to better understand the risks and level of exposure, while also identifying locations where NbS implementation of NbS could reduce disasters, \u25cf Barriers to communication and coordination among different levels of decision-makers and policy entities further exacerbate the lack of 1 UNDP, UNEP and GEF (2013). National Adaptation Plans in focus: Lessons from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Project brief. UNDP-UN Environment National Adaptation Plan Global Support Programme. vi accessibility to reliable data. Complex constitutional arrangements and weak communication among institutions are also reflected in the disaster risk management system and mechanisms in the country. Considering the administrative structure of B&H, this study illustrates the great complexity of the current system relevant for mainstreaming NbS, bringing into focus the need for coordination and collaboration among entities and the Br\u010dko District (BD), state and entities, then among different sectors within each entity and governance levels in B&H. Climate change adaptation actions rely on important economic sectors in B&H, particularly agriculture, forestry and water management (AFWM), which are not synchronised and official communication and coordination is insufficient, oftentimes even among departments within the same Ministry. For example, natural disasters are mostly related to the sectors AFWM, while climate change issues, environment and biodiversity are addressed by another entity institution, thereby complicating institutional horizontal and vertical communication. Recommendation: Prioritise showing the case studies and benefits of NbS towards building a common understanding in the relevant stakeholders including a tailor-made minimum framework for understanding NbS at the state and entity levels in B&H. Dedicate sufficient time and efforts to mobilise local community actors and stakeholders, to ensure two-way communication with the public, and to educate and promote concepts and approaches, respecting equal gender inclusion in the process. Further research among various identified interested groups of stakeholders, including reflections on gender and vulnerable groups, should be considered to ensure local knowledge is incorporated into the data. \u25cf Decision-makers including ministries at the state, entity and cantonal levels, and local governments, have limited capacities and formal competencies to integrate climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction (DRR) into their policies and plans. The capacity gap for implementation, other than the economic aspects of a particular measure, requires appropriate policy and strategic frameworks, represents a further challenge. Institutional capacities and policy development are a precondition for environmental vii sustainability, climate action and the introduction of NbS at the state and entity levels in B&H. The most important priority for B&H in addressing climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction, is to strengthen its institutional and professional capacities for developing and implementing climate policy, monitoring indicators for the environment, planning, implementation, reporting and verifying mitigation actions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "322ed338-2300-44ca-bf79-54a9479ee38e": {"__data__": {"id_": "322ed338-2300-44ca-bf79-54a9479ee38e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3bf5273da66c78bbac7d8a775107c2363da9e09ba15fba750dc3bda00993270b"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6023ad2-0524-4487-9918-01a00f8a08bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb3049257dd15122628fd372890d6cdc30af4de6fa011a41d9731235f1496c62"}}, "hash": "3a5aa7c0f58d79f2e91232660c6c782911989d3a8032ac929df6a5ccc0f16ca1", "text": "Recommendation: Organise round tables, workshops and seminars (by the agriculture advisory service, academia, etc.) for local stakeholders, and actively promote NbS as a new opportunity for DRR and climate change mitigation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceb01f38-c16f-495e-b086-9ffbc4f444f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceb01f38-c16f-495e-b086-9ffbc4f444f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd9af494dc55df730ac19a1ee44a888cfe03f5fb7df95f6d4cf3c4e02eb9f2fb"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb345f1a-05fd-4c94-bfa6-a88e99a41113", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0918086e07be27e975451c2decae0ccd4988b017913aa8e0dae34193302d0d6"}}, "hash": "2d421b026e882c4210929604567d4911c234a21c55ca4be51f2e35d9699b588e", "text": "at the local level, with a focus on remote sensing techniques and software. \u25cf Considering the urgency of the climate and disaster risks facing B&H, it is also paramount to start design and implementation of on-the-ground action for strong NbS. The most vulnerable sectors in regards to climate change (CC) and DRR are agriculture, forestry and hydrology and water resources. Recommendation: Identify and analyse the application of NbS in the context of a watershed-based approach to be further explored as a priority. NbS should also be a priority when considered within existing agriculture and forest management as an opportunity for the prevention of floods, landslides, torrents and wildfires. NbS need to be integrated into and applied through the existing state, entity and cantonal policy and institutional framework, mainly in the DRR and CC sectors, and further mainstreamed and incorporated within urban development, agriculture and rural development, land-use, forestry, water management, biodiversity and nature protection, \u25cf NbS are not captured in existing policies nor is this approach institutionalised, and it is quite unknown in B&H. Recommendation: Key institutional partners should work closely with the scientific community and NGO sector to raise awareness about the many benefits of NbS. Capturing local knowledge is very important since many NbS approaches and viii practices are implemented by local people but not documented, and thus they cannot be analysed. ix Acknowledgements I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided me with the possibility to complete this comprehensive report, particular to representatives of the institutions of Republic of Srpska and Federation of BiH, relevant for NbS.

Purpose and methodology of the scoping study The overall purpose of the scoping study (hereinafter: Study) is to provide a state-of-the art overview of the context in regard to the application of Nature-based Solutions approaches for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Moreover, the objectives of this Study are to: 1) understand the existing context, in terms of institutional, policy and legal framework for the application of NbS, 2) provide an overview of the most common natural hazards and disasters in B&H and correlated risks, 3) elaborate on the added benefit of deploying NbS in the given context, 4) identify knowledge, institutional and capacity gaps and barriers for the application of NbS, and 5) provide recommendations and entry points for mainstreaming NbS into national DRR and CC policies and strategies. The Study relies on available and accessible data and information originating from existing policies, programmes and strategies (global, regional and state/entity), considering data collected in past and ongoing initiatives, projects and activities in B&H on Nature-based Solutions for DRR, and impacts on CC and the environment.

The main findings and conclusion of the Study were cross-checked prior to finalisation, including gathering and incorporating inputs and suggestions of stakeholders and partners. In addition to feedback from relevant stakeholders and other actors across various sectors on the identified priorities and potential pilot sites proposed for B&H, this process contributed to 2 knowledge building and awareness raising through the sharing of data and information on the current state of affairs regarding disaster risks, climate change impacts and the identification of opportunities presented by the application of NbS. This Study has been developed under the auspices of the project ADAPT: Nature-based Solutions for resilient societies in the Western Balkans, funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) and implemented by IUCN. 1.1 The ADAPT Project The ADAPT: Nature-based Solutions for resilient societies in the Western Balkans project aims to increase ecosystem and community resilience to climate change and environmental degradation in the Western Balkans. This regional umbrella initiative works with the six Western Balkan economies, regional and local partners. ADAPT aims to introduce Nature-based Solutions as a contribution to reducing environmental degradation and increasing climate resilience, including social equity and gender equality, in the Western Balkan region. In order to achieve balanced results and realise a positive long- term impact on communities and ecosystems in the region, the project has strong regional and national components. Regionally, it focuses on aligning NbS and DRR policy, knowledge generation and sharing, capacity development and networking, while the focus at the national level is on national policy, stakeholder engagement and demonstration through pilot NbS projects. The project is implemented through the following three strategies: \u2714 Enhance knowledge and awareness of Nature-based Solutions for disaster risk reduction among decision makers, natural resource managers and local communities, with a specific focus on gender; \u2714 Integration of Nature-based Solutions and equitable climate-smart planning into adaptation and disaster reduction policy; and \u2714 Implementation of Nature-based Solutions for disaster risk reduction and their scale- up. 3 2. Introduction The Western Balkans has been recognised as a natural disaster hotspot in Europe facing ongoing climate change.2 Research has shown that Balkan countries along the Danube River will experience a 'progressive and strong increase in overall climate hazards',3 and that the Western Balkans is a highly vulnerable region in Europe for climate change and its environmental impacts. Meanwhile, the Western Balkans is also a uniquely biodiverse region of Europe, consisting of a diversity of ecosystems. It is these ecosystems that play a vital role in sustaining society with significant potential to address development concerns through NbS. Though NbS have the potential to address societal challenges such as human health, economic and social development, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss, food security and water security, this Study focuses on the links to CC adaptation and DRR. In the European Environment Agency report on climate change,4 South East Europe (SEE) has been recognised as extremely vulnerable to climate change effects due to the frequent and disastrous floods, drought and wildfires in the past decade. According to the climate scenarios provided by the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) study on climate change in the Western Balkans in 2018,5 a temperature increase of 1.2\u00baC is expected over the whole territory in the next decade, with further warming by 1.7\u20134.0\u00b0C, depending on the global effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is a serious and pressing call for the whole region, including B&H, to focus on possible mitigation and adaptation measures. The priority for these measures should be given to the most affected sectors, particularly AFWM. This is an urgent priority and also an opportunity to introduce Nature-based Solutions (NbS) and complementary measures in key sectors to reduce the risks posed by natural hazards, to benefit biodiversity, and to protect human well-being. 2 European Environmental Agency (2017).Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in Europe.

NbS are \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits.\u201d - IUCN Resolution (WCC 2016 Res 069) 4 The main natural disasters affecting B&H, such as floods, droughts, forest fires, torrents, landslides and heatwaves, have been identified in different strategic documents and reports.6 These events are anticipated to become more frequent and severe in the future, due to the increased impacts of climate change. The 2017 World Risk Report7 ranked B&H as a country of high exposure to natural hazards, with 91 of 145 local governments considered to be under very significant risk of floods and landslides, and 27 under high risk. This was reiterated in the 2020 World Risk Report,8 where B&H was identified as the country with the highest vulnerability in Europe, together with Moldova, Albania, North Macedonia and Azerbaijan. Already in May 2014, B&H suffered the worst floods in the last 120 years that affected 30% of the territory, causing 2,000 landslides, killing 23 people, and disturbing several minefields further exposing the population to risks from unexploded landmines.9 These impacts once again showed how vulnerable the people of B&H are to disasters. The May 2014 floods and landslides caused an estimated BAM 2.79 billion damage to infrastructure, agriculture, public institutions and the local economy. One of B&H\u2019s greatest challenges is repairing the damage and restoring living conditions for the millions of people affected by these floods, while stressing the pressing need for significant investment, focus and attention into disaster prevention and preparedness. This need is currently being somewhat addressed by various programmes and projects in B&H supported by international donors. For example, the programme \u201cDisaster Risk Reduction for Sustainable Development in B&H\u201d that started in 2018 addresses the key priorities in disaster risk reduction as identified by local authorities and various actors in the different sectors, such as protection and rescue, education, social and child protection, health and agriculture. The programme places particular emphasis on improving local coordination mechanisms in DRR, and on affirmation of the strategic risk planning process, especially for the most vulnerable categories of the population.10 Currently, nation-wide funding for DRR accounts for only 0.5% of GDP, which further reduces the local capacity to invest in research to better understand climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.11 6 \u010custovi\u0107, H. and Lju\u0161a, M.

Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. 6 For example, water management practices based on NbS offer strategies to maintain the hydrological cycle as close to the natural state as possible, while balancing human needs and addressing water security. Other examples show that while reducing the occurrence of floods, landslides and drought, NbS also improves mitigation and adaptation to global changes (including both land-use and climate change) and provides services for maintaining and restoring ecological functions.16 The biodiversity and development benefits achieved by application of the NbS concept contribute to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals and development of circular economy.17 Various approaches can support the application of NbS in different fields, such as green infrastructure, which includes a network of natural and designed landscape components with an important role of water regulation, flood risk mitigation and management,18 and reduction of water pollution. Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR) and Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) are two examples of relevant approaches specific to societal challenges of DRR and CCA and mitigation. It is equally important to implement measures facilitating the practical implementation of NbS through policy development and enforcement, stakeholder involvement and capacity building of national institutions 16 Ferreira, C., Poto\u010dki, K., Kapovi\u0107 Solomun, M., Kalantari, Z.

Some multilateral development banks have already started to recognise that the economic recovery from COVID-19 is an opportunity to both tackle the climate crisis and build higher societal resilience through nature. A growing range of NbS exists, for which real-world experience and expertise are available, that could effectively be harnessed to create employment while simultaneously protecting nature, mitigating climate change, and making human societies safer, healthier and more resilient. NbS provide cost-effective approaches that could contribute to achieving a number of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to poverty, food and water security, human health and climate action.31 OVID-19. 3.4 Biodiversity and ecosystems The ratio of the number of species to the total surface area of the country indicates that it is among the most biodiverse countries in Europe. B&H has a particularly rich biodiversity due to its location being influenced by three distinct geological and climatic regions: (i) the Mediterranean region, (ii) the Euro Siberian-Bore American region, and (iii) the Alpine-Nordic region. Landscapes can be further classified into Mediterranean, sub-Mediterranean, Mediterranean-mountain, Pannonian, peri-Pannonian, upland, relic-refugial, wetland and karst fields. As a result of its unique orography, geological surface, hydrology and eco-climate, B&H has among the highest diversity of species of plants and animals in Europe. The vascular flora includes about 5,000 confirmed taxa of species, subspecies, and variety and form levels. As much as 30% of the total endemic flora in the Balkans (1,800 species) is found in the territory of B&H. In relation to the status of biodiversity information, some progress has been achieved since 2011 when RS established the register of Protected Areas. Eight documents developed after 2011 present data about the status of biodiversity using 15 relevant indicators, and in 2018, the List of environment indicators for B&H included 21 indicators for biodiversity. The B&H Agency for Statistics included three indicators for biodiversity in their 2013 statistical report. However, new areas of special importance to biodiversity and new unique aspects of biodiversity have not been identified since 2011. Unique aspects of biodiversity in protected areas that most likely contain new (undiscovered) species are still undocumented.32 Bosnia 31 WWF and ILO (2020).

During the last two decades, there has been a slight increase in annual precipitation nationwide, with increasing seasonal variation. This increased variation and changes in the distribution of rainfall, combined with rising temperatures have resulted in both floods and droughts.38 Over past decades, climate change has contributed to extreme weather events; for example, the years 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015 were considered very dry to extremely dry, while the floods of 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, and 2014 severely impacted the country\u2019s economy, people and environment.39 These events are predicted to become more severe and frequent in the coming decades.

Another significant threat to forest ecosystems is the increase in forest fires. In terms of biodiversity within forest ecosystems, the changes in precipitation and water availability will likely also have an effect on fauna communities by leading to concentrations of certain populations in specific areas and increasing their vulnerability to pathogens.

Rome, Italy: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 15 Mediterranean forests of B&H are threatened by changes in soil chemistry, with decreased pH levels that will not support the current species. The greatest threat will be to the oaks, which mostly grow at low altitudes (less than 860 m). The threats can undoubtedly cause shifts in species distribution ranges. Another issue in terms of biodiversity and forest areas is related to protected areas. Bosnia and Herzegovina has only a very small area protected under IUCN categorisation (less than 1% of the territory), which is far below the regional averages and the natural potential of the country. Due to climate change, there is a possibility that in the future, these already insufficiently small areas might fail to protect the target species, features and processes. This calls for a reassessment of existing protected areas with their possible expansion, as well as the inclusion of new areas in the network, taking forest ecosystems of high conservation value into account. 3.7 Disaster risks Due to its specific natural characteristics and climate, B&H is frequently affected by various natural hazards, including floods, droughts, landslides, storms and extreme temperatures (Figures 6 and 7).42 Disasters significantly affect the B&H economy. For example, in May 2014, 90,000 people were displaced and some 81 municipalities were affected by floods. The total cost of damage and losses was over EUR 2 billion, which is equivalent to 15% of the country\u2019s GDP in 2014. Over half of the damage occurred in the Federation of B&H, which was estimated at EUR 1.04 billion, while the damage in the RS was about EUR 0.97 billion and in BD EUR 0.30 billion. The agriculture sector was most affected, with total agricultural damage and losses calculated at EUR 140 million, of which EUR 78 million was in damage and EUR 62 million was in losses.43 The risks are not uniform across the country and vary from region to region depending on the type of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity. 42 UNEP (2017).

Key natural hazard statistics in B&H with number of people affected, for the period 1985\u20132018 (Source: World Bank)44 3.7.1 Floods Floods are the most frequent natural disaster affecting B&H. They are usually caused by overflowing rivers, most often in spring and autumn. A recent history of flood events in B&H showed that several major floods have affected the country, including 1976 when three floods affected 43 of 109 municipalities, and in April 2004 that affected 300,000 people in 48 municipalities and 20,000 hectares of farmland.45 A few years later, in December 2010, the country experienced one of the largest precipitation events recorded in the past century that caused extensive flooding.46 Heavy rainfall in May 2014 led to devastating floods across the Balkan region, hitting B&H and Serbia the hardest and causing great economic consequences and the loss of human life. In addition to climate change, flood control facilities damaged in the Bosnian war (1992\u20131995) is another reason for weak and insufficient flood mitigation and control. Currently, flood protection infrastructure is also not regularly maintained, especially along the Sava and Bosna Rivers. Human impacts, such as deforestation (particularly during and after the war) is another reason why heavy rains often result in extensive inundation and flooding across the country, while illegal construction of houses by refugees in flood-prone areas stand directly in the path 44 Climate Knowledge Portal [website].

Average annual natural hazard occurrence in B&H for the period 1900\u20132018 (Source: World Bank)48 Drought was identified as a key driver of land degradation in B&H in the UNEP 2017 Action Program to Combat Land Degradation and Mitigate Drought Effects.49 Drought is a particularly severe problem in regions with intensive agriculture production, and in southern B&H where it creates the preconditions for frequent wildfires.

Damage caused by drought on maize alone in 2012 compared to production from earlier years (2004, 2005 and 2006) was 350,000\u2013400,000 tonnes of grain. During that year, crop and grain yields were reduced by 40 to 50%, and meadow and pasture yields were also reduced by about 60%. The most recent drought hit B&H in the summer of 2017, which substantially impacted all agricultural subsectors. Unfortunately, the entity governments decided not to conduct a detailed assessment of the damage and losses, due to the lack of financial resources for compensation.

This is also the case when investigating pressures on biodiversity and ecosystem services where genders may play different roles in conservation, sustainable management and protections, as well as in activities that threaten biodiversity and ecosystems such as activities in infrastructure and agriculture. According to the 2019 Labour Force Survey, unemployment affects women to a greater extent in B&H: the average unemployment rate is 15.7% (13.6% men; 18.8% women), particularly affecting the 15\u201324 cohort (31.3% for young males and 37.9% for young females). The employment and activity rates show a similar gender difference: 35.5% women and 42.1%", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9120486b-043e-4c2d-a8f8-8067a6710b8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9120486b-043e-4c2d-a8f8-8067a6710b8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a9152c6a4a14a4a54e71d50c650c79a5317bd932d7a3a91eda21182454a5b02"}, "3": {"node_id": "3319a2d3-8a56-4ead-b0f4-98f7fec232d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1227a799573c941b2910ee4cf801407d18986cfbbaaf85d43ca1b8442772883b"}}, "hash": "74afa2ba9171e3d16686b5cafa5579c99350d2e91b8c5471592005dfd94a9e79", "text": "men. The gender gap is relatively high, and so are the disparities between entities. The absence of coordination between entities and the lack of an active labour market measures targeting women are likely the key causes of this problem. Additionally, social contribution rates contribute to a high tax on the labour earnings of low-income earners, resulting in a disincentive to work for this category and for their employers to formalise employment, therefore often confining them, especially women, to informal work.60 Bosnia and Herzegovina is a traditional society in which women struggle for a better position every day. Regular stereotypes about the role of women in society, lower wages and longer periods of unemployment are just a few of the problems faced by women in B&H. Their activities and livelihoods have also been seriously affected by climate change and natural disasters in the recent decade. The process of introducing gender equality in all areas of social life in B&H requires, above all, awareness raising and increasing knowledge about the causes and consequences of gender-based discrimination, and acknowledgment of the benefits and added value of taking a gender-inclusive approach (a central component of NbS according to the IUCN Global Standard for NbS). In the last ten years, significant efforts have been made in B&H to develop a domestic legal, institutional, and policy framework for the application of the principles of gender equality, which are largely in line with international standards. However, gender equality is still not treated as a priority of development and other strategies and is still considered a matter that concerns only women. 60 World Bank [website].

Stakeholder analysis The institutional structure in B&H is complicated; the B&H Constitution states that the country is decentralised, consisting of two entities: FB&H and RS. Each entity has its own constitution, government and parliament, its own budget, and it acts independently. In addition, there is BD, which is located in the north-eastern part of the country and is by decree independent from the two entities. BD operates under the administrative rule of the BD government and under the exclusive sovereignty of B&H. In addition, FB&H is made up of ten cantons, each consisting of municipalities. Cantons also have their own governments and parliaments, which can develop policies and adopt laws pertaining to their competences, managing their own budgets, and act independently. RS is not divided into cantons. Mainstreaming Nature-based Solutions into policy and strategic frameworks and their successful implementation depends on stakeholder awareness, interest and understanding of the importance of NbS for CCA and DRR. Since B&H is a complex country in the administrative sense, it is very important to identify and analyse the role of and relations among each stakeholder at the state and entity level to identify opportunities and barriers. In addition, due to the interdisciplinary nature of NbS, they can be applied in different sectors including agriculture, forestry, water management, biodiversity, spatial planning and urban development. Different institutions are interconnected with their formal competencies and jurisdictions over several of these sectors; some are responsible for policy framework development, while others are involved in implementation. Parts of these strategic and policy frameworks are closely related to NbS, DRR and CCA, so a wide range of institutions and stakeholder groups are influential in mainstreaming the NbS concept. Thus, an important aspect of this analysis is the identification and recognition of stakeholder competencies and their potential influence on mainstreaming the NbS concept in B&H and its entities. The administrative structure of B&H illustrates the great complexity of the current system relevant to the mainstreaming of NbS, and highlights the need for stronger coordination and collaboration among entities and BD, the state and entities, and then also among different sectors under each entity and at different governance levels in B&H. For example, at the state level, MoFTER is a coordination institution, where NbS are relevant for the work of the Department for Water Resources, the Department for Environmental Protection, and the Department for Agriculture, Food, Forestry and Rural Development. At the entity level, the situation becomes even more complex, particularly in FB&H where each of 24 the ten cantons has its own government and ministries, with some assigned to NbS through their jurisdictions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3319a2d3-8a56-4ead-b0f4-98f7fec232d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3319a2d3-8a56-4ead-b0f4-98f7fec232d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a9152c6a4a14a4a54e71d50c650c79a5317bd932d7a3a91eda21182454a5b02"}, "2": {"node_id": "9120486b-043e-4c2d-a8f8-8067a6710b8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74afa2ba9171e3d16686b5cafa5579c99350d2e91b8c5471592005dfd94a9e79"}}, "hash": "1227a799573c941b2910ee4cf801407d18986cfbbaaf85d43ca1b8442772883b", "text": "In RS, the competencies relevant for NbS application are divided amongst sectors within a single ministry, and also among different ministries.

In comparison, the only institution at the state level with jurisdiction in environmental issues is the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations (MoFTER), while environmental legislation operates at the entity and BD level. All international agreements and projects are coordinated through the MoFTER. Due to this complex structure, monitoring any component of the environment relies on the entity institutions, with coordination at the state level. This analysis is a brief overview of the most important groups of stakeholders related to NbS, and their possible roles and positions. Considering the scope of this study and the administrative complexity of B&H, it was not possible to develop a detailed analysis on DRR impacts through the implementation of NbS at the cantonal and local level; the analysis was limited to the state and entity levels. Therefore, further research among various relevant groups of stakeholders, including reflections on gender and other especially vulnerable groups, should be considered. 5.1 Primary stakeholders \u2013 decision-making level The state level decision-making institutions (e.g., MoFTER, Ministry of Communications and Transport) and entity level government bodies (primarily line ministries responsible for forestry, water management, agriculture, climate change, DRR and environmental protection in both entities and BD) together form the most important stakeholder group of institutions in regards to policy and strategy development, planning and monitoring. In FB&H, each of the ten cantons and their relevant government bodies and ministries responsible for forestry, water management, agriculture, climate change, DRR and environmental protection are relevant for NbS. These institutions represent key entry points for mainstreaming NbS into the existing policy and strategic framework. Besides ministries, other institutions relevant for DRR and NbS are also important, such as the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management that assign tasks to public enterprises for the drafting of and monitoring of forest operational plans that are important for DRR and future introduction of NbS-related programmes and projects. The actors at the local decision-making level (cities and 25 municipalities) are also identified as important partners (particularly those threatened by natural hazards in B&H), but due to the scope of this study they will not be analysed in detail. 5.2 Secondary stakeholders \u2013 operational level Professional institutions, public enterprises and local communities are critical for the implementation of NbS measures, particularly the local communities most affected by disasters. Others may have a lack of interest as they do not perceive themselves as being frequently affected by natural hazards. However, climate change is a phenomenon that underpins disasters across B&H, meaning the interest in this topic in each local community is likely to grow in the future. Local governments are champions in the field of implementation of NbS, so their leaders and associate departments should be involved in the process of mainstreaming NbS actions on the ground. On the other hand, public enterprises mandated with environmental work have key operational roles related to NbS. For example, public enterprises mandated to manage forests are the main operational institutions responsible for afforestation, restoration of wildfire affected areas, forest fires and illegal cutting, while public institutions for water management maintain water quality, flood protection, and watershed and river basin management. Both of these public enterprises are key operational institutions that should be further acknowledged and engaged in the application of NbS throughout B&H. An example of the complexity of the context in B&H is taken from the forestry sector, where the public forest enterprises in B&H (only at entity and cantonal levels, without local public forest management enterprises) are as follows: in RS: public enterprise \u0160ume Republike Srpske Sokolac; and in FB&H: Federal Forestry Administration, and the public enterprises or forestry management companies (Sarajevo \u0161ume in Sarajevo, \u0160umsko-privredno dru\u0161tvo Zeni\u010dko-dobojskog kantona in Zavidovi\u0107i, Hercegbosanske \u0161ume in Kupres, \u0160umsko-gospodarsko dru\u0161tvo \u017dupanije Zapadnohercegova\u010dke in BRIGHT EXAMPLE The NGO Centre for Environment Banja Luka actively advocates the importance of increasing of the number of protected areas and public involvement in decision-making processes related to the management of natural resources and protected areas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9058555-96a9-4bae-b24f-61385daebfbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9058555-96a9-4bae-b24f-61385daebfbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "74a9a2e5cf9a05eac7d80031625beb4d9c049fd015f0c479bfbb55d4b3e8a174"}, "2": {"node_id": "ade8032b-8130-4676-a462-0299fb80b924", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3faba9a20007eae58a233f01d3b5c2ee1b0a4aa0e28f9ddc6e703397bc2b453f"}}, "hash": "2b3e91a96082cf81cddaa3f99e40a1100898f3bb4dbd030c3f250636d278ea70", "text": "Activities aim to achieve institutional communication, enriching cross- sectoral cooperation to preserve the environment, introduce sustainable management of protected areas and natural resources, and draw public attention to the need for active participation in decision-making on nature conservation. 26 Posu\u0161je, \u0160ume Tuzlanskog kantona in Kladanj, Unsko-sanske \u0161ume in Bosanska Krupa, Bosansko-podrinjske \u0161ume in Gora\u017ede, \u0160ume Sredi\u0161nje Bosne/Srednjobosanske \u0161ume in Donji Vakuf and \u0160ume Hercegova\u010dko-neretvanske in Mostar).

Another important group of stakeholders are women, youth and socially vulnerable groups who are at a particular risk for disasters and the effects of climate change in rural areas. These groups should be considered separately and with particular attention. There are many great examples of civil societies and NGOs actively involved or leading actions important for promoting and mainstreaming of NbS. In Table 4, relevant stakeholders are assessed in terms of their importance and influence and their primary role in the application of NbS.

Key stakeholders for Nature-based Solutions The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of RS (focal institution for UNCCD), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of FB&H, and the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of BD are the key institutions responsible for reporting to UNCCD (the most recent report was submitted in 2018) on the implementation of the process of Land Degradation Neutrality, agriculture and forest management, flood protection and water management at the entity, district and cantonal levels in B&H. The Departments for water management within these ministries are in close cooperation with water agencies in charge for the flood protection infrastructure and flood control planning. They also coordinate international water management through different programmes and projects, with particular focus on flood risk assessment and mapping methodologies. They also focus on hydrological drought management and provide advice on the accumulation and flows regimes if water levels are low. Flood control in watersheds is organised and implemented by the public water management companies (public enterprise Vode Republike Srpske, Water Agency for the Sava River District, and Water Agency for the Trebi\u0161njica River District in RS; Agency for Watershed of the Sava River and Agency for Watershed of the Adriatic Sea for FB&H. These companies are directed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management and local self-government units within their territories. By comparison, water and flood management of level 2 watercourses are within the mandate of local governments which are endorsed for preparation of Flood Risk Management Plans (e.g., for the Vrbas River with the support of UNDP), implementation of flood control measures, and during emergencies to coordinate and lead operational activities with support of higher- level decision-making institutions (republic level in RS, and cantonal and federal level in FB&H). They are also responsible for coordination and evaluation of contingency infrastructural works and managing technical, human and financial resources. The main responsibility for monitoring drought and heatwaves lies with the hydrological and meteorological institutes of both entities, but to date no early warning system and drought preparedness system has been officially established or made functional. Drought is addressed by the Department of Agriculture within the same ministries, while forestry related issues are the concern of the Departments of Forestry. The Ministry of Environment and Tourism of FB&H (UNCBD focal institution) and the Ministry of Spatial planning, Construction and Ecology of RS (UNFCCC focal institution) are the main government institutions responsible for the coordination of the 31 process of preparation of National Communications toward UNFCCC and Biennial Update Reports, development of reports toward UNCBD and for overall compliance and coordination with UN Conventions and EU climate/biodiversity policy requirements. Climate change adaptation and mitigation are important issues reflected in those reports, and also when examined from the perspective of disaster risk (particularly floods, drought, wildfires and landslides) as a manifestation of climate change. The Fourth National Communication and Third Biennial Update Report for B&H under the UNFCCC is under preparation and it is expected to be submitted in 2022. Public forest enterprises, such as the public enterprise \u0160ume Republike Srpske (Forests of Republic of Srpska) is under the authority of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management of RS, and is entrusted with the management of public forests over the total area of 1,100,268 ha.61 The organisational structure covers 26 forest management units that in places align with the territory of RS municipalities and cities. The Centre for Karst Management, Centre for Seed Nursery Production, and Research-Development Centre act as organisational units within the public enterprise. Sustainable forest management is the main aim of this enterprise, which holds a Forest Stewardship Certificate awarded by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Forest certification is a market-based conservation initiative that aims to promote the environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of forests. These certificates are revised and re-confirmed every four years. The public forest enterprise creates and implements forestry strategy in accordance with the Law on Forests (Official Gazette of RS 75/08), which is currently in the drafting process for period the 2022\u20132032. The federal Forestry Management of FB&H is the main institution at the entity level, and it coordinates with all ten cantonal public forest enterprises aiming to provide sustainable forest management throughout the entire territory.

Local Self-government Units (cities and municipalities) also have a mandate for environment protection and protection from natural and other disasters (Article 8, Law on Principles of Local Self-Governments of FB&H; Article 11, Law on Local Government and Self- government of RS 98/13). They also perform other duties and services delegated through the legislation\u2019s provisions in the areas of protection and rescue from natural disasters, firefighting, etc. 33 7. Nature-based Solutions in policy frameworks Nature-based Solutions are actions that work with and enhance nature to help address societal challenges. The concept is grounded in the knowledge that healthy natural and managed ecosystems produce a diverse range of services on which human wellbeing depends. NbS is an \u2018umbrella concept\u2019 for other established nature-based approaches, such as ecosystem-based adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk reduction, green infrastructure in urban areas and natural climate solutions. They therefore offer a major opportunity for innovation, with possibilities to deliver lasting and tangible benefits across different social groups, in a range of environmental, economic and cultural settings (Figure 2). For B&H, this is a relatively new approach, arising from different international and regional agreements, frameworks and conventions that influence and provide provisions for NbS globally guiding state and entity actions. NbS are not explicitly recognised in existing state and entity policy framework in B&H, while many strategic documents and international reports in the country (NDCs, Natural Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), Action Programme to Combat Land Degradation and Mitigate Drought Effects in B&H (AP), Land Degradation Neutrality Reports) are focused on nature-based measures, approaches and interventions; in other words, they use the approaches that fall under the NbS umbrella without explicitly defining them as \u201cNature-based Solutions\u201d. This means that NbS should first be understood by the main stakeholders, then mainstreamed into policy and legislation framework, and later deployed at the operational level in the areas of forestry, agriculture, agroforestry, biodiversity, ecosystem conservation and restoration. NbS can combine climate change mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity conservation, restoration, and sustainable resource management measures to achieve outcomes that are fundamental for the maintenance of the economy and livelihoods in any context. This chapter provides an overview of the existing policy frameworks related to NbS in B&H, including climate and DRR, forestry, water management, biodiversity and other relevant policies. 7.1 Existing policy and institutional frameworks Considering that NbS is a new approach, the legislative framework in B&H does not recognise it explicitly. On the other hand, many strategies and legislation recognise the importance of ecosystem services and the role of ecosystems in preventing disasters and reducing disaster risks, and therefore NbS-related policies and strategies will be presented, jointly with relevant international commitments and ratified conventions. 34 7.1.1 Climate change policy framework B&H has ratified many international agreements related to recognition of the influence of climate change on ecosystem services and disaster risk reduction, including the UN Conventions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0124dc76-83f8-4a69-a072-3192e99e6b47": {"__data__": {"id_": "0124dc76-83f8-4a69-a072-3192e99e6b47", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b6d050ca6dddd4a4a36ad1c17c5c8741c21cf2e646dd0cb1ce30b733a4f61ae"}, "2": {"node_id": "8345dd28-fbac-4aea-a3a1-b6e75523bd18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55fa5594c00edd683b439e8f57d77a1dc9e51f43c728b1c55feeddce691952c5"}}, "hash": "e1f3072d632253b408b26087ba3d8164b3ab40706e87cdcd26c6f0da96edbb6c", "text": "B&H ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC (Official Gazette of B&H 19/00) in 2000, which provides a global framework to help countries cope with the adverse effects of climate change.

The main gaps and challenges recognised in these reports focus on the institutional and financial constraints together with human resources issues. The key institutional constraints are: conflicting and overlapping mandates, poor coordination and lack of efficient agreement. According to the Dayton Agreement and the Constitution of B&H, the implementation of environmental policy in B&H falls within the competence of the entities and the district government in BD. The state level Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina is endorsed for the fulfilment of international obligations of B&H in the field of environmental protection, while the responsibility under the UNFCCC and development of the National Communications of B&H rests with the UNFCCC Focal Point that belongs to the Ministry of Physical Planning, Civil Engineering and Ecology of RS. In B&H, jurisdiction of the state administration in environmental and natural resources matters covers only international cooperation and the necessary coordination with prior approval of the entities. There is no overall supervision of the environment and data collection system, resulting in a lack of systematic information on environmental protection. For the time being, different institutions collect different data without sufficiently developed coordination and unified databases. Data exchange and communication between institutions collecting data and governmental organisations is insufficient, and there is no information exchange on 62 UNDP (2010).

Administrative capacity in the environmental sector in B&H is quite low and requires additional support and capacity building, not only to identify climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in B&H, but also to build capacity for coping with disaster risk under different climate regions. In the official communications of B&H under the UNFCCC, it is recognised that strong climate extremes impact the most sensitive sectors, such as agriculture, forestry, water resources and protected areas, together with the impacts of natural disasters in B&H, where floods, drought, wildfires and landslides are the most important ones. For example, the Third National Communication to UNFCCC highlighted that vulnerability assessments were made for the following sectors: agriculture, forest ecosystem, biodiversity and sensitive ecosystems, hydrology and water resources, tourism and human health. Possible adaptation measures for these sectors were developed, with the aim of mitigating the effects of climate change (particularly extreme events and natural disasters occurring in the recent decade). Additionally, B&H developed the Climate Change Adaptation and Low Emission Development Strategy for B&H adopted in 2013,65 prepared more as a framework than a detailed operational plan specifying all necessary actions. The need to strengthen capacities is identified in this Strategy as an important assumption for combatting climate change; i.e., institutional and staff training with development and improvement of meteorological monitoring. It is recommended that the relevant environmental and air protection laws be revised in accordance with general requirements of EU Directive (EU) No 525/2013 on the mechanism for monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions, to harmonise statistical data and methodology with IPCC methodology requirements. In the framework of the Paris Agreement and in light of updating of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC), the existing INDC indicators have been analysed.

B&H has already prepared its NAP with the support of Green Climate Fund that provides financial resources (up to USD 3 million) to UNFCCC Parties for establishment of planning and implementation processes for adaptation measures and actions, including development of NAPs. Considering the obligations under the UNFCCC, the process of harmonisation with the EU Acquis and the high vulnerability of the region, development of legislation could significantly contribute to better adaptation planning and its integration into all relevant sectors. Moreover, joint identification of vulnerability and adaptation possibilities, which is the main scope of this Study, and the implementation of adaptation actions and measures at the regional level, could ensure climate resilience and sustainable development not only of B&H, but also of all economies in the WB region. According to the official documents,67,68 the most important priority for B&H in climate change mitigation is to strengthen its institutional and professional capacities which would support development and implementation of climate policy, monitoring greenhouse gas emissions, and planning, implementation, monitoring, reporting and verification of mitigation actions (Table 5). Unfortunately, the negative consequences of climate change are already visible in B&H, even though the country contributes little to the causes of climate change. The country per capita emissions are nearly half the EU average: 5.18 tons CO2 equivalent per capita per annum in 2008, compared to the EU average of 9.93 tons. But if relative wealth is considered, then B&H\u2019s emissions are almost four times higher than those of the EU. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP were 1.59 kg CO2 equivalent per EUR in 2008, while the EU average was 0.4 kg per EUR. According to a European Commission Report, \u201cBosnia and Herzegovina is at an early stage of preparation/has some level of preparation in the area of environment and climate change. A countrywide harmonized approach in strategic planning needs to be ensured to address alignment with the EU environmental acquis at all levels of government in a consistent and comprehensive manner, including on air quality. Significant efforts are needed on implementation and enforcement.

Media support to promote this topic *Other International Agreements and directives relevant for climate changes are listed in Annex I. 7.1.2 Disaster risk reduction policy framework Increased natural disaster losses over recent decades are due to more frequent extreme weather events, such as floods, drought and wildfires. This signals that a comprehensive understanding of DRR by all relevant stakeholders is an urgent need for B&H. The existing institutional framework for DRR is fragmented among the state, entity, cantonal and local levels of decision-making and it lacks both vertical and horizontal integration. Complex constitutional arrangements and weak communication among institutions also affect the disaster risk management system and mechanisms in the country. On the other hand, B&H is in the process of implementing international policy frameworks and directives in the field of disaster risk management, for example: \u2212 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015\u20132030), building on the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005\u20132015, ratified by B&H, reflecting the country\u2019s commitment to reduce disaster risks and build the people\u2019s resilience. This voluntary and non- binding agreement outlines seven global targets to be achieved over the next 15 years, highlighting the importance of ecosystems and biodiversity and knowledge transfer to 39 build resilience and reduce disaster risk, with four priorities: understanding disaster risk; strengthen disaster risk governance to manage disaster risk; investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience, and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response. The Ministry of Security of B&H and relevant authorities in 2019 pledged a long-term commitment and partnership in increasing disaster resilience across the country. Particular attention is given to transposition of the EU Directives e.g., the Water Framework Directive, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, and Drinking Water Directives into the state and entity legislation. This has been achieved, though unfortunately implementation is still insufficient. So far, many improvements have been observed, but since B&H is a decentralised country with complex political and administrative relations, many of these activities are implemented only at the entity level. \u2212 Floods Directive 2007/60/EC is very important and states that floods can cause human casualties, population evacuation, and environmental damage, endangering economic development and weakening economic activities of society. However, some human activities (such as expanding settlements, the production of economic goods in floodplains, and the reduction of space for natural water retention as a consequence of land use) and climate change, contribute to increasing the likelihood and adverse effects of floods. It is therefore necessary and desirable to apply measures to reduce the risks of adverse effects of floods, in particular on human health and life, the environment, cultural heritage, economic activities and infrastructure. Since floods, but also water scarcity and droughts are occurring more often, the EU Floods Directive 2007/60/EC requires Member States to prepare flood risk assessments for all its river basins and flood hazard maps. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, both FB&H and RS have only partly transposed the EU Flood Directive. \u2212 Flood risk management plans According to Article 7, on the basis of the maps referred to in Article 6 of Directive 2007/06/EC, Member States shall establish Flood Risk Management Plans harmonised at the level of the river basin district for the management units referred to in Article 3(2)(b), areas identified under Article 5(1) and areas covered by Article 13(1)(b), in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 7. The Flood Risk Management Plans will address all aspects of flood risk management, with a focus on prevention, protection and preparedness, including flood forecasts and early warning systems and considering the characteristics of a particular river basin or sub-basin. Flood risk management plans can promote sustainable land use practices, improve water retention and control flooding of certain areas in the event of a flood. 40 B&H has developed Flood Risk Management Plans for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fad6bfb5-2229-46cb-bbc2-bc7b5a4ebf20": {"__data__": {"id_": "fad6bfb5-2229-46cb-bbc2-bc7b5a4ebf20", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "964cc1006c12c4b592a6179f272d50c01fa49bef50e4eba133a45738a92c93d3"}, "3": {"node_id": "485fe9a6-b761-4c3b-92c8-563d0469bc32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6e37be2bc65bad73898f55eb2fb8f2fadf979c5f24620df981d1314a2a1cdb7"}}, "hash": "0f0d992fb339b1fd7688170ce5359f80840533c81f972133a390af4a1de0f8f8", "text": "rivers prone to flooding (e.g., Vrbas and Sava Rivers) with the support of international donors. \u2212 Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC This Directive was adopted in 2000 and is complemented by other, more specific EU laws. It manages and protects water at the state and entity level, but also goes beyond political borders to ensure good water quality in cooperation with neighbouring countries that share rivers. Furthermore, other goals include achieving a good ecological and chemical status of surface water bodies and a good status of groundwater. Public participation is also required to achieve public support. The Commission monitors implementation progress through drafting implementation reports and progress reviews. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, B&H, FB&H and RS have partially transposed the EU water framework directive into their legislation. Floods, drought, wildfires and landslides are identified as the most important disasters that have been affecting B&H in the last decade,70,71 thus water legislation is most important for disaster risk management. According to the Report of the European Commission in 2021,72 B&H still lacks a consistent and harmonised countrywide strategy and investment plans on water management that would include implementing legislation and monitoring. In line with Directive 2007/2/EC of March 2007 establishing an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE), the plan for flood protection and river management in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2014\u20132021 is currently in preparation. Flood hazards and risks are being mapped for the entire country. It was also acknowledged that FB&H and RS have both implemented water management strategies. B&H today is facing many challenges across sectors, including a lack of financial resources, and this has been particularly pronounced during the COVID-19 crisis. On the other hand, high investments are expected for DRR through EU funding, though the recommendation is to place the focus on other issues, including institutional capacity development.

There are no laws on climate change or DRR at any level of decision-making in B&H. 7.3.1 Climate change entity legislation According to the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the legislative competence for the environment belongs to the entities in B&H and BD. The current legislative framework of both 44 entities and BD does not provide a basis to address climate change and its impact on different sectors, thus creating an additional problem in the process of prevention, adaptation and mitigation of changed climate conditions. Analysing the entire legislative framework in B&H, it can be observed that all laws or bylaws address this problem within the framework of the term \u201cclimate\u201d, which is certainly not enough. The only legislation addressing the issue of climate change is the Rulebook on the drafting, content and formation of spatial planning documents (2013) in the Republic of Srpska, which clearly defines the methodological approach to drafting spatial planning documents, emphasising that climate change is one of the conditions that must be considered when defining the content of space and spatial documents. The existing spatial planning systems in B&H do not consider climate change as a dynamic impact factor, so the existing legislative framework does not recognise this issue as an important influencing factor. Additionally, NbS are not recognised as a possible measure to address climate change. Therefore, it is of great importance to initiate procedures to amend the existing legal framework in both entities and BD in terms of integrating the concepts of \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cadaptation to climate change using NbS\u201d in the most vulnerable sectors. In addition, the integration of climate change into the strategic framework of the most vulnerable sectors at the entity and cantonal levels is first necessary for the integration of climate change into regulatory and spatial plans at the local level. It is necessary to draft and adopt a Law on Climate Change in both entities, noting that Republic of Srpska, in cooperation with the UNDP of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has already embarked on this process. 7.3.2 Disaster risk reduction entity legislation Existing policy and strategic framework at the entity level mostly does not recognise DRR or natural hazards or has examples of these hazards and climate change relations. Usually, DRR is mentioned within the context of support provided to help prevent or mitigate the effects of climate change. Natural hazards, such as floods, drought, landslides and wildfires are mentioned in strategic documents within the context of climate change, which are expected to increase in frequency and intensity during the century. For example, in the Strategy of Agriculture for Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2015\u20132020, DRR is mentioned within the chapter \u201cChallenges of Agriculture of Federation B&H\u201d as climate change is reflected in the identified temperature increase and frequent inclement weather (drought, flood, hailstones, storms, etc.). These conditions are caused by changes in the vegetation period 45 (start, duration), precipitation schedules (availability of water), increased risk for producers in terms of frost, hailstones, drought, and an increase in the incidence of diseases and pests. Finally, DRR is not a self-standing outcome, but it has been linked to natural resource management, in particular for reducing the impact of drought, such as the use of irrigation to mitigate the impact of this natural hazard. At the entity level, the legislative framework relevant for DRR relies on two main laws: - Law on Protection and Rescue in Crisis Situations in Republic of Srpska (Official Gazette of RS 121/12), - Law on Protection and Rescue of People and Goods from Natural Disasters in FB&H (Official Gazette of FB&H 39/03, 22/06 and 43/10). These two laws define the different roles and responsibilities, including the tasks to conduct disaster risk assessments and to establish protection and rescue plans.

On the other hand, important laws that address floods, drought and landslides indirectly are the entity water laws that are focused on flood prevention and mitigation to protect people and households from flooding. In FBiH there are: \u2212 Law on Water (Official Gazette of the Federation B&H 70/06), and \u2212 Regulation on the types and the contents of the plans for the protection from harmful effects of water (Official Gazette of the Federation B&H 26/09). 46 In the Republic of Srpska there are: \u2212 Law on Water (Official Gazette of RS 01-557/06), and \u2212 Flood Risk Directive (Official Gazette of RS 50/06). The Law on Water of the RS prescribes the obligation of locals to facilitate planning of the flood protection measures as well as support the construction and management of protection facilities, such as dams and dikes. However, these sectoral laws do not include disaster risk reduction or references for prevention, mitigation and preparedness, or the NbS concept. On the other hand, entities preparing several hazard plans in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the EU Flood Directive to which B&H aims to adhere to, even though it is no so obliged as it is not yet an EU Member State. Some flood plans have been developed in collaboration with other countries due to the transboundary river basin to which these countries belong. One example is the Sava River Commission, which prepared the Sava River Action Plan in 2009 in line with the EU Flood Directive, and which focuses on prevention, protection and preparedness.80 In addition, the Republic of Srpska was also involved in the preparation of the action plan for sustainable flood risk management in the Danube Basin for the 2010\u2013 2021 period, with specific reference to the sub-basin of the Sava River and flood risk management plan for the Vrbas River developed by both entities with the support of UNDP. However, the RS entity, in close cooperation with the UNCCD secretariat under leadership of Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management, developed the Drought Management Plan of the Republic of Srpska81 as the baseline for a strategic approach to preparedness, adaptation and mitigation of drought, where drought, floods and wildfires are identified as the main natural disasters. In FB&H, this process is still ongoing. 7.3.3 Environment entity legislation With the assistance of the European Commission, both B&H entities drafted and adopted (in 2002 in RS and in 2003 in FBiH) the following five key environmental laws: 1. Law on Environmental Protection, 2. Law on Nature Protection, 3. Law on Air Protection, 4. Law on Water Protection, and 80 FAO (2020).

Currently in FB&H, activities are ongoing to prepare a new Law on Environmental Protection, and it is expected that NbS will be considered within this document. In both entities, these laws are mostly being implemented through the by-laws (regulations and decrees), which are more or less under preparation and adoption. Entity environmental legislation is, to a limited extent, aligned with the EU Acquis, which brings into focus the necessity for alignment with the EU environmental Acquis at all levels of government in a harmonised and coordinated manner and to strengthen administrative capacities for efficient implementation. The countrywide environmental approximation strategy adopted in 2017 and supplemented by more specific environmental approximation programs for the entities and the BD needs to be updated and fully implemented. The sub-sector strategies remain non-harmonised between the entities for the respective areas covered, leaving the environment sector unevenly covered across the country.

Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina: Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of B&H. 48 aspects should be considered in the exploitation of resources and project development. However, the Strategy provides no specific reviews of the consequences of climate change or the possible consequences of these phenomena. The problem remains in the fact that climate change and natural hazards are not particularly highlighted as a risk to the environment, and there is no requirement for special consideration of their possible consequences, i.e., nature-based measures of adaptation to the existing changed situation. Environmental planning, management and monitoring can only be achieved through cooperation and joint action of all entities with the aim of environmental protection, so that everyone protects the interests of environmental protection within the scope of their competence and responsibility. All laws in B&H emphasise the need for cooperation between entities and BD, with the aim of achieving an optimal approach to resolving environmental issues. 7.4 Gender issues within CC and DRR policies B&H is a middle income, developing, post-conflict country where women have the lowest economic activity rates, and live a precarious reality.84 On the other hand, B&H is the first state in South East Europe to develop a countrywide Action Plan which translated the principles of Resolution 1325 into national goals. The Law on Gender Equality in B&H was adopted in 2003 and amended in 2009. In 2010, an official consolidated version of the Law was published, and is currently in force. The main aim of the Law is to regulate, promote and protect substantive gender equality and to guarantee equal opportunities for all citizens, in both public and private life. The Law has a dual function \u2013 it prohibits discrimination on the grounds of gender (and sexual orientation), and it establishes legal standards in the area of gender equality. It ensures and promotes equal gender representation in the process of managing, decision-making and representation for all state bodies at all levels of organisations, including political parties, legal entities with public authority, legal entities under state ownership or control, including those related to DRR. The Law defines a minimum 40% threshold for equal participation based on the standard established by the Council of Europe Recommendation Rec (2003)323. Article 20, paragraph 4 of the Law stipulates that the responsible subjects are obliged to adopt temporary special measures as defined in Article 6 that aim to achieve equal gender representation. This approach is deeply rooted in international human rights standards, such 84 UN Women Europe and Central Asia [website].

FIGAP II was developed to provide funds for the implementation of activities. The goal of the FIGAP II programme is to provide general financial support to the institutions of B&H, and at the entity level of FB&H and RS, and to non-governmental organisations, in the implementation of activities aimed at improving socioeconomic conditions for men and women, girls and boys in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Institutional structure related to gender consists of the Agency for Gender Equality of B&H under the Ministry of Human Rights and Refugees of B&H, Gender Centre of the Government of the Republic of Srpska, Gender Centre of Federation of B&H. These three institutions have had an important impact on setting policies and priorities in different areas of equal participation of women and men, including issues related to climate change risk and disaster risk management. This was expected to give them mandate as bodies in charge of coordination in the area of gender equality and they are mandated by the Law on Gender Equality. The participation of women in politics is one of the priorities of the Agency and the entity Gender Centres, and is clearly stated in the current Gender Action Plan 2018\u20132022 (Strategic priority I.2)85 and the Action Plan to Implement UNSCR 1325 (Strategic priority 1).86 Moreover, the Agency and the Gender Centres are active in this area with a stronger focus on 85 Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees, Gender Equality Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina (2018).

To date, they have advocated inclusion of the principle of equal representation and of the 40% quota in a number of laws and policies at the entity, cantonal and local levels. However, while gender legislation exists, a series of alternative indicators reveal persisting gaps where additional investment is needed to improve gender equality outputs. While little significant divergence can be noted in the areas of gender equality legislation and education, more prominent gaps can be seen regarding the labour force and political participation. Although 56.7% of men are either employed or actively searching for work, only 33.2% of women participate in the labour force. State and entity plans and budgets are where governments begin to translate commitments to women into practical steps to achieve gender equality. Too often, plans and budgets are inadequately funded and fail to monitor public services to ensure that they respond to women\u2019s needs and priorities. There is still a strong influence of traditional gender roles in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including women\u2019s limited access to resources and rights, limited mobility, and lack of a voice in community and household decision-making, which can make women more vulnerable than men to the impacts of climate change. In their traditional roles, women have a major influence in the stewardship and supply of natural resources in households and communities, and women\u2019s livelihoods are often most affected through reductions in livelihood assets (energy, water, agricultural products, production changes and marketability). In certain areas, such as coal mining regions which traditionally employ men, restructuring due to climate-related objectives can also have a negative gender-specific impact on men. Women in general, especially those living in rural areas are affected by climate change related risk and frequent disasters (floods and drought), particularly those dependent on agriculture. Since rural women suffer from a lack of appropriate social services to enable their participation in the labour market, they are more likely to spend time carrying out unpaid activities within the household. The poor and disempowered people are generally more vulnerable to climate change due to limited access to resources needed for adaptation to disruptions in the immediate environment. Women are at a higher risk of poverty and have less political and socio-economic power than men. Although both men and women suffer the negative consequences of climate change, compounded social inequalities put women at a further disadvantage.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "be114129-2632-4c66-831d-429507a3a9ba": {"__data__": {"id_": "be114129-2632-4c66-831d-429507a3a9ba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d3ca108221f19c14df9bcb342630f8317bbcd656dffc84cfbe87aebe128b64d"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3ae2e41-6424-4c98-86df-7fef975a583f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b7ba10b11e354a6f2fbc1f7d196f5bc25040e5839e13f152d8c61fd109eb50f"}}, "hash": "e7ce8bf772c593cc5b99e14614b930e92da2930732ec02bafc278eac1b5e74e3", "text": "Women in developing countries such as B&H are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, since they are often poor and are usually the primary 51 users and managers of natural resources.87 The Low Carbon Development Strategy of B&H (Strategy) incorporates a gender dimension stating that climate change mitigation and adaptation measures are gender responsive and will incorporate specific measures to ensure that the most vulnerable groups of the population", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f69cce04-82a0-40ed-b5c4-631cddb51307": {"__data__": {"id_": "f69cce04-82a0-40ed-b5c4-631cddb51307", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce2937cc1d9a3dd58bf1d4af86837705b6cf409cbe85343872d23953573539c7"}, "3": {"node_id": "36bda4e2-dd83-4c87-b909-9a7a8958875e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b5f481e44a44280086e1af890f2f0b1d90c351f58a6b07eede3485612642851"}}, "hash": "d38219394dd96b8995c2d9af273f0f6341bffe4596fb04bca5112b8cf6e3f88f", "text": "receive adequate support. The strategy recognises the fundamental goal of achieving equal representation of both sexes in the processes of planning, decision-making and implementation of programmes related to sustainable environment and strengthening capacities of government institutions dealing with the environment, so that a gender perspective is systematically introduced into the creation of policy on integrated protection of the environment. Risks associated with climate change threaten to reinforce gender inequalities and have the potential to erode the progress made towards gender equity. In relation to the general lack of data related to climate change, there is also a lack of gender- specific data and indicators for climate change and climate change adaptation, and therefore a lack of gender-specific adaptation policies and strategies.88 In general terms, women and men experience climate change differently, and gender inequalities (that can encompass economic disparities, access to productive resources, different levels of education, and limited participation in decision-making) affect their abilities to successfully adapt. Therefore, women can significantly contribute to finding long-term solutions to climate change risk and natural disasters, but their capacities are often unrecognised. This is the reality of B&H where women are underrepresented in formal decision-making at the local, entity and state levels, despite existing legislative framework on gender equality. Equal participation during community dialogue, and in the monitoring and evaluation of climate change adaptation and risk management implementation (with disaggregated indicators where appropriate) is of great importance. Particular priority should be given to appropriate gender involvement in capacity building activities for both adaptation and mitigation, and in activities targeting households. 7.5 Other CC and DRR relevant sectors 7.5.1 Forestry Bosnia and Herzegovina has the highest share of forests and the largest variety of forest species of all the countries of the Western Balkans (Figure 9).

Pursuant to Article III of the Constitution of B&H on Responsibilities of and Relations Between the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Entities, foreign trade activities and international obligations in the field of forestry is the responsibility of the institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, namely the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of B&H. The competences for the management of forests and forest land, according to the B&H Constitution, lie with the entities (FB&H and RS) and BD. Institutions in the two entities and BD are responsible for forest management, development and implementation of forestry policies and regulations. In FB&H, these competencies are even more decentralised to the cantonal level. The Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Part III states (Division of Responsibilities between the Federation Government and Cantons) that the Federation (in addition to other responsibilities) has exclusive responsibility for economic policy and land use policy at the federal level, but both levels (Federation and Cantonal Governments) are responsible for the policy of environment protection and the use of natural resources. Where necessary, these responsibilities may be exercised jointly or separately, or by the cantons as coordinated by the Federation Government. At all administrative-political levels, forestry is the responsibility of the Ministries for Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry. B&H does not have a state level forest policy or legislation framework, due to the decentralised administration of the country. The draft FB&H Law on Forests was submitted to parliamentary procedure in 2016, but the law was not passed at the time of writing due to political deadlock in the entity. Currently, certain cantonal assemblies have adopted laws in cantons where forestry activities are carried out.

Other factors likely to impact the forest ecosystems include: changes in soil structure, severe temperatures and climatic conditions causing frost and heat stress, changes in precipitation amount and distribution (snow versus rain, drought versus flood). Another significant threat to forests is an increase in forest fires: higher temperatures and changes in precipitation levels increases the risk of fires in some areas of the country. In summary, climate change is likely to affect the most vulnerable forest ecosystems due to multiple stresses on trees and forest environments, including drought, pest and disease attack, increased fire risks and changes in soil. Considering the environmental and economic importance of forests in Bosnia and Herzegovina, these impacts could have serious consequences for the country. Adaptation approaches where Nature-based Solutions play an important role will require improved information for forest management to support changes in the species planted, and management interventions to prevent fire and the spread of disease.96 High-level genetic diversity of some species, and thus their potential to tolerate climate change effects, make certain species more suitable in terms of their adaptive capacity, and they can be considered for NbS measures. The negative consequences of extreme climate change in forests and forest ecosystems are more difficult to identify. Their detection requires long-term research and monitoring activities. In B&H, there are no permanent measuring stations for monitoring and tracking changes and reactions of the most important forest ecosystems to climate change. In terms of climate change and the consequences for forestry in B&H, it is possible to implement a wide range of practices, such as improvements to the silviculture system, promotion of genetically superior planting material, enlargement of the protected area, substitution of fossil fuels with bio-energy, more efficient protection of forests against fire, diseases and pests, more efficient processing and use of forest products and monitoring of area and growing status of forests, particularly under afforestation practices of bare lands. The most important factor in the field of forestry in terms of the ability to mitigate the effects of climate change is certainly increasing forested areas. Reforestation practices are important to decrease erosion processes and regulate the water regime thus mitigating floods, drought and landslides, and increasing the storage of CO2. Promoting carbon sequestration through forestry practices should be increased, especially in areas where there 96 UNDP (2013). Climate Change Adaptation and Low-Emission Development Strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina: United Nations Development Programme. 56 is an extremely low level of carbon in the soil, and where there is the potential for afforestation. 7.5.2 Agriculture In B&H, agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, due to its exposure and sensitivity. Indeed, 46% of the total area of B&H is agricultural land. Agriculture is also under the jurisdiction of the entities and BD. From the economic perspective, agriculture is one of the most important sectors as it generates incomes and contributes to food security of a large part of the population. The sector contributes approximately 6% to the country\u2019s GDP.97 On the other hand, more than half (51.8%) of the total population98 live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. Land quality is a very important prerequisite for agricultural production, and this is strongly dependent on natural disasters, particularly floods, droughts and wildfires. One of the most important reasons for insufficient production of basic agricultural products in B&H is the insufficient and inadequate use of agricultural land, in addition to the influence of other land degradation drivers. According to statistical sources, the B&H entities have 2.2 million ha of agricultural land, of which 1.6 million ha is arable land and 600,000 ha are pastures. RS has more agricultural land and plough land (1,008,000 ha), in particular, if observed per capita. At the same time, FB&H has more meadows and pastures.99,100 The availability of the labour force in agriculture is also limited, due to low population growth, migration from rural to urban areas and abroad, but despite this, unemployment is a substantial issue in B&H, with an unemployment rate of 18.44% in 2020.101 In the agriculture sector, due to the migration from rural to urban areas, the population is ageing, with more and more older people remaining to be engaged in the sector.

Accessed on: 9 August 2020. 57 droughts, floods and wildfires in the past two decades have caused significant damage to the agricultural sector. Pathogens of plant diseases, pests and weeds represent a very important segment to which the future climate change has an impact. However, a more arid climate will require changes in agricultural technologies, such as the intensification of irrigation. As stated in the Second National Communication, mild winters can contribute to the spread of harmful insects, which requires prevention measures and increased use of pesticides, which in turn can have a negative impact on human health and the environment. B&H is generally very vulnerable to various natural hazards, such as floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and wildfires. Each has significant adverse impacts on the agriculture sector, but floods and drought are of particular importance. Besides the influence on land productivity, floods move unexploded landmine devices remaining from the war to unknown locations, which exposes people to serious risk. According to Bosnia and Herzegovina Mine Action Centre (BH MAC) data for 2020, the total landmine suspected area in B&H covers 965 km2 (1.97% of the country area) with the largest area falling within the category of agricultural land. Drought has been identified as a very important driver of land degradation in the country.102,103 Despite this, irrigation infrastructure is very limited, for example, only 0.65% of arable land is irrigated (before the war this was 1.0%, but this has decreased remarkably due to war damage, landmines and lack of maintenance). The main period of drought occurs from June to September, especially in the Herzegovina and Semberija regions. Dry episodes have increased in recent decades, due to climate change particularly in the last decade, which mostly affects agriculture production in Posavina and Semberija, but also in Herzegovina where frequent wildfires are underpinned by drought. Severe droughts caused enormous damage to agriculture in 2000, 2003, 2007, 2011 and 2017. For example, drought in 2012 in RS caused significant adverse effects on all crops, but particularly on maize. Corn crops, which were sown on 140,000 ha, were completely damaged on the shallow and skeletal soils of Lijev\u010de Polje, and yield was reduced by 50\u201360% throughout RS, amounting about 2.5 t/ha. Damage caused by drought on maize alone in 2012 compared to production from earlier years (2004, 2005 and 2006) was 350,000\u2013400,000 tonnes of grain. During that year, crop and grain yields were reduced by 40 to 50%, meadow and pasture yields were also reduced by about 60%. More hot days, reduced rainfall and higher aridity will increase the probability of 102 UNEP (2017). Action Programme to Combat Land Degradation and Mitigate Drought Effects.

The risks facing the agricultural sector \u2013 due primarily to the combination of increasing drought probability and lack of irrigation options \u2013 are not uniform. Additional risks include an increased fire risk for cereal crops due to reduced moisture content.

At present, there are some efforts towards shifting from a reactive emergency response towards a proactive disaster risk reduction approach. To conclude, the predicted rises in temperature, coupled with changes in rainfall and evaporation, are likely to significantly negatively impact the farming systems in Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in the Mediterranean areas and in the Posavina and Semberija regions. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen systematic research on climate change and agriculture, as well as to ensure capacity building in terms of early warning for extreme events, such as: drought, floods and heatwaves. Moreover, it is necessary to raise public awareness of the harmful consequences of climate change and natural disasters introducing possibilities of adequate adaptation and mitigation using NBS where possible. Continuous training and capacity building is necessary for farmers. Professional advisory services should play a key role in promoting sustainable agricultural practices and NBS and sharing knowledge and skills concerning adaptation measures. To this end, the capacities of the professional advisory services should be strengthened. These changes will require a strong institutional, policy and legislative framework for risk management and adaptation to climate change introducing NBSs and financial mechanisms for their implementation. 7.5.3 Hydrology and water resources B&H is among the countries that is not limited by water for development; on the contrary, water resources are among the most abundant natural resources in B&H. Water resources include 104 Ibid. 59 two major river basins: the Black Sea Basin, with the Sava River watershed and the Una, Vrbas, Bosna and Drina catchment areas in the north, and the Adriatic Sea basin, with the Trebi\u0161njica and Neretva River basins in the south (Figure 10). These resources provide an estimated average flow of 1,555 m3/s. However, the water sector suffers from poor and degraded infrastructure due to the war and lack of investment. It is estimated that 57% of water resources in the country are unused.105 Hydrogeological characteristics directly condition the runoff from basins of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This area mainly belongs to the geotectonic unit of the Dinarides mountain range, and based on the physical-geographical, geological and hydrogeological conditions to the hydrogeological inner region (which is morphologically distinct with heterogeneous litho-stratigraphic composition and complex structural pattern), and to the Pannonian region (lowland terrains south of the Sava River) and karst region.

Black Sea and Adriatic Sea Basins with their river catchments in B&H (Source: Map designed by the report author) The Third National Communication analysed annual precipitation data supplemented with the values for the period 2011\u20132014, both for the Black Sea Basin and the Adriatic Sea Basin, and the main conclusion was that the mean value has not changed significantly.

In relation to the reference period 1961\u20131990, in the period 1991\u20132014 annual precipitation in the Black Sea Basin was 44 mm higher than in the reference period 1961\u20131990, though this increase was somewhat lower than in the period 1991\u20132010. The range has significantly increased (769 mm compared to 407 mm) and the minimum value is 100 mm lower, whereas the maximum value is 262 mm higher. Accordingly, the variance was significantly higher in the period 1991\u2013 2014. Water resources are very vulnerable and over time, the threat will increase. There is also a lack of spatial and temporal uniformity in the availability of water resources. The multi- annual average precipitation in B&H is about 1250 mm/year, which given the surface area of B&H is 51,209 km2, amounts to a total quantity of precipitation of approximately 64 billion m3 per year, or 2,000 m3/s. As such, the annual average precipitation in B&H is around 350 mm higher than in the neighbouring countries.106 Bosnia and Herzegovina possess considerable water resources that, if correctly managed, could support economic development and a green economy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "afdac99e-d131-43ff-921d-96760ceb5aef": {"__data__": {"id_": "afdac99e-d131-43ff-921d-96760ceb5aef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f327d69f1abc85ff19cafaf94bfa3a4f18059d88fd20ed9e09d4aa87b9d47176"}, "2": {"node_id": "05f7ce25-d4e0-47f3-ae6d-a437f377782c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6b06ba8b2c2afff553e4bb097641bf37ab84c32a8a821339d89656faabdde4a"}}, "hash": "f00461f0fa2981f29bf973d43eafa69a0f7a3ee8802b163020d47b12ec39e3ef", "text": "The predicted changes in precipitation and air temperature will negatively impact the current water management system in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which will result in an increased incidence of floods, landslides and drought.

Main challenges for NbS application in B&H Nature-based Solutions are quite a new concept focused on different environmental issues, where climate change adaptation, mitigation, natural disasters and ecosystem services are among the most important ones. This term is still not widely used in B&H, though it has been promoted and implemented by different international organisations and activities supported mainly through different projects. This approach requires a \u201ccase by case\u201d detailed analysis of the natural characteristics of specific location, identification of the main degradation drivers, in order to project potential NbS opportunities with a clear picture of costs and benefits for each one. The IUCN Global Standard for NbSTM provides the comprehensive framework for NbS, allowing users to design, assess and scale up interventions.108 Implementation of NbS, besides the economic aspects of a particular measure, requires appropriate policy and strategic frameworks, but in B&H this represents a great challenge. The complex administrative structure of the country raises additional constraints for mainstreaming of NbS into the existing climate and natural disaster policy framework. Another challenge is that climate change issues and natural disasters in B&H are mostly related to agriculture, forestry and water management, while environment and biodiversity are concerns of other institutions, which complicates institutional horizontal and vertical communication among the state, entity and cantonal levels, also including BD. Existing legislative and strategic frameworks in B&H do not integrate climate change and there is no budget for activities that will mitigate climate change explicitly. These activities rely mostly on the international donors and projects (GEF, GCF, etc.). On the other hand, the main manifestations of climate change like floods, droughts, landslides and wildfires are natural disasters that entities are trying to address through different projects and investments (irrigation, flood protection, afforestation, etc.), and some of these could be considered NbS. Existing planning systems related to climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk reduction do not provide structured and integrated data at the state, entity or cantonal level in FB&H that would show how vulnerable B&H is to climate change and disaster risk and what damages the country has suffered. There are certain annual reports (that are not publicly available) in the ministries at the entity and cantonal levels that show economic damages caused by floods and drought, though these data are not available publicly and there is no information exchange system between the entities in this regard. 108 IUCN (2020).

The various ministries at the state, entity and cantonal levels, including local governments, have limited capacities and formal competencies to integrate climate change adaptation or DRR into their policies and plans. The complex institutional structure and weak political communication between entities draws attention to the importance of coordination and collaboration among different sectors and between various administration and governance levels in B&H. Another challenge is the absence of a comprehensive database and information related to the vulnerability of the regions in B&H, types of natural disasters and their frequency and economic costs, which will serve as a baseline for overview and planning possible NbS across the country. Existing reports and data related to natural disasters underpinned by climate change, distributed mainly among different organisations and institutions are frequently not available to the public. Information exchange between entities and the state level is not sufficient. Identification of existing case studies that consider NbS was not an easy task, due to the above stated data unavailability and absence of a database that would gather this kind of information. On the other hand, many ongoing activities and the projects at the local, cantonal or entity level include measures that could be considered NbS, but the terminology is different and the term is not used in the reports. To summarise, the main challenges related to NbS mainstreaming are: 64 \u2212 complex administrative structure of the country and competencies over NBS that are spread over many institutions, \u2212 weak exchange of existing information among sectors within and between entities and the state, \u2212 existing policy framework that does not recognise NbS, \u2212 climate change adaptation is not mainstreamed into policy framework and there is no budget allocated for these purposes, \u2212 disaster risk reduction is not part of the existing sectoral policy framework, \u2212 reactive instead proactive approach in DRR, \u2212 shortage of early warning systems related to the main natural disasters, \u2212 limited institutional capacities for NbS mainstreaming and absence of a participative approach of stakeholders, \u2212 weak awareness and promotion of NbS concepts among decision-makers and other stakeholders. Recommendations: \u2212 Developing disaster risk management planning should be integral to overall watershed management planning and should be more than just an emergency response. \u2212 Fostering integrated, cross-sectoral approaches is required for many NbS to be successful. \u2212 Participatory processes that support stakeholder empowerment facilitate the sustained success of projects. \u2212 Convincing decision-makers of the value of investing in NbS is beneficial in the long- term. \u2212 Fostering public-private partnerships may be needed in order to finance NbS at larger scales. \u2212 Using elements of traditional nature-based practices may offer more appropriate and accepted solutions and be more successful than approaches that rely solely on bringing \u2018new\u2019 interventions in from outside. \u2212 Biodiversity and social impacts can be achieved together and increase the overall success of a NbS. \u2212 Valuing ecosystem services is important in making a business case for investment in ecosystems. 65 9. Recommendations and next steps in NbS application The institutional structure of the country for sectors relevant for NbS is complex due to the decentralised state of B&H. Existing policy frameworks of B&H at the state, entity or cantonal levels do not recognise NbS explicitly, even though this concept appears in some strategies as associated actions or a possible tool that can be used, but without a broader overview of the possible benefits and advantages for climate change adaptation or DRR. Many documents and reports developed for different ratified conventions should pay particular attention to NbS and include this concept as a potential solution for climate change adaptation and disaster risk in B&H. At the entity and BD level, there are many important sectoral documents in agriculture, forestry, water management, nature protection and biodiversity that would profit from recognition of the potential of NbS, but unfortunately, this concept has not yet been included. Therefore, some important recommendations are given below: - The NbS concept has to be integrated into the existing entity and BD policy framework related to forestry, agriculture, water management, climate change, biodiversity, environment protection, as well as urban development, land use, spatial planning, etc. The country\u2019s sectoral legislation, however, still has limited focus on climate change and NbS. Therefore, the country has a rather reactive emergency response instead of taking a proactive approach. The main proposed shift is to move away from disaster response and recovery and to focus on prevention and mitigation of disaster risks through the introduction of NbS.

This is hampered by unsynchronised policies among the entities and BD, sometimes even among cantons with the same entity. - Close cooperation is required among ministries relevant for DRR and climate change under each entity but also between entities, particularly in terms of water and forest management. The state level should have a coordinating role, specifically for international commitments and reports that B&H submits periodically, and those reports have to incorporate NbS as an important segment that provides new opportunities. - Since the majority of NbS actions is to be applied at the local level, the ongoing process of the development of local development strategies is an excellent opportunity for the recognition and reinforcement of NbS concepts in local planning. These strategies 66 on land use and local development are an unavoidable starting point for the implementation of NbS at the local level. However, many local communities do not have strategic documents adopted due to the weak economic situation. - On the other hand, B&H is a developing country with inconsistent implementation of the existing policy framework that would certainly contribute to disaster risk mitigation. For example, consistent implementation of the legislation relevant for LDD and preparation and implementation of compulsory spatial planning documents (required by law), aimed at sustainable use of space, would certainly reduce the risk posed by floods and landslides in B&H. - Geographic analysis should be conducted to understand the spatial dimensions of risk and identify where hazards occur and where people are most exposed and how. For these purposes, new platforms need to be developed at the state, entity and cantonal levels and properly connected to better understand the risks and level of exposure, jointly with identification of locations where the implementation of NbS will improve disaster occurrence. Online platforms at different levels will facilitate DRR, which will enhance the existing institutional DRR systems introducing early warning systems for the most frequent natural disasters. Actors using risk assessments and applying mitigation measures using NbS should be able to learn from science, case studies and other advanced examples. Good practice in risk reduction needs to be adapted and shared with stakeholders and communities at risk in the country. - Shortage of knowledge on NbS and weak awareness might be overcome through dedication of sufficient time and efforts to mobilise local community actors and stakeholders, to ensure two-way communication with the public and to educate and promote concepts and approaches to be applied along with the benefits that will be gained through the application of NbS. Another positive practice is holding round tables, workshops and seminars for local stakeholders (by agriculture advisory service and academia), and active promotion of NbS as a new opportunity for disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation at the local level, with a focus on remote sensing techniques and software. 67 CURRENT OPPORTUNITIES \u25cf New climate change laws should be drafted at the entity level, and these should consider NbS as a possibility to mitigate climate change and DRR; \u25cf The Environmental Strategy of B&H is currently under development; in the future, this policy document will establish the environmental policy goals and key activities up to 2032 in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It should strengthen the environmental frameworks within B&H and it represents an important step for B&H to align with EU directives and procedures, and hence to increase the chances for European Union accession in the future. The policy document will be comprised of four jurisdiction strategies and action plans (B&H level, and the entity level: FB&H and RS, with BD.

Nature-based Solutions experiences in B&H 10.1 Potential case studies In accordance with the methodology, a desk-analysis was performed to identify acting and potential NbS interventions in B&H. At the time of this scoping study, the gaps in data proved to be a barrier to identifying all potential or NbS complementary projects. Some examples of potential or complementary NbS projects that are worthy of further attention can be found in Table 6. More projects were identified that either had a strong biodiversity emphasis but mentioning climate and DRR benefits or the opposite, a strong climate and/or DRR focus but limited mention of the biodiversity benefits. It is thus likely with further examination and consultation that this list could grow. It is important to note that some of the potential examples identified in Table 6 are also lacking in terms of accessible documentation or further consultation. This means that there is currently not a strong link identifiable for either biodiversity or CCA or DRR (although they likely contribute towards these via added benefits) and that no clear links have yet been identified to the principles of NbS. These would need to be screened using the IUCN Global Standard for NbS to assess their complementarity to NbS. 69 Table 6.

The main aim of this nature-based approach is to improve forest management in B&H, using modern techniques which will reduce future vulnerability of forests to drought and wildfires across the country. This measure is aimed to ensure that forests and associated natural landscapes, which are important for the country\u2019s economic development, are managed sustainably, with particular focus on the most vulnerable areas such as bare land. Additionally, a specific target are landscapes vulnerable to ongoing degradation or to escalated impacts from climate change, such as fire risks. Finally, this project has a scaling-out component, where all of the country's forests (some 2 million hectares) will benefit as this approach and techniques can be used by forest companies and communities to stave off future climate change threats. The social component of this project is related to the protection of future jobs in the forestry sector by maintaining a sound resource base for local manufacturing and exports to a global market, encouraging development of rural economy. Afforestation of bare land using special techniques has been implemented across the country at more than 100 micro-locations where 560 ha have been planted in five cantons in FB&H, while 373.5 ha in mostly unfavourable site conditions on bare land in RS.

Another important aspect of this nature-based approach is related to the inclusion of local communities and people in the preparation and implementation of municipal- level flood response and preparedness plans. The practical aspect has been focused on the projection and implementation of nature-based non-structural interventions in 13 municipalities of the Vrbas watershed and implementation of agroforestry schemes. Also, the Flood Forecasting and Early Warning System was established and is in the testing phase for the Vrbas basin. As a component of the project, the Vrbas GeoPortal was established and activated at http://vrb.pmfbl.org/. It offers flood hazard and risk maps, flash floods sensitivity model, landslide cadastre and torrential stream cadastre, hydrometric measurements in real time and a Participatory GIS (PGIS) tool for flood risk management at the local level. This nature-based approach is a good example for other regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina of how floods (and landslides as a natural disaster) can be managed through a sustainable nature-based participative approach, with equal contribution of all stakeholders.

The City Government of Banja Luka recognised need for active civil engagement in sustainable public land use aimed to improve household income, and encourage people to actively participate in local initiatives. The City of Banja Luka allocated public agricultural land located in Rakova\u010dke Bare for the project \u201cUrban gardens development\u201d. The main purpose is to encourage people to produce their own food, cultivate agricultural land and develop urban agriculture that would benefit the local population, particularly people with disabilities. This project is socially responsible and was well accepted by the local population, with 56 gardens are already cultivated on 0.5 ha of the 1 ha of total area provided for this purpose. Sustainable land managemen t of abandoned fertile land in urban areas. Benefits for ecosystem functions and services. Climate resilient livelihoods. Usage of abandoned and unused public land in the territory of the City of Banja Luka aimed to provide local people with an opportunity for healthy food production, and introduce sustainable ecosystem- based management practices. Improving disaster, climate and urban resilience through urban regeneration Sarajevo Economic Region Development Agency (SERDA) Together with 11 European cities, Sarajevo is part of a project entitled \u201cConnecting Nature\u201d funded by European Commission through the Horizon 2020 project that demonstrates how Nature-based Solutions can contribute to addressing urban challenges such as climate change and water management. The project is aimed at forming a community of cities fostering peer-to-peer learning and capacity building among front runner cities that are experienced in delivering large scale Nature-based Solutions and fast follower cities (Sarajevo in this case) that have the desire to implement large scale Nature- based Solutions but lack the expertise. At the same time, Sarajevo as project partner will develop policy and practices necessary to scale up urban resilience, innovation and governance using Nature-based Solutions. The project will be focused on several important aspects starting from the development of the urban planning process that will enrich and nurture social, business and governance innovations and focus on the scaling-up of Nature-based Solutions in cities. Development of a guiding process for identifying funding and financial mechanisms that establish Nature-based Solutions as evidenced valid solutions for sustainable and resilient cities that are climate prepared, will provide a baseline and create the prerequisites for scaling out and integration of NbS in other cities in B&H.

Livno cheese production WWF Adria, Municipality of Livno, Cincar Association The production of traditional cheese in Livno has been ongoing since the 19th century though in recent decades the industry was under dire threat and danger of disappearing. Traditional agriculture, the traditional raising of sheep and cattle, and the production of Livno Cheese from their milk, has always supported the sustainability of these exceptionally valuable natural habitats on Livanjsko Polje. Intensive grazing has helped sustain the natural ecosystems. That is why the protection of Livanjsko Polje as a whole is important, as it is also listed as an important wetland habitat of international significance under the Ramsar Convention. The quality of the cheese depends on this method of grazing, and synergy is key to preserving the diverse and unique habitats of this karst field. Fifteen years ago, producers came together to form the Cincar association with the aim of protecting traditional Livno Cheese as a specific product and working together to solve their common problems. Prevents the overgrowth of grasslands and revives neglected pastures. Maintains natural ecosystems. Climate- resilient livelihoods. Over 200 people make a living from this type of cheese production ECO KARST (Ecosystem services of karst protected areas \u2013 driving force of local sustainable development ) Canton Sarajevo \u2013 Ministry of Physical Planning, Construction and Environmental Protection; CENER 21 - Centre for Energy, Environment and Resources The ECO KARST project aims to contribute to the protection and sustainable development of karst bio-regions in the Danube region based on their valued ecosystem services.

These regions are already recognised as vulnerable through the LDN Reports, Action Program to Combat Land Degradation and Mitigate Drought Effects in BiH, Drought Management Plan of the RS. These areas represent the potential for the application of NBS in context of flood and drought prevention and improvement of flood and drought management. \u25cf Tuzla Canton (main natural disasters are floods, drought, landslides). The main natural disasters have been identified by LDN reports and the Action Programme to Combat Land Degradation and Mitigate Drought Effects in BiH. This region represents the potential for application of NbS in the context of landslides, flood and drought prevention and improvement of the flood and drought management. \u25cf Herzegovina region (main natural disasters are wildfires, heatwaves, drought). This region has been targeted as vulnerable due to frequent wildfires and drought, and addressing these two natural disasters would give benefits to agriculture, forestry and particularly water management of the Herzegovina region. Characteristics of each potential pilot area for NbS implementation should be given in the second phase, where for each region the conditions should be analysed carefully, local communities consulted with an aim to find the most suitable location that will benefit from the application of NbS and contribute to climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction.

Climate Change Adaptation: Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities (IPCC 2001) Nature-based Solutions (NbS): Actions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits. (IUCN, 2016) 75 Annex II: Nature-based Solutions for disasters risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) Nature can provide solutions that are cost-effective, and can contribute to the community resilience beyond their capacity to absorb and recover from a single disaster, such as a flood or drought. At the 2016 World Conservation Congress and members\u2019 assembly, IUCN's members adopted a resolution (WCC-2016-Res-069)109 which, for the first time, defined the use of nature for simultaneous benefits to biodiversity and human well-being. According to the resolution, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits.\u201d110 While still an emerging concept, NbS have clearly demonstrated their value in providing multiple benefits to societies, e.g., in mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts, reducing disaster risks, improving community resilience and livelihoods, and safeguarding ecosystems and biodiversity. There is growing evidence of the value and importance of NbS and steady progress with documenting, communicating and mainstreaming NbS into climate change and sustainable development policy and disaster risk management. Nature-based Solutions are considered an umbrella framework for ecosystem-based approaches that are used to address major societal challenges. NbS actions can contribute to flood prevention and protection, managing risks of natural disasters, improving forest management, ensuring food and water security, combating climate change and contributing to the global improvement of the social, economic and health conditions, by strengthening the local communities\u2019 resilience to natural disasters. NbS are a powerful mechanism for climate change mitigation due to their capacity to prevent degradation and loss of natural ecosystems, for example through sustainable forest management or improved conservation and land management actions. Moreover, natural and modified ecosystems can also effectively contribute to combating climate change thanks to their function of a \u2018natural carbon sink\u2019, i.e., absorption and insulation of CO2 emissions. Nature-based Solutions to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) are a good strategy for the integrated management of land, water and biodiversity. They can 109 IUCN (2016). Resolution 69. Adopted at the World Conservation Congress, Hawaii, USA. 1-10 September 2016 110 IUCN (2016). Defining Nature-based Solutions.

They prioritise nature conservation and sustainable land use practices that can be implemented in harmony with more traditional methods. The central role of ecosystems and biodiversity to address DRR and CCA challenges is endorsed in major risk related agendas, including the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP21) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, SFDRR mentions ecosystems as being vulnerable to natural and human activity induced hazard impacts, and therefore need to be adequately protected.111 Various approaches can be used to apply NbS, including green infrastructure (GI) projects or ecosystem-based approaches (EbA), in different fields. Measures facilitating the practical implementation of NBS through policy development and enforcement, stakeholder involvement and building the capacity of the national institutions and/or local communities are equally important.112 Nature-based Solutions can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g., technological and engineering solutions); they have been applied in a wide variety of sectors to address a plethora of societal issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "297a5d93-3fc7-44ba-87fb-3c9e1713862c": {"__data__": {"id_": "297a5d93-3fc7-44ba-87fb-3c9e1713862c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84b26ab7d41daf9484c49a2b7f38a528dabe6082bf27a403c8a322bcf0bb8056"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf34d744-8a52-44b3-84f7-2ba808ebd881", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-bosnia-and-herzegovina", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55d851e5c74d41687c161b2aa4b41d5ee23336e2e692894795865242d134be43"}}, "hash": "931c4df7070104e0472940651d2e7480cd1ca24565a5b433760b56f7da514bf7", "text": "Some the NbS interventions examples are found in Section 9.113 111 Ilieva, L., McQuistan C., Rodriguez A.V., Guevara O., Cordero D., Podvin, K., Renaud F.

Floods and droughts have caused significant damage to infrastructure, the economy, and human livelihoods in the past, especially among vulnerable groups. Climate change may intensify the frequency and scale of natural disasters. This Scoping Study has been developed, among other, to enable better understanding of the Serbian national context, in terms of the institutional, policy and legal framework and reveal the key challenges for the application of Nature-based Solutions along with the recommendations and entry points for the mainstreaming of the Nature-based Solutions into national disaster risk reduction and climate change policies and strategies. The identified key findings and recommendations for enhancing the Nature-based Solutions in Serbia are given below: 1. Priority challenges: Agriculture, forestry and hydrology and water resources are recognised as the most vulnerable sectors in terms of climate change impact. This is especially pertinent to Nature-based Solutions (NbS) considering the wealth of knowledge and experience behind NbS for food security and water security. Recommendation: At the same time, existing flood protection infrastructure (linking all the above vulnerable sectors) in Serbia is well developed. NbS can complement and add additional resilience to address limitations rather than replace infrastructure. The application of NbS in the context of a watershed-based approach (based on the ongoing activities in the Zapadna Morava watershed) might be further explored as a priority. 2. Mainstreaming: Policies relating to NbS are disaggregated and separated. The current institutional framework for NbS application is very complex and requires additional efforts to ensure coordination and collaboration among different sectors and between the different administration and governance levels in Serbia. There are some indications of NbS-complementary policies and measures; however, there are no publicly available and accessible data or records of their implementation and impact. There are goals with no or weak indicators. Recommendation: NbS needs to be integrated into and applied through the existing policy and institutional framework, vi mainly in the disaster risk reduction and climate change sectors, and further mainstreamed and incorporated within the urban development, agriculture and rural development, land-use, forestry, water management and biodiversity and nature protection sectors. 3. Data needs: There is a deficit of validated and up-to-date data, making it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the environment and ecosystem services. This is also especially evident in regards to local knowledge and practices. For example, the significance of natural ecosystems in the mitigation of floods and water treatment continues to be neglected, with watercourses assessed separately from their accompanying ecosystems. In addition, climate change and disaster risks are generally treated as separate issues. Therefore, it is not possible to estimate where and to what extent floods, droughts, forest fires occur (frequency/seasons), or to assess the vulnerability of different ecosystems to recover or their capacity to be resilient to climate change and disasters. Recommendation: planning and application of NbS approaches for climate change adaptation and/or disaster risk reduction requires comprehensive analysis and research based on the context of the specific location or site/territory. The assessment, in addition to identifying the needs and capacities of ecosystems, should also identify possible trends in terms of floods, droughts, forest fires, degradation, deforestation and their impact on people, their communities and the economy, including the potential of existing ecosystems; for example, to determine the water retention capacity of a natural system to mitigate flooding and determine its current susceptibility to climate change. 4. Capacity gap: There is a lack of structured information sharing and exchange, capacity weaknesses, and a general lack of awareness and understanding related to ecosystem disaster risk reduction or climate change adaptation, and even less for NbS. Recommendation: Prioritise showing the benefits and building a common understanding in the relevant stakeholders including a tailor-made minimum framework for understanding NbS in Serbia. Recommend dedicating sufficient time and efforts to mobilise local community actors and stakeholders, to ensure a bottom- up approach, two-way communication with the public, and to educate and promote concepts and approaches. 5. Identifying examples: The gaps in data and repositories proved to be a barrier in identifying NbS case studies in Serbia.

Purpose and methodology of the scoping study The overall purpose of the scoping study (hereinafter: Study) is to provide a state-of-the art overview of the Serbian national context with regards to the application of Nature-based Solutions (NbS) approaches for climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR). Moreover, the objectives of the Scoping study are to: 1) understand the national context, in terms of the institutional, policy and legal framework for the application of NbS, 2) provide an overview of the most common natural hazards and disasters in Serbia and the correlated risks, 3) elaborate on the added benefit of deploying NbS in the given context, 4) identify knowledge, institutional and capacity gaps and barriers for the application of NbS, and 5) provide recommendations and entry points for mainstreaming NbS into national disaster risk reduction and climate change policies and strategies. The Study relies on the available and accessible data and information originating from existing policies, programmes and strategies (global, regional, national and local), taking into account data collected on past and ongoing initiatives, projects and activities in Serbia on Nature- based Solutions for disaster risk reduction, and the impacts on climate change and the environment. It includes a rapid overview of the current development in Serbia concerning NbS and their application in the Serbian context, to inform semi-structured interviews and discussions with selected key partners and relevant national stakeholders. Furthermore, in order to identify and elaborate best practice cases and examples of NbS application, a comprehensive desk study was performed during the initial phase to compile data and information on all ongoing projects, programmes, activities or initiatives that are currently applying Nature-based Solutions in Serbia. Special attention has been given to screening and examining relevant national documents and policies: strategies, plans and programmes that reveal existing or potential linkages between Nature-based Solutions, climate smart adaptation and disaster risk reduction policies and measures, including climate and biodiversity, as well as climate and gender interconnections. The Study also maps and identifies the experiences with Nature-based Solutions in/or involving Serbia that can illustrate the benefits and applicability of NbS and reveal entry points for possible scale-up of NbS interventions based on existing experiences. 2 The main findings and conclusions of the Study were further cross-checked, and inputs and suggestions of stakeholders and partners were incorporated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cd6a972-87b1-4e77-b320-7c37f84f70b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cd6a972-87b1-4e77-b320-7c37f84f70b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21e89b09e6c3a574841aff28aca4aa9119412c729968260c8aa46e3f2980b7c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c78c2306-f4ee-4d25-ba4f-905878e7cca2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc2ee80df0e92be0a24890986a98a9ba9dc56b77a587eeefd1a4ec8781125108"}}, "hash": "2d2f06e9cb4501d0db2174b1aa5c96a2ababeb361a7c7b76a738e0ab522d45b3", "text": "In addition to feedback from relevant stakeholders and other actors across sectors on the identified priorities and potential pilot sites proposed for Serbia, this process contributed to knowledge building and awareness raising through the sharing of data and information on the current state of affairs regarding disaster risks, climate change impacts and the identification of opportunities presented by the application of Nature-based Solutions.

The ADAPT Project The ADAPT: Nature-based Solutions for resilient societies in the Western Balkans project aims to increase ecosystem and community resilience to climate change and environmental degradation in the Western Balkans. This regional umbrella initiative works with six Western Balkan economies, regional and local partners. ADAPT aims to introduce Nature-based Solutions as a contribution towards reducing of environmental degradation and increasing climate resilience, including social equity and gender equality, in the Western Balkan region. In order to achieve balanced results and achieve a positive, long-term impact on communities and ecosystems in the region, the project has strong regional and national components. Regionally, it focuses on aligning NbS and DRR policy, knowledge generation and sharing, capacity development and networking, while the focus at the national level is on national policy, stakeholder engagement and demonstration through pilot NbS projects. The project is implemented through the following three strategies: \uf0fc Enhance knowledge and awareness of Nature-based Solutions for disaster risk reduction among decision makers, natural resource managers and local communities, with a specific focus on gender; \uf0fc Integrate NbS and equitable climate-smart planning into adaptation and disaster reduction policy; and \uf0fc Implement NbS for disaster risk reduction and their scale-up. 4 3. Introduction The Western Balkans is one of the most vulnerable regions in Europe in terms of climate change and environmental impacts. Extreme events, such as floods, droughts and forest fires, are predicted to occur more frequently and with higher impacts, calling for measures that increase resilience and climate change adaptation, while reducing disaster risks. The 2016 European Environment Agency report1 on climate change impacts and vulnerability in Europe considers South East and Southern Europe are highly prone to climate change effects, with the highest impacts of climate change and number of severely affected sectors and domains. The Study on climate change in the Western Balkans,2 published by the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) in June 2018 \u201cshows an alarming increase of temperature over the whole territory, with an expected temperature increase of 1.2\u00b0C in the near future, destined to warm further by 1.7\u20134.0\u00b0C and even exceeding 5.0\u00b0C by the end of the century, depending on the global effort to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions\u201d. Analyses of climate change impacts in the region recognise that human health, safety and quality of life are strongly affected by natural hazards and weather-related losses, while also identifying agriculture, forestry, water resources and human health as sectors that will suffer the greatest impacts. Serbia is exposed to various natural hazards, including earthquakes, floods, landslides, droughts, wildfires and storms. In May 2014, Serbia suffered the most severe flooding in 120 years. The disaster affected 22% of the total population and the estimated cost was 4.8% of GDP. By way of illustration of the impact of this flood, it caused the Serbian economy to contract by 1.8% in 2014, in contrast with a projected growth of 0.5%. Additionally, 30% of the country is at risk from landslides.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd41b1b4-16cc-4ded-91b8-e5a8b8462aa4": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd41b1b4-16cc-4ded-91b8-e5a8b8462aa4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "940077e8b65379826d2a92c27c08994c07ab7f08857796386886ccdfe1de23e4"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cb7aa29-5584-4929-9f89-5810ff5ae6ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "512e7797292ff8f53f7051ce51ddf364dc55c59ea9270c0c6a3a0be01c64e6a4"}}, "hash": "3f83c5f1189cd79b64e6e4790f2e8fa301f774b72f3b0e0a306fa7b4b93a80a1", "text": "Additionally, 30% of the country is at risk from landslides.

While still an emerging concept, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) (Figure 1) have clearly demonstrated their value in providing multiple benefits to societies, e.g., in mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts, reducing disaster risks, improving community resilience and livelihoods, and safeguarding ecosystems and biodiversity (for more details on the global NbS context and approach please see Annex II of the Study). Various approaches support the application of NbS, including green infrastructure (GI) projects, ecosystem-based disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR) or ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA), in different fields.

In order to outline the specific context of Serbia concerning the opportunities deriving from the application of NbS approaches in addressing climate, community resilience or disaster risks, it is first necessary to understand the overall framework for their implementation in Serbia. NbS is an overarching, crosscutting concept that by definition involves various sectors, as shown in Figure 2. Climate change and DRR issues are those that penetrate into all relevant sectors, addressing challenges through climate adaptation and mitigation measures or actions striving to reduce the risks from disasters.

Serbia country overview Serbia is a landlocked country in Southeast Europe, at the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkans, bordering with Hungary to the north, Romania to the northeast, Bulgaria to the southeast, North Macedonia to the south, Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to the west, and Montenegro to the southwest, and claiming a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo.8 Serbia covers an area of 77,474 km\u00b2.9 The terrain varies from rich fertile plains in the north, limestone ranges and basins in the east and mountains and hills in the southeast. There are three major geographical areas: the lowland Pannonian Plain, Vojvodina in northern Serbia as a predominantly flatland of alluvial debris and plateau covering about 25% of the territory, and Central Serbia with the \u0160umadija Highlands as a predominantly hilly region ranging in elevation from 100 to 500 metres.

The Head of State is the president, elected by a popular vote every five years, while the head of the government is the prime minister. According to the Statistical office of the Republic of Serbia,10 the estimated population in the Republic of Serbia in January 2020 was 6,926,705 (the estimations are based on the results of natural changes statistics and population internal migration), 51.3% women and 48.7% men. The capital and largest city is Belgrade (population 1.6 million). The official language is Serbian and the official script is Cyrillic. The majority of the population (55%) is urban with steady rural to urban migration. The rural population is generally poor and highly dependent on agricultural production and farming. In addition, 8.8% of the population, mostly in rural areas, lives below the poverty line. Due to domestic migration, the rural population is increasingly vulnerable as a greater proportion of the individuals remaining in the inland, mountainous areas belong to older age groups. 8 Kosovo is the subject of a territorial dispute between the Republic of Kosovo and the Republic of Serbia. The Republic of Kosovo unilaterally declared independence on 17 February 2008. Serbia continues to claim it as part of its own sovereign territory. The two governments began to normalise relations in 2013, as part of the 2013 Brussels Agreement. Kosovo is currently recognised as an independent state by 97 out of the 193 United Nations member states. In total, 112 UN member states have recognised Kosovo at some point, of which 15 later withdrew their recognition.

Serbia basic statistics (Source: Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia, see footnote 11) The depopulation trend continued, meaning that the population growth rate, compared with the previous year (2018), was negative and amounted to -5.4%. At the same time, the process of demographic ageing of the population is seen in the low and steadily declining participation of young people and the high and continuously increasing share of the elderly in the total population. According to the data for the Republic of Serbia in 2019, 20.7% of the population was aged 65 and over and only 14.3% were under the age of 15. According to the activity status for persons aged 18 and over, the most exposed to the at-risk- of-poverty were unemployed persons (49.0%), while the lowest at-risk-of-poverty rate was recorded for employees working for employers (6.8%). In case of self-employed persons, this rate amounted to 31.0%. The at-risk-of-poverty rate for pensioners was 17.1%.12 Based on the 2018 Annual progress report of the European Commission for Serbia,13 activity and employment rates were at their highest, while unemployment (for 15 years and over) dropped to 12.7%. Although long-term unemployment, and female and young people unemployment continued their downward trend, the activity rate for young people has declined. The proportion of young people in the age group 15\u201324 not in employment, education or training fell further to 16.5% in 2018. The share of informal employment, two- thirds of which was in agriculture, fell to around 20% of the total. A steady population decline by 0.5% every year, along with emigration and the brain drain, especially of educated young people, remain key medium-to-long-term economic challenges. In addition, persistent skill mismatches and large regional disparities have continued to be a major labour market issue, resulting in high structural unemployment. 11 Data of the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia.

As a result, among the formally employed, almost half are employed in the public sector. Despite this, poverty measured at the USD 5/day poverty line is projected to continue to slowly decline to around 13% by 2020.15 Food and agricultural products account for about 13% of the country\u2019s exports, 17% of employment and 7% of GDP.

There are also farms with competitive fruit production for export. The agriculture sector has had a net positive effect on growth and exports in recent years, although its weather dependence creates substantial volatility risks.16 4.1 Gender issues The Republic of Serbia has ratified all international and regional treaties and conventions that set the standards in the fields of human rights, women\u2019s rights and gender equality and developed a broad anti-discrimination and human rights legal framework. The Constitution guarantees the equality of women and men and obliges the state to develop equal opportunities policies (Art. 15). The Constitution guarantees equality before the law, and prohibits both direct and indirect discrimination based on any ground, particularly on race, sex, national origin, social origin, birth, religion, political or other opinion, property status, culture, language, age, mental or physical disability. 14 Iseman, T. and Miralles-Wilhelm, F.

Despite increases in economic growth, there is still high gender inequality in access to employment and resources, including property, land, financial markets, transport, jobs, support programs for businesses, and agricultural loans, with persistent gender gaps within the labour market. The 2019 employment rate of the working-age population (15\u201364) was 65.6% for men and 52.0% for women.17 The Law on Gender Equality,18 adopted before the general Law on Discrimination, has numerous shortcomings that still need to be addressed, as seen in practice. Although the Law makes a distinction between sex and gender (Art. 10), it refers only to equality between the sexes and equal opportunity policy and does not introduce gender equality. De facto discrimination against women is not clearly recognised or targeted by the Law. The Law also fails to introduce efficient implementation mechanisms, clear mandates and sufficiently specific provisions that would govern gender equality mechanisms at all levels, application of the principle of equal treatment in the access to and supply of goods and services, and effective penalties for noncompliance with the statutory provisions.19 Since 2014, the primary institution addressing gender-related issues is the Coordinating Body for Gender Equality of the Government of Serbia.20 In addition to the Coordinating Body, other institutions involved in gender-related issues include the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Policy, the Ministry of the Interior, the Network of Women Members of Parliament, the Provincial Secretariat for Gender Equality, local-level bodies for gender equality, and women\u2019s NGOs. The 2009 Law on Gender Equality stipulates that all local self-governments establish their own gender equality mechanisms.

There are only a few natural lakes in Serbia (with the exception of Pali\u0107 Lake), and most are very small, originating from erosion or accumulation processes. On the other hand, there are numerous artificial lakes throughout the country serving as water reservoirs or for flood prevention and erosion control purposes.24 The state of the environment in Serbia has been regularly monitored, based on an established set of environmental indicators. Monitoring is performed by the Serbian Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) that publishes the Report on the State of the Environment in Serbia on an annual basis.25 Throughout the predefined set of indicators, SEPA monitors and reports on air quality, climate change (including GHG inventory), water quality, biodiversity, waste management, noise, ionising radiation, forestry, hunting and fishing, sustainable use of natural resources, and the legal, economic and social issues that influence the environment in the country. 4.3 Serbia\u2019s climate change context An analysis of the observed climate change in Serbia shows that the rising temperature trend is increasing further over time. In January 2019, the Republic Hydrological and Meteorological Service announced that 2018 was the hottest year on record in the Republic of Serbia. In recent decades, changes in climate conditions have also led to more frequent droughts, while more precipitation can be related to intensive precipitation events, frequently causing flash floods. Furthermore, in the national territory, temperatures are expected to continue rising until the end of this century to values that are on average 3 to 5\u00b0C higher than the temperatures from the mid-20th century. Such changes will further destabilise the climate system and this progressive change in climatic conditions will be conducive to the onset of extreme heatwaves, severe drought episodes and an increase in precipitation accumulations during extreme events.26 The risks of climate change to Serbia\u2019s sustainable development are evident, and the impacts of climate change may jeopardise infrastructure, agriculture productivity, water availability and 24 Ministry of the Interior (2017).

In 2014 alone, floods caused enormous damages and recovery required an estimated EUR 1.35 billion.28 Drought, insect invasions and forest fires have significantly impacted forest ecosystems in Serbia. In the long run, climate change can cause a transformation of entire forest ecosystems, changing the distribution and composition of Serbian forests. Climate change will affect the spatial variation in agro-climatic conditions, the conditions for plant breeding and the selection of suitable varieties.

The number of people affected by flooding is estimated at about 200,000 per year on average, at an estimated cost of USD 1 billion in GDP. Serbia ranks fourth among Europe and Central Asia countries in output affected by a 100-year flood. The risk posed by climate change is high for Serbia, as the country ranked 8th in 2017 and 35th in 2018 of all countries on the German Climate Risk Watch Index in terms of losses relative to GDP. Major floods in May 2014 caused damages equivalent to 2.7% of GDP and pushed an estimated 125,000 people into poverty. More recently, parts of central and western Serbia were affected by heavy rain and flash floods in June 2019, with 20 municipalities declaring a state of emergency.30 The risks are not equal across the entire territory and vary depending on the type of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and coping capacity.

(2017). Serbian Water Management Strategy. (Official Gazette of RS 03/17). Belgrade, Serbia: National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia. 16 River floods in the major river basins are caused by long periods of rainfall and/or intensive snow melt. Flash floods can occur in smaller catchments and are caused by short intensive rainfall, mostly due to summer storms. There are other contributing factors, such as a lack of or limited maintenance of embankments and/or flood control structures, debris and sediments blocking rivers, drainage or diversion channels that reduce the capacity of river flow and so on. In addition, the use of certain agricultural practices, such as water, soil and land management techniques, may also have an impact on flooding (flash floods or surface water flooding) and sediments.32 Serbia has flood protection and control infrastructure to prevent and mitigate the impacts of floods. The country\u2019s flood-prone areas cover around 1.6 million hectares, including over 500 larger settlements, more than 500 large commercial buildings, around 1,200 km of railways, and more than 4,000 km of roads.33 In order to protect against flooding, over 3,400 km of embankments have been built and river regulation of about 420 km has been completed. However, in recent years, investments for the maintenance of facilities and riverbeds have decreased. As a result, waterway embankments are highly exposed and at a risk of flooding.34 According to data from the Public Management Investment Office, sanitation and repair works of the existing flood control infrastructure have been complete in more than 300 locations throughout Serbia (data from 2017), at a total estimated value of EUR 25 million. The EU and World Bank, together with other bilateral donors, have supported Serbia in reconstructing and repairing damaged and destroyed flood control infrastructure, values at approximately EUR 70 million.35 The Second National Communication towards UNFCCC36 identified 99 areas in Serbia that are under significant flood risk, revealing that the largest potentially flooded areas lay along the Danube, Tisa, Sava, Drina, Velika Morava, Ju\u017ena Morava and Zapadna Morava Rivers. Floods occurred in these areas between 1965 and 2011, resulting in large-scale damage (total of 73 events). Based on the same document, the disastrous flood in May 2014, caused by extraordinary heavy and prolonged rainfall, hit 42 significant flood prone areas in Western and 32 FAO (2018).

Unfortunately, there are no data available on the implementation and potential effects of these measures in Serbia. In 2019, the Republic of Serbia adopted the Regulation on Establishing a General Flood Protection Plan (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia 18/19). The plan covers a six-year period and stipulates measures to be undertaken in periods of high water, the manner of institutional organisation and responsibilities, the observation and recording of hydrological and other data and the forecasting of phenomena and alerting of relevant public institutions and the public in the case of floods. 18 On the other hand, the Flood Risk Management Plan for the Territory of Serbia has not yet been adopted, despite the fact that the development of such a document is mandatory pursuant to the Law on Waters and the EU Floods Directive on the assessment and management of flood risks.37 Figure 5. The application of NbS for water security (Source: This figure is created by the author of this study.) 4.4.2 Droughts Droughts are, to a certain extent, different from other natural hazards. Since they have a slow start, they can evolve over months or even years, affecting spatially large regions and causing little structural damage. It is often difficult to precisely determine or predict their start, and their severity. Complex and multi-level impacts of droughts on many socio-economic sectors and ecosystems have emerged in recent years in Serbia, leading to greater concerns about droughts. The projected increase in the frequency and severity of droughts related to climate change can make the situation even more unfavourable. Most droughts in Serbia have been triggered by a lack of precipitation during the warmer months, accompanied with increased evapotranspiration due to increased temperatures. A preliminary estimate of cumulative losses that can be attributed to droughts after 2000 exceeds EUR 5 billion. Despite the significance of these losses associated with droughts, 37 Coalition 27 (2020). Chapter 27 in Serbia: Walking in the Mist. Belgrade, Serbia: Young Researchers of Serbia. 19 government responses were mainly reactive and ad hoc, after the end of drought events (Drought Initiative Recommendations for development of the National Drought Plan of the Republic of Serbia).38 Furthermore, the Drought Initiative indicates that the impacts associated with droughts are the result of numerous climate factors, but are also related to societal factors that define the level of overall resilience of society. Factors, such as poverty, weak and/or ineffective governance, outdated or ineffective government policies, unmanaged land use change, degradation of environment and ecosystems, outdated technology used by some industries, such as outdated agro-technical practices in agriculture production, are just some examples that contribute to changing vulnerability to drought. While the additional benefits of NbS may contribute to different aspects of these, NbS approaches also include benefits to mitigate the degradation of environment and ecosystems. Research in Vojvodina39 has shown that drought damage depends on soil characteristics, subterranean water levels, crop and hybrid types, total precipitation deficiencies, precipitation spread and other factors (temperature, etc.). The negative impact of drought in Serbia may include all of the following: \uf0b7 agriculture (the damages from drought in 2007 alone totalled EUR 600 million); \uf0b7 decreasing energy production (in 2007 hydropower plants produced 1.77 billion kWh less than in 2006); \uf0b7 transportation; \uf0b7 commerce and industry (recreation/tourist industry declines); \uf0b7 urban areas (lawn irrigation, sanitation, drinking); \uf0b7 water resources, and \uf0b7 environmental/ecological. The Water Management Strategy prescribes a set of measures to neutralise or reduce the adverse effects of drought foreseen as a result of possible changes in the temperature and precipitation regime, whereas the most pronounced and most harmful effects of droughts are related to agricultural production. Studies have shown that during the past 12 years, there were four autumn droughts, which is not suitable for winter crops and grasslands (meadows, pastures), while there were eight 38 Djurdjevic, V.

The only existing database on natural hazard impacts including drought is the United Nation International Strategy for Disaster Reduction\u2019s (ISDR) disaster loss database DESINVENTAR. The part of the database for Serbia is maintained by the Sector for Emergency Management. Currently, for Serbia there are 45 data cards related to drought (approximately 5% of all available cards for Serbia) covering the period from 2000 to 2012. The number of recorded events and associated losses are probably underestimated, since the number of events and recorded losses are significantly smaller in comparison to some independent estimates. As stated within the National Drought Plan, the priorities in combating drought should be: \uf0b7 development of drought monitoring and early warning systems; \uf0b7 assessment of drought vulnerability and risks; \uf0b7 implementation of measures to limit the impacts of drought and improve response to drought. Some elements needed to establish these three pillars have already been put in place, but they are often not fully developed, or they are fragmented and not able to function together. 4.4.3 Erosion and torrential processes According to the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) Country Report,41 one of the main factors of land degradation in the territory of the Republic of Serbia is the phenomenon and development of different forms of land erosion processes, which cause a series of negative physical and physical chemical changes. 40 UNDP (2019). Climate Change Impacts on Serbian agriculture. Belgrade, Serbia: United Nations Development Programme. 41 Ministry of Environmental Protection (2020). Report on the Applied Methodology and Identification of Targets to Achieve Land Degradation Neutrality in the Republic of Serbia. Belgrade, Serbia: Ministry of Environment and Environmental Protection. 21 Land erosion and the occurrence of torrents are two interconnected natural phenomena which, each in their own way, cause immense damage to all areas of life and economic activities in Serbia. Erosion processes are long-term, with visible changes within a one-to-ten-year period, while torrents occur and end in a relatively short period. The intensity and surface distribution of certain forms of erosion in Serbia\u2019s territory have been subject to monitoring and study for decades, but not continuously.42 Within the Water Management Strategy of Serbia, erosion is grouped into five categories on a scale ranging from very weak to excessive. Land erosion has been recognised within the Serbian legislation as a national indicator of environmental quality. Unfortunately, in recent decades, there has been no systematic research that would result in a complete information database on erosion processes in the territory of the Republic of Serbia. The erosion map (Figure ) was taken from the Water Management Strategy of the Republic of Serbia and was changed only with regard to the surface areas where no anti-erosion work was performed after 1993. However, the map of the entire territory of the Republic of Serbia was not amended. It shows that the most represented forms of erosion in the northern plains of Serbia are very weak (blue) to weak (medium intensity is much less frequent), while the erosion processes in the central and southern parts of Serbia have much greater intensity, with prominent areas of strong (yellow) and excessive erosion (red). In this area, very weak erosion is present only in the plains and in river valleys.43 42 Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection (2017). Executive Summary for the Water Management Strategy of the Republic of Serbia Belgrade, Serbia: Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection. 43 Ibid. 22 Anti-erosion protection and landscaping of basins are implemented as part of measures for integral utilisation, landscaping and timely protection of accumulations from filling with deposits. In conformity with the strategy for transforming the so-far utilised lower value agricultural land into quality forests, biological measures of protection represent a priority \u2013 afforestation, renewal of degraded forests, grass sodding and melioration of pastures. The goal is, by implementing anti-erosion protection measures, to create conditions in which the systems provide a stable income, which further secures regular maintenance.44 44 Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection (2014).

According to the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Serbia from 2010 to 2020 (Official Gazette of RS 88/10), the goal is to increase the area of national territory under forests to 41.4% by 2050. Within that, to increase the level of forest cover in areas under bare and degraded soil in the mountainous areas south of the Sava and Danube Rivers, over an area of 100,000 ha by 2030, so as to control erosion and torrential processes (Water Management Strategy in the Territory of the Republic of Serbia). The Water Management Strategy of the Republic of Serbia further emphasises that over the last twenty years, new anti-erosion activities and the maintenance of existing activities have been significantly reduced due to a reduction of the necessary funds for investments in this domain. As a result, in recent years there have been floods throughout Serbia caused by torrential flows. The construction of new facilities and the execution of necessary protective works require significant resources, because of their complexity and high cost, and the fact that there are still large areas prone to erosive processes. It is estimated that at least EUR 280/ha should be invested in regulating land with low erosion rates, where no additional afforestation is needed, while in the cases of high erosion rates specific costs reach EUR 2,000/ha. In order to achieve a satisfactory condition, it is necessary to invest approx. EUR 240 million in the anti-erosion regulation of affected areas over the next twenty years, while preserving the operational design of constructed facilities and executed works will require an annual investment of around EUR 7.5 million.45 45 Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection (2017).

Stakeholder analysis The purpose of the stakeholder analysis is to provide insight into the importance and influence, interests, and potential roles of various stakeholder groups in relation to NbS for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The analysis strives to reveal relations between the various stakeholder groups at the national and local levels, and how they may benefit from NbS. In order to identify and analyse relevant stakeholders, one should take into account that NbS approaches could be applied in various sectors, penetrating into many fields of actions, including water management, nature protection and biodiversity, forestry, urban development, spatial planning, infrastructure, agriculture, etc. The formal competencies for policy development and implementation are held by various institutions (government bodies, public utility companies, or public agencies) that are in charge of implementing, in whole or in part, some of the important policies closely related to NbS, DRR and CCA. Therefore, the plethora of stakeholder groups and/or various actors could potentially influence and/or contribute to the policy-making, promotion, knowledge building and application of NbS in Serbia. The overview of the competencies of the relevant Serbian institutions illustrates the complexity of the current system relevant for the application of NbS and emphasises the need for coordination and collaboration among different sectors and between various administrative and governance levels in Serbia. It is also important to mention, that due to the overarching and multidimensional nature of NbS, the competencies related to application of some solutions, such as ecosystem restoration or ecosystem-based adaptation, are not just divided between various sectors, but also among various divisions/units/departments within a single ministry. For example, the Sector for Climate Change and Nature Protection within the Ministry for Environmental Protection is in charge of biodiversity, climate change, nature protection and protected areas, while the Forest Directorate within the Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management holds the exclusive mandate for forest management. In order to determine the interest and influence of the various stakeholder groups in the application of NbS, stakeholders were clustered into primary, secondary and other interest groups (Figure , Table 2) and a power-interest grid ( Table 3) was used to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7eef4ffa-6cb9-4337-9028-d5be5e78f806": {"__data__": {"id_": "7eef4ffa-6cb9-4337-9028-d5be5e78f806", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d5f985dedcdc2083bbb8bfe204a4bf14827c14cfaba46ae542a02255414f4dc"}, "3": {"node_id": "7cc52ae4-52e6-428c-b19b-3857a4b3563d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "499ebc8b93f4233ecbeedca2e7220e4ba7d0073b3a7ecc1203f9170e130b1e9c"}}, "hash": "b4dff0ffcf88e71124d2e80cd28db3983fba21aec973e8c3089fe7fc02d2e20d", "text": "identify the importance and influence of each of group. Even though all interested groups and institutions could possibly benefit from NbS, it was not possible, without additional analysis, to provide a precise estimate of the scope of the impact or benefits of NbS for the local population affected by DRR and climate change. Therefore, further research 25 among the identified interested groups including reflections on gender and vulnerable groups should be considered. GROUP 1: Government bodies, primarily line ministries in charge of climate change, forestry, water management, DRR and other complementary policies (Ministry of Environment, Ministry of AFWM, Ministry of Interior, Ministry for Construction, Transport and Infrastructure) representing the most important stakeholder group in charge of both policy development, planning and close monitoring of its implementation, considering their role also in delegating tasks regarding, for example, flood protection or sustainable forest management, to local administrations or public enterprises (in charge of water or forestry management respectively), monitoring and approving the operational plans of the public enterprise\u2019s (PE), etc. The Public Investment Management Office (PIMO) has a significant role in flood prevention and overall coordination of DRR policies, programmes and projects. GROUP 2: Local self-governments (LSGs) and public enterprises (PEs), due to their competencies representing the key spots for the application of the NbS approaches in the field. However, the interest among various LSGs vary across the country and as the risk of disaster increases, so too does the interest for closer involvement and inclusion of local governments and local public enterprises. Besides, PEs managing forests and waters (Srbija\u0161ume, Vojvodina\u0161ume, Srbijavode and Vode Vojvodine) have clear mandates to manage and arrange services related to sustainable forest management, forest fires and forestation, illegal cutting, water management, flood protection, watershed management, etc., and therefore represent the key operational institutions to be engaged in the implementation of NbS throughout Serbia. GROUP 3: Other important stakeholders, media, civil society organisations (CSOs), academic and scientific institutes and organisations, donor community that have a relatively high interest in the topic, but do not have significant influence or power in developing policies or making decisions regarding NbS. This group also includes women, youth and socially vulnerable groups, who are particularly at risk of natural disasters and effects of climate change and should be given special attention. It is important to consider the role of involved and affected local communities as they can have considerable impact at the local level for the certain issues that are of high interest for them. This influence is becoming more visible and can be considerably high at level of local communities, as shown by several citizens movements that have been recently established 26 around local environmental issues in Serbia (for example protests against small hydropower plants on Stara Planina, protest in Smederevo due to air pollution from a steel plant, initiative for adoption of the Air Quality Strategy for Serbia and similar). The public pressure and influence of these groups has proven to be significant at the level of community. In this regard, and depending on the context, the local communities can represent a highly influenced interested group and should be considered part of Group One. Figure 7.

Protection, the Climate Change Unit serves as the UNFCCC focal point. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is also the main government institution responsible for coordination of the process of preparation of National Communications and Biennial Update Reports, and for overall compliance and coordination with UNFCCC and EU climate policy requirements. The Ministry is also in charge of air protection issues, land management and droughts and acts as focal point for the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, CBD, etc. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management: Water Directorate holds the core responsibility for flood protection and water management at the national level regarding level one priority watercourses.46 The Water Directorate is in charge of flood protection infrastructure and flood protection planning. It also focuses on hydrological drought management and provides advice on the accumulation and flow regimes if water levels are low. Furthermore, it coordinates international water management programmes and projects, thereby ensuring that there is coherence in the flood risk assessment and mapping methodologies, although the Directorate is not itself involved in these activities as it plays a more managerial role. Flood control in watersheds is organised and implemented by public water management companies (Srbijavode PWMC, Vode Vojvodine PWMC and Beogradvode) in their respective territories. These companies are directed by the Ministry of Public Administration and relevant the local self-government unit. 46 According to the Law on Water (Official Gazette of RS 30/10), level one watercourses are all international watercourses and all other surface watercourses defined by the Government of Serbia based on predefined criteria such as state borders, size and characteristics of the watershed, and other defined by the Law. 29 Water and flood management of level two watercourses47 are within the mandate of local governments, which are tasked to prepare flood risk plans, conduct flood risk assessments, implement flood protection plans/measures and all operational activities related to emergency situations, overall management, coordination and evaluation of the contingency infrastructural works (e.g., cleaning riverbeds, construction and maintenance of river walls, water gates), and managing the technical, human and financial resources. The Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management: Forest Directorate is the administrative unit in charge of providing public and professional services related to forestry policy, forest conservation, improvement and use of forests, implementation of measures for forest protection, control of seeds and seedling materials, inspection works in forestry and hunting. Two public enterprises are responsible for forest management of state-owned forests, Srbija\u0161ume and Vojvodina\u0161ume, while privately owned forests are managed by private companies under the supervision and monitoring performed by the Forest Directorate. The Unit for Climate Change in Agriculture within the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management has the responsibility for inclusion of climate change issues into sectoral policies and legislation and strategic planning of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures in the sector of agriculture and rural development, among others. This Ministry also acts as the National Focal Point for the Green Climate Fund. The Ministry of Interior leads the National Emergency Management Headquarters, which is in charge of the protection and rescue management activities as well as the mainstreaming of DRR policy in the country. The Sector for Emergency Management (SEM)48 is directly under the Minister of Interior and its five directorates are responsible for civil protection, prevention, risk management, fire and rescue, and the National Training Centre (NTC).

Since its establishment, enterprise operations have been directed towards meeting society\u2019s needs and the requirements given the times we live in, striving to be modern, market-oriented and profitable. Its business strategy, mission and vision are in compliance with the plans and policies of the Government of the Republic of Serbia. The enterprise objectives are complex and result from the fact that forests represent a conditionally renewable natural resource and a common good, and that they need to be managed by following the principles of sustainable use. Such forest management implies the alignment of business activities with growing environmental and social requirements. Enterprise employees are obliged to manage forests as good stewards, taking into account forest cultivation, protection and utilisation. The state enterprise Vojvodina \u0161ume manages state forests on the territory of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. The enterprise is, among others, competent for breeding, protection, management of protected natural goods, maintenance and regeneration of forests, production of forest seeds and planting material and growing of new forests and forest plantation, as well as forest utilisation, production of forest products and other products of forestland areas, utilisation of forests for recreational purposes, sawn-wood production and other ways of forest utilisation. The public water management companies (PWMC) perform activities of public interest related to water management on a specific territory. These companies prepare plans and programmes, organise maintenance of water facilities and systems in public ownership and flood control and protection from erosion and torrents, prepare opinions for the issuance of water acts, perform identification of water bodies of surface and groundwater intended for human consumption, keep registers of protected areas and maintain the information system for their territory, and as a delegated job, they prepare the calculations and debt balance of 31 payers for statutory fees. There are three public water management companies on the territory of Serbia: Srbijavode, Vode Vojvodine, and Beogradvode. Local self-government units (towns and municipalities) have a mandate in environmental protection as well as protection from natural and other disasters (Article 20 of the Local Self- Government Act) and perform other duties and services delegated by national legislation provisions in the areas of defence, protection and rescue, firefighting, etc. Municipalities also have competencies in performing delegated services within the inspection in health, education, environmental protection, mining, agriculture, forestry, water management and other (Article 22 of the Law). 32 6. Nature-based Solutions in the Serbian policy framework Nature-based Solutions are a relatively new approach, mainly representing actions that work with ecosystems in addressing various societal challenges. There is a combination of international and regional frameworks and conventions that influences and provides provisions for NbS globally and guide national actions. The past five years have particularly seen the adoption of major global agreements that recognise the importance of ecosystems in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, as well as providing entry points to upscale such approaches (for more details on relevant international and regional policies relevant for NbS please see Annex III and Annex IV of the Study). Nature-based Solutions can be applied through a variety of different measures, approaches and interventions. They are often applied within existing CCA or DRR policies, programmes or measures without being formally recognised as NbS. Therefore, in order to understand the scope and possible impact of the application of NbS, it is necessary to identify gaps in the current policy framework. A comprehensive overview of the policy framework in Serbia is presented below, including also, besides climate and DRR, forestry, water management, biodiversity and other relevant policies. The analysis helps identify opportunities for the mainstreaming of NbS into policies, including strategies, plans and programmes, as a first step towards wider NbS application in Serbia. 6.1 Climate change policies Existing national programmes and strategies recognise the values of ecosystems and their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation, but NbS are not explicitly mentioned or acknowledged as actions or tools associated with climate change.49 Serbia submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the UNFCCC50 on 15 June 2015 \u2013 prior to UNFCCC COP21 \u2013 with a pledge to reduce its GHG emissions by 9.8% from 1990 levels by 2030. In August 2017, Serbia became a Party to the Paris Agreement. With the ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement, Serbia's INDCs became its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1a0501-4e37-4b53-aab9-2e3c4fcf0c5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1a0501-4e37-4b53-aab9-2e3c4fcf0c5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ed2292fa5c0ad5226d893ebae3efd02a5ec7cd692dcfcac35f1e7d90bbb2efe"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a598050-629d-436b-bad7-6a0ecb046880", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d80a24a6ff5a0f392df735fbe272db45c448eb1b64a8c2d78dd5a2543590d356"}}, "hash": "ef3af137901118a757fe767ec4fd5cea0341290615ed0df24357f8f3b6c572fc", "text": "Currently, Serbia is in the process of revising its NDCs to cover the period from 2021\u20132030.

The Republic of Serbia has drafted its first national Low Carbon Development Strategy with an Action Plan, to be adopted in 2020. Following the reporting requirement under the UNFCCC, Serbia submitted its First Biennial Update Report (BUR) as well as two National Communications. The Third National Communication, and the Second BUR is currently in preparation.51 The reports Serbia submitted pursuant to its obligations under the UNFCCC provide an overview of and propose measures for climate change mitigation and adaptation in the relevant sectors. However, the cross-sectoral and comprehensive integration of climate change issues in other sectors in Serbia (environmental, agricultural, economic, social, etc.) is still pending.52 According to Serbia\u2019s Second National Communication to UNFCCC,53 \u201cvulnerability assessments were made for the following sectors: hydrology and water resources, forestry, agriculture and health care, and it was confirmed that these sectors are affected by the changed climate conditions. Specific adaptation measures for each of these sectors were developed, with the aim to timely adapt to climate change, taking into account climate scenarios. However, analyses show the need for further and more detailed research in all sectors and awareness raising on needs and possibilities of adaptation at the sectoral level.\u201d As stated within the 2020 EU Progress Report for Serbia,54 in the field of climate change \u201cSerbia has some level of preparation on climate change, but implementation is at a very early stage. Serbia has still not adopted the climate law it had prepared in 2018. The adoption and implementation of a climate strategy and action plan, which is consistent with the EU 2030 framework for climate and energy policies and which addresses adaptation to climate change, is paramount for Serbia\u2019s future low carbon development.

Considering proven and evident benefits deriving from NbS for climate change adaptation and mitigation, one should take advantage of ongoing climate related policy updates in order to reinforce inclusion of the NbS approach within climate change related policies and programmes in Serbia. 34 The Law on climate change transposes the relevant EU legislation providing a legal basis for development and updates of low-carbon development and adaptation strategies, monitoring, reporting and verification of the GHG emissions and implementation of climate policies and measures.55 The Draft Law on Climate Change was in the public debate process between 15 March and 20 April 2018; however, the Draft Law is still not in the parliamentary procedure.56 The draft Low Carbon Development Programme of Serbia clearly recognises the importance of natural ecosystems for climate adaptation and mitigation within the specific objective 3: Increase the carbon sink in Serbian Forests by 17% by 2030 and between 22% and 132% by 2050 compared with 2010, and specific objective 4: Preserve the potential of mitigation measures, determined for 2030 and 2050, by increasing the resilience to climate change of the priority sectors.

The National Disaster Risk Management Programme governs interventions with a focus on a long-term disaster risk management system, including DRR. The corresponding Action Plan provides a number of key areas for intervention, including the strengthening and development of institutions, monitoring, structural and non-structural risk reduction, preparedness and early warning systems, risk financing and recovery. In 2018, Serbia adopted a new Law on Disaster Risk Reduction and Emergency Management,57 which is fully in line with the Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction. The Law places emphasis on risk reduction and management, promotes prevention and reduction of risks, including prevention, mitigation and preparedness regarding protection and rescue in various sectors, while striving to strengthen the resilience of individuals and communities to these hazards. The Law further determines the rights and obligations of citizens, local self- governments, autonomous province and the Republic of Serbia, and promotes international cooperation, administrative inspection and other issues related to the architecture and functioning of the whole system. Special attention within the Law is given to vulnerable groups and gender equality, harmonising those with UN recommendations, and to the establishment of partnerships between public and private sectors, participation and inclusion of scientific institutions and civil society in the processes of development and implementation of DRR measures. The Law lists (Article 13) numerous subjects within the system for DRR and emergency management: public institutions, autonomous province, local-self-governments, public utility companies, and other legal entities, entrepreneurs, CSOs, education and scientific institutions, public agencies etc. and introduces the National Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, in charge of ensuring the 57 Anon.

Belgrade, Serbia: National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia. 36 coordination of actions among all the subjects in the DRR system, to be established by the Government (Article 41). However, no specific Government mechanisms have been defined that can ensure enforcement of the Law, i.e., ensure coordination at different levels and enable inclusive participation of various stakeholders within the DRR system in Serbia. This Law represents a key legislative document that harmonises the regulatory and legislative frameworks in Serbia with key international policies on DRR (e.g., Sendai Framework for DRR) and enables transformation of the Serbian DRR system towards one that focuses on disaster risk reduction, prevention and community resilience instead of reaction and mitigation. The current National Strategy on Emergency Management is outdated and the Law prescribes adoption of a new one. However, there is still no indication that such a document is in the process of drafting or adoption. Serbia developed a comprehensive and extensive disaster risk assessment in March 2019,58 providing detailed data on all major disaster risks, including a comprehensive set of measures, activities and actions needed to be taken in order to reduce the risks. Finally, in March 2020, the Government of Serbia adopted the Regulation on the composition, organisation and procedures for the work of the emergency situation headquarters,59 at the national, provincial, district, city and municipal levels stipulating its members, procedures of operations, competencies, etc. According to the 2019 EU Progress Report, \u201cSerbia needs to further strengthen internal coordination and its capacity for disaster prevention, disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management including flood risk management at national and local level\u201d.60 The existing weaknesses and the prevailing barriers to climate change adaptation and DRR planning in Serbia are related to lack of structured information sharing and exchange, capacity weaknesses, as well as a general lack of awareness of CCA \u2013 both at the national and subnational levels. Climate change is not integrated into existing policies, or their associated budget priorities. The underlying challenge is that there is currently no comprehensive 58 Government of the Republic of Serbia (2017).

The poor and disempowered are more vulnerable to climate change because they lack access to relevant socio-economic and political resources needed for adaptation to disruptions in the immediate environment. Women are at a higher risk of poverty and have less political and socio-economic power than men. Although both men and women will suffer the negative consequences of climate change, compounded social inequalities put women in a disadvantageous position. Women in developing countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change since they are often poor and are usually the primary users and managers of natural resources.62 The UNDP report Gender and climate change in the Republic of Serbia63 recognises the differences between men and women in terms of energy and mobility and emphasises the role of women in making specific contributions to mitigation, as household and community managers. The Report also notes that women and men might benefit differently from the positive effects of climate policy, for example from job creation in the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors. The research carried out by the WISE Project in SEE64 on a nationally representative sample of women in Serbia (women professionally engaged in sustainable energy, climate change, and environmental protection, and women in households) showed that: 61 GCF (2019).

Although, the National Disaster Risk Management Programme and its corresponding Action Plan prescribes a number of key areas for intervention directed towards protection from floods and erosion and strengthening of community resilience, Nature-based Solutions are still not recognised nor fully embraced to achieve CCA and DRR objectives. 38 \uf0b7 Women support the state in creating energy and climate change policies promoting sustainable energy development based on the implementation of green technologies and smart and advanced solutions. \uf0b7 Women consider being in line with the principles of sustainable development as very important for their work. \uf0b7 The representation of women in sustainable energy, climate change, and environmental protection positions in Serbia within public institutions and companies decreases as the seniority of ranks increases. The draft Low Carbon Development Strategy does not incorporate a gender dimension in elaborating the issues of climate change and recognises the differences among men and women only within their roles in using energy in the households, assuming that the consumption of energy will affect women more than men. The Second National Communication also does not mention gender issues. However, there are efforts, mainly driven by the UNDP office in Serbia to mainstream gender into environmental and climate related policies in Serbia. Within the UNDP Climate Smart Urban Development Project, the establishment of a gender sensitive monitoring framework has been initiated as a precondition for gender sensitive evidence-based policy-making in the area of climate change and the Guidelines on how and where to mainstream gender perspective in both climate change policies but also other relevant policy areas as gender equality is a cross sectoral and multi- sectoral issue, as well as climate change has been developed.65 There are initiatives (i.e., Climate Smart Urban Development Project66) to include representatives of the Gender Equality Council in the development of the Second BUR and Third National Communication and the Capacity Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) inter-ministerial project working group, and thus enable inputs to draft BUR/National Communication reports related to gender. This and similar practices could be further explored and continued as to ensure that gender aspects are taken into consideration and incorporated in the measures for mitigating and adapting to climate changes in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d45619cf-164a-47da-9cc5-c6b7adfb0f81": {"__data__": {"id_": "d45619cf-164a-47da-9cc5-c6b7adfb0f81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26da560ae2a975129750664ea9fbd0c95c4c4860e2321e4adfed0e1a110e2955"}, "3": {"node_id": "a825b549-f1a3-49fc-a6bb-5233b2e413ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4a8e084166cc3a881d16ae2e8597d100836d99ee82f35aca2d33f4d9c21cb65"}}, "hash": "3afd8d7cc60ddd07d12f270fe4266e3945ff2bcd6996c147621089dbf8530b13", "text": "Serbia.

The new Law integrates the gender perspective as an overall principle, and stipulates the involvement of women\u2019s organisations in the development of DRR plans, assessment of needs and damages, use of gender sensitive language and sex-segregated statistics.67 The Law (Article 7) prescribes the principle of equality and human rights protection and stipulates that \u201cresponsible authorities and other stakeholders involved in the implementation of measures and activities for risks disasters management are obliged to consistently take care on human rights protection, gender equality and in particular protection of elderly, children and persons with disabilities, refugees and internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups\u201d. The analysis of the Office of the Ombudsman of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina in 201568 on gender aspects within DRR, provides a set of recommendations for mainstreaming gender perspective into activities on local level necessary for risks reduction concluding that the gender aspects in emergency situations and DRR is not adequately reflected within local planning and strategic documents. The exemption is found in the municipality of Subotica and sporadically within some other Vojvodina municipalities where a gender component has been incorporated in the respective strategic documents. However, the review of available documentation in Serbia indicates that there is a lack of disaggregated data regarding roles and needs of women and men in emergency situations, and consequently on how the practical implementation of gender responsive DRR could be operationalised. 6.3 Forestry The total area of forests in Serbia is 2,360,400 ha, and the percentage of forest cover is 26.7%, which is somewhat lower than the average percentage of forest cover in Europe. The area of state-owned forests managed by State Enterprises is 1,375,553 ha, or 51.4% of the area of forests and other wooded land in Serbia. The remaining forest area is managed by private owners, other public enterprises and/or national parks. The general condition of forests is unsatisfactory, and the current condition of state forests is characterised by insufficient production volume, unfavourable age structure, unsatisfactory density of stocking and forest 67 Anon.

Of the total territory, 29.1% is under forests (in central Serbia 37.1% and in Vojvodina 7.1%). Other forestland, which according to the international definition includes thickets and shrubs, covers 4.9%. In comparison with the reference year 1979, there is a 5.2% increase of areas covered with forests. In comparison with the total covered forest, the forest stock of Serbia is dominated by coppice forests that make up 64.7% of the total. Natural high stands cover 27.5% of the territory, whereas artificially raised stands with cultures covering 7.8%.70 The Serbian policy and strategic framework regulating forestry remains obsolete despite many years of attempts and efforts at improvement.

Accessed on 12 December 2020. 41 1. increase the area of the national territory under forests to 41.4% by 2050 (Act on the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Serbia); 2. increase the area under forests in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina to 14.3% (in relation to the total area of the province), primarily by applying a system of forest protection belts; 3. increase the level of forest cover in areas under bare and degraded soil, in mountainous areas south of the Sava and Danube Rivers, in the area of 100,000 ha by 2030 so as to control erosion and torrential processes; 4. maintain the determined positive trend of land degradation neutrality, applying appropriate measures and activities, through spatial and planning documentation. Afforestation measures have a major impact on a range of problems, for which appropriate solutions need to be found: mitigating the effects of climate change in rural and urban areas (increased O2 generation, decreases CO2 emissions); soil erosion control (more than 70% of the national territory is threatened by erosion processes); protection of watershed areas of water reservoirs that are part of the water supply systems (located in mountainous area, with a significant share of eroded areas and barren lands, which leads to the filling of reservoir spaces); prevention of torrential floods, which are associated with erosion processes and represent the most common natural catastrophe in the territory of Serbia; realisation of the concept of development of the mountainous region through the agroforestry system; conservation and restoration of biodiversity. It is of particular importance to increase the forest cover of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, which is the lowland breadbasket of Serbia, primarily through the forming of forest belt systems. This will protect the soils from aeolian erosion in the lowland parts, protect railway, road and water management infrastructure (water system \"Danube-Tisa-Danube\"), and create a corridor for biodiversity restoration and ecological network structure. Therefore, afforestation measures are important not only for forestry, but for a whole range of vital activities aimed at restoring ecosystem services, preventing natural hazards and protecting the economic potential of the country, and this is incorporated in Serbia's basic spatial planning and strategic documents. According to the Draft Low Carbon Development Strategy, Serbian forests contribute to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis (carbon sink or carbon sequestration). In 2015, the CO2 removed from the atmosphere by Serbian forests amounted to 4533 ktCO2, equivalent to 7.4% of Serbia\u2019s emissions. 42 Within the draft Forest Development Programme with Action Plan (2010), although not in force, the issues of forest soils erosion are recognised along with the effects of climate change on forests and in particular vulnerability caused by wind erosion. However, the precise measures for addressing those issues are missing (except afforestation). The Programme also provides guidance to stakeholders in relation to the development of the forest sector and includes specific targets, namely for afforestation. Such approaches/targets are aligned with the need to increase the carbon sinks in Serbia but there is no GHG emissions reduction targets and it is not a driver for forestry related actions. In addition, the Spatial Development Strategy of Serbia in the field of forestry determines the long-term basis and the objectives of development and use of forests and forestland management, management of hunting opportunities and the protection of natural resources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61790e35-50a3-4e10-a56e-aada724ecab1": {"__data__": {"id_": "61790e35-50a3-4e10-a56e-aada724ecab1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f83102badcec6fdd295e6eeb668d5a95da0994acde5dd8554bd9c5bfebd72c0"}, "2": {"node_id": "fe72cd95-d0fc-4a30-b978-53a25762f056", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ffef2e521239c92c1e966fd364c37fc02926f6a13591b5efd02b805604889441"}}, "hash": "2f44aadcad27af3ebac165e321624eb051a746e5c57bc5fbfb9e54e17ca6dca8", "text": "Serbian forests are particularly vulnerable to biotic (such as pests and diseases) and abiotic (such as fires) factors, which will be further aggravated by climate change.

Belgrade, Serbia: GFA Consulting Group. 43 6.4 Biodiversity Protected areas in Serbia currently cover an area of around 678,000 ha, representing 7.65% of the territory. There are a total of 462 protected areas: five national parks, 18 nature parks, 21 special nature landscapes, 68 nature reserves, six protected habitats, 308 natural monuments, and 36 areas of cultural and historical importance. According to the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Serbia (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia 88/2010), protected areas should cover 12% of the national territory by 2020. The five national parks (\u0110erdap, Tara, Kopaonik, Fru\u0161ka Gora and \u0160ara Mountain) cover a surface of approximately 1.75% of the Serbian territory. According to the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, in particular habitats of marsh birds (Ramsar Convention), there are 10 Ramsar areas in Serbia, covering a total area of approximately 64,000 ha, or 0.72% of the territory. Based on the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of World Heritage, two areas in Serbia have been enlisted as part of the Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme: Golija \u2013 Studenica Biosphere Reserve with an area of 53,084 ha (0.61% of the territory) and Ba\u010dko Podunavlje Biosphere Reserve with an area of 176,635 ha.74 The National Nature Protection Programme75 expresses concerns about the decrease of biodiversity, inefficient system for management of protected areas, weak integration of biodiversity within other sectors, lack of knowledge and public awareness, etc. The document particularly emphasises that the biodiversity usage is not sustainable, and that the distribution of benefits and economic values \u2013 valorisation and contribution of ecosystem services - is not fully integrated in the price of most of products, nor are values of important areas (protected areas, forests reserves, wetlands and other highly diversify areas) appreciated enough and often managed in a way that degrade or erode the delivery of ecosystem services. The pressures influencing biodiversity in Serbia over the past 3\u20134 years include: \uf0b7 fires in protected areas, which have impacted forest ecosystems and led to changes in the biogeocenotic balance; \uf0b7 influence of agricultural production: exaggerated application of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, uncontrolled drainage of liquid manure from cattle farms, land management in steppe and saltwater habitats and diffuse pollution on agricultural fields; 74 Ministry of Environmental Protection (2019).

First-order waters, primarily concerning water activity, which is related to waterway regulation and flood control, are under the national and/or provincial jurisdiction, while second-order waters are under the local jurisdiction. Water management is delegated to the state-owned water management companies having jurisdiction in each territory. The Water Management Strategy\u2019s main strategic goal is achieving integrated water management, the uniformity of the water regime throughout the territory of the Republic of Serbia and establishing water management to ensure maximum economic and social effects in a fair and sustainable manner in compliance with international agreements. Furthermore, the Strategy explains that the regulation of water flow includes the construction and maintenance of water facilities for regulating waterways and works related to maintaining the stability of banks and riverbeds and increasing or maintaining the flow capacity for water, ice and sediment. Protection against the harmful effects of water means the implementation of a series of works, facilities, measures and other activities that protect people, natural and human-made material goods and resources from floods and water erosion in a rational way.

The Strategy emphasises that the current system of flood protection facilities, with a network of regulated waterways, is a very important infrastructure system in Serbia, critical for the survival and development of urban and economic centres, and infrastructural corridors in river valleys. One of the basic objectives of the EU Water Framework Directive is to achieve the good ecological status of water bodies. The fulfilment of this objective includes large-scale river and river habitat restoration projects, aimed at eliminating hydrological and morphological pressures that have an adverse impact on water ecosystems. There are still no serious river restoration initiatives in Serbia, despite a high percentage of watercourses having been significantly altered and/or negatively impacted. Initiating and implementing these projects requires cooperation with other sectors, primarily the energy sector, which exerts the most pressure on rivers (river damming and regulation); these sectors will need to take part in river restoration project funding.77 Although the new Law on Waters and the Water Management Strategy introduced the concept of integrated water resource management into public policies, it is being implemented slowly in practice. Outdated approaches to watercourse regulation are still prevailing at the expense of the protection of watercourse and aquatic ecosystems. The significance of natural ecosystems in the mitigation of floods and water treatment continues to be neglected, with watercourses assessed separately from the accompanying ecosystems. There are no data about activities or plans for the integral renewal of watercourses. Moreover, proposals have been made for very harmful projects that will place significant hydro morphological pressures on watercourses and further deteriorate already unfavourable watercourse conditions. An example is the construction of a residential complex on Ribarsko ostrvo, a waterside area in Novi Sad, which has recently been reported on by the media. Although only unofficial information has been reported by the media about this project, it is concerning that any 77 Coalition 27 (2020). Chapter 27 in Serbia: Walking in the Mist.

The Strategy emphasises negative effects of climate change on water resources, which has an inverse effect on irrigation and agricultural production. These issues are recognised as highly complex and the necessity for the comprehensive and systemic climate change adaptation measures is clearly noted. However, the Strategy does not propose any such measures. The World Bank Systematic Country Diagnostic Report for Serbia80 highlighted that agriculture is the sector most vulnerable to weather hazards and climate change. More frequent and intensive droughts in the past two decades have had a significant impact on the Serbian agriculture sector. Droughts can reduce the average crop yield by over 40%, and this could worsen as the climate continues to change. The United States Agency for International Development\u2019s 2017 Climate Change Risk Profile for Serbia projects a rise in temperature and decline in precipitation by 2050 that will affect the rain fed crops that dominate Serbian agriculture. Diversification in Serbia\u2019s agriculture would be important to reduce risks through climate mitigation and improve resilience through climate adaption. Unsustainable agricultural production practices are, however, common in Serbia, particularly among smallholders. There is also little support or technical assistance in promoting agri-environmental practices, despite the increased threat of climate change and extreme weather events that are expected to disproportionately affect poor rural households that often depend on agriculture for their livelihoods. The UNDP analysis Climate Change Impact on Serbian Agriculture81 listed a set of adaptation measures for prevention of flooding and droughts, including measures that represents the application of NbS, for example: restoration of wetlands and vegetation, reforestation, multi- purpose accumulations for water supply, introducing and growing varieties/hybrids resistant 78 Ibid. 79 Anon.

Consequently, one of the five objectives of the Strategy is dedicated to the quality of the environment with a view to \u201cimproving the quality of the environment, health and safety of citizens and adaptability of the urban areas to climate change\u201d. The Strategy relies, inter alia, on the EU Urban Agenda82 (one of whose thematic partnerships is devoted to sustainable use of land and nature-based solutions). The Strategy sets out a comprehensive set of measures under Strategic Goal No. 4 related to the quality of the environment. Several of these measures could be considered as application of the NbS principle. For example: \uf0b7 mitigation of climate change by improving the quality of the environmental parameters, inter alia, through green infrastructure measures and green roofing, and \uf0b7 adaptation to climate change and establishment of a rapid response system for risks and hazards in urban settlements, inter alia, through the conservation of biodiversity of urban areas (green surfaces, green infrastructure, protected areas, landscape, water surfaces, etc.). Forestry and land use The LDN Country Report sets the National Targets by 2030 for land use in Serbia as follows: \uf0b7 recognising elements and targets of land degradation neutrality in the legislation; \uf0b7 improvement, restoration, rehabilitation of degraded areas, implementation of measures of sustainable land management; \uf0b7 establishment and development of sustainable, systematic land monitoring; \uf0b7 establishment of appropriate, detailed national databases for the implementation of the LDN methodology; 82 European Commission [website]. https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/themes/urban- development/agenda/#:~:text=The%20Urban%20Agenda%20for%20the%20EU%20is%20an%20integrated%20and,of%20life %20in%20urban%20areas.

Protected areas and ecosystem services Research and evaluation of ecosystem services in Serbia are underdeveloped and performed sporadically. Since this is a relatively new concept, the very term is still not clear enough and not accepted by the general public. A more detailed analysis of ecosystem services has not been performed for any areas. There is no system in place or any harmonised methodology of ecosystem services research.83 A protected areas benefits assessment was conducted by WWF in 2017 for six protected areas (PA) in Serbia.84 It showed that stakeholders in Serbia recognise a wide array of PA values and benefits. They identified many values that are important for their subsistence or for economic development. These are not only values based on traditional and direct use of natural resources (i.e., forestry, mining), but also include other values based on sustainable practices and that are highly dependent on the protection and conservation of natural resources (i.e., tourism and education). The most recognised values are tourism and recreation, natural values and biodiversity, cultural and historical values, water quality and quantity, wood/forestry, and wild food plants and mushrooms. Tourism is the economic activity that is most easily linked with PAs by local stakeholders. PAs and their natural and cultural values are attractive tourist destinations that support local economies in a variety of ways. Serbia recently joined the Global Ecosystem Services Partnership, which aims to map and evaluate ecosystem services at the national level. Tourism The Tourism Development Strategy (Official Gazette of RS 91/06) recognises preserved natural values as a comparative advantage of tourism in Serbia, following the trend of the increase in the number of tourists interested in natural values. Bearing in mind that the potentials of nature represent one of the advantages on which competitiveness of tourism in Serbia is grounded, the provision of long-term protection and integrated management of natural and cultural resources are included in the goals of the development of tourism. 83 Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection (2014).

Key findings and challenges regarding NbS application in Serbia 7.1. Experiences with NbS in Serbia In accordance with the methodology, a comprehensive desk-analysis was performed to identify acting and potential NbS interventions in Serbia. At the time of this scoping study, the gaps in data and repositories proved to be a barrier to identifying NbS case studies in Serbia. Instead, research providing recommendations for NbS and undocumented local knowledge of sustainable practices were available and accessible. Regarding the former, three research studies providing concrete recommendations for NbS practices are listed below, although action has yet to be taken in each at this time. For the latter, there are sustainable practices that are known of by word-of-mouth that hold potential to either be an NbS or contribute towards a larger NbS. These word-of-mouth sustainable practices hold untapped potential in documenting, promoting and upscaling NbS in Serbia. As of yet, there are no repositories or databases capturing this local knowledge and practice. Identifying and supporting sustainable local knowledge and practices is a global challenge; one that the framework of NbS, and specifically the IUCN Global Standard for NbSTM, seek to address. A few interventions were identified that have the potential to align with or contribute to the concept of NbS, however data gaps (either a lack of data altogether or the data available being obsolete) means these could not be included as full case studies and/or good practice examples of NbS ( Table 5). It is important to note that the potential examples identified in Table 3 are lacking in terms of accessible documentation or further consultation. This means that currently there is no strong link identifiable for CCA or DRR (although they likely contribute towards these via added benefits) and that no clear links have yet been identified to the principles of NbS. These would need to be screened using the IUCN Global Standard for NbSTM to assess their complementarity to NbS.

Type of NbS approach: Flood prevention through the use of natural retention capacities in wetlands Due to the traditionally strong regulation of water flows and the narrowing of flooded areas, flood waves often do not have enough space for spilling, therefore the wave moves downstream more quickly and can cause more damages than it normally would. This becomes the case with lowland rivers, in particular during the floods in 2014, and in these cases, the 52 existing flood protection systems consisting primarily of dams and accumulations cannot neither prevent nor slow flooding due to their limited capacity. Given the more extreme hydrological phenomena caused by extreme weather conditions, one could expect that flooding and flood waves might occur more frequently, and that flood protection needs to be strengthened as much as possible through the usage of natural retention capacities. The natural retention capacity of the Sava and Danube Rivers could provide more space for these rivers for spilling, while also representing cost-effective solutions, that are cheaper than the construction of dams or other expensive grey infrastructure (the latter should however still be considered in certain cases such as for protection of industrial complexes or important roads). The current flood protection system in Serbia includes massive water accumulations that combines dams, a system of channels, deepening riverbeds and/or construction of embankments, cleaning of the natural river", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88d38ae6-5c65-46e4-8ac8-c57f40fce9d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "88d38ae6-5c65-46e4-8ac8-c57f40fce9d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ed16f922cb61466506fb5b545a5db6449f90f7bcb023d9536534ab28afd9012"}, "3": {"node_id": "b643b42b-a551-4883-8ddf-c791969888d0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b802395e7883f311c8b3670233b59598bab9fe1d5ca4fe5414b7fe03f3dfe23"}}, "hash": "3521e279e84f24aabd4478029aa5e161963a8f448ea590fdb05b42b5ec6711e5", "text": "vegetation, etc. However, these measures proved to be inefficient and insufficient during the 2014 floods in Serbia, as the ground was already saturated from the rain and could not absorb the high waters and strong flood waves. Therefore, a possible solution for preventing flooding and slowing the flood wave, in particular in the Vojvodina region, could be the application of the NbS approach. The natural river valleys should be expanded to enable more space for water spilling, creating a self-regulating mechanism for large flood waves. The natural flooded areas could mitigate or decrease the negative effects of the floods downstream. Some examples of natural retention areas that could be transformed and upgraded so as to enable more efficient prevention of floods are the special natural reserves Zasavica, Obedska Bara, Gornje Podunavlje and Karadjordjevo. In accordance with the Convention on wetlands of international importance, in particular habitats of marsh birds (Ramsar Convention), 10 Ramsar areas have been proclaimed in Serbia, covering a total surface of approximately 64,000 ha, or 0,72% of the territory. These areas hold the potential for application of the NbS in context of flood prevention and improvement of the flood management in Vojvodina through improvement and exploitation of the natural retention capacity, and this should be further explored in this sense. It is not known at this time what measures are taken at these locations to improve their capacities for flood prevention and protection. 53 Type of NbS approach: Ecosystem-based approach for increasing the value of ecosystem services Advocating Ecosystem Services Assessment and Valuation (ESAV) in the Bosut Forests area \u2013 Integrating biodiversity and ecosystem services in natural resource uses and management86 This case study aimed to present the possibilities for increasing benefits, both quantitative and qualitative, through the introduction of integrated planning and multipurpose utilization of the Bosut Forests area, near Sremska Mitrovica. A comprehensive study of the conditions, proposed scenarios, and costs and benefits was performed and the most optimal scenario was recommended. The case study proposes \u201cmultipurpose utilisation of the area (the establishment of a protected area with the reception of flood waves in half of the Nature Park; environmental flooding of the forest complex in order to increase forest vitality and maintain the existent habitat mosaic; the application of traditional animal husbandry as the most economical method of habitat maintenance; increasing yields and profits in the area).\u201d Furthermore, the authors demonstrated a likely increase in the value of four ecosystem services, selected as having the highest importance for the area (wood production, flood prevention, meat production and biodiversity), if environmental flooding of the forest complex and increase in traditional animal husbandry are implemented along with joint management and establishment of protected area: \uf0fc wood production would benefit from 30\u201350% less forest dieback and salvage cuttings related to water depletion, with proportionally higher quality yield in timber; \uf0fc the forest retention area will be able to store 100\u2013200 million cubic meters of water, with extraordinary importance in flood management; \uf0fc an increased number of pigs grazing in the Bosut Forests (by 5\u20137 times) together with better fodder availability will result in 10\u201314 times the income from traditional farming. Moreover, there will be an additional benefit from better meat flavour and quality when compared with conventional pig farm production, 86 German Development Cooperation [website].

Environmental degradation creates economic and social problems within local societies, which is often followed by depopulation. Restoring watersheds to their optimal hydrological state would reduce flood discharge, and increasing groundwater recharge would increase both low-flow and average discharges in springs and streams.

Administrative measures are applied through the \u201cPlans for announcement of erosive regions and protection from torrential floods in the Leskovac municipality\u2033. The plans prohibit clear cutting, cuttings in protective forests, straight row farming down the slope, uncontrolled urbanisation, and overgrazing (Articles 15 and 30 of the Law on Waters; Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia 54/96). Landowners are required to apply contour farming and terracing of arable land as effective measures of erosion control. The results of this study show that protection from torrential floods can be enhanced by planned land use change through the calculation of the effect of selected restoration measures on the hydrological performance of the Jela\u0161nica River, showing that modest land use changes can have significant impacts. Forest vegetation significantly decreases the amount and velocity of surface water and intensity of erosion processes, helping the development of soil and its infiltration capacity. Planting stable forest stands on bare lands and steep slopes is an effective anti-erosive and flood protective measure. Similarly, positive effects can be provided by properly treating arable land with contour farming and terracing. 7.2 Main obstacles for NbS application in Serbia Nature-based Solutions are a relatively new approach, promoted during recent decades by the international community to address climate change issues, natural disasters and other societal challenges. As per its definition, NbS can be applied in numerous fields and through various approaches (ecosystem-based adaptation, green infrastructure, ecological/environmental engineering, forest landscape restoration, etc.). The IUCN Global Standard for Nature-based SolutionsTM provides guidance on how to design and monitor NbS interventions. The application of NbS requires comprehensive analysis and research based on the context of the specific location or site/territory and iterative decision-making processes facilitating the selection of the best available and most cost effective and efficient (also feasible) option.88 The policies in Serbia are still fragmented and cross-sectoral mainstreaming is lacking. Despite many attempts to mainstream climate change issues into other policies (even within the environmental sector), the recognition of climate change impacts on different sectors remains insufficient. Moreover, climate change and disaster risks are generally treated as separate issues, presenting an additional challenge for the application of NbS in Serbia. 88 Mainly taken from: UNDP (2020). Study on Nature-based Solutions in Serbia. Belgrade, Serbia: United Nations Development Programme. 56 The analysis of available documents, strategies and policy frameworks for Serbia reveals that climate change is not integrated into existing policies or their associated budget priorities. The underlying challenge is that currently there is no comprehensive framework for adaptation in Serbia, though the National Communications to NFCCC provide a preliminary assessment of climate-induced vulnerabilities. Furthermore, there is a lack of structured information sharing and exchange, capacity weaknesses, as well as a general lack of awareness related to CCA \u2013 both at the national and local levels. These are the main weaknesses and prevailing barriers to climate change adaptation (CCA) and disaster risk reduction (DRR) planning in Serbia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2119021-cb16-48e4-b9ce-1ae9f8e45236": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2119021-cb16-48e4-b9ce-1ae9f8e45236", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59fa1dbd3b266dd0741c31c4e012e3675fd9cc66c7470cd2ab4280405ff1a449"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc568322-c300-46e9-9e3d-b5d01a845f7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbf751fea613ef8f56d2be7c0334dd4f6ec4f17144af68a598596e150591ae54"}}, "hash": "c7698d6398c2d2ab5164ef6f9af12c182a78603ed81b1b1bfac8f4cfc1016852", "text": "Even though some data on the socioeconomic impact of the effects of climate change in Serbia are available, with estimations of the effects of some disasters (for example, assessment of the 2014 floods), there is currently no systematic information on geographical areas most affected by disasters, or the types of risks that prevail.

Consequently, it is not possible to give an estimation of the vulnerability of different ecosystems to recover or their capacity for resilience to climate change and disasters. Due to its multi-sectoral nature, formal policy competencies for NbS application cannot be attributed to a single sector or institution (Government bodies, local administrations, public utility companies, or public agencies) to partially or fully implement some of the important policies closely related to NbS, DRR and CCA. Competencies related to its application are not only divided among different sectors, but also among different divisions/units/departments within a single ministry. For example, the Sector for Climate Change and Nature Protection of the Ministry for Environmental Protection is in charge of biodiversity, climate change, nature protection and protected areas, while forest management lies exclusively under the jurisdiction of the Forest Directorate of the Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management. Additionally, issues related to specific measures and projects addressing identified climate change challenges or risk reduction are to be considered and tackled mostly at local (or regional) levels. The various ministries and local governments have limited formal competencies to integrate climate change adaptation or DRR into their policies and plans. There is no formal structure to integrate climate change related concerns into other national development programmes and policies, and planners and 57 decision-makers lack the tools and frameworks that would enable mainstreaming of climate change into existing national processes and systems. Therefore, the current institutional framework for NbS application is highly complex and requires additional efforts to ensure coordination and collaboration among sectors and between administration and governance levels in Serbia. In terms of DRR, the situation has improved since 2014; however, this is still no integrated system for the collection and processing of data on risks or climate change, despite efforts of the Government and international organisations to establish and support such a system. The capacities for DRR within the institutions in charge of various sectors and domains remain low. Even where formal cooperation structures exist, they are hampered by limited resources and knowledge. The data are not shared or disseminated accurately. Within the context of these capacity gaps, most efforts to improve national policies and plans on climate change and DRR retain a specific sectorial emphasis, lacking multi-sectorial coordination mechanisms for both policy and implementation.89 7.3 Recommendation and next steps in NbS application in Serbia Within the existing Serbian policy framework, the values of ecosystems and their contribution to climate change adaptation and mitigation and DRR are partly recognised, but NbS are not explicitly mentioned as associated actions or tools. However, some nature-based concepts appear sporadically among actions recommended in Serbia\u2019s strategies and several newly developed strategic documents made clear reference to NbS. \uf0b7 The new draft National Forestry Programme clearly recognises the potential for NbS, incorporating NbS approaches through envisaging the contribution of the forestry sector to economic, environmental and social development through the synergistic effects of carbon storage, conservation of biodiversity and economic benefits, coppice conversion, i.e. carbon storage through conversion of coppice to high-forest, and promotion of multifunctional sustainable forest management (biodiversity, carbon storage, ecosystem services in economically sustainable areas). \uf0b7 Furthermore, clear linkages to NbS approaches within the new Sustainable Urban Development Strategy of the Republic of Serbia adopted in July 2019 opens new possibilities and creates an enabling environment for the application of NbS or similar approaches in urban areas through mitigation of climate change by improving the quality of environmental parameters, through both adaptation to climate change and 89 Mostly taken from: UNDP (2019).

In order to derive maximum benefits from the existing natural phenomena and ecosystems in Serbia, NbS need to be mainstreamed and their application strongly linked with other sectoral measures and plans. Therefore, NbS needs to be integrated into and applied through the existing policy and institutional framework mainly in the DRR and climate change sectors and further mainstreamed and incorporated within the urban development, agriculture and rural development, land-use, forestry, water management and biodiversity and nature protection.

In order to plan and apply appropriate adaptation measures or to apply NbS approaches for the reduction of risks from disasters, it would be beneficial to have data on where and to what extent floods, droughts, fires occur (frequency/seasons). The assessment should identify of the needs and capacities of ecosystems, and also the possible trends in terms of fires, degradation, deforestation and their impact on people/economy/communities, and determine the water retention capacity of natural systems to mitigate flooding and provide overall estimation on how fragile are the systems already to climate change. NbS approaches have been sporadically applied in several ongoing initiatives in Serbia, mainly through inchoate steps in integrating the new way of thinking into existing planning systems in forestry or local flood protection, but there is no clearly \u201crecognisable\u201d NbS project implemented in Serbia so far. Some of the applied \u201cnature-based\u201d principles in wetlands like Zasavica or Obedska Bara in Vojvodina could be \u201cmarked\u201d as applications of the NbS approaches in increasing the use of natural retention capacity of the wetland and marshes to prevent flooding and/or improve flood prevention in these areas. On the other hand, the vast majority of nationally-driven implemented measures for flood protection and prevention implemented since the 2014 floods were focused on immediate emergency response, and based on grey infrastructure principles without consideration of nature and existing ecosystems or nature\u2019s potential for addressing the issues.

These areas representing the potential for application of NbS in the context of flood prevention and improvement of flood management in Vojvodina through improvement and exploitation of the natural retention capacity and needs to be further explored in this sense. The detailed analysis of the global concepts, approaches, examples and lessons learnt from the application of NbS shows that policy enforcement, stakeholder engagement, a multi- sectoral approach and local participation are just as important for putting NbS into practice as an enabling environment supported by the integration of NbS into national strategic and policy frameworks. Therefore, it is of the highest importance when implementing such a novel initiative to dedicate sufficient time and efforts to mobilise local community actors and stakeholders, to ensure two-way communication with the public and to educate and promote concepts and approaches to be applied along with the benefits that will be gained through the application of NbS. An example of good practice is the initiative in the Zapadna Morava watershed, where the municipalities belonging to the watershed signed a Memorandum of cooperation, joining forces to ensure effective and better disaster response and cooperation in creating more resilient communities. The signatories of the Memorandum agree to jointly prepare strategic and planning documents and projects, and to act towards disaster prevention and reduction in the watershed. The justification behind this approach lies in the experiences from the field that demonstrate that watersheds follow natural ecosystem boundaries, thus having similar climate conditions and common hazards and risks. Therefore, this approach represents a logical entity and enables multifunctional, multisectoral and all-inclusive approach in addressing climate change and risk-related issues and the application of NbS in the context of watershed-based approach might be further explored in flood prevention and disaster risk reduction planning in Serbia (including other watersheds such as Velika Morava, Kolubara, Drina and Gornje Podunavlje). 60 ANNEXES Annex I: Key terms and definitions Climate Change Adaptation: The IPCC defines CCA as adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities Disasters: UNISDR defines a disaster as \u201ca serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society involving widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses and impacts, which exceeds the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e09ec7a-bf51-45ef-8d7a-c8e212d3a66d": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e09ec7a-bf51-45ef-8d7a-c8e212d3a66d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9760d2a9324f84a4d811be886bd06e31335ecab1cea0d0f8d5e817ada36d605f"}, "2": {"node_id": "c0ce002c-2e1a-4cb5-9af5-453f4d9aaf90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0f0ded13c32df668446853fef8e216624d243958d03da625f3e8f889988e3ea"}}, "hash": "7b474a62d0bfdb996b3980d8dc08a19e1ec5fa575f73a766da7a388b2c3f1883", "text": "Disaster risk reduction (DRR) UNISDR defines DRR as \u201creducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and the environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events\u201d (UNISDR, 2009) Ecosystem-based Disaster Risk Reduction (Eco-DRR): Based on PEDRR, the Eco- DRR are defined as \u201cSustainable management, conservation and restoration of ecosystems to provide services that reduce disaster risk by mitigating hazards and by increasing livelihood resilience.\u201d Ecosystem-based Adaptation (to Climate Change) (EbA):", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee7ed524-10da-4143-9719-05e916ea265c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee7ed524-10da-4143-9719-05e916ea265c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Nature-Based Solutions in Serbia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efceff6e921dc7425c0a14b61a4db90e317a05e7e22ff06e662cba6a9a6068e1"}, "3": {"node_id": "49d23039-8325-424a-b943-48269e641ebb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/enhancing-nature-based-solutions-serbia", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53a79fa90b892d94ed547035b7c1e1d074b2aa36ed98fa154ba1e852458d4c7f"}}, "hash": "8f9cce237e4c546896d35c658dd37fec6e1c5d1aa31e4bf940118253364e6e38", "text": "IUCN defines EbA as the conservation, sustainable management, and restoration of ecosystems to help people adapt to the impacts of climate change.

THE KEY TERMS AND DEFINITIONS 61 Annex II: Nature-based Solutions for disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) Nature can provide solutions that are cost-effective, and can contribute to the community resilience beyond their capacity to absorb and recover from a single disaster, such as a flood or drought. At the 2016 World Conservation Congress and Members\u2019 Assembly, IUCN's Members adopted a motion (WCC-2016-Res-069) which, for the first time, defined the use of nature for simultaneous benefits to biodiversity and human well-being. According to the Resolution, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems in ways that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, to provide both human well-being and biodiversity benefits.\u201d91 While still an emerging concept, NbS have clearly demonstrated their value in providing multiple benefits to societies, e.g., in mitigating and adapting to climate change impacts, reducing disaster risks, improving community resilience and livelihoods, and safeguarding ecosystems and biodiversity. There is growing evidence on the value and importance of NbS and a steady progress with documenting, communicating and mainstreaming NbS into climate change and sustainable development policy and disaster risk management. Nature-based Solutions are considered an umbrella framework for ecosystem-based approaches that are used to address major societal challenges. NbS actions can contribute to flood prevention and protection, managing risks of natural disasters, improving forest management, ensuring food and water security, combating climate change and contributing to the global improvement of the social, economic and health conditions, by strengthening the local communities\u2019 resilience to natural disasters. NbS are a powerful mechanism for climate change mitigation due to their capacity to prevent degradation and loss of natural ecosystems, for example through sustainable forest management or improved conservation and land management actions. Moreover, natural and modified ecosystems can also effectively contribute to combating climate change thanks to their function of a \u2018natural carbon sink\u2019, i.e., absorption and insulation of CO2 emissions. 91 World Conservation Congress (2016). Resolution 069. Adopted at the World Conservation Congress, at its session in Hawaii, USA, 1-10 September 2016. 62 Nature-based solutions to disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) are a good strategy for the integrated management of land, water and biodiversity. They can provide low risk, low maintenance and low-cost solutions to many climate change related disasters and impacts. They prioritise nature conservation and sustainable land use practices that can be implemented in harmony with more traditional methods. The central role of ecosystems and biodiversity to address DRR and CCA challenges is endorsed in major risk- related agendas, including the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP21) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Specifically, SFDRR mentions ecosystems as being vulnerable to natural and human activity induced hazard impacts, and therefore need to be adequately protected.92 Various approaches can be used to apply NbS in different fields, including green infrastructure (GI) projects or ecosystem-based approaches (EbA). Measures facilitating the practical implementation of NBS through policy development and enforcement, stakeholder involvement and building the capacity of the national institutions and/or local communities are equally important.93 Nature-based Solutions can be implemented alone or in an integrated manner with other solutions to societal challenges (e.g., technological and engineering solutions).

It seeks to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risk through the mainstreaming of DRR across all development sectors, programmes and policies. While the SFDRR is a voluntary, non-binding agreement, it calls for an all-of-society engagement, with governments having the primary role of reducing disaster risk. 95 IUCN (2020).

Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. 64 Sustainable Development Goals \u2013 SDGs (2015\u20132030) and 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda With a total of 17 goals and 169 targets, the SDGs focus three main areas: (i) eradication of poverty; (ii) protecting the planet from degradation, while ensuring that economic, social and technological progress occurs in harmony with nature; and (iii) promoting universal peace and just and inclusive societies. While the SDGs are not legally binding, governments are expected to take ownership and establish national frameworks for the achievement of the 17 Goals United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) UNFCCC provides the global framework to cope with the adverse effects of climate change. The ultimate objective is to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that will prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system. UNFCC 21st CoP \u2013 Paris Agreement on Climate Change The Paris Agreement seeks to significantly scale-up climate actions and deal more comprehensively with climate change impacts to safeguard development and eliminate poverty. Countries committed to hold the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial 30 levels (and to pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5\u00b0C).

In 2019, the new Commission also published its vision for a European Green Deal, highlighting specific actions to achieve a climate-neutral EU and, as a follow-up, proposed a new climate law. The law should stipulate the 2050 climate-neutrality target and related trajectory and establish a framework for actions to enhance certainty for society. Interim targets for 2020 and 2030 should help realise the vision for a GHG emission neutral EU by 2050. In its Europe 2020 strategy, the EU committed to reducing its GHG emissions by 20% compared with 1990, improving energy efficiency by 20% and increasing the share of renewables in final energy consumption to 20%. The 2030 Climate and Energy Framework includes 2030 targets for GHG emissions, renewable energy and energy efficiency. The EU increased the ambition of the latter two targets in 2018, which are now reflected in the revised Renewable Energy Directive and the revised Energy Efficiency Directive. The targets commit the EU to cutting GHG emissions by at least 40% (from 1990 levels), achieving a minimum 32% share for renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency by at least 32.5% (compared with a projected business-as-usual scenario for 2030). In its European Green Deal, the Commission also proposed to increase the ambition of the 2030 GHG emission target to at least 50% and towards 55% compared with 1990 levels. The Energy Union further supports the shift towards a resource-efficient, low carbon economy to achieve sustainable growth through legal frameworks and related initiatives, highlighting renewables as a key element of decarbonisation. Finally, the EU cohesion policy (2014 to 2020) sets aside EUR 29 billion for sustainable energy programmes and initiatives, including for energy efficiency, renewable energy, smart energy infrastructure and low-carbon research and innovation. The new cohesion policy (2021 to 2027) includes a \u2018greener, carbon free Europe\u2019 as one of its five main objections. SEE 2020 During the COP 23 in Bonn, Germany, ministers from the Western Balkans responsible for the environment and climate change signed a Ministerial Declaration on the 2nd High-Level Panel on Environment and Climate Action in the Western Balkans, under the framework for the implementation of the South East Europe 2020 Strategy (SEE 2020) and its Environment Dimension. The ministers re-affirmed their commitment to strengthen regional cooperation, 66 joint efforts and concrete common action in addressing the existing environmental and climate challenges together with preventing and mitigating the future ones. The declaration calls for further strengthening of synergies and regional cooperation for the implementation of the environment and climate change priorities in the region, as well as for strengthened high-level policy dialogue between the Western Balkans and the EU. With respect to climate change, the accession of the Western Balkan countries to the EU remains a key driver in improving environmental legislation and policy. The South East Europe 2020 Strategy (SEE 2020) of the Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) provides a unique opportunity to mainstream and communicate the results of the project at the regional level. The SEE 2020 Pillar 3: Sustainable Growth aims to \u2018Increase adaptive capacity through awareness raising and education on climate change adaptation (knowledge and best practice transfer, experimental showcase projects and awareness rising in the fields of agriculture, forestry, water usage, energy usage for individual farmers, cooperatives, public and private companies and operators, local municipalities, community-based organisations and associations, media). DPPI SEE Another major regional programme is the Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Initiative (DPPI SEE). Launched in 2000 to assist partners prevent and deal with the impacts of natural disaster, it has since continuously provided a framework for South-East European countries to develop joint activities, programmes and projects leading to strengthened capacity in preventing and responding to natural disasters. DPPI, as an umbrella regional network for developing programmes and projects to prevent and respond to natural and human-made disasters and as such, represents one of the major regional processes on DRR and CCA.

Glossary ix Introduction: Incubating conservation PLENTY OF VALUE, NOT ENOUGH MONEY Parks, reserves, and other public and private protected and conserved areas are some of the most valuable places on the planet. Protected ecosystems help clean the water we drink and the air we breathe, maintain the soil we use to grow food, store carbon to mitigate climate change, and provide a variety of health bene\ufb01ts. They support a tourism industry worth billions of dollars and provide primary or secondary jobs and livelihoods to countless people around the world. They also serve as the home and source of life for tens of millions of species, including many threatened with local or global extinction. Despite their enormous economic, environmental, and social value, many of the world\u2019s more than 200,000 protected areas have trouble making ends meet. Management and operational costs are rising, driven by increasing public uses, growing demand for the ecosystem bene\ufb01ts provided, and mounting global challenges such as climate change and socio-political pressures. Government budget allocations are not enough to keep up; in fact, in many cases the allocation of public funds both from national and international parties is shrinking. OPPORTUNITIES AND MISSED CONNECTIONS Conservation has long been fnanced chiefy by national and international government funds, though the idea of using private sector investment and other innovative mechanisms to \ufb01nance conservation is not new. Tourism user fees and concession payments have been a source of conservation revenue for decades. However, in recent years a plethora of new tools, instruments and approaches has emerged, with signi\ufb01cant potential being observed around private participation. Creative investment vehicles such as green bonds and biodiversity enterprise funds are becoming more popular and accessible. From global \ufb01nancial \ufb01rms to individual investors, people are increasingly seeking sustainable and environmentally friendly options to put their money into, with the goal of producing social and environmental bene\ufb01ts while still generating a positive \ufb01nancial return, in what is known as impact investment. This represents an enormous opportunity to unlock essential funding for protected and conserved areas. However, too often conservationists and investors seem to be reaching towards similar goals, but failing to connect. It seems as if neither party is speaking the same language (see Figure 1). On the one side, conservation actors require fexible, low-cost fnancing and availability of funds tailored to their needs. On the other, investors require risk security and attractive returns on investment. What seems to be urgently needed in these challenging times is a forum where investors, conservation specialists, and protected and conserved area managers and advocates can come together to explore their mutual interests, needs, opportunities and bene\ufb01ts. \u2022 Unrestricted funds \u2022 Money up front \u2022 Low liability / risk \u2022 Nature for the sake of nature!", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "838d4ad7-2edd-4176-97db-266b0d7cbf9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "838d4ad7-2edd-4176-97db-266b0d7cbf9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Becoming a conservation entrepreneur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f707c4e999caade8827ebaf4cd85fd96aa9683a75f546889dbeff610d161b167"}, "2": {"node_id": "a7c9e9ce-1442-4316-8b19-a89238d43c88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be57f445850f1741d210c595af13afa4579441e54a7bca94f6352ec09b14c91a"}}, "hash": "a4900cb73e173c52bcd1ffc946e307e1ab5a580c8cf55cb433c775011fcf87ec", "text": "\u2022 Return on investment \u2022 Evidence of impact \u2022 Appropriate scale CONSERVATIONIST INVESTOR Figure 1: Conservationists and investors dialogue gap \u00a9 IUCN ELT Introduction: Incubating conservation PLENTY OF VALUE, NOT ENOUGH MONEY Parks, reserves, and other public and private protected and conserved areas are some of the most valuable places on the planet.

What seems to be urgently needed in these challenging times is a forum where investors, conservation specialists, and protected and conserved area managers and advocates can come together to explore their mutual interests, needs, opportunities and bene\ufb01ts. 1 THE BIRTH OF AN INCUBATOR In 2016, the IUCN Environmental Law Team (ELT) put together an initiative to strengthen private funding for conservation. The ELT took on this challenge since \ufb01nancial issues create substantial obstacles to effective governance and implementation of environmental law. As a programme with decades of experience in protected area policy and governance, the ELT realised that legal and institutional circumstances create special challenges and opportunities for conservation \ufb01nance projects that support area-based conservation. Drawing on examples from the tech and startup sectors, ELT developed the idea of an incubator to identify and nurture ideas coming from protected and conservation area managers and stakeholders who lack the knowledge, resources, or professional contacts to make them a reality. The IUCN Incubator for Nature Conservation (INC) was funded by the Aage V. Jensen Foundation, a long-time partner of IUCN, with an expressed interest in advancing a potentially risky idea. Recognising that protected and conserved area \ufb01nancial questions go beyond law and governance, the ELT teamed up with two other IUCN Programmes: the Global Protected Areas Programme and the Business and Biodiversity Programme.

Figure 2: The methodology of the Incubator for Nature Conservation The ultimate goal of the INC process is to enable the incubator sites to meet the standards of the IUCN Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas. The Green List provides certi\ufb01cation to national parks, public and private nature reserves, community conserved areas, and other protected and conserved areas that demonstrate successful conservation results through effective management and good governance. The Green List has become a recognised global standard (see Box 1).

The areas which can demonstrate this receive certi\ufb01cation for a period of \ufb01ve years, which can be renewed. This certi\ufb01cation promotes compliance with local, national, regional and global conservation goals; in turn granting sites greater visibility and recognition. In addition to incentivising management staff and members of the conservation community, it also seeks to motivate other actors representing different sectors who are interested in investing in protected sites with guaranteed compliance with their conservation objectives. One of the current challenges for protected and conserved areas is long-term \ufb01nancial sustainability, as well as the management of threats that could put the area and its conservation values at risk. The Green List promotes collaboration and investment in effective and equitable implementation in protected and conserved areas committed to operate in accordance with the IUCN Standard. It provides a set of indicators that can demonstrate impacts to investors who search for fnancial returns and measurable contributions to long-term conservation. 3 The Green List, together with INC, is attractive for donors, since together they ensure that PAs have been independently evaluated through a transparent and objective process. They have been able to demonstrate, prior to global certi\ufb01cation, that through good governance, design and planning, adequate management effectiveness, articulated with an ef\ufb01cient use of \ufb01nancial resources, they achieve biodiversity conservation in the medium and long term. Currently, several INC sites are Green List sites or candidates, including Tatam\u00e1 National Natural Park, National Park of the Esp\u00edritu Santo Archipelago and Cordillera Azul National Park. In all three experiences, INC has supported the strengthening of their \ufb01nancial strategies, improving their management for them to maintain their Green List certi\ufb01cation.

The INC team also recognises that this guide mostly refects the Latin American context because it is based on the team\u2019s experience on the ground. Other opportunities or contexts in different regions may not be fully refected in this guide, but we do hope that these lessons are useful for a global audience. This guide is principally intended for practitioners, including government of\ufb01cials, civil society organisations, indigenous and local community members and private landowners with an interest in developing sustainable \ufb01nancing projects for protected and conserved areas. It is aimed at all types and categories of protected and conserved areas, with examples from private land trusts, community conservation areas, and national, provincial, and state parks and reserves, including both terrestrial and marine areas. The draft feasibility studies, \ufb01nance strategies, business plans, contracts and other resources developed for the partner sites are available on the IUCN website. INC fully recognises that there is no silver bullet for \ufb01nancing protected and conserved areas. A wide range of \ufb01nancing options are available to practitioners, and new ideas are being tested all the time. The aim of this document is to present the hands-on experience gained in trying to explore alternative \ufb01nancing and to share the lessons that came out of it with those that are willing to take this challenge. The hope of the INC team is that readers will discover ideas that can help their unique situations, and perhaps stimulate more innovative strategies that will open other \ufb01nancial opportunities not yet tested. Future editions of this document will hopefully build from these initial lessons learned and embrace new cutting-edge innovative ideas.

These areas can choose to undergo proft-generating activities based on their resources, which can help their administration derive higher funds that enhance management. With these activities, areas can generate part of their own fnancial base and, furthermore, attract private capital for investment. It is thus relevant to understand the basic general way in which businesses are conceived, developed, and implemented, how they can attract sources of fnancing, and in which ways incubators can help them reach their goals. A business idea is turned into a business model through the assessment of possible goods and services that have a certain demand. A business model is a general view of what a business venture might look like. It considers the ways and channels in which a service or a good will be offered to customers and the type of customers targeted (their location, age, gender, education, socioeconomic level, and cultural preferences amongst other). Once a business idea has been devised, it is further analysed through the development of a business model and related business cases. A business plan is then the basic document portraying the mission and short-, medium- and long-term goals of a business. This document is key for attracting investors. Although business planning can take different forms, there are general guidelines that most ventures follow. The main subjects that a business plan must follow are: \u2022 Executive summary \u2022 Description of products and services to be offered in the market. \u2022 Market analysis of possible demand, customers, and direct competitors, as well as size of the industry \u2022 Marketing strategy on how to communicate with potential customers and attract them into using/acquiring the product or service in question. \u2022 Financial planning with revenue objectives in the short, medium, and long term. The fnancial plan can help attract investors through the future predictions of the frm's fnancial situation. While ongoing businesses will include fnancial statements, balance sheets and other fnancial information, new businesses should present their targets and estimates for the frst years of operation. \u2022 Budget including the calculation of all costs. It is recommended that a business reviews its plan yearly and adjusts it to its current situation and the situation of the market.

Business plans are thus dynamic documents. As dynamic documents, business plans can also be adjusted when undertaking the development of business cases. Although both business plans and cases require a thorough feasibility analysis, business cases are much more specifc. They consider specifc activities under a business plan that can be developed in different ways. In this way, business cases are comparable to scenario analyses. When, for example, searching for a way to fnance a business model, the business plan might consider several options, and with the help of business cases, the analysis of these options results in an overview for the selection of those which are more effective and effcient. Business cases can be developed for activities such as marketing strategies, product development and sales channels amongst others. An incubator is a non-proft or for-proft organisation that supports startups in their early stages. Incubators can offer technical support, mentoring, working space, networking and contact with business partners, fnanciers, and research institutions, and in some cases even capital in form of small loans. Incubators accompany startups until they are stable enough to drive their business on their own. This can take from a couple of months to years, depending on each startup case. In the case of INC, the different projects incubated asked for different activities and fnancing instruments. 6 Table 1: Projects incubated by INC, solutions applied, activities implemented, and \ufb01nancing instruments and mechanisms proposed or implemented COUNTRY SITE INC SOLUTION INC ACTIVITIES FINANCING INSTRUMENTS AND MECHANISMS Brazil Cavernas do Perua\u00e7u Community-based tourism services and activities.

If certain pre-conditions are not met, the design and implementation of a business venture or of sustainable \ufb01nancing mechanisms may take longer than expected and require more resources. Some pre-conditions are essential for developing successful projects that can meet their economic, social, and environmental goals in the long term, while others are ideal conditions that can make implementation much easier. ESSENTIAL PRE-CONDITIONS 1 Management plan Management plans describe activities, needs and goals protected and conserved area managers are working to achieve, and act as frameworks for decision-making over a speci\ufb01c period of time. They provide practical information about the context, values, objectives, threats, governance structure and key stakeholders. According to the IUCN Green List Standard, each site should have a management plan or equivalent document that provides appropriate strategies and actions to achieve the goals of the area. Without a clear and up-to-date management plan, identifying \ufb01nancial needs and gaps becomes problematic, and it will be very dif\ufb01cult to convince any potential \ufb01nancier to invest in an area. More information about management plans can be found in the IUCN Protected Areas Guidelines. 2 Site \ufb01nancial plan Protected and conserved sites should have a comprehensive overview of a site\u2019s current \ufb01nancial state, projections of future income, long term \ufb01nancial goals and needs and steps needed to achieve the goals. Financial plans should be linked to speci\ufb01c programmes and activities, coherent with the management plan. Knowing and understanding the \ufb01nancial needs for implementing speci\ufb01c management programmes and attaining particular goals will enable managers to: \u2022 Determine \ufb01nancial gaps; \u2022 Prioritise and allocate funds; \u2022 Identify business drivers; \u2022 Design creative solutions; \u2022 Consider partnerships that can provide in-kind help; and \u2022 Provide evidence of results to potential investors. Figure 4: Understanding the relationship between \ufb01nancial, business and management plans MANAGEMENT PLAN BUSINESS PLAN FINANCIAL PLAN \u00a9 IUCN ELT 3 Enabling environment An important priority of fnanciers when looking for investing options is the minimisation of risk. To minimise the risks of not meeting project goals, it is important to consider political will, legal frameworks, and institutional capacities in relation to the site and the proposed project. Legal and institutional frameworks are further discussed in Step 2. A solid understanding of the enabling environment can be achieved by consulting all actors or institutions involved in the management of a protected or conserved area, as well as key stakeholders. Political stability is essential to ensure that long-term goals can be implemented and strategic activities such as control and surveillance are not constrained. National policies are key for creating the right enabling environments but local politics may ultimately 9 determine the success or failure of new processes and projects. Furthermore, it is important to recognise the local capacities for delivering successful projects. A strong organisation amongst the actors undertaking a business project is essential. Strong organisations help ensure the resilience of businesses and thus, the reduction of risk. Good relationships and communication between key actors and stakeholders Many different types of stakeholders can be involved in protected and conserved area management and use. Important stakeholders can include \u2022 Protected area managers and staff; Communities and landowners in or around the area, particularly any affected indigenous and traditional residents; \u2022 Users of natural resources from the area; \u2022 Bene\ufb01ciaries of ecosystem services provided by the area; \u2022 Scientists and researchers who carry out \ufb01eld work within the area; \u2022 Visitors to the area, including foreign and local tourists; \u2022 Conservation organisations or other Non- Government Organisations (NGOs) concerned with the area; \u2022 Local businesses and private sector organisations whose activities impact the area or who may have an interest in supporting conservation of the area through new or existing business ventures; \u2022 Local and national government of\ufb01cials with mandates related to the area or surrounding communities. Coordinated collaboration with key local, regional and national stakeholders is essential, no meaningful stakeholder should be left out of this process.

Many conservation practitioners have been habituated to depend on government funds, donations and international cooperation. There is a strong sense that protected areas are a public resource and should be publicly funded. However, in this reality where public funds are insuf\ufb01cient, understanding that protected and conserved areas can and should work to generate their own incomes is essential to enabling implementation of \ufb01nancial mechanisms to unlock other sources of funding. Changing mindsets requires time and creates signi\ufb01cant challenges, but is essential in order to create a critical mass of well-informed and engaged protected area managers and other conservation practitioners prepared to apply 21st century principles to conservation ideals. Key lesson: Shifting mindsets IDEAL PRE-CONDITIONS Management effectiveness assessment If protected area staff have assessed their management effectiveness, it is very likely that they have a better understanding of their problems and needs. Protected area management effectiveness (PAME) assessment tools can provide evidence that protected areas have been managed well, and in a transparent, participatory manner (see a list of PAME methodologies and example of reports on the Protected Planet website). Additionally, they allow for better allocation of funds according to speci\ufb01c needs, and can provide investors with monitoring mechanisms, as they enable regular accounting of where the money goes. 1 2 Site business plan Site-level business plans can help identify goals for the site and strategies for achieving them. Financial plans can be a component of business plans, but while site \ufb01nancial plans are essential for identifying assets and needs, site business plans can be helpful though not necessary for initiating a conservation \ufb01nance project. Site business plans should not be confused with project business plans for speci\ufb01c conservation \ufb01nance ventures. Both types of business plans are discussed in Step 8. 10 3 Deep understanding of local, national, regional and international contexts Better understanding of the broader social, economic, political and conservation context will facilitate the design and implementation of appropriate and tailored \ufb01nancial strategies. Knowledge of other projects and activities in the region can create opportunities for connections and complementarity. Robust networks can help establish partnerships and identify additional interest and potential from different projects, donors and funding sources, improving the viability of a speci\ufb01c project. 4 Participation in the IUCN Green List The Green List of Protected and Conserved Areas is a globally recognised certi\ufb01cation programme for management effectiveness. Sites that apply for certi\ufb01cation undertake a process of evaluation and review against the Green List Standard, which provides them with information on current performance and how to improve. This process can help sites identify \ufb01nancial needs and opportunities. It also provides a baseline and indicators, which can allow site managers and potential investors to measure impact. A Green List site is also aiming to achieve good governance and equity, which is critical for fair access to protected areas \ufb01nancing.

LAND TENURE AND RESOURCE OWNERSHIP Conservation \ufb01nance options depend on clear de\ufb01nition of ownership and use rights in relation to land and other natural resources.

In Colombia, indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities own nearly 4.4 million hectares, which are subject to special conditions and requirements in relation to land tenure and agreements. Where a conservation \ufb01nance project takes place on indigenous peoples\u2019 lands, the right to free, prior and informed consent needs to be respected. Some revenue-generating projects implicate new types of property rights, such as those based on carbon bonds and genetic resources. Projects involving these resources depend on legal de\ufb01nition of who owns the resources and who has the right to bene\ufb01t from them. For example, in some countries, genetic resources are owned by whoever owns the land on which they are found, whether that is a public or private owner. In others, they are owned by the public, represented by a specifc government entity. Rights to bene\ufb01t from climate \ufb01nancing can similarly be de\ufb01ned by the government. In 2018, Peru passed a climate change framework law providing for development of guidance for public and private organisations to receive and administer funding for climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, and began a process of harmonising Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) projects implemented under a voluntary standard with national accounting reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). During the 2008-2018 period, more than 25 million tonnes of CO2 emissions were avoided through a REDD project implemented in Cordillera Azul National Park. The project will be harmonised with the national inventory in a way that avoids double counting of bonds sold abroad. Step 2: Evaluate the legal and institutional frameworks CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN BUSINESS To participate in revenue-generating activities the manager or owner of the protected or conserved area needs to have the ability to enter into contracts, receive funds, and make deals related to natural resources. This may not be a problem for private protected and conserved areas, but public protected area managers may face restrictions. For example, in Brazil protected area managers are not allowed to spend or handle money except under strictly de\ufb01ned circumstances. The law can explicitly allow management authorities to use various funding tools, such as setting entrance fees, selling promotional materials, issuing concessions, licensing or setting fees for eco-tourism activities, and receiving donations. In Greece, the Law on Management Bodies of Protected Areas (NOMO\u03a3 \u03a5\u03a0\u2019 \u0391\u03a1\u0399\u0398\u039c. 4519 \u03a6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c7\u03ce\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2) ensures the annual public funding of Management Bodies. Furthermore, as the Ministry of Environment has embarked on an evaluation of the Management Bodies in Greece, it is preparing structural changes and is discussing the possibility of a) including mandatory Financial (Business) Plans to accompany the Management Plans that are currently being drafted and b) allowing each Management Body to develop its own business activities (see Box 4). 13 In many systems, fees collected at the site level go to a central management entity, to be later distributed among the sites in the country, or added to the general national budget. This creates disincentives for managers to set and collect fees at an adequate level to promote conservation, and severely limits their capacity to achieve \ufb01nancial sustainability. In many cases, conservation \ufb01nance projects involve third parties who take on \ufb01nancing or management responsibilities for the protected area. Here, national frameworks dictate the extent to which protected area managers can delegate authority to these third parties through management contracts. For example, in Brazil, in Cavernas do Perua\u00e7u, Ekos Institute entered into a contract with ICMBio to take on fundraising responsibilities, but does not have the capacity to issue licenses or concessions (see Box 9).

Working with local consultants, the INC team prepared a proposal for an amendment of existing legislation and met with the Ministry of Environment, introducing clearer clauses regarding private funding and an integrated business plan for the protected areas. The amendment would not only drive Managers to seek alternative funding opportunities but also send out the right signal to potential investors. Strengthening the enabling environment would also contribute to creating a critical number of Management Bodies that would take this issue on board and help change the mindsets of conservationists unaccustomed to treating a protected area as a business. The Ministry of Environment is currently working on the proposed amendment. Box 4 Case study: Lake Pamvotis, Greece Identifying gaps to improve legal frameworks CONCESSIONS AND LICENSING Concessions and licences for tourism, \ufb01shing and other resource uses are governed by national legal frameworks that vary by country. These laws and regulations determine licensing processes and fees as well as who can issue licences and what conditions are imposed. Exclusive concessions can be used to promote co-management arrangements that can generate revenue for local users and conserved sites. Concession arrangements do not have to be monetary\u2014they can be used to obtain in-kind contributions of necessary services. For example, in Cavernas do Perua\u00e7u, in Brazil, local guides are given concessions to bring tourists into the Park in exchange for an agreement to work on maintaining trails and \ufb01ghting forest \ufb01res, beneftting the park. 14 OFFSETTING, COMPENSATION AND CARBON CREDITS Some countries have policies or laws related to offsetting and/or compensation for harm to the natural environment. Offsetting and environmental harm compensation can be powerful tools for \ufb01nancing conservation. In Colombia, by law every project that includes the use of water taken directly from natural sources and subject to an environmental licence must allocate 1% of the total investment for the recovery, conservation, preservation and monitoring of the river basin that feeds the respective water source, including those in protected and conserved areas. In Brazil, judicially imposed penalties for environmental wrongdoing can be used to fund conservation. A familiar form of offsetting is trade in carbon bonds. Frameworks for carbon trade can include requirements for offsetting emissions, and stipulations regarding location and type of carbon offset projects. The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, an emission mitigation approach for the global airline industry, provides new offsetting opportunities. In Guatemala, INC partners are exploring the development of a national strategy that would require international travel to and from Guatemala to be compensated at least in part through bonds generated in the country. Legal frameworks can also provide guidance on monitoring and evaluation of carbon projects. The Peruvian Climate Change Law (Ley No. 30754, Ley Marco sobre Cambio Clim\u00e1tico) provides a framework for reporting to the Ministry of the Environment by administrators of carbon \ufb01nancing. While offsetting may offer an opportunity to \ufb01nance protected areas, these schemes are not always appropriate conservation tools. According to the IUCN Policy on Biodiversity Offsets adopted in Resolution WCC-2016-RES-059-EN: IUCN Resolution WCCC-2016-RES-059-EN on Biodiversity Offsets \u201cUnder the speci\ufb01c conditions outlined in this policy, it is IUCN\u2019s position that biodiversity offsets can contribute to positive conservation outcomes. However, biodiversity offsets are only appropriate for projects which have rigorously applied the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimise, restore/rehabilitate and offset) and when a full set of alternatives to the project have been considered. \u2022 Offsets must only occur after all previous steps in the mitigation hierarchy have been considered and no alternatives are available. Avoidance is the \ufb01rst and most important step in the mitigation hierarchy. Biodiversity offsets must never be used to circumvent responsibilities to avoid and minimise damage to biodiversity, or to justify projects that would otherwise not happen. \u2022 The mitigation hierarchy must be applied at the landscape or seascape level with mitigation actions designed and implemented at a site or project level. Governments should ensure the mitigation hierarchy is embedded in the framework of landscape and seascape level planning and legislation and is part of existing and future strategic development plans. \u2022 Only after applying the earlier steps in the mitigation hierarchy should biodiversity offsets be employed to address the residual impact in order to achieve at least No Net Loss and preferably a Net Gain at the project level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5acdd8cd-70e8-42bf-9bc8-ecad7db8fc2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "5acdd8cd-70e8-42bf-9bc8-ecad7db8fc2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Becoming a conservation entrepreneur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57e94e6dfb6772e1d5f6e1bb32b67748a3309d35c3b691328418be851b08734a"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2453360-01ed-4fc4-b2ef-23228e9984dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca6962f79677990778ce9fb043665293f82b6b86cb265cfa80b17b4b3cf96033"}}, "hash": "f18c27a954d47655fe0a44d780c48a3a933fac0d65bc2853229cbac0fea420eb", "text": "The terms No Net Loss or Net Gain refer to the outcome achieved compared to a reference scenario.

Societal values should also be accounted for and used to inform the design and implementation of biodiversity offsets. \u2022 In certain circumstances, residual impacts on biodiversity (after completing the avoidance, minimisation and rehabilitation steps of the mitigation hierarchy) cannot be offset. Additionally, there are some components of biodiversity for which impacts could theoretically be offset, but with a high risk of failure. Under these circumstances, biodiversity offsets are not appropriate, and this means the project as designed should not proceed.\u201d 15 PAYMENTS FOR ECOSYSTEM SERVICES Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects can be based on general contract law and licensing frameworks, but in some cases countries have a speci\ufb01c law or policy on PES. Such a law can de\ufb01ne recognised types of PES, create special institutions or national funds for managing PES, set guidelines for valuing ecosystem services, or require PES for certain industries. For example, in Peru the Law on Compensation for Environmental Services (Ley No. 30215, Ley de mecanismos de retribuci\u00f3n por servicios ecosist\u00e9micos) identi\ufb01es the actions that can qualify under PES and the elements that payment mechanisms need to have. The Law creates a registry for PES and also designates roles to the Ministry of the Environment and regional and local governments to facilitate and promote PES mechanisms. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY AND RESOURCES Conservation \ufb01nance initiatives can involve signi\ufb01cant administrative costs. Institutional capacity, including human capacity and \ufb01nancial resources, must be taken into account in determining whether projects will be viable. While the goal of protected area \ufb01nance projects is typically to increase the resources available to management institutions that can translate into the achievement of conservation goals, insuf\ufb01cient capacity may prevent projects from getting off the ground. TRANSPARENCY, ACCOUNTABILITY AND PARTICIPATION Transparency and accountability are fundamental requirements of good governance. They are even more relevant where management authorities are allowed to engage in business operations in public lands. Frameworks relating to access to public information, transparency and accountability of public authorities for the management of public funds may exist to ensure that limited resources are managed properly. In Colombia, the Of\ufb01ce of the General Comptroller of the Republic is in charge of overseeing and controlling the use of public funds and scrutinising contracts. Legal frameworks can also support or require transparency and opportunities for participation of the public or speci\ufb01c stakeholders. The Climate Change Law of Peru (Ley No. 30754, Ley Marco sobre Cambio Clim\u00e1tico) safeguards the right of indigenous peoples to participate in climate investment projects that affect them, and prioritises \ufb01nancial resources destined for vulnerable populations, including indigenous peoples and women. Where communities are involved in producing or processing goods or resources, transparent selection processes that provide equal participation opportunities can help avoid disputes and ensure fair distribution of resources and opportunities. COMMITMENT AND POLITICAL WILL Even when all legal and institutional frameworks are in place, nothing can happen if there is a lack of commitment and political will. Political changes and institutional turnover during the life of the project can seriously affect the availability and effectiveness of \ufb01nance mechanisms. Strong and lasting commitment at site, regional and national levels is necessary to ensure that conservation \ufb01nance projects can adapt to changing circumstances and be successful. Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) projects can be based on general contract law and licensing frameworks, but in some cases countries have a speci\ufb01c law or policy on PES.

Strong and lasting commitment at site, regional and national levels is necessary to \u00a9 Lake Pamvotis Management Body 16 Despite their environmental value some protected and conserved areas face important fnancial gaps. Financial gaps are defned as the lacking fnancial needs, both monetary and in-kind, that ensure the undertaking of specifc activities within projects. It is the difference between the funds a site has and the funds it requires. It is thus important to determine a site\u2019s \ufb01nancial needs and how to meet them. Otherwise, the management effectiveness to achieve conservation goals might be affected. Identifying \ufb01nancial gaps is a key \ufb01rst step to developing a strategy for sustainable \ufb01nancing. To avoid an unrealistic \u201cwish list\u201d, \ufb01nancial needs should be correlated to conservation objectives and planned activities as set out in the management plan or other foundational planning document of the protected or conserved area (see Step 1). Ideally, the activities generating \ufb01nancial gaps should be grounded on indicators of management effectiveness as used in the management effectiveness assessment and/or related to the Green List standard. This provides a basis for getting support from different stakeholders and fnancing sources. Step 3: Identify financial gaps 1 Develop a strategic component Under the management plan or other planning document, de\ufb01ne objectives and activities in the short, medium and long term to achieve conservation goals. 2 3 De\ufb01ne costs Identify the \ufb01nancial requirements for each activity in the strategic com-ponent. For example, how much does \ufb01re management cost? Include costs of personnel (\ufb01re\ufb01ghting staff), equipment (buckets, hoses, vehicles, shovels), infrastructure (roads, stations, water points) and supplies (water, sand, fuel). The calculation of costs should also take into account the temporal frame of each activity. How long does a certain activity take and how often will it be undertaken? Establish scenarios Consider basic or optimum scenarios according to the conservation goals to be achieved. A basic scenario includes the minimum resources possible to achieve the overall conservation goal of the site. 18 4 Map available resources Consolidate all existing sources of funding for the protected or conserved area. Consider public and private funding sources, as well as contributions from communities. This can include in-kind support, as decreasing costs also contribute to protected area \ufb01nancial sustainability. 5 Calculate the gap Determine the difference between available resources and necessary resources for each scenario. This process can be facilitated by including \ufb01nancial planning in the general planning processes of protected and conserved areas. Identifying \ufb01nancial gaps helps site managers include prioritised actions to close these gaps in management plans at the outset. In many protected areas, only the personnel and basic operating costs are covered by the government, meeting at most the needs of the basic scenario. To achieve the optimum scenario, it is necessary to develop ways in which fnancing instruments can be adapted, mixed, and implemented. This may include only personnel and essential day-to-day operating costs needed to maintain conservation values. Under an optimum scenario, additional resources may be available for activities, improvements and investments in the site that achieve a higher standard of conservation, bene\ufb01t local communities, and lower costs in the long term. Calculate the \ufb01nancial costs and conservation bene\ufb01ts of each scenario.

Case Study: Tatam\u00e1 National Natural Park, Colombia Assessing the \ufb01nancial gap to meet the Green List standard standards of management. \u00a9 John E. Rojas 19 Private investment in conservation seems like a promising way to address a serious \ufb01nancial gap. However, unlike public funding, private investment is conditioned to the generation of dividends, that is, returns on the money given as an investment to a third party. Thus, securing private investment requires a revenue-generating activity, which can involve the sale of a tangible product (e.g. \ufb01sh, honey, coffee); a deal involving an intangible product (e.g. sale of carbon bonds, bene\ufb01t-sharing from genetic resources); or the provision of a service (e.g. accommodation facilities, hiking tours, energy production). In all cases, opportunities can exist within the boundaries of the site or in the surrounding area. The \ufb01rst step is coming up with a revenue generating idea, then elaborating this idea into a business model. REVENUE-GENERATING OPTIONS The initial step in identifying a workable business model is identifying assets in the area that can be used to provide revenue for conservation. Assets can include, for example, exceptional beauty, biodiversity, natural resources (e.g. water for agriculture), marketable products, or offsetting potential. Conservation practitioners should consider the value of different assets, potential markets, and whether the assets can be used sustainably to generate revenue for the site. There are a wide range of possible options. Step 4: Analyse options and develop business model CONTRIBUTION OF NATURE PRODUCT SOURCE OF INCOME CO2 emission reduction certifcates Compensation and 1% investment Water funds Payments (transfers) of the electricity sector Debt exchange REDD+ with communities REDD+ National Park and communities Ecotourism Tourism concession Tourism (operators) Preserved/ restores hectareas Environmental interpretation, guidance, training, etc. CONTRIBUTION OF NATURE PRODUCT SOURCE OF INCOME Figure 5: Example of revenue generating options for Tatam\u00e1 National Park SUPPORT TO THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PNN TATAM\u00c1 Provision and improvement of biodiversity & ecosystem services Reduction of CO2 emissions and sustainable forest uses Provision of spaces for recreation and leisure Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) 20 \u00a9 IUCN ELT Tourism fees: Sustainable tourism can provide revenue through a range of mechanisms. The most straightforward is entry fees, charged to everyone who enters the park. Fees can also be charged for activities or use of infrastructure, such as climbing, diving, parking or camping. Fees can be charged at the entrance to the area, collected by tourist operators such as hotels, cruise ships or diving operators, or assessed in airports or ports. The Greater Sossusvlei-Namib Landscape Association developed a model for adoption of bed-night fees to be collected by hotel operators, to support conservation activities in the landscape (see Box 6). Where there is concern about preserving accessibility of public protected areas, fees can be signi\ufb01cantly different for foreign and local tourists. Box 6 Stakeholder engagement was a key feature in the development of the business plan for the Greater Sossusvlei- Namib Landscape (GSNL) Incubator project in southwestern Namibia.

Case Study: Greater Sossusvlei-Namib Landscape, Namibia Funding conservation through a \u201cbed levy\u201d on tourists Licensing fees: Licences and concessions for exploitation or use of resources, such as \ufb01shing, hunting, logging, mining or other commercial activities can be used as a source of funding for conservation. These include tourist concessions, such as diving, hotel, tour or food concessions. For example, Cavernas do Perua\u00e7u is set up to bene\ufb01t from concession agreements with food sellers and tour guides (see Box 9). The Management Body of Lake Pamvotis is looking into fees from environmental licensing of businesses to ensure resources for the management and monitoring of the protected area. In implementing this option, it is essential to ensure that licences or concessions are only issued for sustainable activities that do not undermine the objectives of the site. Payments for Ecosystem Services: PES is more often seen as a government-based incentive approach to conservation. However, private schemes for PES can be arranged through user fees. Under such PES arrangements, users pay for the value they receive from ecosystem services generated by the protected or conserved area. This payment is used for conservation of the valuable ecosystem. For example, in Guatemala, Sierra de las Minas generates 100% of the water used in the region north of the Motagua river, and the region south of the Polochic River. Approximately 500,000 people, 5 small hydroelectric projects, 6,000 agricultural hectares and 72 agricultural companies use this water. Downstream users have indicated a willingness to support conservation of these resources. 21 \u00a9 Greater Sossusvlei-Namib Landscape Association Sale of carbon credits/REDD+: In sites with high carbon sequestration potential and adequate legal frameworks, sale of carbon bonds can generate signi\ufb01cant funding for conservation. In Cordillera Az\u00fal, Peru, Althelia Climate Fund, now Althelia-Mirova, invested over 8 million USD to \ufb01nance activities that avoided deforestation inside the national park, resulting in the generation and certi\ufb01cation of carbon bonds which, when sold, provided a \ufb01nancial return for Althelia-Mirova and the necessary resources for Cordillera Az\u00fal to cover its operating expenses for several years, thus ensuring its conservation and protection. Tatam\u00e1 National Natural Park is working with Afro-Colombian communities to establish a REDD+ project in areas covered by a co-management agreement, the revenues of which will be used to strengthen management effectiveness Offsets, compensation and penalties: Where private activities cause damage to the environment, companies can be required to offset this damage through investment in offsets or compensation. This can take the form of biodiversity offsetting requirements that apply to industries from the outset, or penalties imposed on corporations or individuals for violations, such as illegal hunting or exceeding emissions restrictions. In both cases, the amount of compensation or offset should be equivalent to or greater than the amount required to rectify or replace the damage caused, and should be earmarked for conservation purposes. Cavernas do Perua\u00e7u National Park in Brazil was established with funding from Fiat, through a judicial settlement agreement arising from irregularities in vehicles produced and sold by the company. Sale of sustainable products: Products sustainably sourced or produced within or around a site, such as coffee, honey or \ufb01sh, can be sold locally or at a national or international level to support protected and conserved areas. Directing revenue from these products to conservation can involve a specially created mark or brand that adds a price premium, or support from protected area managers or conservationists in developing, selling or certifying the products. For example, in Sinal do Vale, Brazil, conservationists have developed products from jackfruit and other \u201cfruits of the forest\u201d, which they process and sell under the brand \u201cFrutas da Floresta\u201d as part of a landscape regeneration initiative (see Box 10).

A site may have signi\ufb01cant beauty that would be attractive to tourists, but lack accessibility and infrastructure. To be able to fnance infrastructure, a site could decide on charging entrance fees. However, if the legal framework prevents the site from \ufb01nancially bene\ufb01ting from tourism, for example because entry fees are sent to a central government budget rather than staying with the site, as is the case, for example, in Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, then tourism may not be a good option for the site, or it may require investment in infrastructure or a more complex governance structure (see Box 9). The business model should be sustainable in the long term. It is essential to consider the needs, capacities, and interests of different stakeholders in developing a business model. This includes government actors at all levels, civil society organisations, local businesses and industries, and communities living in and around the area. These groups can be important partners in developing and realising the project, or they can create obstacles. Where compatible legal measures are not in place, it may be possible for protected areas managers and other project proponents to work with policymakers to revise relevant frameworks. This can require building a case to convince the relevant agency or lawmaker of the economic potential, feasibility and ef\ufb01ciency of the proposed revision of laws and regulations (see Step 5). It is also important to consider the cost of the process of developing and realising the business. This includes not only the necessary initial investment, but also the time and resources needed to elaborate a business plan and undertake necessary studies and consultations. In some cases, undertaking the steps detailed here can take several years. Furthermore, the business model should contemplate the possible organisational shapes it can take based on legal frameworks. Building private-public partnerships, private small and medium companies or partnering with an external enterprise can allow conserved and protected areas to incur lower costs and unlock different sources of funding (see Step 6). Box 7 Esp\u00edritu Santo National Park is a complex of islands, one of the 182 Mexican protected areas administered by the National Commission of Natural Protected Areas (CONANP). Esp\u00edritu Santo\u2019s abundant marine biodiversity is potentially threatened by \ufb01shing and tourism activities. Fisheries provide an important source of income to local populations in the areas adjacent to Esp\u00edritu Santo in La Paz bay, and throughout the Gulf of California. Nevertheless, often confict between \ufb01shing activities and conservation of the marine environment occurs, such as encroachment on and degradation of Esp\u00edritu Santo National Park by illegal small-scale \ufb01sheries activities. At the same time, there is a growing market for sustainably caught \ufb01sh that meet international certi\ufb01cation standards; such \ufb01sh can command a premium price on the market. Community-based \ufb01sheries governance models can be used to ensure sustainability while improving livelihoods and serving the needs of local communities. Such sustainable \ufb01sheries projects can provide a return to investors as well as a conservation dividend to support operation of the protected area. INC worked with CONANP, the Mexican Fund for the Conservation of Nature (FMCN) to develop a funding mechanism around sustainable community-based \ufb01sheries in Esp\u00edritu Santo. The mechanism centers on an impact investment vehicle for sustainable \ufb01sheries which will raise funds from impact investors and generate dividends from its investments in the innovative sustainable \ufb01sheries businesses that are fourishing in and around La Paz bay. Part of the dividends will go to the impact investors, and part will go as a conservation dividend to Esp\u00edritu Santo National Park to add to the existing Esp\u00edritu Santo Endowment Fund (ESEF).

The feasibility study explores multiple aspects of a business idea to determine if it is practical, viable and suitable for a speci\ufb01c context. It provides important information to build a strong business case, that can convince investors to support a project that has been identi\ufb01ed as economically viable and functional. Both the feasibility study and the business case support the construction of a business plan and \ufb01nancial plan. CONDUCTING A FEASIBILITY STUDY The feasibility study can be conducted for more than one business idea or project as a means to prioritise those that should be carried forward. It requires a considerable amount of resources (literature review, additional studies, time, etc.), as it intends to answer all possible questions and evaluate multiple aspects of a business venture in order to make an informed decision on which business idea to develop. Thus, it is recommended to start with a preliminary feasibility study that can rapidly evaluate fundamental aspects of the project using a multicriteria approach, especially when considering a long list of possibilities. If applied with multiple stakeholders, it provides participation opportunities as well as an ef\ufb01cient way to consolidate large amounts of information and knowledge based on relevant experiences brought by all participants (see Box 8) Step 5: Undertake a feasibility study and develop a business case A preliminary feasibility study can assess: \u2022 Whether the legal, technical, administrative and institutional conditions are in place to enable the project\u2019s implementation; \u2022 Potential to generate income to contribute to closing the identi\ufb01ed \ufb01nancial gap; \u2022 Direct or indirect impacts on conservation values; \u2022 Whether social and political contexts limit or favor the project\u2019s implementation; and \u2022 Needs, strengths and challenges that will guide the implementation of a project. Following the preliminary study, a detailed and in-depth feasibility study can focus on a few pre-prioritised ideas or projects. It should include a brief description of the site\u2019s assets and economic potential, the product or service that will be marketed, the stakeholders involved, and the business operation scheme. It should include a market analysis and describe the technical, institutional, legal and \ufb01nancial resources needed for implementation (Figure 8). If considering more than one business idea, it is important to conclude with an analysis that can facilitate the selection of the best and most suitable ideas considering current needs and contextt (see Box 5 and Box 8). This analysis should consider the following aspects: \u2022 Financial resources necessary to design and begin implementation of the project/idea (availability, \ufb01nancial capacity); \u2022 Potential amount of revenue generated and its capacity to close the \ufb01nancial gap; \u2022 Time needed until the area can start receiving funds (quick wins vs. long-term returns); \u2022 Legal constraints; \u2022 Market viability; \u2022 Dif\ufb01culty of implementation and potential challenges; \u2022 Investment risks; and \u2022 General challenges and possible solutions. 25 Ease of implementation Time period for starting activities GOOD BAD < 6 MONTHS < 5 YEARS RELEVANT ASPECT DESCRIPTION Tool de\ufb01nition Specialised and sustainable tourist modality, consisting of activities of contemplation of nature, which can generate social and economic opportunities for local populations Good or service Tourism services geared towards the enjoyment of nature Financial source - Park entrance fees - Resources originating from touristic concessions Administration vehicle FONAM (Can be complemented with an additional fduciary commission type strategy) Business Consideration for the provision of tourism and nature contemplation services Role of the PNN Tatam\u00e1 implementer Develop a strategy that allows the receiving of resources resulting from the ecotourism activity Clients National and foreign citizens, investigators (ecologists, biologists), environmentalists, tourism agencies/promoters (Awake, Aviatur), USAID, European Union, etc. Approximate structuring cost USD 500,000 for a 5-year strategy Approximate collection potential Approximately USD 700,000 for a 5-year period INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS ECOTOURISM CONSOLIDATION OF SCIENTIFIC TOURISM AND BIRD WATCHING IN TATAM\u00c1 PARK Figure 6: Example of the conclusions of a feasibility study in Tatam\u00e1 National Park IDEA BUSINESS CASE The feasibility study can inform development of a business case for one or more prioritised ideas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7623e5af-fc5f-4ce0-9a93-acc0b19c4e0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7623e5af-fc5f-4ce0-9a93-acc0b19c4e0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Becoming a conservation entrepreneur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2804abbb6fb24989b71194d3ee79ed8c458a1e1167cd46cfbd4939457abe8855"}, "2": {"node_id": "b10ab43a-04c1-4a6e-bcce-74728f3e8f69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a0ae3d4da05df1431a2d36a086d82910d211ab47244b5d8eb558b0bbd49397a"}}, "hash": "e283437a3fc8ef57c028a2ccd9255a0c1d4e8e7caf48f1dfe4e923f5d224ece4", "text": "The business case is the narrative about the importance and suitability of the particular business venture, its bene\ufb01ts to nature conservation and the \ufb01nancial or reputational gains for the investor.

Sierra del Lacand\u00f3n protects archeological sites with the remains of pre-Columbian Maya civilisation, including the ruined city of Piedras Negras. INC worked with these sites to conduct a feasibility study of potential business ideas in two phases. The \ufb01rst phase was a preliminary analysis for which the INC team designed and applied a speci\ufb01c methodology and a set of criteria that helped assess each business idea ef\ufb01ciently, during a workshop where strategic and key stakeholders of each partner site analysed compliance to ten speci\ufb01c criteria based on their knowledge and expertise. This resulted in three prioritised business projects for each partner site. During the second phase, a thorough, in-depth assessment of the practicality of each business idea was carried out and delivered to the protected area managers, local partners and strategic stakeholders, including relevant governmental agencies. Because the required information was not always available or accessible, fostering close relationships with local partners and protected area managers was essential for completing this phase. Ultimately, INC will continue to support the development and implementation of an ecotourism strategy for Sierra de las Minas Biosphere Reserve, and Wildlife Refuge Bocas del Polochic; and a commercialisation strategy for carbon bonds in Sierra del Lacand\u00f3n National Park, based on the results of the feasibility study.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54a8ffa5-e66e-44d4-8c40-0c4315046d0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "54a8ffa5-e66e-44d4-8c40-0c4315046d0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Becoming a conservation entrepreneur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4038c8310b66256abe3f95beb34c2dede93c2aef32f0687b0f4633d9f926c94c"}, "2": {"node_id": "94b35c3b-51f2-4585-8ea0-8d7d283f6e9a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6c6b6d68beb8a569b74aade7ea4beeefca6f24a5eaed44553217e355f26de58"}}, "hash": "733ae3fb862a03ee12c0503258e5bfa19411a41dc4dc4541409079601d37aac5", "text": "\u00a9 Sierra de Las Minas Management Authority 28 Step 6: Define an operational framework A clear project structure and sound contractual framework, as the basis in which contracts are developed, constitute a basic precondition to investment.

The most appropriate governance structure will depend on the national legal and governance framework (see Step 2), the intended \ufb01nancial structure (see Step 9), and the legal status of the parties involved. De\ufb01ning an operational structure requires specialised expertise. If a private entity is setting up a business enterprise to generate income for conservation, a corporate lawyer should be consulted on questions such as legal personality, incorporation formalities, capital requirements, directors\u2019 duties of care, shareholding, distributions and taxation. In the case of a national park run by a government authority, governance questions often extend to the possibility of cooperating with private enterprises and NGOs to circumvent bureaucratic requirements and budgetary limitations. In many countries, revenue generated from entry fees and other activities within a public protected area does not go directly into the budget for managing that area, but is centralised as part of a national budget, and protected area managers are restricted in their ability to handle cash. Cooperation with third parties can provide ways to accommodate these restrictions, but they need to be carefully designed. For example, in Cavernas do Perua\u00e7u, in Brazil, the existing public-private partnership based on a cooperation agreement between a private charity and a government entity cannot operate ef\ufb01ciently because the government organisation running the park is not legally allowed to handle cash, while its private counterpart does not have the sovereignty to charge entry fees or grant concessions. Such deadlocks are common, and can be solved through more detailed arrangements (see Box 9). 29 Box 9 Central Brazil\u2019s Cavernas Do Perua\u00e7u National Park protects one of the most impressive speleological sites in the region, where karstic caves of astonishing size contain painted scenes dating back 10,000 years. The INC has been working with ICMBio, a governmental organisation, in cooperation with EKOS, a private charity, to help move away from the park\u2019s current dependence on government funding by capturing tourism revenue. The law discourages such initiatives by providing that any money generated by ICMBio must fow straight to central government. Additionally, ICMBio employees are not allowed to handle cash. The team tried to build a framework for implementing the public-private partnership between EKOS and ICMBio as effectively as possible by channeling money generated by the park back to the park. The park itself does not currently generate any income \u2013 concessions or entrance fees are not being charged. The basic maintenance costs of the park (fuel, of\ufb01ce costs, council meetings, building, trail and road maintenance, employment of local ICMBio staff) are covered by the State. The budget is quite restricted and does not provide for spare cash in case of unforeseen events, and varies on a yearly basis. As a state organisation, ICMBio is entitled to give out concessions to local tourism operators and to charge fees for the entrance to and the performance of activities in the park. However, ICMBio's employees are tied to strict governmental regulations and are not allowed to derive pro\ufb01ts from the park or to handle cash generated by, for instance, tourism. EKOS on the other hand, being a private sector organisation, does not have the sovereignty required to hand out concessions or charge fees but it possesses the management capabilities and unbureaucratic fexibility to manage tourist activities and to direct cash fows to where they are needed the most. Therefore, as a team, ICMBio and EKOS can overcome many obstacles to ef\ufb01cient park management. The INC team developed a model whereby ICMBio and EKOS sign a management agreement that gives EKOS the authority to identify and manage tourist operations, such as: restaurant managers, local guides, tour operators and the charging of entrance fees. Each operator will enter into a tripartite concession agreement with EKOS and ICMBio.

Communicating the vision, mission, purpose and business model of the site and the project is essential to inspire and maintain employee and institutional commitment and passion, stakeholder endorsement, and enthusiasm and \ufb01nancial support from funders and investors. PURPOSES OF COMMUNICATION Communication serves a number of important purposes within a site and within a project. The nature and purpose of the communication determines the most appropriate methods and strategies for getting information across, building awareness, and keeping others engaged. Internal communication and stakeholder engagement are important to focus, energise and empower employees, members of staff, volunteers and partners to help communicate key themes and messages. Understanding and support of the internal team is necessary before communication with an external audience. Stakeholder engagement is necessary to enable transparency and participation, promote inclusion and avoid potential confict. All actors involved in or affected by the conservation area should be kept informed as \ufb01nancing projects develop. Stakeholder relationships are often most appropriately managed through consultations and formal and informal meetings. Marketing speci\ufb01c products such as fruit or carbon bonds can be part of a business model for creating new revenue streams for the site. A market analysis should be part of the business plan, and can also be used in initial stages to assess the feasibility of a venture. Where there is already demand for a product, marketing is a matter of creating a presence, attracting consumers, and, where necessary, demonstrating an edge over the competition. Telling a compelling story of the site and its conservation activities can provide key advantages in marketing a product. For example, the cocoa post-harvest facility managed by the Centro de Conservaci\u00f3n, Investigaci\u00f3n y Manejo de \u00c1reas Naturales (CIMA) in Cordillera Azul's buffer zone, is committed to delivering a \"product of quality, free of deforestation\u201d. The impact could be reinforced by the use of local and international product-related standards, such as UTZ, FSC, and/or VCS/CCB for carbon bonds. Communicating these bene\ufb01ts and growing a sustainable brand is essential to effectively competing in this market. In some cases, it may be necessary to build a market where one does not exist or where it is emerging. For example, in Brazil, jackfruit is not traditionally sought after for food, but demand is rising as vegan and vegetarian food is becoming more popular. Sinal do Vale is partnering with vegan and vegetarian restaurants to market jackfruit as a meat alternative, and their own branded product as a particularly sustainable and socially responsible option. Promoting a site as a tourist destination can be part of a strategy to increase income from entry fees and sales. Tourism can also have positive effects on the local economy, such as channeling money towards local guides, guest houses, restaurants, and artists. Conservation practitioners can increase the fow of tourism by taking some of the following measures: Step 7: Create a communication strategy 33 Invite national and international tour operators to visit. A wide range of mainstream and specialist tour operators may \ufb01nd the area attractive, depending on the services and opportunities available (for instance, those specialising in hiking, adventure travel, kayaking, etc.). 1 2 Invite event managers and wedding planners to stage events, such as opera performances or high-pro\ufb01le weddings. Such events can signifcantly raise the pro\ufb01le of the area and make it widely known. Note that this would merely entail raising awareness among event managers and providing the necessary permits and concessions. The site managers would not necessarily need to organise or \ufb01nance such events, which is the job of a professional event manager. 3 Invite travel writers, newspapers, magazines, and other authors to write about the area. Journalists and writers should have an opportunity to visit for free, with the best tour guides available to show them around.

Communicating with investors requires going beyond the business case for a particular initiative to tell a compelling story of why the protected or conserved area exists, and why it must endure and thrive in the future, as well as the business case for investment. It can be particularly useful to have an \u201celevator pitch\u201d prepared for random or formal meetings with potential funders, investors, or partners. An elevator pitch is a concise prepared statement that captures all the critical elements of your project or propos- al. The name elevator pitch is based on the idea of presenting a project proposal to someone during a random meeting in an elevator. This means it must be short (a couple of minutes long), concise and compelling. The elevator pitch should allow the audience to fully understand exactly what the speaker wants to accomplish, why this proposal is the ideal one to solve a pressing need, and why the speaker\u2019s team is the best team to respond to this need. It is important to be engaging and friendly, and practise the pitch, so that it is clean, concise, and well-paced. The goal of the elevator pitch is to capture the interest of the audience and earn a second conversation, not to convince someone to immediately invest. The pitch can be used at networking events, conferences, and other opportunities to share a vision or idea with an audience that can add value to the effort. The pitch should be goal orient- ed, and should conclude with contact information and a request to reconnect at a later time to provide more elabo- rate details. \u2022 Meetings, open houses, focus groups; \u2022 Celebrations/special events, theater and other public events; \u2022 Electronic media, including email, listservers, websites, or similar platforms; \u2022 Video, \ufb01lm or other moving image media; \u2022 Display ads, news releases, press conference; \u2022 Public hearings and presentations; \u2022 Social media tools (YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.); \u2022 Workshops and training events; \u2022 Fact sheets, brochures, and publications; and \u2022 Targeted invitations to journalists, \u201cinfuencers\u201d, and personalities with a large online following. The internet presents unprecedented opportunities for reaching a broad audience at comparatively low cost and conservation practitioners should not shy away from tapping into new trends. The internet can be used to market and sell products, such as fruit, souvenirs, and indigenous crafts, and to promote a site for tourism. At the most basic level, it is possible to set up a professional looking website, Instagram, and Facebook accounts at relatively low cost, and without needing a specialised IT expert. These must be updated on a regular basis. For these purposes, working through large third-party portals such as eBay, Etsy, Tripadvisor, and booking.com can be more effective than setting up a new website. VEHICLES FOR COMMUNICATION Different communication mechanisms can be appropriate for different purposes and audiences. The reach and impact of a message will increase if the same message is distributed several times and via multiple methods. A few communication options include: 34 A business plan is a written description of the future of a project or programme. It describes objectives, activities, funds, and resources. All business plans are inherently strategic\u2014they begin by describing the resources and capacities that exist now, then identify one or more goals in the future (usually 3-5 years), and describe all of the resources and capacity that will have been secured at that time, as well as increased \ufb01nancial assets. The business plan describes in words and shows in graphs and images the path from today to that future point. PURPOSES AND USE A business plan serves as a road map for conservation practitioners to develop a project or programme they wish to seek funding for. It is a necessary instrument for unlocking private investment in conservation and the basis for business case studies to be presented to investors. A good business plan will give an investor con\ufb01dence that the project team knows exactly where they are going, how they will get there, and everything they need to accomplish their objectives. A business plan can also be developed for a protected or conserved area as a whole. Every site can bene\ufb01t from creating a clear, concise, and easy to follow business plan. The plan serves as a tool to understand \ufb01nancial gaps in implementing management objectives. It can be used to monitor progress, show accountability, and control the direction and success of a management plan. It can also help attract funding from public and philanthropic sources.

This is the most important topic in the business plan, since it is the section that most people will read \ufb01rst (or at all). The summary should be short, clear and in an objective voice. Speci\ufb01c sections can be highlighted in different colors or fonts depending on the audience (e.g. donors, government management authorities, strategic partners). It should describe key facts and summarise \ufb01nancial highlights and priorities. The summary should also state the mission and vision of the business in an appealing way for targeted investors. 1 Market analysis/strategy \u2014 an analysis of the factors that affect sales, fees, or other revenue generating measures. The marketing strategy should be compatible with the overall mission and objectives of the protected or conserved area. It should include: 4 5 6 Site description/context \u2014 an overview of the physical and management characteristics and context. This should be a brief but comprehensive overview of the protected or conserved area, its resources, infrastructure, mission and history, including maps as appropriate. It should identify all facilities relevant for providing products and services. This section should also include a description of the enabling legislation, management structure and institutional authority overseeing the area, and show how these factors will infuence the use and reinvestment of revenues and the agility and fexibility of the decision-making processes (see Step 2). 2 Business model/product/opportunity \u2014 a description of products or services and opportunities for developing them to generate revenue (see Step 4). This section can draw on the feasibility study and the business case to present a strong and compelling idea, bearing in mind that details of marketing, operational structure and \ufb01nancial aspects can be addressed later. Here the goal is to introduce and start to sell the business concept. Where the objective is to attract an impact investor interested in more than just a \ufb01nancial return, this section can include a theory of change illustrating the expected social/environmental impact. Theory of change is a specifc methodology followed to meet social-based goals. The main idea is parting from the defnition of goals to track and identify necessary preconditions. 3 \u2022 An analysis of market trends and competitors, describing the direction the market is moving, and factors that could infuence market success; \u2022 An analysis of target audience, consumers, visitors or other customers or clients, including historical trends and predicted changes over time; and \u2022 Marketing, promotion, branding and pricing strategies to attract customers and infuence behaviour to increase the customer base. Organisation and management \u2014 a description of the management and decision-making structure, including the organisational structure, management team, personnel plan and decision-making structure for the project. This is particularly important in clarifying responsibilities and providing the right incentives for success. It should summarise the operational framework and governance structure (see Step 6). It can also include descriptions of alliances with local government, community and non-pro\ufb01t organisations as well as involvement of other stakeholders. This section can include the communication/marketing strategy (see Step 7) as well as market aspects identi\ufb01ed in the feasibility study (see Step 5). A separate market analysis will often be necessary to develop a strong business plan. Financial plan \u2014 an estimate of costs and revenue each year for the next 3-5 years. A project \ufb01nancial plan is distinct from a site \ufb01nancial plan (see Step 1). Where a site \ufb01nancial plan should summarise the \ufb01nancial history, needs and income of the protected or conserved area as a whole, the project \ufb01nancial plan should consider the \ufb01nancial resources related to the speci\ufb01c business model.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ac3a77d-1727-4160-b4cf-d68dfad80d68": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ac3a77d-1727-4160-b4cf-d68dfad80d68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Becoming a conservation entrepreneur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18e013767d4b1e07c0e043a9b87a4e99c62f476003ef9894d42a2d64fb60dd2f"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b5e79b2-4407-4676-8141-8193a642a4dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a53729679978735d9d400df05bf8b440d61d4212c095d887a856ddbf42bf884a"}}, "hash": "1f4e0c981972f0d800c6121febb4cab802e9c9b42f7abea6f8d2285c216bb8e1", "text": "It should cover: 35 \u2022 Current and projected costs and expenses including general expenses, costs of inputs for the business (production cost of jackfruit, cost of materials for souvenirs), costs of infrastructure and equipment (buildings, vehicles), running costs (maintaining trails, operating hotels), personnel, marketing expenses and taxes. \u2022 Current and projected revenue from sale of goods or services, investment income (returns to investments), or other sources. \u2022 Initial investment required and \u201cbreak-even\u201d point at which the business will have covered the initial", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "575c957d-22d0-4533-b1ab-c3424c20c92b": {"__data__": {"id_": "575c957d-22d0-4533-b1ab-c3424c20c92b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Becoming a conservation entrepreneur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93f7ed729131c7b8e8bb2e67c681335bb0bd9de5aaa67cf4d6f7cc6481d19ef8"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e4c9d59-61ea-45cd-bf23-cf0922e799cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/becoming-conservation-entrepreneur", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3dfce1940a7efd521f1540ff148cc34c2c7218a33b725a2d54bb92b188c998e4"}}, "hash": "e789dc65c8196974f919c76794b837c4df1a09aafeb128e8d6c4e86cf06379b3", "text": "investment and start generating a pro\ufb01t.

INC helped Sinal set up a social enterprise called Frutos da Floresta that commercialises a line of organic products processed from fruits - such as green jackfruit - grown locally in agroforests or sustainably extracted directly from the Atlantic Rainforest. Green jackfruit grows abundantly in the forests and constitutes a versatile and nutritious food source that is particularly popular as a meat alternative in vegetarian cuisine. Most landowners in the peri-urban areas of the Atlantic Rainforest are unaware of the economic opportunities and bene\ufb01ts of the forest and generally consider forested land as less valuable than degraded land. The goal is to give an economic value to the conservation and regeneration of the local tropical forest. By installing a food processing plant, creating a line of food products and building up a value chain, the business guarantees access to the market and revenue for landowners. The project was set up sticking closely to a business and \ufb01nancial plan created by Bemtevi, a business consultant with experience in the sustainability sector. INC contracted Bemtevi to conduct an in-depth analysis of the local, national and export markets for jackfruit-derived products. The business plan included a review of all relevant stakeholders, in particular the potential producers and consumers of jackfruit. A SWOT analysis and an economic feasibility analysis detailed possible production processes, sourcing and distribution logistics and personnel considerations. The related \ufb01nancial plan suggested potential sources of \ufb01nancing. Additionally, legal considerations such as licensing, IP rights and company law requirements were set out. Case Study: Sinal do Vale, Brazil Developing a business plan for processing jackfruit \u00a9 Sinal do Vale 36 PROCESS Creating a business plan can force conservation practitioners to review everything about a protected or conserved area: the value proposition, marketing assumptions, operations plan, institutional relationships, \ufb01nances, and staf\ufb01ng. The business planning process provides an opportunity to identify risks, challenges, and opportunities that could easily be missed in the day-to-day operations. The business plan should be as concise and speci\ufb01c as possible. It can be helpful to remember the following guidelines: Preparation \u2014 it can take much more time to conduct research to prepare the plan than to do the actual writing. Including thorough and accurate descriptions is essential to ensure \ufb01nancial success. This is important to consider, as well as the costs implied in the undertaking of the process. Understanding purpose and niche \u2014 the mission, vision, and purpose statements from the management plan should tell a clear and compelling story of the protected or conserved area, and help investors understand why conservation of the area is important. Incorporating the communications and marketing strategies \u2014 the communications, marketing, and outreach strategies should be incorporated in the business plan. The ideas behind these strategies may also inform other sections of the plan. Adaptability to speci\ufb01c audiences \u2014 a variety of readers may access the business plan, and they may each require different information from it. Sections of the plan may need to be modi\ufb01ed depending on audiences reading it. Demonstrating passion \u2014 a business plan should clearly show why the proposed activity, and the protected or conserved area as a whole, matters to the stakeholders as well as to the reader. \u00a9 Sinal do Vale 37 Accessing \ufb01nancial resources to an initiative is one of the most important steps in conservation \ufb01nance processes. In some cases, a substantial upfront investment may be required to prepare and implement the business plan. This is particularly true in situations where a signi\ufb01cant amount of time, resources or infrastructure will be required before revenue can start to fow in, such as projects involving certi\ufb01cation of carbon bonds. In other cases, more easily obtained seed capital can be used to start operating on a smaller scale to create a demonstration of the viability of the idea that can then attract larger funds.

The proft might be seen as a fnancial proft, meaning a monetary gain, or in case of not-for proft fnancial instruments, it could be a social or environmental gain. There are different ways investments take place. The ways depend also partially on the sources of investment, that is, on the investors. There are two types of sources: private and public. Private investors are individuals or groups that decide upon resource allocation in an independent way. Public investors are government and government-based organisations that allocate their resources based on national, regional, and municipal budgets. Private and public investors might generate partnerships through different schemes in order to provide specifc fnancial instruments for investment, in what is called blended fnance. Both private and public investors can offer for proft and not-for proft fnancial instruments. It is however more common for private investors to search for monetary proft, while public ones focus more on social and environmental non-monetary returns to investment. Financial instruments are broadly classifed into equity and debt instruments. A separate category are grants. Step 9: Access financial resources Equity \ufb01nancing means that the investor buys a share or proportion of a company or venture. It can provide immediate cash to develop infrastructure or a product within or near the area and the investor or shareholder then has a right to claim on future earnings. This kind of \ufb01nancing best \ufb01ts business plans that include a revenue generating activity (e.g. ecotourism) or product (e.g. sustainable \ufb01sh) that is developed or managed by local enterprises or a third entity, for example an NGO, a public-private-partnership or a holding company (see Box 7). Through equity instruments, the investor takes on part of the risk of the venture. If no revenues are generated, investors receive no returns to their investments. Thus, in some cases, depending on the amount and type of shares sold to investors, they might have the possibility to take a decision-making position in the business itself. Debt \ufb01nancing means that the investor grants a loan, or buys \ufb01xed income products, such as bonds, bills, or notes. Fixed income means that through a certain amount of time, the investor will receive a fxed revenue for the bonds, bills and notes bought. The revenue is an interest rate that is placed prior to the buying of the product. These instruments to support conservation are increasingly being developed, including, for example, green bonds. Green bonds are made to \ufb01nance projects which bene\ufb01t the environment, which may have a lower interest rate and include an obligation to report on the use of the funds (see indicators of effectiveness). With debt \ufb01nancing, the conservation management, local company or venture receives immediate cash to prepare and implement the business plan, against the obligation to pay the debt back, including interest after a certain period. This type of debt instrument is mostly given out by governments at all levels and big corporations. Other debt instruments include loans and credits which can be accessed through commercial and development banks and other fnancial institutions. The difference between a loan and a credit is mainly that a loan is paid in one disbursement and must be repaid after a fxed period. Loans often include interest rates that represent the cost of the debt. These rates are variable depending on the type of loan. For example, soft loans are offered 38 by institutions such as development banks at very low interest rates and longer repayment periods. Other types of loans are concessional loans, where one part of the loan is given as a grant to which no interest rate is applied (at least 25% of the loan must be a grant). On the other side, credit is an open amount which can be spent through time and cancelled in a more fexible period. Credits also generate interests that should be paid to fnancial institutions. It is important that, when required, the terms of repayment of debt instruments are suitable to the underlying activities. For example, if the \ufb01rst revenue comes three years after the start of the activities, it is better to have a 3-year grace period before starting the repayment period, in order to match the revenue generation with the loan installment repayment. It is very important that the loan suits your \ufb01nancial plan. Grants are funds given to a third party which should not be repaid. Grants come from governments, development banks and private philanthropic institutions in the form of donations.

This has been the most used type of funds for conservation around the world. However, nowadays grants are increasingly being used in mixed fnancing mechanisms (grouping of fnancing instruments) to support the participation of private for-proft investment. ENVIRONMENTAL FUNDS Environmental funds (EFs), sometimes referred to as \u201cconservation trust funds\u201d (CTFs), are \ufb01nancial structures created to raise, invest, and re-grant \ufb01nancial resources for the sustainable management of nature. This can include the protection of terrestrial, coastal, and marine ecosystems, and sustainable agriculture, \ufb01shery and forestry, sustainable water management, and the use of best practices in land and marine management. Some secondary functions of EFs may include building the capacity of local NGO and civil society conservation organisations, and improving coordination between donor programs and national or regional conservation plans and strategies. EFs (and CTFs) began to fourish in use in the early 1990\u2019s. The Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, a government managed facility, was one of the early funds established in 1992, followed soon after by the Mexico Fund for the Conservation of Nature (see Box 11), a private non-pro\ufb01t organisation implemented in 1994. Both funds continue to successfully operate today, and have been joined by more than 80 others now operating worldwide. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was one of the organisations that took an early interest in providing capital for EFs and is still active in providing funding to establish and support Funds around the world. Those early experiences led the GEF to identify essential factors for effective EF start-up, including: \u2022 A long-term \ufb01nancial commitment of at least 10-15 years; \u2022 Active government support, although virtually all funds operate as independent organisations outside direct government control; \u2022 Decision-making and advisory boards that include people from diverse sectors of society working together to achieve very speci\ufb01c biodiversity conservation and sustainable development objectives; and \u2022 A clearly de\ufb01ned set of legal, governance, operational, and \ufb01nancial procedures to ensure that funds are carefully managed, invested, disbursed, and monitored. Including the input of supporting institutions (e.g. banking, auditing, and contracting). EFs are usually created as a public-private partnership,
