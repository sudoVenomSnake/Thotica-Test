 exclusively on fossil fuels. Given likely trends in demand for transport in developing countries, emissions from the sector in these countries could grow substantially. For this reason, implementing sustainable transport solutions is critical. Seventy-seven per cent of the INDCs submitted before the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change identified transport as a key target sector for mitigation (Gota et al., 2015). Interventions quoted in these INDCs focus on actions to \u201cimprove\u201d (141 INDCs), \u201cshift\u201d (66) or \u201cavoid\u201d (17), compared to current transport forms (Gota et al., 2015). Across national submissions, policy options like fuel economy standards, regulations for cleaner fuels, and reorienting development plans, play a key role. 5.4.1 Vehicle Fuel Economy Standards", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4996ef0e-180d-4e09-895e-42133569637f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4996ef0e-180d-4e09-895e-42133569637f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93ce5a56288c306bfe5971ab3de47ad1110d99a4b9080035044a555914bbaedf"}, "3": {"node_id": "4d702204-10e6-42b9-8aba-4a88b047802d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d6f9f1c402e1b6642db6da74e853afd68489614d363e8bd3fe213c1fa303858"}}, "hash": "a9e2a3958e778690cd4641d94f9a0f042ef7314a0d25d84209508a875ccf9b7a", "text": "and CO2 emissions Standards that specify fuel economy (average fuel consumption, for example, expressed as litre (L) per 100 km) and/or CO2 emissions for new vehicles have been implemented in most industrialized countries and several developing countries (table 5.1). These policies have generally been successful, and the average fuel economy of new vehicles sold has improved significantly. However, standards are most effective when complemented with user charges that reflect actual road and environmental costs, levied according to vehicles\u2019 usage and emissions intensity performance. Compliance monitoring and enforcement are necessary to ensure that the purported performance levels are being achieved (IEA, 2016c), and consumers can have confidence in energy efficiency. Fuel economy improvements will also deliver benefits related to improved public health from better air quality, reduced fuel costs, and increased energy security. Box 5.2: Steam Systems in China. In 2012, the economic emission reductions potential associated with industrial coal-fired steam systems in China was 1,687 PJ (or 23 per cent of the total fuel used in industrial coal-fired steam systems in the country in 2012). This corresponds to savings in CO2 emissions of 165,817 kilotonnes of CO2 (UNIDO, 2014). Optimization of the entire steam system (as opposed to boilers only) would result in much larger energy savings. 37 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency Regulations on fuel economy and emissions have also helped promote other types of vehicles, such as Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles. Similarly, higher fuel and road taxes have encouraged the purchase of more efficient vehicles. Labelling, to inform consumers about the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of a vehicle, thus allowing them to make more informed purchasing decisions, is implemented in the EU, the USA and other countries (Haq and Weiss, 2016). Vehicle maintenance, low rolling resistant tyres, tyre pressure, road maintenance, and driver behaviour, all influence the fuel efficiency of a vehicle. Combining policies and measures, as has been done in France, for example, makes it possible to achieve results in a more cost-effective manner. 5.4.2. Electric Mobility for Passenger Transport In 2015, the global stock of electric cars was 1.26 million (IEA, 2016e). Electric vehicles use energy 70 per cent more efficiently than non-electric vehicles (Sims et al., 2014). However, when power generation losses are taken into account, the overall system efficiency balance needs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. In the long-term, electric vehicles are an important mitigation option through both end-use efficiency and decarbonisation of electricity supply (Dhar et al., 2016). They also bring about substantial co- benefits, such as improved urban air quality. In 2015, to increase the up-take of electric vehicles, a range of enabling policies were in place in 16 selected countries (IEA, 2016e). Policies that help increase the up-take of electric vehicles can be grouped in three areas: \u2022 Economic incentives: purchase incentives (France, Germany, Japan, UK, USA); tax exemptions, including waivers on excise tax (China); lower purchase tax, or lower registration tax (Netherlands, Portugal); and differential taxation on the basis of emissions. \u2022 Urban initiatives: e-mobility plans in cities; increased network of charging stations; incorporation of electric vehicles in urban plans and bylaws; waivers on parking charges; and priority in urban traffic. \u2022 Policy continuity: An important lesson from the success of Norway was that in addition to strong incentives, there was effective policy sequencing over many years (box 5.3). Globally, the movement of electrification has been transitioning into other transport modes, including two-wheelers, three-wheelers and public transport. Electrification of transport has grown rapidly in China and India, where electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers are increasingly common, highlighting a need to offer diverse efficient travel modes and vehicles. China leads with around Box 5.3: Incentives for electric vehicles in Norway. Norway has one of the most ambitious programmes to foster the adoption of electric vehicles. In 2015, battery electric vehicles represented 18 per cent of the total car sales, which has been achieved through: (i) collaboration between government, private players and non-government organizations, (ii) publicly-supported charging stations (Figenbaum et al., 2015), and (iii) strong incentives for purchase and ownership of battery vehicles (Bjerkan et al., 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d702204-10e6-42b9-8aba-4a88b047802d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d702204-10e6-42b9-8aba-4a88b047802d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93ce5a56288c306bfe5971ab3de47ad1110d99a4b9080035044a555914bbaedf"}, "2": {"node_id": "4996ef0e-180d-4e09-895e-42133569637f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a9e2a3958e778690cd4641d94f9a0f042ef7314a0d25d84209508a875ccf9b7a"}}, "hash": "4d6f9f1c402e1b6642db6da74e853afd68489614d363e8bd3fe213c1fa303858", "text": "The case for decarbonisation from electric vehicles is strong, as over 95 per cent of the electricity in Norway is supplied by hydro- electric power.

The sale of electric scooters in China started rising due to a ban on conventional vehicles in cities, to reduce air pollution. Other contributing factors were policies to allow e-bikes up to a certain weight limit to share right-of-way on bicycle lanes, and investments in charging stations in cities. The Chinese government has also implemented aggressive policies and incentives for electrification of public transport, including subsidies and investments in charging infrastructure for buses. Presently, China has over 170,000 electric buses (IEA, 2016e). Recently, India has announced policies and incentives to enable the adoption of electric vehicles. The near-term challenges for electric vehicles include the currently high up-front costs, compared to conventional vehicles, and addressing the technical issues related to battery capacity, reuse and recycling. Battery costs have undergone significant reduction, from nearly US$1,000 per kWh in 2007, to nearly US$300 per kWh in 2015 (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015), and are expected to further decease to less than US$150 per kWh in the future (Bruce et al., 2012). Estimated cost reductions for cars could be nearly 50 per cent for battery electric vehicles, and 60 per cent for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (Wolfram and Lutsey, 2016). These lower battery costs will significantly reduce the cost of electric vehicles and the amount of subsidies required in the future. Further improvements in battery technologies and vehicle performance are expected to ease the existing limitations of driving range and battery costs. The driving range issue is also being addressed by local governments through the provision of charging infrastructure. Efforts are also underway to find solutions for the re-use and recycling of batteries, including utilisation of used car batteries as a source of storage within electric grids. 5.4.3. Sustainable Logistics/Freight Transportation Freight transport accounted for 45 per cent of transport sector energy demand in 2009 (Sims et al., 2014), and a similar share of CO2 emissions. More than 50 per cent of freight-related CO2 emissions come from road transport, especially heavy-duty vehicles (IPCC, 2014; Sims et al., 2014). Efficiency of freight transport can be improved through better utilisation of freight capacity, decisions regarding siting of logistics facilities, routing of freight corridors, and a shift to more efficient and cleaner modes of transport, such as rail or water-borne transport. A modal shift away from road to rail can lead to substantial emissions reductions, since the emissions from rail are only a fraction per km, compared to heavy-duty vehicles (Sims et al., 2014). This modal shift can deliver additional benefits, in the form of reduced local air pollution and accidents (Machado-Filho, 2009). India\u2019s Dedicated Freight Corridor project is an example of an integrated plan that aims to increase efficiency of freight transport, while ensuring overall economic development (box 5.4). 5.5. Opportunities through systems thinking and integration Some mitigation opportunities are difficult to cover in a sectoral breakdown, but can still be very important. In general, the opportunities for increasing energy efficiency are moving from perfecting individual products to optimizing systems. This section highlights a couple of such opportunities. 5.5.1 Urban systems: efficient settlement forms Cities are one of the biggest consumers of energy in the world, representing almost two-thirds of global primary energy demand, and accounting for 70 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector (IEA, 2016b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fde9d608-90db-455e-bbe7-e3f6c1372497": {"__data__": {"id_": "fde9d608-90db-455e-bbe7-e3f6c1372497", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b66879fcb32e530f038254f722de667d059cb734ae3bb27f9ebab773c07b9395"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a3a7c2b-29da-4231-a2f2-2a2651060c52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "140e6db9d3869e714b532b3115e426bf649788c3797d0185199b7a4946e3d4e1"}}, "hash": "908ce8f5d03027e6ca3e740bb3b16b10d697c790e3e63465c45dd588d07abae6", "text": "While most emissions in cities originate from the building, industry and transport sectors, a sizable share of these emissions could be avoided through city-level mitigation options, such as spatial planning (to ensure connectivity, accessibility, mixed land-use, and a certain level of density), improving transit options, increasing and co-locating employment and residential densities, and increasing green spaces. A growing number of cities are joining various non-state actor partnerships, in an effort to become more efficient, sustainable and low emitting.

While policy making has traditionally focused on technological and economic solutions, changes in behaviour can often result in large energy savings (Allcott and Mullainathan, 2010; EEA, 2013). Box 5.4: Dedicated freight corridors in India. The Indian government is prioritizing policies that help to shift freight transport from road to rail. This ambition was highlighted in India\u2019s INDC as an important strategy for decarbonizing the transport sector (UNFCCC, 2015). The INDC specifies a target of increasing the share of rail in land transportation (from 36 to 45 per cent by 2030) through investment in Dedicated Freight Corridors. These corridors will develop separate rail networks for freight transport (DFCCIL, 2016). India\u2019s INDC estimates that these corridors could reduce emissions by about 457 million tonnes of CO2 over 30-years, a figure that could increase if electricity were decarbonized. 39 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the role of energy efficiency Most studies agree that mitigation strategies involving lifestyles and behaviour do not need to imply compromises in living standards. Recent research points out that domestic energy saving potentials through behavioural measures range from 20-30 per cent, but could be substantially larger in the longer term (Karlin et al., 2015).16 While both the understanding of and the policy toolbox addressing behavioural and lifestyle changes as mitigation strategies are very rudimentary, a few conclusions can be derived. Policies that can influence the choices of consumers typically focus on price signals (notably: subsidies, tax rebates, and taxes) and information disclosure \u2013 for example, mandated energy labels (Allcott and Mullainathan, 2010). 5.6. Emerging Opportunities Advances in information communication technology, including the internet, big data, smart technologies and systems, and shared economy platforms, social media, are revolutionising human activities and, consequently, energy consumption. While the impact of these is still being understood, it appears as though the economic emissions reduction potential is high, if these trends can be intelligently guided and opportunities seized. 5.6.1. Circular and sharing Economy Recent developments enable opportunities to utilise capacities to a much higher degree, which in turn helps the world move towards a more \u201cshared economy\u201d, as people are increasingly using assets such as cars, bicycles, and apartments on a regular basis.17 Similarly, dematerialisation can shift manufacturing away from a linear to a circular economy. 16 Based on the review of behavioural measures across the EU, it was found that behavioural measures could achieve around 5-20 per cent reduction in energy consumption compared to previous consumption (EEA, 2013). A meta-analysis found that of the 29 energy feedback studies they surveyed with sample sizes over 100, energy savings ranged from 0.5 to 13 per cent of previous consumption (Ehrhardt-Martinez et al., 2010). 17 For example, in 2015, 980 cities globally had some type of public bike- sharing programme (May, 2016). Public bike-sharing is the fastest growing mode of public transportation and has grown at an annual growth rate of 37 per cent since 2009 (Campbell et al., 2016). Similarly, many mainstream car manufacturers are promoting sharing electric vehicles, such as Daimler\u2019s Car2Go, BMW\u2019s Drivenow, among others. The concept, based on a regenerative design principle, turns goods that are at the end of their service life into resources for others, closing loops in industrial ecosystems and minimizing waste (Stahel, 2016).18 Companies engaging in these production paradigms are inherently drawn to efficient production, distribution, recycling and materials supply chain practices. Large economies, such as the EU, are on their way to adopting the circular economy as the standard approach to material production and use. 5.6.2. Information and communication technology New information and communication technologies are expected to improve the efficiency of services with minimal environmental impacts, and also imply a certain degree of automation in decision making. Such systems can be applied to buildings to control heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting and utilities,19 as well as in the industry and transport sectors. In the industry sector, instantaneous tracking of energy performance and a real-time measurement of energy use and savings allows for significant reduction in energy use. In transport, real-time access to traffic information allows for safer and more efficient uses of transport networks.20 18 Several developed countries including Germany, Japan and the USA have comprehensive regulations in place.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fe528eb-2585-4814-be6d-7b1a43bb84ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fe528eb-2585-4814-be6d-7b1a43bb84ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00ec48bd6b4db92b091e4efb8593a258a8f844b6a92b9751d643ce811a4d57f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "0070ede8-0229-48aa-a4de-bf23a7c3a066", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "68d9af0d5d1487345d2ce8a1ecd1b38e72eec9cf9e61ef0c826228bc9a65c17c"}}, "hash": "1308a926a3cebf9a498a86dae6f30c3c00afe7e584ed8450a2406ec008603c39", "text": "Sharing and recycling are closely linked to behaviour and cultural issues, therefore, incentives for energy saving behaviour, including tax breaks, market levers and government support, will encourage higher adoption.

The agenda succeeds the United Nations Millennium Declaration, which established the Millennium Development Goals, and represents a considerable expansion in scope and ambition. It comprises 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (see figure 6.1) and 169 associated targets, and takes a global perspective \u2013 seeking to provide a comprehensive, strategic direction to the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development. Acknowledging the interdependence of the challenges, the SDGs are to be regarded as \u201cintegrated and indivisible\u201d, according to paragraph 18 of the 2030 Agenda (UN, 2015). The need for an integrated approach to the SDGs is nowhere more relevant than in the context of climate change. This chapter provides a brief overview of the challenges climate change poses to the SDGs. It then gives an initial qualitative assessment of key areas of alignment, trade-offs and opportunities between the SDGs and the climate change mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement, focusing on selected SDGs and associated targets. SDG13 constitutes the 2030 Agenda\u2019s climate change goal. It does not provide concrete mitigation targets or proposed limits to global warming. It, instead, targets strengthening the resilience to climate-related hazards, mainstreaming climate change into policy and strategic planning processes, awareness building and capacity development, and funding. For more concrete and measurable mitigation and adaptation objectives, the 2030 Agenda expressly recognizes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) as the authoritative body for defining global policies on climate change (see UN, 2015). The Paris Agreement, thereby, frames a boundary condition for the implementation of the SDGs. 6.2 The SDG-mitigation nexus During the period of dialogue and negotiation for the SDGs, a number of studies sought to catalogue the interrelationships, synergies and trade-offs between the proposed goals and climate change (WWF and CARE, 2015; Scott and Picot, 2014; Picot and Moss, 2014; Munro, 2014; Marston, 2014; Leong, 2015; Ansuategi et al., 2015). These studies considered relevance from both SDG impacts on climate, and climate impacts on the SDG, with a range of methodologies and results. Some studies focused on the explicit mentioning and recognition of climate change in the target formulation of different SDGs, while others placed stronger emphasis on sector specific linkages. 6.2.1 Climate change jeopardizes maintenance of progress against the SDGs The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment reports have identified the human impacts of climate change with increasing confidence (IPCC 2001, 2007, 2014a). This has led to growing concern for the long-term sustainability of development progress, and impacts on the poor, in particular, in the absence of appropriate risk management practices and steep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (see for example AfDB et al., 2003; Stern Review, 2007; World Bank, 2010; Hallegatte et al., 2016; Granoff et al., 2015). The need to strengthen resilience to climate change is a repeated concern in the SDGs. It is not only reflected in SDG13 on climate change, but also under several other goals, such as those related to ending poverty (SDG1), ending hunger (SDG2), building infrastructure (SDG9), and improving cities and human settlements (SDG11).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75753f21-32e4-4b55-9cde-52cbc30cbbcc": {"__data__": {"id_": "75753f21-32e4-4b55-9cde-52cbc30cbbcc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52ed1c5f15bc7390d46fac78f27f75a9d148818c5b9e3eb8bb187e15b4287555"}, "2": {"node_id": "0bdfc627-233c-4212-bb58-ed171fec9a86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a70359bd34f30280832327f389f314ab746cd7f115c18223a842d0cbabdcd74b"}}, "hash": "fa9939a813599cfe084ee5ca5d0e9c27b0be2172fe456c6849092374f8d0703b", "text": "Adaptation 41 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation to climate change is a necessary, complementary measure to mitigation, but does not substitute for closing the emissions gap, as with progressive levels of warming, adaptive capacities of several natural and human systems may no longer be able to cope with the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f5a4fcb-5469-4bd3-8d20-6f4b630518ca": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f5a4fcb-5469-4bd3-8d20-6f4b630518ca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6292848efe41669ae9efd10d1c4b20a7e3f07896d0861088b672f0868af999bd"}, "3": {"node_id": "513a4711-eff3-4fb9-8393-a57529e670c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e52e3156467df344bc3b2f6b38b3c0ac714e3798c8f9321fa3e8dc79be6ff36"}}, "hash": "edbbbd6b24c71b1f828fad175e707cd2452ce3a88687603d1f8f44a8a814961a", "text": "rate and magnitude of change, and the risk of crossing tipping points with large-scale irreversible consequences may increase (Schneider et al., 2007; Lenton et al., 2008; Schleussner et al, 2016). Among the chief findings of analyses to date is that the impacts of climate change may undermine our ability to deliver the SDGs by 2030. Analysis by the World Bank (Hallegatte, 2016) estimates that absent, rapid and inclusive development practices, climate change could result in an additional 100 million people living in extreme poverty by 2030, slowing progress against SDG1. Ansuategi et al. (2015) assessed the risk of failure to achieve the SDGs under high- and low-ambition climate change agreement outcomes at Paris. Their analysis identified a medium risk, even under the high-ambition scenario, of failing to achieve the SDGs related to health (SDG3); gender equality (SDG5); clean water and sanitation (SDG6); sustainable consumption and production (SDG12); life below water (SDG14); and life on land (SDG15). With the low-ambition scenario there would be a high risk of failing to achieve 10 of the 17 SDGs. As impacts become increasingly certain in the post-2030 period, they also become highly likely to undermine the ability to maintain progress against many of the SDGs beyond 2030. Looking only at the best understood pathways by which climate change impacts poverty targets\u2014 agricultural productivity, climate extremes, and corollary childhood malnutrition and developmental stunting\u2014 Granoff et al. (2015) found that these factors alone could impact up to 750 million people in extreme or moderate poverty by 2050. Climate-exacerbated extreme weather events will also likely impact urban populations severely. Half of humanity lives less than 60 kilometres (km) from the coast, and three-quarters of all large cities are located in coastal areas (UNEP, 2016).

Prior authors have emphasized the potential for conflict between certain SDGs and climate change objectives. The remainder of this chapter explores a complementary approach, analysing the SDGs particularly relevant for mitigation, divided into two key areas: agriculture, forestry and other land-uses, and energy-related emissions. Certain goals and associated targets are defined in ways that are synergistic, or \u201cpath-aligned\u201d. Their achievement will generally facilitate the achievement of the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Others are defined in ways that may or may not be antagonistic with these mitigation objectives, depending on how they are pursued.

While the goal heading itself makes reference to sustainability, the only target level reference to sustainability is with respect to \u201csustained growth\u201d under target 8.1, leaving open the mitigation implications of growth pathways on its face. Target 8.4 discusses decoupling of growth from environmental degradation generally but focusing on the sustainability of consumption and production as per SDG15. Growth\u2019s historic correlation with increased greenhouse gas emissions underscores that the compatibility of this SDG with the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement hinges on the ability of growing economies to accelerate the decoupling economic output from emissions. SDG9 Infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation Path-contingent Targets 9.1, 9.4 and 9.a focus on the expansion of infrastructure. Infrastructure development is paradoxically a strong correlate of emissions growth, and a critical requirement to decarbonization. This is because incumbent infrastructure choices have been associated with increases in energy demand and intensity and land use change: decarbonization will require both the replacement of incumbent infrastructure and expansion of infrastructure services through low-carbon options. Some infrastructure locks in patterns of inefficiency, other choices lead to decarbonization, energy efficiency, and pollution reduction. The result of these targets on emissions will be highly contingent on the nature of these infrastructure choices. Targets 9.2 and 9.3. focus on the promotion of industrialization. While target 9.2 does acknowledge the need for \u201csustainable\u201d industrialization, historic processes of industrialization have been drivers of emissions growth. New paths of industrialization, particularly if enabled by innovation promoted under targets 9.5, 9.b and supplied with low-carbon energy sources, have the potential change this historical pattern if innovation is geared toward decarbonizing technologies and processes. The emissions implications of the target are therefore contingent upon realizing this potential. SDG11 Sustainable Cities Path-aligned The 10 targets of the goal are generally well-aligned as seven of the ten targets as-drafted focus on measures that expressly improve the resource efficiency of urban form, and thus also ones that benefit climate: factors to achieve them would be policies that improve, for example, compactness, public transport, and other efficiency inducing measures. Target 11.1 on access to housing does leave open the possibility of climate-conflicting approaches, but the goal taken as a whole emphasizes that improvements to urban form entail measures that are sustainability enhancing. SDG12 Sustainable consumption and production Path-aligned Improving the resource-use efficiency of production, reducing pollution and promoting more sustainable consumption patterns diminish the pressure on the environment, including impacts on the climate. This makes the targets under this goal well aligned with SDG14. Achievement of these targets will also further the scope for the climate-alignment of agricultural production, industrialization, and corollary economic growth under SDGs 2, 8 and 9, respectively. SDG15 Terrestrial Ecosystems Path-aligned Terrestrial ecosystems, particularly forests, hold large carbon stocks that, if disrupted, could have severe consequent emissions. The halting of deforestation is an important lever for agriculture, forestry and other land-use mitigation. While carbon stock preservation does not necessarily serve all of the objectives of terrestrial ecosystems preservations found in SDG 15\u2019s targets, the targets are largely salutary to mitigation efforts. 43 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation Hence, they are considered to be \u201cpath-contingent\u201d. With these goals and targets, strategic choices matter. Once these choices about how to achieve these SDGs are made, they may be difficult or costly to reverse. Table 6.1 identifies SDGs that fall under each category, with a brief rationale. The approach focuses on the specific definition of SDG goals and targets, and what this means for their ability to align or conflict with the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Goals are regarded as path-aligned, where both the overarching SDG and individual targets are expressly defined in a way that reinforces the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Goals are also regarded as path-aligned if several associated targets are synergistic to mitigation objectives and others primarily neutral -- that is, collective progress on the goal does not impede simultaneous progress towards the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Goals are regarded as path-contingent, where either the goal or one or more targets are defined in a way capable of undermining the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement, depending on how it is pursued. 6.3.1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "744020dd-1a61-4d98-a64f-7a02ef465c50": {"__data__": {"id_": "744020dd-1a61-4d98-a64f-7a02ef465c50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4c1193151a90f1c529e3be698fd2974f1ee72a6392c83fdff9a9a87c9755651"}, "2": {"node_id": "c41b9428-297e-42bd-9bf6-0f048e6c2c92", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2f23621c7eebec6e95288e2b883cdb8f2ef2763f7ddeb492846b87eed6debc8"}}, "hash": "d3f7dbd084d031b62b178f9bfa82603fdf104e6b5adacfbc8138b938961c0dbb", "text": "6.3.1.

How these interests are integrated in development policies and practice will have implications for progress towards the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Hunger and food security (SDG2): Path-contingency Food security improved during the Millennium Development Goals, but close to 800 million people continue to suffer from hunger, and the global community fell short of the stated Millennium Development Goal ambition of halving the proportion of chronically undernourished people between 1990 and 2015 (FAO, IFAD and WFP, 2015). While ending extreme hunger and achieving food security remain central concerns of the SDGs, SDG2 also represents an expansion in scope. The goal now targets the eradication of all forms of malnutrition, taking both undernourishment and nutritional quality into account. It also targets the improvement of agricultural productivity, especially for small-scale producers (target 2.3, UN, 2015), and provides strategic guidance on how to achieve this, assigning particular importance to sustainable food production systems and resilience of agriculture practices (target 2.4, UN, 2015). How societies decide to meet food security and nutrition targets will have direct implications for agriculture-related emissions, and indirect implications through agriculture\u2019s impact on maintaining forests and sustaining terrestrial ecosystem functions (SDG15). While more quantitative understanding of SDG interactions is needed, early results from integrated assessments highlight that single sector policies may harbour considerable policy trade-offs, while a system\u2019s perspective informing policy formulation can help anticipating and minimizing these (Obersteiner et al, 2016; see also von Stechow et al, 2016 on climate and energy related SDGs). For example, Obersteiner et al. (2016) show that for land-use decisions, the interactions between environmental and food security outcomes are more tightly associated with each other than population and economic growth scenarios.1 Furthermore, an emphasis on measures that reduces energy and other consumption demand, generally benefits overall development concerns by freeing up solution space for other SDGs, including on food security and infrastructure (Obersteiner et al., 2016; von Stechow et al., 2016). Alexandratos and Bruinsma (2012) project substantial increases in global food consumption accompanied with structural changes in diets, expecting that by 2050 around 52 per cent (or 4.7 billion people) of the world population will live in countries with a national average of 3000 kilocalories per person per day in comparison to 28 per cent (1.9 billion people) today. How malnourishment\u2014related to both over- and under-consumption\u2014is addressed through agricultural practices, land-use choices and distributional choices will have implications for aligning mitigation efforts with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The choice of policies and measures that integrate productivity demands with an advancement of sustainable agricultural practices will influence the level of emissions from land-use (Valin et al., 2013), as well as the pressure on biodiversity, natural ecosystems, and forests (SDG15). As Section 3.2 showed, almost all 1.5 and 2\u00b0C pathways currently available assume negative emission technologies during the second half of the century. This has consequences for available land-use options and, hence, the ability to achieve other SDGs that depend on the ecosystem goods and services provided by land. Land-use based technologies, such as bioenergy carbon capture and storage, afforestation and reforestation, and biochar are among the most promising negative emission technologies. Depending on the type and scale of negative emission technologies deployed, there may be synergies or trade-offs with land demand for food security and environmental conservation targets. For example, soil carbon sequestration and biochar applications can be applied on existing agricultural lands, do not require specific land-use changes, and are also considered to have beneficial impacts on soil nutrients and land productivity, while having negligible impacts on water-use and albedo (Smith, 2016). By contrast, increased deployment of bioenergy carbon capture and storage, as well as afforestation and reforestation activities, may require land-use changes. Locally, their deployment may conflict with certain means to achieve food security targets, and vice versa (Hasegawa et al., 2015). 1 The existing literature on the food-energy-water-environment nexus offers further insights on policies and practices aimed at managing interactions in the land-use space (Biggs et al., 2015; Howells et al., 2013; Ringler et al., 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24381767-15a9-4d2a-9ca8-ee6bb333c368": {"__data__": {"id_": "24381767-15a9-4d2a-9ca8-ee6bb333c368", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3a699abac8be0ced4642e0e95ffad411c404a2e4cd229601e9ecc70a58ac516"}, "2": {"node_id": "7782860b-bdca-4799-a674-7c6ef4881786", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b25605646b36e28e96ef35d18e90f82f54023f972751b336e2c92ccd2e512d4"}}, "hash": "d419f99d38b252fe7c25540e23cf38fc3ebb85b83887ae4478be97065062b64a", "text": "44 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation The supply-side mitigation options focusing on changes in technologies and practices in the land-use context, discussed above, may support or compete with food security.

The multiple objectives in the land-use context need to be carefully integrated, taking into account development needs, livelihood security and environmental sustainability. Sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems (SDG15): Path-alignment SDG15 on sustainable management of terrestrial ecosystems emphasizes reversing and halting trends in forest loss, land degradation and biodiversity (UN, 2015). The advancement of the specific targets of the goal are well aligned with enabling progress towards the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Target 15.2 stipulates that by 2020 deforestation should be stopped, and accompanied by restoration of degraded forests and an increase in the global area under afforestation or reforestation. Target 15.2 is unusual in aiming for completion of the target a decade earlier than most SDGs. Its timely achievement will be critical for the SDG on climate change, in light of the important role that forests play as stores of terrestrial carbon (Smith et al., 2014; UNEP, 2015), and the importance of early action outlined in Chapters 2 and 3 of this report. While well aligned with mitigation objectives, SDG15 also leaves some challenges to be resolved. The target implies zero deforestation on a global scale, but does not specify whether this is achieved by conservation of existing forest stocks, or by achieving zero \u201cnet\u201d deforestation through offsetting afforestation and reforestation. The world community is called upon to realize a \u201csubstantial increase afforestation and reforestation globally\u201d (see target 15.2, UN, 2015). However, it is not specified what a \u201csubstantial\u201d increase means, and the extent to which there is a differentiation between primary and secondary forest is similarly unclear. Target 15.5 is focused on reducing the degradation of natural habitats, halting the loss of biodiversity and, by 2020, protecting and preventing the extinction of threatened species (UN, 2015). While there are regional differences, there is generally a strong association between natural forests and high levels of biodiversity and carbon stocks (Strassburg et al., 2010). This makes achievement of target 15.5 further the goal of avoiding emissions related to land-use conversion from forest stocks. However, SDG15 also illustrates that targets need to be considered collectively: while high- biodiversity forest protection may help achieve SDG13, a focus on forest cover and afforestation for mitigation value, alone, may overlook important biodiversity considerations. 6.3.2 Implications of SDGs for energy-related emissions Energy-related emissions are responsible for just over three- quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2014a; also see Chapter 2). Energy is also critical for development. In addition to SDG7 on energy, a number of other goals have substantial energy and, therefore, climate change mitigation implications. In particular, these include SDG8 on growth and employment, SDG9 on infrastructure, industrialization, and innovation, SDG11 on sustainable cities, and SDG12 on sustainable consumption and production. The following sections look at where energy-intensive SDGs are path- aligned or path-contingent with climate change mitigation objectives. Universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy (SDG7): Path-alignment SDG7 comprises a universal access target, a renewable energy target and an energy efficiency target (see also Chapter 5). Given the importance of energy to climate change, SDG7 is closely interdependent with the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Target 7.1 aims to achieve universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030. One in six people lack access to modern electricity services, and two in five lack access to modern cooking services (IEA and World Bank, 2015). Although delivering basic access to energy for poor people\u2014defined for electricity as 250 kilowatt hours annually for rural households, and 500 kilowatt hours annually for urban households\u2014will result in an increase in energy consumption by people currently living below the poverty line, achieving the target will not have material implications for global emissions. Flat economies of scale for renewable energy (unit costs change relatively little for installations below a few megawatts) means that they are effective at delivering electricity services with small, off-grid or distributed installations appropriate to the rural areas where most of those lacking access today live. This flexibility, along with the rapid decline in costs, has made sustainable distributed energy open a tremendous opportunity to achieve universal access, even before 2030 (Power for All, 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86f9340e-2b7e-4255-bf2e-f4544a7e4aaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "86f9340e-2b7e-4255-bf2e-f4544a7e4aaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7ff9ff5aa0725ef0fe89cbb1dad9a620c836e011f9bbee222bc444a08caabac"}, "2": {"node_id": "37b6fa5d-d973-4599-96da-6fffe2246b9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f3afe90729489123ec979aa21775dc57675bb98d6736daaa9d8b9a6a2f1f942"}}, "hash": "086aef34e909ddc9ecc27df44de0b8b2aa238cf9f72feb72d478068f70e2abf4", "text": "Aggressive strategies for universal electricity access are climate compatible, since they require much greater investment in the diffusion of flexible, easily distributed, and predominantly renewable energy technologies, like mini- hydro, solar-pv, and solar-diesel hybrids (IEA, 2011; Szab\u00f3 et al., 2011).

This, of course, does not capture the broader energy demands associated with development across the full range of SDGs. Most projected growth in energy demand is driven by consumption from wealthier income groups, and for industrial and commercial uses in emerging economies. In 1990, consumption in high-income countries accounted for 63 per cent of the world\u2019s total primary energy supply. By 2014 this share had fallen to 48 per cent, while the share of upper middle-income countries had risen to 34 per cent (IEA and the World Bank, 2015). According to the International Energy Agency\u2019s New Policies Scenario, by 2040, energy consumption in Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries will be three per cent lower than it is today\u2014all of the growth in demand is in non-OECD countries (IEA, 2015a; also see Section 3.4 and Chapter 5). However, per capita energy consumption in these countries will still be less than half the OECD average. The energy consumption of this cohort of middle-income countries, and the growing middle class and industries within them, will be very important for meeting climate targets. In this context, the transformation of the energy sector toward low-carbon and renewable supply will also be critical, as will improvements in energy efficiency that dampen demand growth for the same or better energy services. Targets 7.2 and 7.3 aim at the material increase of renewable energy and energy efficiency, respectively. Both avenues to mitigation have been identified by the IPCC as critical for the energy sector (IPCC, 2014b). Therefore, achieving these goals is entirely aligned with, albeit not alone sufficient for, the transformation of the energy system necessary for achieving the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Target 7.2 does not specify a measureable objective, but most countries have adopted the objective of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative, launched in 2011 and supported by most governments. It aims to double the proportion of renewables in the global energy mix, between 2010 and 2030 (IEA and World Bank, 2015). Although generation capacity, globally, is still dominated by incumbent high-carbon technologies, the use of low-carbon energy is growing rapidly. Renewables accounted for about half of new power generation capacity in 2014 (Frankfurt School- UNEP Centre and BNEF, 2016); over half (53.6 per cent) of the capacity installed in 2015 was in renewables (BNEF, 2016). In 2014, 85 per cent of the increase in power generated was from renewables (IEA, 2015a). Sustainable Energy for All estimates that between 2010 and 2012, the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption globally increased from 17.8 per cent to 18.1 per cent. However, this rate of increase is well below what will be required to achieve the Sustainable Energy for All target, which is equivalent to a renewables share of 36 per cent (IEA and the World Bank, 2015). Only eight of the 20 largest energy- consuming countries increased their renewables share between 2010 and 2012 (IEA and the World Bank, 2015). Comparing projections to 2030, the International Renewable Energy Agency concluded that, \u201ceven ambitious scenarios aimed to drastically mitigate emissions and climate change leave significant gaps if compared to the Sustainable Energy for All objectives\u201d (IRENA, 2013). The SDG energy efficiency target (7.2) implies a 2.6 per cent annual rate of reduction in energy intensity (IEA and World Bank, 2015). According to the International Energy Agency, energy intensity globally reduced by 2.3 per cent in 2014, which was more than double the average over the previous decade (IEA, 2015b). To drive higher rates of improvement in energy efficiency, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate recommend the convergence across countries of the current best energy efficiency standards for appliances, transport, buildings and industry (Bishop, 2015).

For developed countries, the rate at which they can decouple their economic output from emissions will be critical to meeting SDG8, together with SDG13. The energy intensity of economic growth must decline by four to 10 per cent per year between now and 2050 (Loftus et al., 2015). For low- and middle-income economies, the industrialization and urbanization associated with economic transformation have generally been linked with increases in emissions, primarily via increases in energy consumption and intensity. Declines in emissions associated with industrialization and urbanization tend to be related to high-income countries (Li and Lin, 2015). The difference between these two effects has been attributed to the energy implications of durable infrastructure development and structural changes to less energy-intensive sectors (Li and Lin, 2015). This, in turn, leads to the path-contingent implications of infrastructure targets. Development of low-carbon infrastructure is regarded as critical to most mitigation scenarios, and yet infrastructure development is most closely associated with increased emissions, as countries have historically developed. The mitigation challenge for infrastructure is that it will need to meet both demand growth and the replacement of legacy high-carbon infrastructure stocks at an accelerated pace (Granoff et al., forthcoming). This challenge occurs in the context of a global infrastructure gap, with infrastructure falling short of optimal levels by 70 per cent (IMF, 2014). Most governments face political hurdles to allocating sufficient resources \u2013 by raising revenue or financing \u2013 to meet infrastructure needs, while poor countries face an inadequate tax base and little ability to raise debt. 46 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation Evidence, however, suggests that future economic growth, underpinned by urbanization, industrialization and associated infrastructure development, is enhanced by low- carbon pathways (New Climate Economy, 2014). Historic patterns have occurred in a context of vastly different technological options. Consider, for example, the limited availability of low-carbon technologies at the time of France\u2019s rapid decarbonisation, compared to the wider range of available technologies today. Further, close analysis of the relationship between urbanization and industrialization show the potential for each to be associated with either increases or declines in energy intensity (Sadorsky, 2013). Further progress with respect to the energy goal (SDG7), by improving low-carbon energy supply and diminishing energy intensity through efficiency measures, would expand the \u201coperating space\u201d for progress on growth and employment (SDG8) and infrastructure, industrialization and innovation (SDG9) in a manner more compatible with achieving the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Likewise, though, the alignment of SDG8 and SDG9 with climate goals is contingent on the emissions intensity of energy consumption implicit within those goals. Sustainable cities and consumption and produc tion (SDG11 and SDG12): Path-alignment SDG11 addresses issues central to any long-term mitigation strategies, focusing on affordable housing, universal access to public transport, reducing the per capita environmental impact of cities, and providing access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green and public spaces. SDG12 on sustainable consumption and production is similarly path-aligned with the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement through a focus on improving the resource-use efficiency of production, reducing pollution and promoting more sustainable consumption patterns. Not only will achievement of these targets reduce emissions, but also further the scope for alignment between agricultural production, industrialization, and economic growth under SDGs 2, 8 and 9, respectively. The two goals are inextricably interlinked. SDGs 11 and 12 aim to address demand-side emission reductions by transforming the way people live, and how they produce and consume. Cities and human settlements are critical to emissions reductions, as well as to adaptation and building resilience to climate impacts. Cities consume 60\u201370 per cent of the world\u2019s energy supply, and account for 70\u201380 per cent of total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions due to energy generation, transport, industry, and biomass use (Tsay and Herrmann, 2013). In 2014, the commitments made by 228 global cities (representing 436 million people) were estimated to result in cumulative emissions reductions of 6.1 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalents (GtCO2e) by 2030 and 13 GtCO2e by 20502 (ARUP and C40 Cities, 2014; see also Chapter 4).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0e5e2a3-8900-450e-85e3-22c0f5e2d4be": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0e5e2a3-8900-450e-85e3-22c0f5e2d4be", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2016", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33532b5f740436fb5d988689e78e5a293c7c481711cf2055bae8fe51f1abcccc"}, "2": {"node_id": "74c03d13-8908-486f-b2ad-896ad294ef2e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2016", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9457cabc22095e839b24d1950bcc2e733c879acf6a8e9a80ae2e1e9a17a65704"}}, "hash": "8442df42a97cd09e4802ac836751cba5c1ddaf18d763fb332df06caae7bb431d", "text": "Harnessing these commitments will be crucial to achieving the mitigation goals of the 2 This corresponds to annual emission reductions of 0.402 GtCO2e/year in 2030 and 0.43 GtCO2e/year in 2050 as reported in Chapter 4.

The World Energy Council warns that, without strong global action, car ownership worldwide is on track to more than double, to over two billion vehicles by 2050, with a correlated increase in the demand for diesel and fuel oil of up to 200 per cent (World Energy Council, 2011). According to the Paris Process of Mobility and Climate (2015) nearly three-quarters of countries prioritize the transport sector and 61 per cent include transport sector specific mitigation measures in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) under the Paris Agreement. SDG11 comprises 10 targets, of which nine are well aligned with the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. Seven of them are drafted with express attention to sustainability and efficiency considerations, while two of the remaining address disasters and impacts on cultural and natural heritage sites. Of the 10 targets, only one relating to ensuring universal access to housing and basic services has the potential for material climate implications without making specific reference to sustainability considerations. The challenge for achieving this and other targets relating to universal and inclusive access to housing, sustainable urbanization and safe green and public spaces in a manner that is path-aligned with SDG is to reconcile the short-term demand with longer-term sustainability requirements. Governments must adopt approaches that support the construction of homes and urban spaces using green building techniques in suitable locations that also provide a range of transportation choices to avoid undermining the achievement of other targets under SDG11. Implementation of the targets under SDG11 must be undertaken holistically to avoid perverse outcomes, such as building affordable homes in areas vulnerable to climate impacts like rising seas or extreme weather events, or in dispersed housing development lots. Transforming consumption and production patterns under SDG12 is also a core component of the goal under the Paris Agreement to reach net zero emissions in the second half of this century (Article 4, UNFCCC, 2015). According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the energy used for the global production, harvesting, transporting and packaging of wasted food generates 4.4 GtCO2e annually, or about eight per cent of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (FAO, 2016). This means that the contribution of food wastage emissions to global emissions is almost equivalent to that of global road transport (IPCC, 2014a), which emphasizes the central importance of both SDG11 and SDG12 to achieving the mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. The final target under SDG12 addresses the market distortions that prevent a shift to sustainable patterns of consumption and production, and calls for rationalizing inefficient fossil fuel subsidies (target 12.c, UN, 2015). In 47 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 Bridging the gap \u2013 the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change mitigation 2015, around 13 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions were from subsidized fossil fuels (IEA, 2015b). The International Energy Agency estimates that this provides an average incentive to emit CO2 of US$115 per tonne of CO2. According to the IEA (2015b) efforts have been made in developing countries to reduce consumption subsidies, and in developed countries to reduce producer subsidies for investment in fossil fuel extraction. Fossil fuel subsidies remain a significant impediment to sustainable development and climate change mitigation. 6.4 Summing up This chapter has outlined how selected SDGs and associated targets are aligned, while others potentially conflict with the climate change mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement. For SDGs that are path-contingent, there is often general or even specific knowledge of the \u201cdos\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d of particular policies and practices that can help to minimize trade-offs and maximize synergies between different interests. Previous United Nations Environment (UNEP) Emissions Gap Reports have discussed such best practices for a number of key sectors and issues including agriculture, buildings, energy, forestry, and transport (UNEP 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015). The need for an integrated approach to the sustainable development and the realization of the SDGs is nowhere more relevant than in the context of climate change. The potential to meet the long-term temperature objective of the Paris Agreement rests within the framework that the SDGs provide. Equally, the potential to achieve the SDGs rests with our ability to address the climate change mitigation challenge. 48 The Emissions Gap Report 2016 \u2013 References 48 References Chapter 1 UNEP (2015) The Emissions Gap Report 2015: A UNEP Synthesis Report.

Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Glossary Glossary This glossary is compiled according to the Lead Authors of the report drawing on glossaries and other resources available on the websites of the following organizations, networks and projects: Center for International Forestry Research, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action, United Nations Environment Programme, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and World Resources Institute. Adaptation: The process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. Additionality: A criterion sometimes applied to projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions. It stipulates that the emission reductions accomplished by the project must not have happened anyway had the project not taken place. Afforestation: Planting of new forests on lands that historically have not contained forests. Agriculture, forestry and other land use: AFOLU plays a central role for food security and sustainable development. The main mitigation options within AFOLU involve one or more of three strategies: prevention of emissions to the atmosphere by conserving existing carbon pools in soils or vegetation or by reducing emissions of methane and nitrous oxide; sequestration\u2014increasing the size of existing carbon pools and thereby extracting carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere; and substitution\u2014substituting biological products for fossil fuels or energy-intensive products, thereby reducing CO2 emissions. Demand-side measures (for example, reducing losses and wastes of food, changes in human diet, or changes in wood consumption) may also play a role.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cadb8a75-e3ba-4b99-88cd-6998b6ab4ca6": {"__data__": {"id_": "cadb8a75-e3ba-4b99-88cd-6998b6ab4ca6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd7009fe4e2bc09a326a54a1bff895781e96335965a4dd149bc0d49cbe1d9343"}, "2": {"node_id": "e37abc37-5a0b-413c-b586-945d536e8d51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed31ecde901ed42b5332fffe2891fb8b057141c9dc084df45a4fbab1b3eec71f"}}, "hash": "63ecc95a27050d843fcbbf15dfab0bed66ebd391fe470dfbc7417ddf4a08b505", "text": "FOLU (Forestry and Other Land Use)\u2014also referred to as LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry)\u2014is the subset of AFOLU emissions and removals of GHGs resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change, and forestry activities excluding agricultural emissions. Annex I Parties: The industrialized countries listed in Annex I to the Convention, which committed to returning their GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000 as per Article 4.2(a) and (b). They have also accepted emission targets for the period 2008-12 as per Article 3 and Annex B of the Kyoto Protocol. They include the 24 original OECD members, the European Union, and 14 countries with economies in transition (Croatia, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Slovenia joined Annex I at COP 3, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia replaced Czechoslovakia). See also Non-Annex I Parties. Annex II Parties: The countries listed in Annex II to the Convention which have a special obligation to provide financial resources and facilitate technology transfer to developing countries.

Baseline scenarios are not intended to be predictions of the future, but rather counterfactual constructions that can serve to highlight the level of emissions that would occur without further policy effort. Typically, baseline scenarios are then compared to mitigation scenarios that are constructed to meet different goals for GHG emissions, atmospheric concentrations or temperature change. The term \u2018baseline scenario\u2019 is used interchangeably with \u2018reference scenario\u2019 and \u2018no policy scenario\u2019. In much of the literature the term is also synonymous with the term \u2018business-as-usual (BAU) scenario\u2019, although the term \u2018BAU\u2019 has fallen out of favour because the idea of \u2018business-as-usual\u2019 in century-long socioeconomic projections is hard to fathom. Biomass: The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume, including products, by-products, and waste of biological origin (plants or animal matter) and excluding material embedded in geological formations and transformed to fossil fuels or peat. viii viii The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Glossary Biomass plus carbon capture and storage (BioCCS or BECCS): Use of energy produced from biomass where the combustion gases are then captured and stored underground or used, for example, in industrial processes. It excludes gases generated through, for example, a fermentation process (as opposed to combustion). Black carbon: The substance formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass, which is emitted in both anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. It consists of pure carbon in several linked forms. Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing albedo \u2013 the ability to reflect sunlight \u2013 when deposited on snow and ice. Bottom-up model: In the context of this assessment, a model that represents a system by looking at its detailed underlying parts. Compared to so-called top-down models, which focus on economic interlinkages, bottom-up models of energy use and emissions can provide greater resolution with regards to sectors or mitigation technologies. Business-as-usual: A scenario that describes future GHG emission levels in the absence of additional mitigation efforts and policies (with respect to an agreed set). In the 2014 EGR (page 5, para 2), BAU scenarios were based on an extrapolation of current economic, social and technological trends. They only took into account climate policies implemented up to around 2005-10 (that is, more recent country pledges and policies were not considered) and therefore served as a reference point for what would happen to emissions if planned climate mitigation policies were not implemented. See Baseline/reference. Bunker fuels: A term used to refer to fuels consumed for international marine and air transport. Cancun pledge: During 2010, many countries submitted their existing plans for controlling GHG emissions to the Climate Change Secretariat and these proposals were formally acknowledged under the UNFCCC. Developed countries presented their plans in the shape of economy-wide targets to reduce emissions, mainly up to 2020, while developing countries proposed ways to limit their growth of emissions in the shape of plans of action. Carbon credits: An entitlement allocated by a government to a legal entity (company or other type of emitter) to emit a specified amount of a substance. These entitlements, which may be transferrable and tradable, can be used to reduce emissions of GHGs (by giving them a monetary value) or can be used for accounting of emissions. Carbon dioxide emission budget: For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted to stay within that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a GHG emission trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. Carbon dioxide equivalent: A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of GHGs, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, GHG emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of GHG listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents assuming a 100-year global warming potential.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac534fff-3950-4858-bd4f-d770e4cadc5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac534fff-3950-4858-bd4f-d770e4cadc5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "410c3b8d293aafd8317c566b6ce85dd73435893f09c1bdc0efce0c79dffa88c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "629af2b2-d442-43f9-950c-67990edf51fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e32b8f10eb3651c58bdbfbf895917546e282d5cff54f02993483c27b617c9108"}}, "hash": "2f689feb6f05ee27c18dc254519d10c66fd4c05b51678e01822040d83f7a9aad", "text": "Carbon intensity: The amount of emissions of carbon dioxide released per unit of another variable such as gross domestic product (GDP), output energy use or transport.

The term comes from the fact that CO2 is the predominant GHG, and other gases are measured in units called \u2018CO2 equivalents\u2019. Carbon offset: See Offset. Carbon price: The price for avoided or released CO2 or CO2-equivalent emissions. This may refer to the rate of a carbon tax or the price of emission permits. In many models that are used to assess the economic costs of mitigation, carbon prices are used as a proxy to represent the level of effort in mitigation policies. Carbon sequestration: The process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir. Carbon sink: A pool (reservoir) that removes carbon from the active part of the carbon cycle. Carbon stock: The quantity of carbon contained in a carbon pool. Carbon tax: A levy on the carbon content of fossil fuels. Because virtually all of the carbon in fossil fuels is ultimately emitted as carbon dioxide, a carbon tax is equivalent to an emission tax on CO2 emissions. Co-benefits: The positive effects that a policy or measure aimed at one objective might have on other objectives, without yet evaluating the net effect on overall social welfare. Co-benefits are often subject to uncertainty and depend on, among others, local circumstances and implementation practices. Co-benefits are often referred to as ancillary benefits. Conditional INDCs: INDCs proposed by some countries that are contingent on a range of possible conditions, such as the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors. ixix The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Glossary Conference of the Parties (COP): The supreme body of the Convention. It currently meets once a year to review the Convention\u2019s progress. Current policy trajectory: This trajectory is based on estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches including policies at least through 2012. Estimates may be based on either official data or independent analysis. Decarbonization: The process by which countries or other entities aim to achieve a low-carbon economy, or by which individuals aim to reduce their carbon consumption. Deforestation: The direct human-induced conversion of forested land to non-forested land (Marrakesh Accords). The conversion of forest to another land use or the long-term reduction of the tree canopy cover below the minimum 10 per cent threshold. Degradation (forest): Changes within the forest that negatively affect the structure or function of the forest stand or site, and thereby lower its capacity to supply products and services. Delayed-action scenarios: See Later-action scenarios. Double counting: In the context of this assessment, double counting refers to a situation in which the same emission reductions are counted towards meeting two countries\u2019 pledges. Emissions gap: The difference between the GHG emission levels consistent with having a likely chance (>66 per cent) of limiting the mean global temperature rise to below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 above pre-industrial levels and the GHG emission levels consistent with the global effect of the INDCs, assuming full implementation from 2020. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual GHG emissions over time. Forest: Land spanning more than 0.5 ha with trees higher than 5 m and a canopy cover of more than 10 per cent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. Forest landscape restoration: A process which aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human wellbeing in deforested or degraded forest landscapes to meet present and future needs and accommodate multiple uses over time. Global warming potential: An index representing the combined effect of the differing times GHGs remain in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in absorbing outgoing infrared radiation. Greenhouse gases (GHGs): The atmospheric gases responsible for causing global warming and climatic change. The major GHGs are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Less prevalent, but very powerful, GHGs are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a253bef0-57fa-4c92-af68-2d669824763c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a253bef0-57fa-4c92-af68-2d669824763c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e45bfdf41b0c43352a20c691ef99d9d933527389dc1e7a00c8b6e2e31167b9ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "af772a9b-ee48-4789-bdb6-b3bdfd0eddd5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9e7afe09a30674fe9b0a2ca76966823a38479823c79e3754c9bc46fb77c4696"}}, "hash": "d7bcdd9e1016bb25f88064c3b4f7a19521b1cb614ca014044f92fc70f6350534", "text": "Grid parity: This occurs when an alternative energy source can generate power at a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) that is less than or equal to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid.

GDP is calculated without deducting for depreciation of fabricated assets or depletion and degradation of natural resources. \u2018Hot air\u2019: Refers to the concern that some governments will be able to meet their targets for GHG emissions under any formal agreement with minimal effort and could then flood the market with emission credits, reducing the incentive for other countries to cut their own domestic emissions. Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of GHGs to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socio-economic and biophysical processes. Intended nationally determined contribution (INDC): Submissions by Parties which identify actions each national government intends to take under the future UNFCCC climate agreement, due to be negotiated in Paris in December 2015. INDCs are, in effect, the basis of post-2020 global emission reduction commitments that will be included in the future climate agreement. International cooperative initiatives (ICIs): Initiatives outside the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at reducing emissions of climate forcers by, for example, promoting actions that are less GHG intensive, compared to prevailing alternatives. Cooperative initiatives also involve national and sub-national partners (they are often referred to as, simply, \u2018cooperative initiatives\u2019). Kyoto Protocol: An international agreement, standing on its own, and requiring separate ratification by governments, but linked to the UNFCCC. The Kyoto Protocol, among other things, sets binding targets for the reduction of GHG emissions by industrialized countries. Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): A GHG inventory sector that covers emissions and removals of GHGs resulting from direct human-induced land use, land-use change and forestry activities. Later-action scenarios: Climate change mitigation scenarios in which emission levels in the near term, typically up to 2020 or 2030, are higher than those in the corresponding least-cost scenarios. Leakage: That portion of cuts in GHG emissions by developed countries \u2013 countries trying to meet mandatory limits under x The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Glossary the Kyoto Protocol \u2013 that may reappear in other countries not bound by such limits. For example, multinational corporations may shift factories from developed to developing countries to escape restrictions on emissions. Least-cost scenarios: Climate change mitigation scenarios assuming that emission reductions start immediately after the model base year, and are distributed optimally over time, sectors and regions, such that aggregate costs of reaching the climate target are minimized. Likely chance: A likelihood greater than 66 per cent chance. Used in this assessment to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Lock-in: Lock-in occurs when a market is stuck with a standard even though participants would be better off with an alternative. Medium chance: A likelihood of 50\u201366 per cent chance. Used in this report to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Mitigation: In the context of climate change, a human intervention to reduce the sources, or enhance the sinks of GHGs. Examples include using fossil fuels more efficiently for industrial processes or electricity generation, switching to solar energy or wind power, improving the insulation of buildings and expanding forests and other \u2018sinks\u2019 to remove greater amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. Monitoring, reporting and verification: A process/concept that potentially supports greater transparency in the climate change regime. Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in order to reduce their abundance in the atmosphere, and thereby protect the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. Mosaic restoration: This integrates trees into mixed-use landscapes, such as agricultural lands and settlements, where trees can support people through improved water quality, increased soil fertility, and other ecosystem services. This type of restoration is more likely in deforested or degraded forest landscapes with moderate population density (10-100 people/km2). Net negative emissions: A situation of net negative emissions is achieved when, as a result of human activities, more GHGs are sequestered or stored than are released into the atmosphere. No-policy scenario: See Baseline/reference.

Offset (in climate policy): A unit of CO2-equivalent emissions that is reduced, avoided, or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. Party: A state (or regional economic integration organization such as the EU) that agrees to be bound by a treaty and for which the treaty has entered into force. Pledge case: This case identifies the maximum level of GHG emissions that each country or Party could emit in 2020 and still meet its pledge \u2013 without considering the use of offsets. Readiness: REDD+ country actions \u2013 including capacity building, policy design, consultation and consensus building, and testing and evaluation of a REDD+ national strategy \u2013 that are taken prior to the comprehensive implementation of REDD+. REDD+: Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries. Reference scenario: See Baseline/reference. Reforestation: Planting of forests on lands that have previously contained forests but that have been converted to some other use. Rehabilitation (forest): Restoration of the capacity of degraded forest land to deliver forest products and services. Forest rehabilitation re-establishes the original productivity of the forest and some, but not necessarily all, of the plant and animal species thought to be originally present at a site. Restoration forest: Restoration of a degraded forest to its original state \u2013 that is, to re-establish the presumed structure, productivity and species diversity of the forest originally present at a site. Results-based payments: Payments for fully measured, reported and verified emission reductions (or removals), also conditional upon the country having a national strategy/action plan for REDD+, a national forest monitoring system, national forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level, a safeguard information system and a summary of information on how safeguards have been addressed and respected. Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on \u2018if-then\u2019 propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables. Sink: Any process, activity or mechanism which removes a GHG, an aerosol or a precursor of a GHG from the xixi The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Glossary atmosphere. Forests and other vegetation are considered sinks because they remove CO2 through photosynthesis. Source: Any process, activity or mechanism that releases a GHG, an aerosol or a precursor of a GHG or aerosol into the atmosphere. Sustainable development: Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Technology transfer: A broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change among different stakeholders. Temperature overshoot: An emission pathway that temporarily exceeds target temperature limits (2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C) before falling below the limits again by 2100 with a given percentage chance. Tipping point: A level of change in system properties beyond which a system reorganizes, often abruptly, and does not return to the initial state even if the drivers of the change are abated. For the climate system, it refers to a critical threshold when global or regional climate changes from one stable state to another stable state. The tipping point event may be irreversible. Top-down model: A model that applies macroeconomic theory, econometric and/or optimization techniques to aggregate economic variables. Using historical data on consumption, prices, incomes, and factor costs, top- down models assess demand and emissions for goods and services from main sectors, such as energy conversion, transportation, buildings, agriculture and industry. Transient climate response: Measure of the temperature rise that occurs at the time of a doubling of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions: Measure of temperature rise per unit of cumulative carbon emissions. Uncertainty: A cognitive state of incomplete knowledge that can result from a lack of information or from disagreement about what is known or even knowable. It may have many types of sources, from imprecision in the data to ambiguously defined concepts or terminology, or uncertain projections of human behaviour. Uncertainty can therefore be represented by quantitative measures (for example a probability density function) or by qualitative statements (for example reflecting the judgement of a team of experts).

It compares the 2030 emission levels that would result from these commitments with what science tells us would keep average temperature increases on track to stay below 2\u00b0C by the end of the century; it provides data for an aspirational target of keeping that increase below 1.5\u00b0C; and it evaluates the INDCs in relation to progress on the 2020 pledges made in Cancun. The INDCs demonstrate a significant increase in ambition and their successful delivery could reduce emissions by around 25 per cent compared to the level expected from current policies and pledges. However, this would still put long-term temperatures on track for an increase and lead to serious climate impact, so more action is required. Therefore, the Emissions Gap Report also explores how available financial, technical and capacity building solutions can be scaled up, or even accelerated, to close the gap between the expected and required levels of emissions. This includes detailed assessments that look beyond the INDCs to identify the further gains being identified by the International Cooperative Initiatives and by Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). With many new emission reduction initiatives also generating substantial economic, social and environmental benefits, the INDC preparation process in most countries encouraged greater exploration of the links between development and climate. This is an important first step in a possible transition towards more low carbon economies. The Emissions Gap Report makes it very clear that while reaching a meaningful global agreement in Paris is essential, it is not the end of the climate change story: it is a stepping stone on a much longer journey that requires us to stay alert to the science and remain dynamic in our response. The world has already tripled the expected performance on scaling up clean energy and been able to start reversing damage to the ozone layer. I firmly believe that if we act on the findings of this report, there is nothing to stop us closing the emissions gap and creating a more inclusive and sustainable future for both the developed and the developing world. xv xv The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Executive summary Executive Summary The year 2015 has the potential to become a turning point in global efforts to transform the prevailing social and economic development paradigm into a more sustainable one. The global community reached agreement in September 2015 on a set of 17 sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030, including climate change. Countries will meet again at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris with the aim of establishing a new global agreement on climate change, hereafter the \u2018Paris Agreement\u2019, with the ambition of limiting changes in global temperatures to below 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C warming in 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. The Paris Agreement will also aim to establish a framework to provide technological and financial support for developing countries to accelerate the transition towards low carbon and climate resilient development paths. The architecture of a new climate agreement has many facets with an array of issues under negotiation that have become significantly more complex since the Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 1994. The core structure of the Paris Agreement will comprise the \u201cIntended Nationally Determined Contributions\u201d (INDCs) as well as the process by which implementation of the agreement will proceed over time to advance the objectives of the UNFCCC. In addition, a number of key decisions will be required covering issues like adaptation, finance, technology, and capacity building. 1. What is covered in the 2015 Emissions Gap Report? This sixth UNEP Emissions Gap Report provides a scientific assessment of the mitigation contributions from the submitted INDCs. As in the previous reports, it then compares the resulting emission levels in 2030 with what science tells us is required to be on track towards the agreed target of a global average temperature increase below 2\u00b0C by 2100. The Report also provides data for the aspirational target of keeping the temperature increase below 1.5\u00b0C.

This year the detailed assessment is on possible mitigation contributions from International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) and enhanced forest-related mitigation activities with a focus on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). By 1 October 2015, a total of 119 INDCs had been submitted to the UNFCCC. Fifteen INDCs included only mitigation, while most included both adaptation and mitigation components. The report only presents qualitative information about the adaptation component of the INDCs submitted. The report has been prepared by an international team of leading scientists assessing all available information, including that reviewed by the IPCC in its fifth assessment report, as well as more recent scientific studies. The assessment production process has been transparent and participatory. The assessment methodology and preliminary findings were made available to governments and stakeholders concerned xvi xvi The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Executive summary during relevant international fora as well as on the UNEP Live website. The governments of the countries with specific mention in the report have been invited to comment on the assessment findings. 2. What are current emissions and what emission levels in 2030 are consistent with the 2\u00b0C and the 1.5\u00b0C targets? Over the past decades global GHG emissions have been increasing steadily, with small variations around a longer- term trend. The most recent global emission estimates1 are available for the year 2014. In that year, total global Kyoto-GHG emissions2 amounted to about 52.7 GtCO2e (range: 47.9-57.5). Global carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil-fuel and industry were estimated at 35.5 GtCO2 for 2014 (range: 32.5-38.5). Staying below 2\u00b0C temperature rise implies that CO2 emissions are reduced to net zero by 2060-2075. The IPCC in its fifth assessment report concluded that to limit global warming to below 2\u00b0C, the remaining cumulative CO2 emissions \u2013 the so-called carbon budget \u2013 are in the order of 1 000 GtCO2. This remaining budget can be utilized in different ways, but given the most recent assessment of current trends, net global carbon emissions will eventually need to be reduced to zero between 2060 and 20753. For a detailed discussion of the carbon budget, see the 2014 Emissions Gap Report. ____________________ 1 Data for 2014 are available from EDGAR and PRIMAP, see Chapter 2. 2 The six greenhouse gases covered by the UNFCCC/Kyoto Protocol \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride.

What are the implications of the scenarios that are consistent with the temperature goals? The scenarios used in this Report as reference for meeting the 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C goals are all characterized by modest emissions reductions compared to current policies until 20205 that are in line with the ambition of Cancun pledges. This implies a need for deep and stringent emission reductions over later decades. Enhanced action before 2020 that would bring emission levels below the projected 2020 Cancun pledge level would ease the challenge and reduce overall cost of transitioning to least-cost pathways after 2020. It should be noted that in order to move to such pathways after 2020, the necessary policies and investment will need to be prepared well in advance. The assessment of the pathways and target levels point at three key issues that have also been raised in previous gap reports: \u2022 All scenarios analyzing 2\u00b0C pathways that follow the Cancun pledges until 2020 and with a least-cost starting point in 2020, require strong reductions after 2020. They also rely on so-called \u2018negative emission technologies\u2019 such as bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage \u2022 For scenarios analyzing the 1.5\u00b0C target, the reduction rates will need to be steeper \u2022 The feasibility of large scale deployment of negative emission technologies is still a contentious issue. Enhanced early action (such as moving below the 2020 pledges) is associated with the following economic and technological advantages: \u2022 Softening the requirement for very steep emission reductions over the medium term \u2022 Facilitating mitigation in the medium to long term by reducing lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure in the energy system and society as a whole \u2022 Encouraging near-term learning and development of technologies that will be essential in the long term \u2022 Providing early policy signals which are needed for action later in the coming decades \u2022 Reducing the overall costs and economic challenges in terms of, for example, upscaling of energy investments, during the transitional period \u2022 Reducing the dependence on unproven technologies and increase the options society can choose from in terms of means to achieve stringent emission reductions in the long term. Delaying stringent mitigation efforts until 2030 (in other words, not following a least-cost reduction trajectory after 2020) would with high confidence make the transition to longer-term emissions levels in line with the 2\u00b0C goal significantly more difficult. A significant number of models are not able to produce 2\u00b0C scenarios consistent with global emission levels in 2030 above 55 GtCO2e, while other scenarios which delay enhanced mitigation action until after 2030 would imply massive cost increases coupled with a need for unprecedented political action. 4. Are G20 countries making progress on the implementation of 2020 pledges? Among the G20 there are thirteen countries with pledges for 2020 (counting the EU members France, Germany, Italy and UK as one) and three countries without pledges. Six of these are assessed as being on track to meet pledges or extremely close, four are not, and three cannot be assessed, because there is insufficient evidence. Pledges are self-determined. A country being on track does not necessarily mean that it undertakes more stringent action on mitigation than a country that is not on track \u2013 it depends on the ambition of the pledge. The report presents an assessment of progress by G20 countries on the national pledges presented in the context of the Cancun agreement, and referred to here as the Cancun pledges. The assessment compares projected 2020 emissions under three cases: \u2022 Pledge case \u2013 projecting the maximum amount of emissions for 2020 compatible with the pledge \u2022 Current policy trajectory \u2013 official national estimate \u2022 Current policy trajectory \u2013 independent analysis. Despite progress towards implementing policies in line with pledges, it is evident that work remains to be done to bring all G20 countries into pledge attainment. 4 As there are fewer than 10 scenarios available for the 1.5\u00b0C pathways, the 20th to 80th percentile range is not provided. However, the minimum and maximum values are 37 GtCO2e and 40 GtCO2e respectively. 5 Global emissions in 2020 under various pledge cases are estimated to be about 52-54 GtCO2e. The least-cost 2020 scenarios used here have global emissions close to this range (49-56 GtCO2e). xviii xviii The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Executive summary 5.

When conditional INDCs are included as fully implemented, the emissions gap in 2030 is estimated to be 12 GtCO2e (range: 10-15) and 5 GtCO2e (range: 4-8) in 2025. If countries that have not yet submitted an INDC were to reduce their emissions at the same percentage below current policy trajectories as those that have already submitted, the projected global emissions would be further reduced, and the gap narrowed, by a further 0.5 GtCO2e in 2025 and 1 GtCO2e in 2030. Full implementation of unconditional INDC results in emission level estimates in 2030 that are most consistent with scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3.5\u00b0C until 2100 with a greater than 66 per cent chance. INDC estimates do, however, come with uncertainty ranges. When taking this into account the 3.5\u00b0C value could decrease to 3\u00b0C or increase towards 4\u00b0C for the low and high unconditional INDC estimates, respectively. When including the full implementation of conditional INDCs, the emissions level estimates become most consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to <3-3.5\u00b0C by the end of the century with a greater than 66 per cent chance. These numbers essentially tell two stories. Firstly the INDCs do present a real increase in the ambition level compared to a projection of current policies; all global modelling groups that have been assessed reached this conclusion. Secondly the submitted contributions are far from enough and the emissions gap in both 2025 and 2030 will be very significant. The Report presents an assessment of the 119 INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015, covering 146 countries and 85-88 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2012. A final update of the assessment including later submissions will be presented on the UNEP Live website before the start of COP 21. In the absence of agreed formats for reporting on mitigation contributions, including on the units in which those might be expressed, Parties have chosen a wide variety of forms and contributions: for example, targets used include: \u2022 Economy-wide absolute reduction from historical base year emissions \u2022 Emissions reduction relative to a baseline projection for the emissions associated with energy consumption \u2022 Trajectory target for specific sectors or gases \u2022 Specifying a peaking year \u2022 Emissions intensity of GDP \u2022 A fixed level target. This has increased the analytical challenge of ensuring consistency when comparing and aggregating different mitigation contributions. The assessment builds on a combination of global and country-specific modelling studies from independent research teams, and official country- specific data sources. The global emission levels in 2030 consistent with having a likely chance (>66 per cent) of staying below the 2\u00b0C goal in 2100, following a least-cost pathway from 2020 with only modest improvement of the GHG intensity until then, is 42 GtCO2e (range: 31-44). In 2025 this level is 48 GtCO2e (range: 46-50). In comparison, global GHG emissions, based on assessment of the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015, are for the unconditional INDCs projected to be at 54 GtCO2e (range: 53-58) in 2025, and 56 GtCO2e (range: 54-59) in 2030. If conditional INDCs are included, the global emissions projection is 53 GtCO2e (range: 52-56) in 2025 and 54 GtCO2e (range: 52-57) in 2030. The emission levels resulting from submitted INDCs are 4 to 6 GtCO2e lower than the current policy trajectory in 2030 of 60 GtCO2e (range: 58-62). They are 9 to 11 GtCO2e lower than the baseline of 65 GtCO2e (range: 60-70), which is based on IPCC AR5 scenarios and assumes no additional climate policies are put in place after 2010. 6. Can the INDC process become a foundation for enhancing ambition? It is clear from the assessment of the mitigation contributions from the INDCs that much more needs to be done.

What are some of the options for closing the gap? A number of recent global studies conclude that there is a significant potential to reduce global emissions in 2030 \u2013 beyond the reductions resulting from implementation of the INDCs. If this potential is fully exploited, it could bring global emissions to a level very close to bridge the emissions gap in 2030. Furthermore, the studies suggest that this can be done by relying on proven technologies and policies. A number of recent studies and reports, including by the IPCC and leading international research institutions, identifies a significant emissions reduction potential by 2030. Acknowledging that the methodologies, assumptions, scope and coverage of measures considered vary across the assessed studies, they all show that tapping into unused emission reduction potential could narrow the emissions gap in 2030 considerably. Taken together, they indicate that global greenhouse gas emissions could be further reduced by between 5 to 12 GtCO2e/yr (range: 3-13) relative to the emissions level resulting from implementation of the unconditional INDCs, and between 5 to 10 GtCO2e/yr (range: 1-11) relative to the emissions level associated with implementation of the conditional INDCs. These reductions could contribute to the reductions needed to bridge the emissions gap in 2030, which as previously stated is estimated at 14 GtCO2e (range: 12-17) for the unconditional INDC case and at 12 GtCO2e (range: 10-15), if both unconditional and conditional INDCs are implemented. There is considerable uncertainty associated with the possibilities for achieving the emission reduction opportunities put forward in some of these studies. At the same time, the studies assessed do not cover all relevant measures, thematic areas and sectors. In other words the total technical and economic emission reduction potential in 2030 could be larger than indicated in the studies assessed. In comparison the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC indicated a total emission reduction potential in 2030 of 23 GtCO2e (range: 16-31). No update of the total emission reduction potential in 2030 was provided in the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC, but sectoral updates in this report indicate emission reduction potentials in 2030 of the same order of magnitude. The assessed recent studies emphasize the key importance of enhanced energy efficiency with a particular emphasis on industry, buildings and transport, and expanded use of renewable energy technologies for power production combined with increased efficiency of fossil fuel-based power production will all be critical for achievement of the desired large-scale emission reductions. Other key sectors for enhanced mitigation action emphasized in the studies include forestry, agriculture and waste. These are all sectors that have been assessed in earlier UNEP Emissions Gap Reports and where significant opportunities for bridging the gap have been highlighted through possibilities for replication, acceleration and scaling up proven good practices and policies. 8.

The impact of actions by International Cooperative Initiatives can potentially be significant. Preliminary assessments indicate a contribution in the range of 2.5 to 4 GtCO2e in 2020, if fully implemented. Part of this contribution falls within the Cancun pledges while the additional contribution may be in the range of 0.75 to 2 GtCO2e in 2020. Significant attention has been put on mitigation actions by ICIs including actors other than Parties to the UNFCCC. ICIs include a wide variety of activities, which makes consistent and thorough assessment difficult. Nevertheless, an effort has been made to assess all available information and organize it under a simple catalogue of actions categorized by type of constituent engaged. This catalogue serves to focus on those ICIs that have the most impact potential and by disentangling the various initiatives the overlap and double-counting risks with the national pledges can be minimized. The report examines initiatives in three broad categories: \u2022 Cities and regions \u2022 Companies \u2022 Sectors A few examples below illustrate the wide span of ICIs: \u2022 C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group \u2013 is a network of the world\u2019s megacities committed to taking action that reduces global GHG emissions. It has 75 affiliated cities (as of July 2015) and a total of 80 total participants \u2022 The Compact of Mayors - is an agreement by three city networks to undertake a transparent and supportive approach to reduce city-level emissions, and to reduce vulnerability from, and enhance resilience to, climate change, in a consistent and complementary manner to national level climate protection efforts. It builds on ongoing city-level efforts \u2022 Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) - is an alliance of 25 leading companies in the global cement industry created under the auspices of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). Participants commit to developing a climate change mitigation strategy, setting reduction targets for CO2 and reporting annually on their progress. xxi xxi The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Executive summary A number of new studies have examined the major initiatives and this report presents an assessment of these studies and their estimates of the emission reduction potential for each category of initiative. The studies list a number of challenges related to the analyzed ICIs including elements of overlap between initiatives and comparability of transparent monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) of results. It is therefore difficult to assess whether all the international initiatives actually deliver on promises, as most initiatives propose only voluntary commitments and hence make it difficult for accountability and compliance to be enforced and sometimes lack robust Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV). Many initiatives can, however, play important roles to advance climate action, as they: \u2022 Encourage or facilitate emission reductions at the city and regional level, via knowledge sharing, capacity building and technical support for project planning and implementation \u2022 Identify partnerships and support local communities to become climate resilient \u2022 Represent common city-level interests to influence policymakers at other levels \u2022 Help implement climate plans and low-carbon and climate-resilient economic development projects \u2022 Achieve transparency and accountability by encouraging best practice in GHG emission reporting \u2022 Help overcome financial barriers and attract investors and accelerate additional capital flows into cities for low carbon projects. The studies compare the emissions reduction potential for the different categories of initiatives compared to a current trajectory baseline (noting that studies are not necessarily using same baseline approaches). Even if uncertainties are quite large, it is interesting that results are quite comparable at the aggregate level, even if the assessment of the different groups of initiatives varies significantly. The assessment notes that the impact of non-state climate commitments can be significant, most likely in the range between 2.5 and 4 GtCO2e in 2020 (taking into account that not all initiatives are included in all assessments). These numbers include an estimate of overlaps between the various initiatives, in terms of actual actions, sectors, greenhouse gases and regions. It is harder to estimate the overlap between these non- state initiatives and government emission reduction pledges for 2020. The recent studies examined in this assessment suggest that the overlap ranges between 33 and 70 per cent, resulting in possible additional net contributions of the order of 0.75 to 2 GtCO2e in 2020. Even if ICIs are not necessarily additional to national 2020 pledges, they can be an important component of actually implementing these and at the same time facilitate or even drive increased national ambition. Only one study extrapolates the potential reductions to 2030, so it is not possible to present numbers here, but the study indicates that the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dfbeeb8-72f1-4949-8056-53ae401bb5f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dfbeeb8-72f1-4949-8056-53ae401bb5f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2486a1277f37d7b9cd2ae48270c6b465e9b1d35edaf7d3198b7c196c958ce591"}}, "hash": "2486a1277f37d7b9cd2ae48270c6b465e9b1d35edaf7d3198b7c196c958ce591", "text": "mitigation contribution from existing ICIs would be substantial.

What is the potential for greater forest- related mitigation, in particular through REDD+? Forest-related mitigation activities in both developing and developed countries are attracting significant political attention, both in the negotiation process over the last years and in many of the submitted INDCs. Special focus is on policies and actions under REDD+ as the theoretical potential of forest-related mitigation activities in developing countries is estimated to be up to 9 GtCO2 in 2030. The realization of this theoretical potential will be constrained by economic and land-use factors. A rapid review6 has been undertaken of forestry related mitigation actions in the submitted INDCs and these are together with other types of national engagement in forestry related mitigation illustrated in the global map below. The map clearly shows that many countries see potential mitigation opportunities in the forestry sector. A special focus in the assessment has been devoted to the set of policy approaches and actions known as REDD+ as one option for facilitating cost-effective contributions to climate change mitigation, in developing countries. REDD+ (as defined under the UNFCCC) includes \u2013 reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. REDD+ has seen marked progress under the UNFCCC negotiations over the last ten years, as a policy tool to reduce forest related emissions, including on measurement, safeguards and eligibility for results-based finance. In order for developing countries to access results-based finance for REDD+ emissions reductions or enhanced removals of carbon from the atmosphere, they need to have in place: \u2022 A national strategy or action plan \u2022 A national forest monitoring system \u2022 A safeguards information system and a summary of information on how the REDD+ safeguards have been addressed and respected \u2022 A forest reference emissions level or forest reference level \u2022 Fully measured, reported and verified results, in terms of emission reductions/enhanced removals. These requirements place some constraints on the potential for REDD+ implementation in the short term, for example the speed at which policies can be put in place and governance improvements can be implemented. The availability of finance, whether domestic or international, to cover the upfront costs of REDD+ measures will also be a determining factor. Results-based finance, by its nature, will be released only after success has been achieved. Many developing countries have expressed their interest in large- scale forest-related actions, both in their INDCs and a range of other statements. The theoretical emissions reduction potential has been assessed for Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America and the Caribbean and is broadly in the range 2.7-3.3 GtCO2 in 2030 for each region. However, the realization of this theoretical potential will be significantly constrained by economic and land-use factors. 1 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Scoping the 2015 report Scoping the 2015 report Chapter 1 of the intended nationally determined contributions\u201d (UNFCCC, 2014). The architecture of a new climate agreement has many facets relating to mitigation and adaptation, and the array of issues under negotiation has become significantly more complex since the Convention was established. The Paris Agreement will also aim to establish a framework to enhance capacity building and provide technological and financial support for developing countries to accelerate the transition towards low carbon and climate resilient development paths. A number of key decisions related to these issues will be required, while the core structure of the agreement will be based on the INDCs. 1.2 Key questions Subsequent to COP 15, UNEP has produced an annual Emissions Gap", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d476abc-a4a8-4f9c-8b30-ae683a48140f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d476abc-a4a8-4f9c-8b30-ae683a48140f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70b6f547808a39579071e410f0195e47431cab2ef9540f855c024b0c5e7d3e5b"}}, "hash": "70b6f547808a39579071e410f0195e47431cab2ef9540f855c024b0c5e7d3e5b", "text": "Report presenting an up-to-date assessment of how actions, pledges and commitments by countries affect the global GHG emissions trend and how this compares to emissions trajectories consistent with the goal of keeping temperatures below 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C by 2100. The difference has become known as the emissions gap, calculated for specific target years. This year, UNEP was requested by a number of countries to undertake an independent scientific assessment of the INDC submissions to inform the political process. The UNFCCC Secretariat has undertaken the formal compilation for COP 21. The 2015 UNEP Emissions Gap Report asks four principal questions: i) What are the latest estimates of 2025 and 2030 total global emissions levels consistent with the goal of holding the global average temperature rise below 2oC or 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels by 2100? ii) What is the progress on implementation of the Cancun pledges for the period to 2020? iii) Will the combined INDC commitments for 2030 1.1 Moving towards a new international climate change agreement The year 2015 has the potential to become a turning point in global efforts to transform the prevailing economic development paradigm into a more sustainable one. All UN member countries reached agreement in September 2015 on a set of 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. The main political instrument to address SDG 13 - \u201cTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\u201d - is the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Countries will meet again at the UNFCCC 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris with the aim of establishing a new international climate change agreement, hereafter the \u2018Paris Agreement\u2019, with the ambition of limiting changes in global temperatures to below 2oC or 1.5\u00b0C warming in 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. The decision \u201c[\u2026] to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties\u201d originated at COP 17 in Durban (Decision 1/CP.17) and has been confirmed most recently at COP 20 in Lima (Decision 1/CP.20) (UNFCCC, 2014). As the foundation for a new agreement, and reiterating decisions of COP 19 in Warsaw, the \u2018Lima Call for Climate Action\u2019 requested each Party \u201c[\u2026] to communicate to the secretariat its intended nationally determined contribution [INDC] towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2\u201d (UNFCCC, 1992)1 ensuring that these are submitted \u201c[\u2026] well in advance of the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties [\u2026] in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding 1 Article 2 states \u201cThe ultimate objective of this Convention and any related legal instruments that the Conference of the Parties may adopt is to achieve, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Convention, stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner\u201d (UNFCCC, 1992).

The objective of the report remains the same, which is to assess the global progress towards the emissions reductions required to be on track towards the agreed target of limiting global average temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C by the end of the century compared to pre-industrial levels. In parallel, the report assesses the possible actions to be taken to achieve the necessary reductions and how these can be accelerated and scaled up to close the gap between the target and actual emissions trends \u2013 a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70f10e28-4b40-4601-b04b-dfcb77e2f484": {"__data__": {"id_": "70f10e28-4b40-4601-b04b-dfcb77e2f484", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c96615fe9f953517084517248acd0e80ca0e35ac498b73322a19b24bb03b6166"}}, "hash": "c96615fe9f953517084517248acd0e80ca0e35ac498b73322a19b24bb03b6166", "text": "constant feature of this series of reports. 1.4 INDC Assessment process The INDC assessment team\u2019s approach has been to assess the impacts of the INDCs on future global GHG emissions. Global GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 are compared under four scenarios \u2013 the baseline scenario (assuming no additional climate policies since 2010), the current policy trajectory scenario (includes currently adopted and implemented policies), the INDC scenario (how global GHG emissions might evolve with full implementation of the INDCs) and the 2\u00b0C scenario (representing an idealized global scenario consistent with limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C by 2100, keeping the option open to strengthen the global temperature target to 1.5\u00b0C). Each scenario is a composite in the sense that it draws on multiple individual scenarios from the published literature. The emissions gap is estimated as the difference between the INDC scenario and the 2\u00b0C scenario. The approach to the assessment is characterized by the following principles: i) For nationally-generated data, assessment is based on the figures directly available in the officially submitted INDCs ii) For independently-generated data, assessment is based on peer-reviewed published analyses (or on related outputs) by independent modelling groups/ analysts based on the analysis of the information available in the INDCs iii) Participation of a balanced team of experts in the INDC assessment (by gender, professional and sectoral background, institutional affiliation and geographical location). In the process of preparing the Report and the INDC assessment, experts have frequently debated differences in understanding of assumptions (such as forms of mitigation contribution, conditional versus unconditional INDCs, use of international market mechanisms and treatment of the land use sector). By scrutinising assumptions (used by governments, independent modelling groups and international bodies), the team has been able to resolve many inconsistencies which, in turn, has led to increased confidence in the accuracy and validity of results. 1.5 Organization of the report The report comprises six chapters \u2013 this first one scoping the outline, with subsequent ones falling under two main parts of the report. part I comprises Chapters 2 and 3. Chapter 2 focuses on the importance of enhanced pre-2020 mitigation action. It starts by presenting recent estimates for global emission levels and assesses pathways consistent with the 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C temperature goals, based on the latest available literature. It then explains why enhanced early action matters and outlines the implications of not enhancing action, followed by a review of progress with current 2020 pledges. Chapter 3 assesses the 119 INDCs, covering 146 countries, submitted by 1 October 2015, with a specific focus on the extent to which the INDCs in aggregate contribute to a reduction in global GHG emissions consistent with limiting average global temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C in 2100 with >66 per cent chance. The chapter quantifies an emissions gap \u2013 the gap in 2025 and 2030 between future emission levels with the INDCs fully implemented and the emission levels consistent with the temperature goals of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C in 2100. PART II explores some of the opportunities for narrowing and potentially bridging the estimated emissions gap in 2030. It starts with an overview of key issues and potentials for reducing GHG emissions by 2030, based on an assessment of a number of recent studies. This is followed by two focal chapters. Chapter 5 assesses the possible contribution to global mitigation efforts by key International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs) led by actors other than the Parties to the UNFCCC. Finally, Chapter 6 reviews a range of forest-related mitigation activities and identifies the technical potential for both CO2 emissions reductions and sequestration from these activities in developing countries, and with a special focus on REDD+. As in previous editions, this year\u2019s Report has been put together by an international team of top scientists. This year 42 scientists from 24 scientific groups in 18 countries have contributed to the report. 3 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The importance of pre-2020 action The importance of pre-2020 action Chapter 2 2.1 Introduction This Chapter first discusses recent global emission levels and trends, and reviews where global emissions would be heading in the absence of additional deliberate climate policies. It then presents assessment of global emission pathways that would keep global warming to below respectively 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C in 2100. This is followed by an elaboration of why enhanced early action matters and a discussion of the implications of not increasing short-term climate mitigation efforts. Achievement of the Cancun 2020 pledges will be important for the transition to least-cost mitigation pathways from 2020. Section 2.3 therefore takes a closer look at progress towards achieving the 2020 pledges.

Moreover, during the first decade of the 21st century, emissions increased at a faster rate (2.2 per cent/yr) than during the last three decades of the 20th century (1.3 per cent/yr) (IPCC, 2014a). After the recovery from the economic crisis (with a 3.5 per cent increase in 2010-2011), the emissions growth slowed to 1.8 per cent on average over the subsequent two years1. The most recent global emission estimates2 are for the year 2014. In that year, total global Kyoto-GHG emissions3 amounted to about 52.7 GtCO2e/yr (range: 47.9-57.54, Figure 2.1). Global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels and industry alone were estimated at 35.5 GtCO2/yr5 for 2014 (range: 32.5-38.56). In the absence of any further mitigation action compared to these trends, GHG emission projections are set to increase significantly over the 21st century. These projections are influenced by many factors. For example, economic and population growth will generally result in an increase in emissions, while energy intensity improvements in the global economy and reductions of carbon intensity in energy production will generally result in a decrease in emissions. These factors have characterized the last three decades of the 20th century. During the first decade of the 21st century, however, carbon intensity increased again, thus further contributing to rising global emissions. 1 Based on EC-JRC/PBL.

Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) version 4.3. http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/, 2015 update (forthcoming), (Olivier and Janssens-Maenhout, 2012). **** based on updates of van der Werf et al. (2010). 5 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The importance of pre-2020 action with >66 per cent chance, the timing is of the order of one or more decades later, more specifically around 2070 (range: 2060-2075)12. Achieving global net zero CO2 emissions is a geophysical requirement. It follows directly from the fact that to limit warming to any level, total net CO2 emissions need to be capped, and from the fact that, up to the present day, global CO2 emissions are still rising13. In theory, a small set of scenarios is able to limit warming to below 2\u00b0C14 without achieving net negative emissions by 2100 (UNEP, 2014). However, these scenarios all start stringent, global mitigation before 2020 (see also Section 2.2.3), which is no longer considered realistic. Without exception, all 1.5\u00b0C scenarios available in the literature reach net negative CO2 emissions by mid-century, even with stringent mitigation action having started in 2010. In most scenarios, global net zero and negative emissions are achieved by the use of so-called negative emission technologies that offset any residual positive emissions. Such negative emissions might be achieved on a large scale, for example, by massive afforestation or by combining bio- energy with capture and storage of CO2. Bio-energy combined with capture and geological storage of CO2 has been studied increasingly over the past decade, but uncertainties about its large-scale deployment remain (see Annex A for details). Compared to 2\u00b0C pathways, significantly fewer studies have explored pathways that limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C (Clarke et al., 2014). Findings for the very stringent 1.5\u00b0C limit are therefore less robust. However, one scientific review of 1.5\u00b0C scenarios (Rogelj et al., 2015a) found that such scenarios are in many aspects similar to 2\u00b0C-consistent scenarios, but that they are characterized by faster emissions reductions in the near term (in 2020 and 2030). Compared to 2\u00b0C, the rapid and profound decarbonization of the energy system in 1.5\u00b0C scenarios is driven by earlier reductions in the power sector, important efforts to limit energy demand in the industry, buildings, and transport sector; and no delays in global mitigation action beyond 2020. This more rapid transformation translates into significantly higher costs. For example, carbon prices are about two or three times higher in 1.5\u00b0C scenarios than in scenarios that keep warming to below 2\u00b0C with >66 per cent chance (Rogelj et al., 2015a). 2.2.3 Why enhanced early action matters Enhanced early action facilitates the transition to the stringent, long-term emission reductions required for limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C. It would enable countries i) to overachieve their current pledges by 2020, 12 These numbers differ from the ones presented in the 2014 Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2014, Table 2.1), where the median year and range of annual net global CO2 emissions including LULUCF becoming zero was indicated as 2065 (range: 2055-2070). The reason is that this year the final IPCC AR5 Scenario Database data are used, whereas the estimate last year was based on a preliminary release of the IPCC AR5 scenarios database data. In addition, this year the estimate is corrected for sampling bias by removing scenarios that do not represent a variation at the global level, but only represent a variation in the regional burden sharing scheme.

Data from a recent scientific study that described pathways that limit warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 were also included10. Pathway characteristics for both 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios are provided in Table 2.1. These show pathways with limited action until 2020 and global least-cost mitigation afterwards. These are in line with current policy trajectories (see Section 2.3 and Chapter 3), which suggest that the global community did not enhance its mitigation action from 2010 aligned with long-term least-cost 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C pathways from 2010 onward (UNEP, 2014). Therefore, the scenarios used in this year\u2019s report assume global emissions in 2020 that are roughly in line with the Cancun pledges for 2020 (that is, 49- 56 GtCO2e in 2020 as indicated in Table 2.1). Furthermore, the pathways shown allow temperatures to \u2018overshoot\u2019 \u2013 that is, to temporarily exceed the 2\u00b0C limit before falling below it again by 210011. These pathways do not represent the only possibilities of limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C. Some level of flexibility is available for emissions falling outside the range. However, this flexibility is not infinite and enhanced pre-2020 action matters (as further discussed in section 2.2.3). As Table 2.1 shows all scenarios are characterized by net negative global total GHG emissions by 2100. Looking specifically at CO2 emissions that play a dominant role in determining long-term warming as described in Box 2.1, 1.5\u00b0C- and 2\u00b0C-consistent scenarios reach net zero CO2 emissions globally between 2045 and 2075 (Table 2.1). Scenarios in line with 1.5\u00b0C reach net zero CO2 emissions around 2050. In scenarios that keep warming to below 2\u00b0C 7 They may or may not include Kyoto Protocol commitments until 2012. 8 Scenario-based ranges in this chapter refer to the 20th to 80th percentile range, unless stated otherwise. 9 In particular, the emission scenarios available in the IPCC AR5 Scenario Data- base were used. Temperature projections for the IPCC AR5 Scenario Database were computed with a probabilistic version of MAGICC. (Meinshausen et al., 2009; Meinshausen et al., 2011). 10 Rogelj et al. (2015a). These 1.5\u00b0C scenarios temporarily exceed the 1.5\u00b0C limit during the 21st century in order to fall below it again with >50 per cent chance in 2100. This is sometimes referred to as a temperature overshoot. Insufficient data are available for assessing pathways that return warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 with >66 per cent chance. 11 Pathways for 2\u00b0C scenarios that do not allow overshooting (that is, where temperatures stay below 2\u00b0C during the 21st century) are shown in the technical Annex A to Chapter 2, available online. 6 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013The importance of pre-2020 action Box 2.1: The global carbon dioxide (CO2) budget, non-CO2 GHGs and the link to global warming Limiting warming to any desired level requires a cap on total, cumulative anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Working Group I of the IPCC (IPCC, 2013) showed that global mean temperature increases are almost directly proportional to cumulative carbon dioxide emissions since the pre-industrial period. This leads to the important conclusion that there is a maximum amount of carbon dioxide emissions, or a CO2 budget, that can be discharged to the atmosphere over time if society wishes to stay within a 2\u00b0C or other global warming limit. The IPCC indicated that to limit warming to below 2\u00b0C with a \u2018likely chance\u2019 (that is >66% chance) by the end of the century, about 1 000 GtCO2 of CO2 emissions remained \u2018in the budget\u2019 from 2011 onward* (IPCC, 2014b; Knutti and Rogelj, 2015). To keep CO2 emissions within such a budget allowance, annual global CO2 emissions have to become zero at some point during the 21st century.

All scenarios have prescribed 2020 emissions consistent with the GHG pledges made by Parties in Cancun in 2010, and hence do not represent least-cost emission levels until then. All available scenarios with limited action until 2020 rely on net negative CO2 emissions from energy and industry during the 21st century. Most scenarios with such specifications were contributed to the IPCC AR5 Scenario Database by the LIMITS intercomparison project16.

Furthermore, to keep the door open for limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, enhanced early action seems essential. Previous reports (UNEP, 2012, 2013, 2014) provided detailed discussion of the trade-offs between early and late action. Three main areas of importance with respect to enhanced early action were highlighted in particular:1516 1. Economics and technology, where enhanced early action will: \u2022 mediate the requirement for very steep emission reductions in the medium term \u2022 facilitate mitigation in the medium to long term by reducing lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure in the energy system and society as a whole \u2022 spur near-term learning and development of technologies that will be essential in the long term \u2022 provide early policy signals which are needed for action in the following decades \u2022 reduce the overall costs and economic challenges during the transitional period, for example, in terms of upscaling of energy investments \u2022 reduce the dependence on unproven technologies such as negative emissions technologies17 and increase the options society can choose from to achieve stringent emission reductions. 2. Climate outcomes: Enhanced early action will reduce climate risks, for example, by influencing the rate of temperature increase (Schaeffer et al., 2013; Ricke and Caldeira, 2014). 3. Co-benefits: Enhanced early action will enable the realisation of near-term co-benefits of climate change mitigation, such as improved public health as a result of lower air pollution, improved energy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65acce67-cdc4-490c-bae5-aca16d594433": {"__data__": {"id_": "65acce67-cdc4-490c-bae5-aca16d594433", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad9e21ae800245c48b127fa3c920c1487d237db8cc7999ff53cb0ef30b836267"}, "3": {"node_id": "bdba8aaf-2deb-4a57-8913-b913c9017ebb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e80cab58f5a87b2310d08f1925c0ed4173f32469c5435ef1be555b0c7956e9f"}}, "hash": "df31c3d2b1c7b5deca2e58be91e09f435e6b92d4b32a2f23f76d5f1dc01de5b6", "text": "security, and reduced crop yield losses18. The issue of lock-in is very important in a number of ways. Even with enhanced early action, it is projected that carbon intensive infrastructure, such as unabated coal-fired power plants, will have to be shut down before the end of their lifetime in some stringent mitigation scenarios, and delay exacerbates this (Rogelj et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2015). Furthermore, delay also locks in energy intensive practices. Limiting energy demand is critical to keep stringent mitigation targets within reach (Clarke et al., 2014). Furthermore, the transition to a low energy-demand society is also inhibited by delays of action, as more energy intensive infrastructure continues to be built up. Infrastructure lock-in makes the transition to a low-carbon path harder. 15 16 17 Enhanced early action is important in reducing dependence on negative emissions in the long term for achieving stringent climate targets like 2\u00b0C. However, there are no scenarios available that return warming to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100, without the use of bio-energy combined with capture and geological storage of CO2. 18 Note that the IPCC AR5 also identified adverse side-effects of climate change mitigation, which will have to be considered simultaneously. Enhanced early action is thus important. As described above, overachievement of the 2020 pledges will improve the chances for the stringent emission reductions that are required post-2020 ( Rogelj et al., 2013; Clarke et al., 2014). 2.3 Progress towards the 2020 pledges: a closer look at major economies Section 2.2 underlined the importance of pre-2020 mitigation action to achieving consistency with the below 2\u00b0C by 2100 scenarios. It is critical that all countries, and particularly the highest-emitting economies, advance as far as possible towards achieving \u2013 and ideally exceeding \u2013 their Cancun pledges. This section takes a closer look at progress towards achieving these 2020 pledges, focusing on the parties that are members of the G2019. These economies collectively generate around three quarters of global GHG emissions20. 2.3.1 Assessment of G20 countries\u2019 2020 emissions under three cases The section compares current emissions trajectories of G20 members with the trajectories associated with the achievement of these parties\u2019 2020 pledges. It should be read with three important caveats in mind. First, not all pledges demand the same level of effort to achieve. In other words, a country currently on track to achieve its pledge has not necessarily made a greater effort to mitigate emissions than a country not yet on track21. Secondly, these projections are subject to the uncertainty associated with macroeconomic trends, such as changes in gross domestic product (GDP), as well as the impact of policies. Thirdly, the emission trajectories analysed here do not quantify the potential impact of using offsets to achieve pledges. If offsets are traded internationally, and are counted towards the pledges of both buying and selling parties, the global impact of the pledges will be weakened. Most countries have not clarified their intentions concerning use of offsets to meet their 2020 pledges. Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, and the United States have explicitly not excluded the possibility; others have not formally commented (CAIT WRI, 2015). Table 2.2 compares 2020 emissions under three cases: a pledge case, based on official data; a current policy trajectory case, based on official data; and a current policy trajectory case, based on independent analysis. These cases are described in Box 2.2. 19 The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK, the USA, and the EU. In our analysis, the EU including all its Member States (regardless of G20 status) is considered as a single Party, and EU Member States are not considered individually. In general, evaluating the pledges of other countries is limited by a lack of data. 20 In 2012, these parties accounted for 77 per cent of global emissions excluding LULUCF and 75 per cent of global GHG emissions including LULUCF (CAIT WRI, 2015). 21 See Appendix 2.D of the 2013 UNEP Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2013) for further discussion of this issue. 8 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013The importance of pre-2020 action Box 2.2: Assumptions of analysis of progress towards pledges For each country or Party, Table 2.2 compares estimates for 2020 emissions under three cases: 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bdba8aaf-2deb-4a57-8913-b913c9017ebb": {"__data__": {"id_": "bdba8aaf-2deb-4a57-8913-b913c9017ebb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad9e21ae800245c48b127fa3c920c1487d237db8cc7999ff53cb0ef30b836267"}, "2": {"node_id": "65acce67-cdc4-490c-bae5-aca16d594433", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df31c3d2b1c7b5deca2e58be91e09f435e6b92d4b32a2f23f76d5f1dc01de5b6"}}, "hash": "6e80cab58f5a87b2310d08f1925c0ed4173f32469c5435ef1be555b0c7956e9f", "text": "Pledge case (official data): identifies the maximum level of GHG emissions that each country or Party could emit in 2020 and still meet its pledge \u2013 without considering the use of offsets.

For countries whose pledges are framed as GHG intensity targets, economic growth consistent with official projections is assumed22. Where available, the 2020 emission level described by the country or Party as the pledge level is used; alternatively, these levels are calculated working from official base-year or baseline data. 2. Current policy trajectory case (official data): identifies official estimates of 2020 emissions considering projected economic trends and current policy approaches, including policies at least through 2012. 3. Current policy trajectory case (independent analysis): similarly identifies estimates of 2020 emissions considering the best current estimates of projected economic trends and current policy approaches, but is based on independent analysis rather than official data. Figures are drawn from the Climate Action Tracker (CAT, 2015) and den Elzen et al. (2015) for all countries, as well as other, country-specific sources where noted. Current policy trajectory (independent analysis) supplements the official sources described in point two by providing data that aim for consistency across countries and political independence. Projections only consider a limited subset of sectors and gases, for example, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels are omitted, as they cannot be compared to projections and targets that include the full set of GHGs across the entire economy. 22 For China, GDP is assumed to reach 61.6 trillion yuan in 2020, consistent with China\u2019s National Communication (People\u2019s Republic of China, 2012).

While this adjustment makes it much easier for Japan to achieve its pledge, current official projections still place Japan\u2019s 2020 emissions slightly above its pledge threshold (UNFCCC, 2014). Independent projections differ slightly \u2013 CAT (2015) shows Japan on track to meet its revised pledge, whereas den Elzen et al. (2015) estimates a range in 2020 from slightly below to slightly above the pledge level. Japan\u2019s actual trajectory, however, will depend significantly on the respective roles of nuclear power and coal-fired power to meet future needs29. Canada and Mexico are likely to require further action or purchased offsets, or both in order to meet their pledges, according to government and independent estimates. Mexico\u2019s 2020 pledge is conditional on the provision of adequate financial and technological support from developed countries as part of a global agreement (Mexico, 2015). According to independent analysis, the Republic of Korea will also require further action to meet its pledge, but this cannot be verified based on publicly available official projections. Independent estimates of 2020 emissions range from well below to well above the pledge level (CAT, 2015; den Elzen et al., 2015). In the cases of Australia30 and the USA, government and independent analyses reach differing conclusions regarding each country\u2019s progress towards its pledge. In the case of Australia, the government projects 2020 emissions of approximately 655 MtCO2e, not including the impact of the Emission Reduction Fund (ERF). The Australian government states that it is \u201con track\u201d to meet its target of 533 MtCO2e, and that the ERF has contracted projects expected to deliver 28 Calculated for China based on an assumed GDP growth rate of 8.5 per cent (PBL, 2015) and 7.0 per cent (CAT, 2015), and for India based on an assumed GDP growth rate of 7.5 per cent (PBL, 2015) and 6.4 per cent (CAT, 2015). 29 A study commissioned by Japan\u2019s Ministry of Environment (MOE, 2015) pro- jected that by 2030, the share of renewable energy in the electricity sector could reach around 25-30 per cent in a \u2018medium deployment\u2019 case and 30-35 per cent in a \u2018high deployment\u2019 case. 30 See CCA (2014) for further discussion. abatement of 47 MtCO2e (Commonwealth of Australia, 2015). Prior to the initial auction, CCA (2014) reviewed studies of the potential of the ERF and concluded, \u201cIn short, these studies suggest that the ERF\u2019s contribution to reducing emissions is likely to fall some way short of what is required to meet Australia\u2019s minimum 2020 target\u201d. Independent analyses (CAT, 2015; PBL 2015) project emissions above the pledge level. The USA contends that the \u2018with additional measures\u2019 scenario from a 2014 addendum to its biennial report now represents its current policy trajectory. This trajectory shows the United States on track to achieve its pledge. Independent analyses, by contrast, find that further action is still necessary (see, for example, Rhodium Group, 2014; Belenky, 2015; CAT, 2015; Hausker et al., 2015; PBL, 2015). Insufficient information is currently available to determine whether Indonesia and South Africa are on track to meet their pledges. In the case of Indonesia, independent projections span a wide range, and official projections reflecting current policies are unavailable. In the case of South Africa, official projections to 2020 do not reflect recently adopted and implemented policies, and independent estimates vary widely, from well below the pledge level to well above it. South Africa\u2019s pledge is conditional. Finally, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not proposed GHG reduction pledges for 2020 (as of 1 October 2015, Argentina and Turkey had submitted post-2020 pledges to the UNFCCC as part of their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions). Despite progress towards implementing policies in line with pledges, work remains to be done to bring all G20 countries into pledge attainment. Additionally, better data are necessary to adequately track this progress in some countries. Ensuring continued progress towards 2020 pledges will reduce the mitigation burden associated with achieving the post-2020 pledges put forward in the INDCs. This section has examined the extent to which G20 countries are proceeding towards the minimum level of their 2020 pledges, in light of the importance of pre-2020 GHG reductions for achieving consistency with 2\u00b0C scenarios, with implications beyond 2020.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca66b8e1-fb3c-4190-a8a3-27ebec0e386c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca66b8e1-fb3c-4190-a8a3-27ebec0e386c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a90ffd4ccfe011e4053501dc06a123bbf8e2cdc49e2101a1f28d84bf555cd101"}, "2": {"node_id": "114cd35b-03de-46b9-91d4-e677987b6d67", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54b1617804a9221c936943b503b2e9511cc8bd35463d6d8df1e8781ac30b4faf"}}, "hash": "9aab1648076f9bdd7bf77b72209bbcdf4107d29b148a7c24c5d9b32570c2edd7", "text": "As described earlier in this chapter, this report does not address the global emissions gap in 2020, so the cumulative impact of the progress towards 2020 pledges is not calculated.

This would allow a transition towards a pathway in line with a least-cost trajectory after 2020, with the associated economic, technology, societal co-benefits, and climate outcome benefits highlighted in section 2.2. 12 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 Chapter 3 Box 3.1: INDCs in the Warsaw (2013) and Lima (2014) decisions under the UNFCCC The Warsaw decision 1/CP19 (UNFCCC, 2013) introduced the concept of INDCs as follows: \u2022 All Parties are invited to initiate or intensify preparations for their INDCs, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions \u2022 All Parties are invited to communicate their INDCs well in advance of COP 21 \u201c[\u2026] (by the first quarter of 2015 by those Parties ready to do so) in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the intended contributions, without prejudice to the legal nature of the contributions\u201d. The Lima decision 1/CP20 (UNFCCC, 2014) reiterated the points agreed in Warsaw, and also: \u2022 Agreed that each Party\u2019s intended nationally determined contribution towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 will represent a progression beyond the current undertaking of that Party \u2022 Invited all Parties to consider communicating their undertakings in adaptation planning or consider including an adaptation component in their INDCs \u2022 Agreed that the information to be provided by Parties may include, as appropriate, inter alia, quantifiable information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year), time frames and/or periods for implementation, scope and coverage, planning processes, assumptions and methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and, as appropriate, removals, and how the Party considers that its INDC is fair and ambitious, in light of its national circumstances, and how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 (UNFCCC, 1992).

It reiterated the invitation issued by the 2013 Warsaw decision for Parties to communicate their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) towards achieving the objective of the Convention (UNFCCC, 2013) (see Box 3.1). This chapter explores the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 (UNFCCC, 2015a), with a specific focus on the extent to which the INDCs in aggregate are in accordance with the long-term objective of the Convention, which is \u201c[\u2026] to achieve [\u2026] stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\u201d.

INDCs that countries intend to achieve unconditionally, as well as INDCs that are subject to conditions (such as the provision of international climate finance), are evaluated separately. A final update of the assessment including later submissions will be presented on the UNEP Live website before the start of COP 21. 3.2 Broad characteristics of submitted INDCs By 1 October 2015, a total of 119 INDCs, covering 146 countries and 85-88 per cent of global GHG emissions in 2012 (JRC/PBL, 2012; WRI, 2015), had been submitted to the UNFCCC1,2. Every INDC includes a mitigation component and just over 85 per cent cover both mitigation and adaptation. Fifteen INDCs cover mitigation only. Mitigation INDCs were submitted by countries from all regions (see Figure 3.1), and the 10 largest emitters had all submitted their INDCs by 1 October. These are, in descending order of emission levels, China, the USA, EU, India, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Japan, Canada and Mexico. The review of the INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 identified broad mitigation-related groupings as follows: Coverage: 38 INDCs explicitly state that they are economy- wide. Many of these cover 100 per cent of national GHG emissions, while another specifies 98.5 per cent coverage. Sectors: 50 INDCs include all major IPCC sector categories (energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, waste, and Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF)), while 61 INDCs are sector-specific. Eight INDCs do not explicitly state which sectors are covered. Nitrogen trifluoride: 19 INDCs cover nitrogen trifluoride (NF3, also a Kyoto gas from 2013 onward) in addition to all Kyoto GHGs of the first commitment period. With respect to NF3, two countries (Gabon and Republic of Congo) indicate the gas is to be included in future. Selective GHGs: 50 INDCs cover only CO2, N2O and CH4 (and another INDC includes SF6 in addition to these). Eleven INDCs include only CO2 emissions, while two (Mauritius and Mexico), besides first-commitment-period Kyoto Protocol gases, also include Short Lived Climate Forcers (SLCF)3. 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP): The common metric of 100-year GWP values is indicated in some, but not 1 This total of 119 recognizes that the EU submitted collectively as 1 INDC. Counting the 28 EU member states separately, the country total covered by the INDCs is 146. 2 Covering all sectors including land use, land-use change and forestry (LU- LUCF), and all six Kyoto gases of the first commitment period [carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), per- fluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)]. 3 Mexico\u2019s unconditional INDC is equivalent to a reduction of 51 per cent of black carbon (BC); with conditional reductions extending up to 70 per cent of BC emissions, both below BAU by 2030. Mauritius does not provide further information about their SLCF emissions. all, INDCs, referring to different IPCC Assessment Reports (ARs).

Below, the various forms of targets included by Parties in their INDCs are summarized. Base year target: 32 INDCs report on an absolute reduction from historical base year emissions. The base year chosen varies, with 1990, 2005 and 2010 being the most common. Most Parties chose 2030 as the target year for their INDCs. However, 11 countries chose 2025. Baseline scenario target: The form of emissions reduction relative to a baseline projection has been chosen in 63 INDCs, mainly for countries located in South and Central America, Africa and South Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d34925dd-9e38-44a9-9f93-5efa1bb04fe1": {"__data__": {"id_": "d34925dd-9e38-44a9-9f93-5efa1bb04fe1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f616d7043a20e959a47d2581c8e88f071d5fa2edb8d9adba5ad10823853df70"}, "3": {"node_id": "04ea8dc4-5b19-42d7-b72e-10133db49af4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7607886bdb00b8cacc21d4743858efc4572629854413236a16c4c214948b4b54"}}, "hash": "328669dd7cec6266357676df3ddb567929f00159ac160835e7d82bf23476baa6", "text": "Two countries using a baseline scenario target are Guyana and Mozambique. They quantify the MtCO2e they intend to reduce, but do not specify relative baseline emissions projections. Trajectory target: South Africa has a trajectory target stating the emission range in 2025 and 2030 and adds an emission range in absolute Mt to its trajectory target. Specifying a peaking year is part of China\u2019s and Singapore\u2019s INDCs. In these cases, the timing of the maximum CO2 emissions has been communicated, but not the level, while adding intensity targets. Intensity target: China also specifies the carbon intensity of GDP, indicating percentages by which CO2 emissions per unit of GDP will be reduced by 2030, compared to the 2005 intensity. Singapore adopts the same approach, but for all GHG emissions, giving an emission intensity of GDP. A further four countries (Chile, India, Tunisia and Uruguay) indicate reductions in emission intensity of GDP as the main form of their mitigation INDC. Fixed level target: Seven countries put forward a fixed level target; that is, they specify the MtCO2e that they intend not to exceed in a given year (Armenia, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Israel and Sierra Leone). Kenya\u2019s INDC, though framed as percentage emission reduction relative to a baseline projection, adds the Mt in the same sentence; the calculation of absolute emissions in 2030 is simple multiplication. Actions and non-GHG metrics only: Six countries (Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Malawi, Myanmar, Rwanda and Swaziland) include only actions and another four countries only non-GHG metrics (Cape Verde, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu). Additional non-GHG metrics: Some INDCs include additional non-GHG metrics, for example, in the form of a target for non-fossil-fuel primary energy share, in the case of China, and a reduction from baseline projections of Short Lived Climate Pollutants, in the case of Mexico. 15 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 Renewable energy (RE) target: 42 INDCs include quantified renewable energy (RE) targets as a form of non-GHG metric or actions consistent with their GHG target, in addition to other forms. For example, Brazil targets 45 per cent of renewables in its energy mix by 2030, including expanding the use of renewable energy sources other than hydropower to between 28-33 per cent and increasing the share of renewables (other than hydropower) in the power supply to at least 23 per cent. Furthermore, eight INDCs (Cape Verde, Gabon, Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Vanuatu) made RE targets part of their headline mitigation contribution. As an example, Gabon\u2019s RE target is expressed as 80 per cent of electricity supply from hydropower by 2025, and as a summary component of its mitigation INDC in addition to an emission reduction target, while Samoa\u2019s contribution is a \u201c[\u2026] 100% renewable energy target for electricity generation through to the year 2025\u201d. From the above review, it is evident that, in the absence of agreed forms of mitigation contribution and the units in which those might be expressed, countries have selected a wide variety of forms. Over 50 per cent of the mitigation INDCs have taken the form of emission reduction relative to a baseline projection. Within single forms, different units have been chosen; forms are not mutually exclusive; and several countries have chosen more than one form of mitigation contribution. This has increased the analytical challenge of comparing INDC elements and ensuring consistency when aggregating the different contributions. 3.2.2 Treatment of Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use The vast majority of INDCs includes the land-use sector or a component of it. Only a few countries (including Albania, Andorra, Djibouti, Georgia, Marshall Islands, Republic of Macedonia and Trinidad and Tobago) explicitly exclude it. Some countries (for example, Republic of Korea) indicate that a decision on whether to include LULUCF will be made later. Few countries explicitly include a separate forest goal (for example, Benin, China and India).

If an INDC explicitly includes LULUCF in the base year, then net-net is assumed to be treating LULUCF is the same way as any other GHG inventory sector. It is also possible for countries to use a net-net accounting approach where the base year does not include LULUCF, but the LULUCF contribution is added or subtracted from total national emis- sions in the target year. allow. In addition, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, United States and Canada declared also that emissions from natural disturbances may or will be excluded, consistent with available IPCC guidance. Almost all developing countries have mitigation actions both in agriculture and LULUCF. In many cases, LULUCF represents the most relevant current source of emissions and the main area for future mitigation. Often REDD+ is mentioned, but sometimes the relationship between INDC and REDD+ is not fully clear. Several developing countries include specific LULUCF information within the unconditional and the conditional targets (for example the expected LULUCF mitigation and the related cost of implementation). In terms of methodology for estimating GHG emissions and removals, the IPCC 2006 Guidelines are mentioned as the primary guidance by most countries (including all developed country Parties). The 2003 Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF is mentioned by few countries (for example, Kenya, Madagascar, Peru, Jordan and Benin). Some countries also refer to the 1996 IPCC guidelines (for example, Argentina, Democratic Republic of Congo, Macedonia and Republic of Korea). 3.2.3 Adaptation components in INDCs and undertakings in adaptation planning The Lima decision invited all Parties to consider including an adaptation component in their INDCs or to consider communicating their undertakings in adaptation planning. Components on adaptation have been included in just over 85 per cent of INDCs submitted by 1 October (102/119). Of these, three (Australia, Israel and Monaco) indicate in their INDCs that they are working to build their adaptation strategies during 2015, while Brazil\u00b4s INDC states that it is \u201c[\u2026] working on the design of new public policies, through its National Adaptation Plan (NAP), in its final elaboration phase\u201d, and Macedonia\u2019s INDC states that \u201c[\u2026] climate change adaptation shall be the subject of more detailed analysis in the future\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015a). Four undertakings in adaptation planning were submitted or referred to in the INDCs submitted to the UNFCCC. Undertakings in adaptation planning were submitted by both the EU and the USA. These are available on the UNFCCC website (UNFCCC, 2015b) as distinct from the INDC portal (UNFCCC, 2015a). Furthermore, New Zealand and Norway refer in their INDCs (UNFCCC, 2015a) to undertakings in adaptation planning by referring to chapters in their national communications. 3.2.4 Specifying support required or offered Several countries have stated requirements for support for their INDCs in the form of finance, technology transfer, and investment in capacity building, and through international support or the use of international market mechanisms or both. Conditional versus unconditional INDCs: 42 INDCs have both unconditional and conditional components to their GHG emission reduction targets while 39 include only conditional contributions. 37 INDCs do not make a clear distinction between conditional and unconditional provisions in their INDCs. 16 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 Use of international market mechanisms: 22 INDCs indicate they will mainly achieve their emission reductions domestically, although only seven of these specifically state international market mechanisms will not be used. An explicit intention to use these mechanisms is stated by 11 countries, while 20 INDCs express support for their use and a further 23 are considering their potential use. Norway and Iceland indicate in their INDCs that they will likely continue their participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). Liechtenstein\u2019s INDC indicates \u201c[\u2026] supplemental emission reductions abroad\u201d, while Albania, Chad, Ethiopia, Montenegro and Rwanda intend to \u201c[\u2026] sell carbon credits\u201d.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e57bf4ae-1449-4114-b01b-ca117cc93735": {"__data__": {"id_": "e57bf4ae-1449-4114-b01b-ca117cc93735", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e476884ddad6be591d64bd9c5f521ce52fb86e72923bb79130235f81e10d041c"}, "2": {"node_id": "358f2fa6-c4bd-493b-87bc-da2bd00ce619", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf405917d8b0d8c43aa42641517cb85b4350cddd8d1879531799f80e65cabe57"}}, "hash": "93d1bd1e2e6716bf94aeb76499887b36756ccb5e58a39c9d2d511dc00fd4a944", "text": "In formulating their mitigation INDCs, four countries (Ghana, Guyana, Japan and New Zealand) have assumed that international mechanisms will be used.

For further detail on these examples, see UNFCCC (2015a). 3.2.5 How countries address equity, ambition and Article 2 of the Convention The Lima decision invited information on fairness and ambition, and how the INDC contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 (UNFCCC, 1992). In relation to the objective of the Convention, 52 of the INDCs make reference to Article 2 (verbatim or indirectly), while 62 INDCs refer to the 2\u00b0C goal; 36 INDCs make no reference to either Article 2 or 2\u00b0C. Most INDCs have addressed equity (or fairness) and ambition in some way. However, 80 INDCs do not offer specific metrics to support their claims to relative fairness in relation to their INDCs, instead providing only general statements or reference to principles. A further 31 INDCs draw on analyses conducted by modelling teams or experts from within the country. Only eight INDCs \u2013 Andorra, Brazil, Macedonia, Monaco, Norway, Republic of Moldova, South Africa and Switzerland \u2013 refer to external, independent analyses. On equity, a range of arguments and indicators is referred to in the INDCs. The most common indicator chosen is per capita emission levels, described in 57 INDCs. Specifically, 68 INDCs refer to their countries representing a small share of global emissions. Additionally nine INDCs (Andorra, Armenia, Bangladesh, EU, Japan, Jordan, Monaco, Norway and Switzerland) reference ranges in IPCC reports for consistency with 2\u00b0C. Further details are available in Annex B of this report (avail- able online), presenting a summary of key characteristics of all INDCs submitted by 1 October 2015 in table form. 3.3 Methodology for quantifying the effect of INDCs on global GHG emissions 3.3.1 Overview of scenarios To assess the impact of the INDCs on future global GHG emissions, global GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 are compared under four scenarios. Each scenario is composite. It draws on multiple individual scenarios from the published literature in line with the characteristics described below. \u2022 The baseline scenario assumes that no additional climate policies have been put in place since 2010 (see also Chapter 2). It is sourced from the scenario database that accompanied the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Clarke et al., 2014). \u2022 The current policy trajectory scenario takes into account currently adopted and implemented policies. It is based on (i) the current policies scenarios from three5 out of the eight global INDC analyses6 that provide such current policy trajectory scenarios, (ii) official country-specific data sources, and (iii) independent country-specific data sources, as detailed in Table 3.1. 5 These three groups with current policy scenarios are: (i) the Climate Action Tracker by Climate Analytics, NewClimate Institute, Ecofys and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research\u2013PIK (CAT, 2015); (ii) International En- ergy Agency (IEA, 2014); and iii) PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (den Elzen et al., 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52864ba3-2744-4c74-b267-1d9dafceedab": {"__data__": {"id_": "52864ba3-2744-4c74-b267-1d9dafceedab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72bda930e10187f49a1e76adcbbe31065223517e1166e34da062e6da696ac2c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "8cc8bbc7-0229-4cb3-85a1-d2fed1c4ad8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06a3d35077023c4a83ca25dee8a73a2a4d161b1457ee3521549bac76f25ef6b2"}}, "hash": "8943643c52cf51926fcd0579d1c3d45bc827a7e2ec28a2e305b93056d25320a4", "text": "The groups from LSE and DEA (see footnote 6) also have current policies scenarios that are calibrated at the IEA current policies scenario. 6 These eight global groups with INDC scenarios are: (i) the Climate Action Tracker by Climate Analytics, NewClimate Institute, Ecofys and PIK (CAT, 2015);

Table 3.1: Overview of INDC studies included in the assessment by type of source (in alphabetical order) \u2022 The INDC scenario portrays how global GHG emissions might evolve with full implementation of INDCs. It is sourced from (i) the official estimates included in the INDCs (UNFCCC, 2015a), (ii) calculations based on the INDCs and on other documents submitted by countries to the UNFCCC (such as national GHG inventories, national communications, biennial reports, and biennial update reports), (iii) estimates published in country-specific studies, and (iv) eight global analyses, described further below. \u2022 The 2\u00b0C scenario represents an idealized global scenario consistent with limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C, keeping the option open to strengthen the global temperature target to 1.5\u00b0C. It comprises the subset of scenarios from the IPCC AR5 scenario database that (i) have a greater than 66 per cent chance of keeping global temperature increase to below 2\u00b0C in 2100 compared pre-industrial levels, (ii) are consistent with full implementation of 2020 pledges that are anchored in the Cancun Agreements, and 18 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 (iii) distribute emission reductions across regions, gases and sectors after 2020 in such a way that that global mitigation costs of necessary reductions are minimized.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f0eaa18-caa2-4330-9b2d-cd7bee888aa1": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f0eaa18-caa2-4330-9b2d-cd7bee888aa1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc4c989b0a022bc8568950d5c3bfa421ed3ddbd906e70aa0b695785f8d586174"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb3e894d-5117-45e9-989e-edec41c0b2f4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "019bfe1fc39463d21feb87a88405d4d2f4d51ca71bb13a3fcf1de648ee046cf8"}}, "hash": "31cc4ad7c157f629e49ff5c47dadaa57ef6ced324b056e3114e945e22f8deaa9", "text": "3.3.2 Methodology for current policy trajectory and INDC scenarios While the baseline and 2OC scenarios are drawn entirely from the IPCC AR5 database and have not been adjusted, the data sources and methodologies for the current policy trajectory and INDC scenarios are more complex, as indicated above and in Table 3.1. The methodology in the assessment of these scenarios is therefore described in more detail in the following. As mentioned, the current policy trajectory scenario draws from the current policy scenarios of three of the eight global analyses, in addition to current policy scenarios from official and independent country-specific sources. Where no data are available from official or independent country-specific sources, the assessment uses the median current policy scenario estimate from the three global studies.

This implies that publicly announced plans or strategies alone would not qualify, while individual executive orders to implement such plans or strategies would qualify. Ultimately, however, these definitions may be interpreted differently in the different underlying studies. This assessment is bound by the definitions that the individual research groups use. The INDC scenario draws on individual INDC scenarios from the same eight global analyses. It furthermore draws on official and independent country-specific sources, as indicated in Table 3.1. These are converted to two global estimates in the same manner as for the current policy trajectory scenario. Finally, it considers five additional scenarios that are created by combining emission growth rates of the non-INDC countries from five modelling groups (Tavoni et al., 2015)7 with the median emission values for INDC-countries taken from the INDC scenarios of the eight global INDC analyses, and the two additional analyses based on the aggregated official and independent country-specific data sources8. The resulting composite INDC scenario comprises the median, 10th percentile, and 90th percentile global estimates for 2025 and 2030 from all of these sources. 7 The Low climate IMpact scenarios and the Implications of required Tight emission control Strategies (LIMITS) study modelled reference scenarios con- sistent with achieving the Cancun pledges, assuming constant climate poli- cies thereafter. The LIMITS modelling groups are: Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN), Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (FEEM), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK). 8 These five scenarios represent the sum of the median value for 2025 and 2030 emissions for countries with INDCs from the ten INDC analyses (eight global studies, one official and one national global estimate) and estimated values for future emissions in non-INDC countries. The latter are calculated by applying the 2010-2030 emission growth rates from each of the five LIM- ITS studies to the median 2010 emissions of the non-INDC countries from the ten INDC analyses. This results in five additional global INDC scenarios considered in the composite INDC scenario. 3.3.3 Unconditional and conditional INDC cases As discussed in section 3.2, some countries place conditions on all or part of their INDCs. Consequently, two cases are explored in this assessment: unconditional INDCs and conditional INDCs. In the unconditional INDC case, Parties with INDCs are assumed to implement targets without conditions only. Parties that solely have a conditional target, or have not submitted an INDC, are assumed to follow a current policy trajectory. In the conditional INDC case all Parties with INDCs are assumed to implement their conditional targets. Parties that only have an unconditional target are assumed to implement that target, and Parties with no INDCs are assumed to follow a current policy trajectory, or if that is not available, a baseline scenario. In both the unconditional and the conditional INDC cases, it is assumed that for any traded international offsets, each unit is counted towards the INDC of a single country only \u2013 either the buyer or the seller. The studies from which the current policy trajectory scenario and the INDC scenario are drawn differ in a number of respects, such as: conditional versus unconditional INDCs; assumptions regarding non-covered sectors and gases; treatment of LULUCF and surplus emission units; and different bases for calculating Global Warming Potentials (GWPs). The methodological differences between the groups cannot be fully harmonized, which leads to some uncertainty as indicated in the results presented in Section 3.4, where the implications of the differences between studies are also further explored. 3.4 The effect of INDCs on global GHG emissions This section presents the findings regarding the aggregate effect on global total GHG emissions of full implementation of the INDCs in 2025 and 2030, compared to the emissions implied by baseline, current policy trajectory and 2\u00b0C scenarios.

These scenarios assume a constant level of climate mitigation from 2000 or 2005 and until 2100. 12 Note that the scenarios underlying Figure 3.3 assume a constant level of miti- gation ambition over the 21st century, from 2000 or 2005 onward. This is dif- ferent from what is assumed for the 2\u00b0C \u2013 consistent scenarios in Chapter 2, where scenarios achieve the Cancun pledges in 2020 and then start a global mitigation path towards 2\u00b0C. As a result, the 2030 emission levels in line with limiting warming to below 2\u00b0C with greater than 66 per cent chance in Figure 3.3 are lower than the levels reported in Chapter 2. 21 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 Figure 3.3 Greenhouse gas emissions levels in the year 2030 from long term scenarios that assume a constant level of climate acti on over ti me starti ng before 2010, compared to the esti mated conditi onal and unconditi onal INDC emission levels for 2030.

The 10-90th percentile range for the INDC cases is shown. The Figure illustrates that compared to the levels of 4\u00b0C and above that would be expected under baseline projections (see also Chapter 2) current policies and full implementation of the INDCs would reduce the long-term temperature projections. More specifically, Figure 3.3 illustrates that full implementation of unconditional INDC results in estimated 2030 emission levels that are most consistent with scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3.5\u00b0C by the end of the century 2100 with >66 per cent chance. Figure 3.3 furthermore illustrates that a move from implementation of the unconditional to combined implementation of both conditional and unconditional INDCs would have an effect on long-term temperature projections. Combined implementation of unconditional and conditional INDCs, results in projections becoming more consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3\u00b0C by the end of the century with a greater than 66 per cent chance13. There is significant overlap between the ranges of the unconditional and conditional INDC emission levels, as well as between the scenario bins. Taking uncertainty ranges into account, the 3.5\u00b0C value for implementation of unconditional INDCs could decrease to 3\u00b0C or increase towards 4\u00b0C for the low and high unconditional INDC estimates respectively. When including the full implementation also of conditional INDCs, the emission level estimates taking uncertainty ranges 13 Given the uncertainties in both projections and climate response, the reso- lution of the bins is limited and therefore the above-mentioned estimates are to be interpreted as indications of the broad order of magnitude of the expected avoided warming. 22 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 Figure 3.4: Global greenhouse gas emissions as implied by submitted INDCs (original data from different modelling groups, including LULUCF) Figure 3.4 (original data from di\ufb00 erent modelling groups, including LULUCF) 60 55 50 45 2010 2020 2025 2030 Uncond.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7bc1267-1e89-4c9b-b629-ccc3e0ee972c": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7bc1267-1e89-4c9b-b629-ccc3e0ee972c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9507a95204b23a43e5c95b8dfd4576445cdd31f987fb80d6aa4a9bcbb6242ed8"}, "2": {"node_id": "a03d1e92-7404-4938-961e-ac2a179b24c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2f01303bea58231dc19c7d1cee106d22e89912a5b98abb1063534f0e70f8cb9"}}, "hash": "9b75304f9cad6dd6a0f0e7ebfa506e07601eec80b97be6ec82959ed9f02b591f", "text": "Cond.

To illustrate the range of estimates from the studies considered for this assessment, Figure 3.4 provides an overview of historical emissions (2010), current policy trajectories (2020, 2025, and 2030), Cancun pledges (2020), and unconditional and conditional INDCs (2025 and 2030) by the different studies considered. The figure illustrates that differences can be significant. However, it is noteworthy that, amongst all the global modelling and country-specific scenarios, there is unanimity that full INDC implementation would indeed reduce global emission levels in 2025 and 2030 relative to the current policy trajectory. 23 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 The emissions gap in 2025 and 2030 The main factors that contribute to the discrepancies and consequently the approximate ranges in the 2030 emission estimates are described below. Where possible, the uncertainty that each discrepancy implies for 2030 global emissions, is also indicated. \u2022 Non-covered sectors and countries: There is often a significant range in the emission estimates for sectors not included under INDC pledges, such as emissions from international aviation and maritime transport (bunkers) and for countries which have not submitted an INDC. For example, the uncertainty range across the model groups for the emission projections from international bunker emissions are 1.7 GtCO2e (range: 1.3-2.1), which is consistent with the uncertainty ranges of the projections from international shipping and aviation organisations (ICAO, 2013; IMO, 2014). The results from different studies will vary, since some have explored the impact of mitigation policies of only a subset of countries. \u2022 Uncertainties surrounding the emission projections of the countries with INDCs: Modelling groups have used different assumptions regarding the implementation of INDCs. Many INDCs put forward absolute GHG emission goals, which can be represented easily. There are also many INDCs that referenced a business-as-usual emission projection. However, for most INDCs an estimate of target-year or target-period emissions is given. The quantification of these INDCs is not surrounded with moderate uncertainties (see Section 3.5). The few countries putting forward GDP emission intensity targets (measured as the improvement in emissions per unit of GDP), did not provide target-year GDP estimates or indicate the data source for GDP absolute level, BAU, or reference level if given. The quantification of these INDCs with intensity targets poses additional uncertainties. \u2022 Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF): LULUCF plays a relevant role in the mitigation target of most INDCs. Quantification of the LULUCF contribution depends on the availability of adequate official information from each country on: (i) the modality of inclusion of LULUCF in the INDC (for example, LULUCF treated as any other sector or through special accounting rules); (ii) historical data and projections (for example, from INDC, GHG inventories, National Communications, Biennial Update Reports).

In Chapter 2, the global emission pathways consistent with meeting the below 2\u00b0C target also have global emissions with a median estimate of 47.5 GtCO2e by 2010, so the discrepancy between the historical emissions and the emission projections resulting from the INDCs of the model teams has not been corrected. If we were to resolve the discrepancy in historical emissions (that is, harmonization), this would also increase the emission projections resulting from the INDCs by about 2 GtCO2e (under a constant harmonization) or about 1 GtCO2e (under a decreasing harmonization, towards zero by 2050, for example). However, as the global emission pathways consistent with meeting the 2\u00b0C target also need to be harmonized, and thus would increase by the same amount, harmonization has no impact on the global emissions gap. \u2022 Conditional versus unconditional INDCs: Some studies report separate figures for conditional and unconditional INDCs, while others combine this aspect with other uncertainties in a maximum/minimum range or leave out the conditional targets completely. \u2022 Surplus emission units: For countries where the emission level resulting from the INDC is higher than the current policy trajectory, some studies use the current policies trajectory as the value for the INDC emission level, implying that they do not allow the use of surplus emissions, whereas the other studies assume INDC emission levels. \u2022 Global Warming Potential: About 25 per cent of all countries have submitted their INDC based on GWP from the Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC.

First, due to the steep rate at which global emissions must decline after 2020 to be consistent with the 2\u00b0C scenario, the emissions gap grows rapidly over time. This underscores the importance of enhanced early action to reduce emissions. Secondly, bearing in mind the emissions gap that remains even under the most optimistic assumptions about the INDCs, countries should not assume that these proposed contributions will be sufficient to meet agreed global objectives. While an appropriate level of additional ambition would depend on equity considerations, in general, countries should expect that additional ambition will be necessary. Failure to anticipate this could result in technological lock-in and stranded assets. Third, the INDC process has proven to elicit greater ambition from countries relative to a current policy trajectory. Future calls for INDCs may therefore be successful in eliciting even greater ambition. Early calls to enhance ambition for the 2020 to 2030 timeframe can best address the need", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1b17952-30f4-4673-9144-7c0cce2aea61": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1b17952-30f4-4673-9144-7c0cce2aea61", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0779257a2e72d17cdf8b6abde74b835eafd4134bb9a11ba2910696d6aefd0303"}, "3": {"node_id": "242aec92-ec43-4c98-8628-8291814c367d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ac190dd1c2bb14dde6aa973a85a9115cdc9765910e26da819ce3ff5c2e4a6ad"}}, "hash": "441f539fe12b3ba410aa874c29d62be175a4e3f7ed089fe656696d4828030c15", "text": "for enhanced early action. In this context the IPCC AR5 (IPCC, 2014) highlighted that if GHG emissions are above 55 GtCO2e in 2030, challenges of transitioning to low emission levels in line with 2\u00b0C in the longer term will become particularly daunting (Figure 6.32 in Clarke et al., 2014). The challenges are much reduced if 2030 Kyoto-GHG emissions are kept below 50 GtCO2e (Clarke et al., 2014), or even more so, to 42 GtCO2e in line with a least- cost 2\u00b0C pathway after 2020. To sum up, this assessment of the aggregate effect of the INDCs on global total GHG emissions in 2025 and 2030 essentially tells two stories. First, the INDCs do present a real increase in the levels of ambition compared to a projection of current policies; all global modelling analyses and scenarios based on country-specific data sources assessed, reached this conclusion. Secondly, however, the ambitions are far from sufficient, and the emissions gap in 2030 is very significant. Unless ambition is raised rapidly, the projected emission levels resulting from the INDCs are likely to lead to a path that at best will be consistent with an increase in global average temperature of below 3oC in 2100. If considering unconditional INDC levels only, the projected temperature increase is closer to below 3.5oC. Taking uncertainty ranges into account, the emission level estimates under full implementation of both unconditional and conditional INDCs become most consistent with long-term scenarios that limit global average temperature increase to below 3-3.5\u00b0C by the end of the century with >66 per cent chance. 28 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Opportunities for bridging the gap Opportunities for bridging the gap Chapter 4 Lead author: Anne Olhoff (UNEP DTU Partnership) Contributing author: John Christensen (UNEP DTU Partnership) 4.1 Introduction The INDCs represent a real increase in the level of mitigation ambition compared to a continuation of current policies. However, as Chapter 3 illustrates, even with combined implementation of unconditional and conditional INDCs, the emissions gap in 2030 is estimated to be in the order of 12 GtCO2e. The central question is then if and how this emissions gap can be narrowed and potentially bridged? This second part of the Emissions Gap Report explores some of the answers to this question. Assessing the most recent literature, it sets off by providing an overview of key issues and opportunities for narrowing and potentially bridging the emissions gap in 2030 in this chapter. These opportunities include: \u2022 Establishing a dynamic framework under the Paris Agreement to drive continuous strengthening of mitigation ambition and ensure efficient implementation of the agreement \u2022 Boosting pre-2020 mitigation action to reduce mitigation costs, avoid lock-in and maintain a possibility of staying below 1.5\u00b0C by 2100 \u2022 Introducing, replicating and scaling up good practice mitigation action, enabling countries to overachieve on their INDCs and bring about a transition to a low carbon economy \u2022 Full integration of development and climate co- benefits in policies, planning and action. This is followed by 2 chapters providing in-depth assessment of opportunities to further tap into emission reduction potentials in one cross-cutting area, International Cooperative Initiatives (Chapter 5), and for one sector, forestry (Chapter 6). 4.2 Ensuring coherence, synergy and complementarity between climate change, economic growth and sustainable development A deeper understanding and recognition of the interdependency between climate change, economic growth and sustainable development has emerged over the past decade. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) recently adopted in New York by Heads of State of all member states of the United Nations (UN, 2015a) (see also Chapter 1) are an exemplification of this recognition. The SDG process explicitly recommends prioritizing coherence, co-benefits, and complementarity between a climate change agreement under the UNFCCC and the SDGs. The interrelationships between climate and development are demonstrated in the SDGs and the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2014a, 2014b). Similarly linkages between economic growth, sustainable development and climate change are echoed across the recent literature (GGBP, 2014; Ansuategi et al., 2015; GCEC 2015a, 2015b; IEA, 2015a, 2015b).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "242aec92-ec43-4c98-8628-8291814c367d": {"__data__": {"id_": "242aec92-ec43-4c98-8628-8291814c367d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0779257a2e72d17cdf8b6abde74b835eafd4134bb9a11ba2910696d6aefd0303"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1b17952-30f4-4673-9144-7c0cce2aea61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "441f539fe12b3ba410aa874c29d62be175a4e3f7ed089fe656696d4828030c15"}}, "hash": "9ac190dd1c2bb14dde6aa973a85a9115cdc9765910e26da819ce3ff5c2e4a6ad", "text": "A briefing paper prepared for the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in New York earlier this year states that \u201cProgress towards many SDGs will be affected, overwhelmingly negatively, by climate change (for example food security, water scarcity and water related disasters, poverty and livelihoods, health, and the well-being of ocean and terrestrial ecosystems)\u201d (UN, 2015a, p.2).

In order to get both political engagement and input for consideration, the draft INDC was submitted for public consultation over a period of 4 months with public briefings throughout the country. Proposals received went into a revision process for the draft INDC and final decision rested with the Council. Mitigation discussion was focused around two possible emission intensity targets for the country with different implications but neither of them was seen as damaging to the economy. So climate change policies were treated, in effect, as an integral part of overall national development. Box 4.2: Preparation of the INDC in the Gambia The INDC of the Gambia comprehensively addresses mitigation and adaptation and relevant means for implementation like finance, technology and capacity building. The INDC process has been founded in the context of the regular national development planning process. The national INDC preparation process has a strong focus on stakeholder engagement with sensitization workshops in each of the eight districts of the country and broad cross ministerial and institutional engagement in the actual preparation of the national submission. As a small LDC the Gambia has limited mitigation potential but has identified a number of areas like renewable energy, forestry and agriculture where actions can be implemented - some domestically, others requiring international financial and technological support. Similarly, the recent IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report states with high confidence that climate change poses a threat to equitable and sustainable development (IPCC, 2014a). However, the report also finds that it is possible to pursue strategies and actions that will move towards climate- resilient pathways for sustainable development, while simultaneously facilitating improved livelihoods, social and economic well-being and effective environmental management (IPCC, 2014a). The SDG Goal 13 \u201cTake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\u201d specifically acknowledges that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change (UN, 2015b), and the targets associated with the Goal are clearly aligned with the ambitions in the INDCs. From the assessment of the submitted INDCs it is evident that many countries have established national processes that are explicitly anchored in an understanding of climate change mitigation and adaptation in the broader context of sustainable development planning at the national level (see Box 4.1 and 4.2). 4.3 A robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework under the Paris Agreement is vital to narrow the emissions gap A robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework is critical to ensure the implementation of an ambitious global agreement on climate change. The SDG process has emphasized the importance of establishing a framework for periodic follow-up and review of progress towards implementation of the SDGs and mobilization of further action to accelerate implementation with a four-year interval (UN, 2015c). A similar approach seems likely to feature in the Paris Agreement. As of 23 October 2015, the UNFCCC draft negotiating text includes mention of periodical global stocktakes of the implementation of the Paris Agreement guided by modalities to be adopted by a body under the new agreement at its first session1. A dynamic approach of the Paris Agreement that enables countries to regularly review and strengthen their INDCs is consistently highlighted as essential to enhance mitigation ambition and narrow the emissions gap (GCEC, 2015a; IDDRI, 2015; IEA, 2015a; INDC Forum, 2015; Spencer et al., 2015). In this way it has been stressed that the first round of INDCs should be seen as the basis for a \u2018virtuous circle\u2019 of rising ambition (IEA, 2015a), and as representing \u2018floors rather than ceilings\u2019 to national ambition over the coming years (GCEC, 2015a). In this context it is important to note that the social and political effects of the INDCs and the processes undertaken at national level transcend the aggregate effect they are estimated to have on total global GHG emission levels in 2025 and 2030. The preparation of the INDCs, has in many countries incentivized exploration of linkages between development and climate outcomes, and can be seen as a step towards a transition to a low carbon economy. As Figures 3.6 and 3.7 in Chapter 3 illustrate, in many cases the INDCs support a decoupling of economic growth and emissions growth, and reduce per capita emissions. The Paris Agreement can support these national transitions and provide the framework for mobilization of the enhanced mitigation effort", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9189571-4ba1-4ea8-b90d-c92a8c431ae1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9189571-4ba1-4ea8-b90d-c92a8c431ae1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26ac3e5140724fc8004b30a99c4720ca90bab0e2bea19dc47f170db3516eccab"}, "3": {"node_id": "14fe3891-b597-4244-8388-378f97128e90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f51ca55cc1b32c19f0078f732aba7d64eaddd3a01f401704d9bdc6ed296acc73"}}, "hash": "73de756ae673042cb2398d7c269ce09807c8c0a34cbdf2017bc573ed1d85fd60", "text": "that is required to align national efforts with the global mitigation ambition indicated by the 2oC pathways. 1 Draft text available at http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/bonn_oct_2015/ap- plication/pdf/ws_1_and_2.pdf [Accessed 6 November 2015]. 30 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Opportunities for bridging the gap Establishing a robust, effective and transparent follow-up and review framework as part of the Paris Agreement will be critical in this context. The following sections look into the opportunities for further enhancing mitigation action to narrow and potentially bridge the emissions gap, which would support the transition towards a low carbon economy and facilitate overachievement of the emission reductions put forward in the INDCs. 4.4 Bridging the gap \u2013 realizing emission reduction potentials by 2020 and 2030 4.4.1 The critical role of boosting pre-2020 mitigation action The importance of increasing pre-2020 mitigation action was underscored in Chapter 2. Reducing emissions compared to the current policy trajectories before 2020 will not only improve the chances for achieving the stringent emission reductions that are required after 2020 to limit warming to below 2\u00b0C by 2100. It will also reduce the costs of emission reductions, avoid lock-in of carbon and energy intensive infrastructure, and lower the risk associated with substantial dependence on negative emissions beyond 2050 to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C. In addition, as shown in Chapter 2, enhanced early action that goes beyond current policies would facilitate maintaining the option of limiting warming to below 1.5\u00b0C in 2100 (with a greater than 50 per cent chance). Previous Emissions Gap Reports (UNEP, 2011, 2012, 2013) showed estimates of the aggregate emission reduction potential by sector by 20202. This potential was based on studies that assumed earlier and more stringent mitigation action than indicated by the current policy trajectory. As we get closer to 2020, it is no longer possible to realize the full 2020 emission reduction potential referred to in previous Emissions Gap Reports. One reason is that often there is a considerable time lag between the adoption of emission reducing policies and options, their implementation and the reaping of the associated emission reductions. In addition, failure to invest in best available technologies and options as early as possible constrains our ability, in the near-future, to reduce emissions in some sectors and cross-cutting areas, because of lock-in of higher-energy use and emission investments with long timeframes. The size of the remaining emission reduction potential by 2020 is difficult to assess, as few comprehensive updated studies are available. However, three recent technical reports by the UNFCCC (2014a, 2014b, 2015) highlight that significant emission reduction potential by 2020 remains. These reports focus on the thematic areas of renewable energy; energy efficiency; land use; urban environments; carbon dioxide capture, use and storage; and non-carbon dioxide GHG emissions. Another recent study finds that scaling up and replicating current good practices could, reduce global emissions by around 2 Assessed in previous Emissions Gap Reports to be in the order of 17 \u00b1 3 GtCO2e, adopting a sectoral bottom-up approach, with marginal costs of up to US$50\u2013100/tCO2e. 4.6 GtCO2e in 2020, if wide-spread and urgent action is undertaken (Fekete et al., 2015). 4.4.2 Reaping emission reduction potentials by 2030 to narrow and potentially bridge the gap Extensive emission reduction potential by 2030 Looking beyond 2020, a number of recent studies and reports, including by the IPCC and leading international institutions, identify a significant emissions reduction potential by 2030 (IPCC, 2014b; IRENA, 2014; Fekete et al., 2015; GCEC, 2015a; IDDRI, 2015; IEA, 2015a; JRC, 2015; OECD/IEA/ NEA/ITF, 2015). Acknowledging that the methodologies, assumptions, scope and coverage of measures vary across these studies, they all document that tapping into unused emission reduction potential could narrow the emissions gap in 2030 considerably. Specific examples are presented in Table 4.1 showing emission reduction opportunities by 2030 estimated by different studies, and how this potential relates to the gap assessment findings presented in Chapter 3. Only studies that allow comparison of emission reductions relative to the INDC case levels are included in the table. Several other recent studies show sizeable emission reduction potential in specific sectors or thematic areas, but cannot be directly compared to the 2030 baseline, current policy trajectory and INDC emission levels from Chapter 3 and are therefore not included in the table.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14fe3891-b597-4244-8388-378f97128e90": {"__data__": {"id_": "14fe3891-b597-4244-8388-378f97128e90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26ac3e5140724fc8004b30a99c4720ca90bab0e2bea19dc47f170db3516eccab"}, "2": {"node_id": "a9189571-4ba1-4ea8-b90d-c92a8c431ae1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73de756ae673042cb2398d7c269ce09807c8c0a34cbdf2017bc573ed1d85fd60"}}, "hash": "f51ca55cc1b32c19f0078f732aba7d64eaddd3a01f401704d9bdc6ed296acc73", "text": "Taken together, the studies shown in Table 4.1 indicate that global GHG emissions could be further reduced in 2030 by between 5-12 GtCO2e (range: 3-13) relative to the emissions level resulting from implementation of the unconditional INDCs, and between 5-10 GtCO2e (range: 1-11) relative to the emissions level associated with implementation of the conditional INDCs.

There is considerable uncertainty associated with the emission reduction potential estimated in the studies included in Table 4.1. On the other hand, the studies do not cover all possible measures, thematic areas or sectors. The study by NCI, PBL and IIASA (Fekete et al., 2015), for example, excludes potential emission reductions in agriculture, parts of the transport and industrial sector, waste, and bunkers. Similarly, the IEA study only considers options for reducing energy-related CO2 emissions. In other words the total technical and economic emission reduction potential in 2030 could very well be larger than indicated in the table.

For the industry sector overall, global mitigation potentials in 2030 of up to 8 GtCO2e are referenced in AR5 (IPCC, 2014b).

Such policies have the potential to make a significant contribution to bridging the gap, if scaled up in terms of ambition and geographical coverage.

Their success also depends on how stringently they are implemented. assessed in earlier UNEP Emissions Gap Reports and where significant opportunities for bridging the gap have been highlighted through possibilities for replication, acceleration and scaling up proven good practices and policies. The importance of scaling up good practices and policies There is immense potential for reducing emissions through world-wide replication and scaling up of good practices and policies as illustrated above. However, the emission reduction potentials shown in the previous sections can only be realized if strong, long-term and sector-specific policies are put in place at the global and national levels without delay. Previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report (UNEP 2012, 2013, 2014) have demonstrated how proven policies can be scaled up (both in ambition and geographical reach) across countries and regions taking national differences and circumstances into account. Box 4.3 summarizes key proven policies in different areas considered in earlier Emissions Gap Reports. 33 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Opportunities for bridging the gap Consideration of multiple benefits essential Previous editions of the Emissions Gap Report have emphasized that in many, if not most, cases climate change mitigation is not the primary driver for action, but rather a significant co-benefit of sound sectoral and national development planning and policies. The previous Emissions Gap Reports offer examples of how ambitious policy instruments that lead to significant emission reductions can foster innovation and economic growth, bolster national energy security, improve public health and address other key developmental priorities. The feasibility of introducing, replicating or expanding ambitious regulatory measures, market- and price-based instruments, and command-and-control measures varies across thematic areas, sectors and countries (UNEP, 2012; IPCC, 2014b). In order to build a strong case for enhanced action by policy makers and other stakeholders, it will be important to provide clear and convincing documentation of the wide range of benefits associated with the implementation of the policies and actions that can bring about the needed reductions of GHG emissions (UNEP, 2012). Numerous studies confirm that many actions that reduce GHG emissions are associated with considerable co-benefits (IPCC, 2014a; Parry, et al., 2014; WB, 2014; Fekete et al., 2015; GCEC, 2015b; H\u00f6hne et al., 2015; UNFCCC, 2014a, 2014b, 2015). Accounting for co-benefits reduces the average cost of emission reduction options and increases the total emission reduction potential associated with a net benefit. For energy efficiency options, inclusion of multiple benefits in some cases triples the overall benefit of these options, notably where they heavily reduce coal use (GCEC, 2015b). Options associated with net costs, may also swing to net benefits when co-benefits are taken into account. This is, for example, the case for reduced deforestation, recycling of new waste, and offshore wind (GCEC, 2015b). Full integration of co-benefits in planning and decision- making can thus have profound implications for climate and development action. 34 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 International cooperative initiatives International Cooperative Initiatives Chapter 5 Lead authors: Walter Vergara (UNEP DTU Partnership / World Resources Institute), Michiel Schaeffer (Climate Analytics), Kornelis Blok (Ecofys) Contributing authors: Andrzej Ancygier (Climate Analytics), Skylar Bee (UNEP DTU Partnership), Philip Drost (United Nations Environment Programme), Lara Esser (Ecofys), Mark Roelfsema (PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency) 5.1 Introduction The objective of this chapter is to provide an assessment based on published or readily available information of the possible contribution to global mitigation efforts especially by key International Cooperative Initiatives (ICIs).

Across this spectrum, ICIs cover a wide range of activities, and although it is a challenge to cover them comprehensively, an effort has been made to assess available information and prioritize initiatives according to their potential mitigation significance. The chapter starts by presenting the results of a number of recent studies regarding the potential emission reduction contribution of ICIs together with an assessment as to what extent ICI contributions can be considered as additional to those anticipated from the Cancun pledges. This is followed by an examination of the links between national level cooperative initiatives and the UNFCCC process, with examples from selected INDCs submitted during 2015. The chapter then presents a detailed overview of ICIs grouped into three categories, cities and regions, companies and sectors, which helps illustrate the innovative approaches adopted by many non-state actors and facilitate opportunities for identifying new types of partnerships that could contribute to addressing the mitigation challenge. A particular effort has been made to examine south-south initiatives that may have been under-represented in past reviews. The chapter focuses on actions on the ground rather than enabling measures, as the former are more quantifiable. Particular attention is given to private sector activities which, under favourable policy and legislative frameworks, strengthen technological innovation. 5.2 Quantitative impact of ICIs on emission reductions An earlier estimate of the possible emissions reduction impact of ICIs was reported in the Emissions Gap Report 2013 (UNEP, 2013). This report stated a total expected impact of about 10 GtCO2e in 2020, based on a number of underlying studies (Blok et al., 2012; IEA, 2013; UNFCCC, 2013). A number of recent studies have estimated both the gross emission reduction potential of ICIs for 2020 and 2030, and, for 2020, attempted to calculate net impacts additional to what will be included in the 2020 pledge achievement. These include a study carried out for UNEP by Ecofys (UNEP, 2015), a study by Yale University (Hsu et al., 2015) and a study by the Netherlands\u2019 Environmental Assessment Agency (Roelfsema et al., 2015). An overview of the results, broken down by sector is given in Table 5.4. Although all studies have comparable methodologies (Mosteller and Hsu, 2015) and consider similar categories, there are marked differences in scope between the studies. UNEP (2015) started from all initiatives gathered on the Climate Initiatives Platform (CIP, 2015), and then selected the most significant ones for quantitative analysis. Commitments made at the New York Climate Summit in 2014 were not included because of their early stage of development. This summit sparked significant new engagement on climate action and a number of new ICI type commitments were presented (Climate Change Summary, 2014). Hsu et al. (2015) explicitly focus on these new commitments from the Climate Summit. Roelfsema et al. (2015) took a similar approach as the UNEP report, but the authors used a different baseline scenario. They also included major initiatives outside the UNFCCC framework (for example, those of national governments 35 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 International cooperative initiatives under the Montreal Protocol). This is also the only study to project possible emission reduction contributions to 2030, partly through extrapolation. Findings from a further study (CISL/Ecofys, 2015) have been also been included in the assessment, even if the coverage was more restricted. These differences in scope and coverage indicate that the total impact of non-state climate action could be larger than reported by each individual study, as they do not fully overlap. An overall conclusion of the assessment is that the impact of non-state climate commitments can be very significant, most likely in the range of 2.5-4 GtCO2e in 2020 (taking into account that not all initiatives are included in all assessments). This already accounts for an estimate of overlap between the various initiatives, in terms of actual actions, sectors, greenhouse gases and regions. It is difficult to estimate the overlap between these non- state initiatives and national government pledges for 2020. Overlap between these varies from full overlap, for example for the Global Fuel Efficiency Initiative, to virtually no overlap, for example for the international marine and aviation sector (Roelfsema et al., 2015). For countries with economy-wide reduction pledges the overlap is hard to estimate, but likely to be larger, compared to the overlap for countries with very narrowly defined pledges limited to one or two particular sectors. Roelfsema et al. (2015) estimated the overlap for individual initiatives and country pledges and, by aggregating this to the global level, found a total of 70 per cent overlap between initiatives included and government pledges for the year 2020.

It is currently difficult to assess whether international initiatives actually deliver. Most initiatives put forward voluntary commitments which makes it difficult to enforce accountability and compliance. For some initiatives this leads to a lack of robust Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) (IVM, 2015). In practice, actors may over- or under-deliver compared to their commitments (see section 5.4.2 on delivery by companies). Although the 2013 Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2013) quoted a non-state contribution of just under 10 GtCO2e/yr by 2020, this represented an acknowledged overlap with national pledges that was not quantified. Beyond the possible direct mitigation contribution either as part of fulfilling government pledges or providing additional reductions, it is important to stress the possibilities for growth and acceleration of initiatives. A recent study (CISL/Ecofys, 2015) illustrates in several areas that there is significant potential for scaling up initiatives. The development and engagement of ICIs are rapidly evolving within all the different categories, therefore the results presented in this section must be seen as a snapshot of where ICIs stand today. It would have been very interesting to assess the possible contribution from ICIs for 2030 and similarly, as with pledges, to examine how much of this contribution would be additional to the new INDCs. However, although PBL (Roelfsema et al., 2015) does offer an extrapolation of the total expected impact of ICIs in 2030 (midpoint estimate 5.5 GtCO2e), it is not feasible at this point to consider questions of 2030 additionality in any meaningful way. 5.3 Non-state actors and the UNFCCC process In view of the importance of cooperative initiatives (often led by non-state actors) in low carbon development, some UNFCCC Parties and observers have called for better representation of their role in the UNFCCC process (Chan and Paux, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9777d27a-9e1e-4485-a95b-9ee56253fc01": {"__data__": {"id_": "9777d27a-9e1e-4485-a95b-9ee56253fc01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "581f3f53d5e2d1214d55e2842eeff1aaaf118e0a039a7827739e340ba4c07369"}, "2": {"node_id": "bff02d68-ad08-4b6d-ba70-2ca7b96399df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "930f22e0a24b5ad69ec312a8cf5d971bf95b852732ca576abe40ed3da51a7985"}}, "hash": "d0c57081e39d5bdbe1e104bef410b6fc1661ca1299311bd0a13f5f7bcad03f01", "text": "In December 2014 at the COP 20 in Lima, a new platform was launched to showcase climate mitigation initiatives as distinct from national pledges (NAZCA, 2015).

In Brazil, Observat\u00f3rio do Clima, a Brazilian coalition comprising more than 30 NGOs, has estimated annual GHG emissions estimates for Brazil since 2013. Even before the INDC process, the organization had already participated in domestic consultations led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In Senegal, a non-governmental organization, Enda Energie, participated in the sectoral and national reports validation workshops and contributed to the preparation of scenarios used as the basis for the INDC18. The contribution of non-state actors to climate mitigation actions will continue following the submission of INDCs. They can be instrumental not only in facilitating the achievement of the emission reduction targets, but also in monitoring, reporting and verification of actions at national level (Dodwell et al., 2015). Some INDCs acknowledge the contribution of non-state actors. Mexico states that multiple stakeholders have been consulted during the INDC preparation, including NGOs specializing in adaptation. Interestingly, few INDCs have highlighted the role of non-state initiatives in mitigation. An exception is China, which plans to \u201c[\u2026] conduct low- carbon cities (towns) pilots as well as low-carbon industrial parks, low-carbon communities, low-carbon business and low-carbon transport pilots\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015). Indonesia mentions \u201c[\u2026] active participation of the private sector, small and medium enterprises, civil society organizations, local communities and the most vulnerable groups [\u2026]\u201d in sustainable forest management (UNFCCC, 2015). 5.4 Summary of Initiatives This section presents a review of the recent literature on ICIs with a main focus on initiatives that have substantial mitigation potential. Various reports (Hale and Roger, 2014; Hsu et al., 2015; Roelfsema et al., 2015; Roger et al., 2015; UNEP, 2015) provide an overview of what has been announced or implemented by subnational governments, such as cities, municipalities and regions, company initiatives and initiatives with a specific sectoral focus. Descriptions of initiatives can be found on the Climate Initiatives Platform (CIP, 2015) and the NAZCA portal (NAZCA, 2015). Monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) arrangements for the various initiatives is also assessed, as this is a key element in providing transparency and ensuring credibility. The ICIs considered are grouped into three categories, cities and regions, companies and sectors. 5.4.1 Cities and regions initiatives Subnational governments can act on climate change mitigation in many ways. Sub-national jurisdictions, such as state or regional governments, have even attempted to 18 Direct communication with the NGO\u2019s representative. 37 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 International cooperative initiatives compensate for the lack of political will at the national level (Somanathan et al., 2014). There are many ICIs in which several cities and regions cooperate; for example, UNEP\u2019s recent report on subnational actors lists twenty one initiatives of this type (UNEP, 2015). A few started in the 1990s19, while the majority started in the period 2005-201220 and some were announced during the UN Secretary-General\u2019s Climate Summit in September 201421. Initiatives focus on the following roles: \u2022 Encouraging or facilitating emission reductions at the city and regional level, via knowledge sharing, capacity building and technical support for project planning and implementation \u2022 Identifying partnerships and supporting local communities to become climate resilient \u2022 Representing common city-level interests to influence policymakers at other levels \u2022 Helping implement climate plans and low-carbon and climate-resilient economic development projects \u2022 Achieving transparency and accountability by encouraging best practice in GHG emission reporting \u2022 Helping overcome financial barriers and attract investors and accelerate additional capital flows into cities for low carbon projects.

Cities participating in the Compact of Mayors are requested to use the Global Protocol for Community-scale GHG emissions (GPC) and they are also required within 3 years to submit a climate action plan which includes an implementation and monitoring plan. The cities and regions initiatives generally have designated registries (see Table 5.2). In the case of the newer initiatives such as the Compact of Cities and Compact of States and Regions, signatories have the choice of reporting to the carbonn Climate Registry or CDP. In addition to reporting on GHG emissions, signatories are requested to advise which GHG protocol and emissions factors were applied. The Compact of Mayors requires a complete updated inventory every three years23. Annual reports or summaries are published by the initiatives or the reporting platform. These include the total planned emission reductions and often the base year of emissions, without specifying the current progress towards the emission reduction targets. Such information is currently only publicly available for a limited number of cities such as those under the Covenant of Mayors. The cities that disclose their information to CDP also provide information on whether or not their GHG emissions inventory has been verified by a third party. While the SEAPs that are submitted to the Covenant of Mayor are subject to verification by the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, the monitoring progress reports available for certain cities on the website do not indicate that they are third party verified. Participating authorities to the CDP States and Regions platform will be asked to report whether data sources have been verified. It is evident from the assessment of cities and regions initiatives that there are a number of different approaches to especially monitoring and reporting and generally limited independent verification. Recent development indicates that the initiatives are gradually building the necessary processes and moving towards more uniform approaches. 23 The year of the inventory should not be more than three years prior to the reporting year \u2013 that is, in 2017 inventories must be dated between 2014 and 2016.

A total of 30 such initiatives are currently listed on the Climate Initiatives Platform (CIP, 2015). Many of these initiatives act more as convening platforms for exchange of best practice and advocacy than engaging in direct commitments. But some have objectives that indirectly lead to emission reduction, for example, those aiming to re-direct investment to clean energy. An overview of companies\u2019 initiatives that focus on direct GHG emission reduction is provided in Table 5.3. One common characteristic, of the initiatives with considerable potential for emission reductions (UNEP, 2015), is the requirement for participating companies to set their own emission reduction commitments. The most recent climate initiative assessed in this chapter, the Science Based Target Initiative which was launched in 2014, requests participating companies to set targets that are compatible with a global 2\u00b0C goal (CDP, WRI and WWF, 2014). There is a trend towards more collaboration between different kinds of partners. Most private sector companies\u2019 initiatives have up to 50 member companies, while others like the Caring for Climate Initiative has over 380 signatories. Monitoring, reporting and verification Among companies initiatives, members of the Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI) use the Cement CO2 and Energy Protocol, while others reporting via CDP routinely use The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. The Caring for Climate companies are recommended to use CDP\u2019s reporting process on an annual basis. Other alternatives are the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) guidelines and the Global Compact Advanced Communication on Progress (COP). Almost all companies of the Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC), the majority of WWF Climate Savers and CSI26 companies, and half of the participating companies of Ultra-Low CO2 Steelmaking (ULCOS) initiative self-report to CDP by means of a questionnaire. The information related to supply chain or climate change reported to CDP as part of their corporate disclosure can be viewed by registered users. The company can choose via the CDP Platform, whether their disclosure is available to registered users and whether their submission is scored. The Caring for Climate companies should annually report by means of a Communication on Progress-Climate (COP- Climate), which is available via the initiative\u2019s website27. 26 CSI companies can also report their information to a voluntary and indepen- dently-managed database of CO2 and energy performance information of the global cement industry called Getting the Numbers Right (GNR). Annual summary information is published. The database covers over 930 individual facilities including non-CSI. 27 Failure to prepare a publicly available COP-Climate report will result in a change of status (to \u201cnon-communicating\u201d) and eventually in the delisting of a signatory from Caring for Climate. Annual reports or summaries are published by the various initiatives or reporting platforms, covering total planned emission reductions and often the base year of emissions, without specifying the current progress towards the emission reduction targets. The companies that disclose their information to the CDP, report whether their information on GHG emissions has been verified, whether assurance is still underway or whether no third party verification took place. The annual reports of Caring for Climate are self-assessed. The overall picture on MRV for company initiatives is, therefore, quite similar to that for cities and regions though with variation in approach and limited evidence of verification at present. Progress towards goals An important question is to what extent companies are on track to reach their goals. According to their Progress Report (Caring for Climate, 2014), which lists both large companies and SMEs, a subsample of 33 large companies with high quality data for 2012 and 2013 demonstrated a decrease in GHG emission levels of around 13 per cent against 2007 levels. However, the CDP Carbon Action Report 2014 (CDP, 2014) suggests that more than half of the companies in its sample did not set absolute targets and a quarter of absolute targets ended in the reporting year. The report notes that 70 per cent of the correctly set absolute targets by companies \u201c[\u2026] will not be achieved in a business-as-usual scenario and further action will be required\u201d (CDP, 2014, p.12). 41 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 International cooperative initiatives Table 5.3: Overview of Companies initiatives Initiative/Date of establishment Description Members Partnership/collaboration Business Environmental Leadership Council (BELC) (1998) BELC is the largest US-based group of corporations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ed47b62-8abf-4fc2-a9ac-678d2ba264ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ed47b62-8abf-4fc2-a9ac-678d2ba264ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35597fe4a30527357a9c09e1972d4771981b6f610f0d2df522aae298b6aaaedf"}, "2": {"node_id": "396e1df1-10d4-4f28-a23b-b421134ee6bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de9e4ebfa1faa8cf4c7952e8ae29203b3268d7042bb2542e2920e2d2c695578d"}}, "hash": "941440a1a6e0b24e428c36a2aef0427fc56a9e625c20b2b0370d5c7d2b9f2527", "text": "Companies adopt voluntary emission reduction targets and innovative programs in energy, carbon sequestration and waste management. 39 participants (global) (as of October 2015) Led by Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) Cement Sustainability Initiative (CSI)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b77f356-cc8b-4ce7-94c7-9c2f0828d122": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b77f356-cc8b-4ce7-94c7-9c2f0828d122", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55f25697a734fd6d15f8d396f1d40788b4cb31e9226114f9790ed0b4763fc624"}, "3": {"node_id": "fea1d7c8-b1d8-4c7e-a437-2c6013aa09bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5e577deb7ecd866c596041a7be3dfe8bb8ba1eebcd3e565a8c327a88220451b"}}, "hash": "c63748deaf33431ff5824d2ca416ca5ed30f9abaaa54e67269fa200b23155e91", "text": "(1999) CSI is an alliance of 25 leading companies in the global cement industry created under the auspices of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

There is a clear likelihood of overlap between the sector initiatives and the other categories (cities and regions, and companies), but recent estimates indicate this overlap to be relatively small \u2013 less than 10 per cent \u2013 in the region of 0.21 GtCO2e/yr by 2020 on a total impact range of 2.5-3.3 GtCO2e/yr by 2020 (UNEP, 2015). Table 5.4 identifies principal sector-led initiatives. 5.5 The private sector and innovation in mitigation Looking beyond ICIs, the private sector is engaged in a wide range of climate activities that have the potential to reduce carbon intensity in many economies (Vergara et al., 2015). Acknowledging the critical role of favourable policy and regulatory frameworks, the private sector is instrumental for innovation, as innovation stems from technology advances, often through new economic and financial opportunities, and market-based risk-taking undertaken by the private sector. Selected examples include: \u2022 Renewable energy, which has seen annual investments grow between 2004-2014 by 500 per cent from US$45 billion to US$270 billion (FS UNEP Centre, 2015) partially as a result of significant reductions in capital and operation and maintenance costs. For example, PV utility-size costs have been consistently falling at 22 per cent per year since 1976 (Seba, 2014). Capital costs for wind energy have also seen substantial decreases (IRENA, 2015). This pace of change is already affecting how new capacity is being planned and has the potential to bring substantive additional changes in the power generation market in the near future \u2022 Deployment of distributed power, which has the ability to shift modes of generation and transmission from 43 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 International cooperative initiatives centralized solutions with large grids to local systems with only distribution grids, resulting in lower overall costs in many developing countries, in particular for rural and isolated communities \u2022 Electric power storage, which has seen an average reduction in production costs of 14 per cent per year during the period 2007-2014 and may be at a tipping point for mass production (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015) \u2022 Electric vehicle technologies, which are projected to potentially disrupt the use of fossil fuels in transport and may represent one of the largest available energy efficiency measures (Vergara et al., 2015), and \u2022 The application of land restoration practices, which can significantly impact accumulation of carbon sinks. Most, if not all, of these measures are also associated with significant co-benefits, for example through improvements in energy security, reductions in emissions of harmful airborne pollutants, increased food security, and recovery of soil and water quality (IPCC, 2014; Vergara et al., 2015). Together these developments improve the outlook for substantial reductions in global carbon emissions, in some cases at an unexpected pace, bringing new market solutions into play \u2013 working hand in hand with enabling policy from government and behaviour change initiatives in civil society. In the broader picture of raising ambition and closing the gap, these recent developments indicate that acceleration is possible with the right incentives, and action on the ground may eventually surpass formal commitments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f20b634b-354c-42ab-8e69-a7cb2e4ca641": {"__data__": {"id_": "f20b634b-354c-42ab-8e69-a7cb2e4ca641", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e04eb58a92a5774d0aa70dbf3c6b4ccf88eef34d169332806603212357077f06"}, "2": {"node_id": "bfa236e6-237f-457b-a511-8985ea659eee", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "161e7d7532501d3654b51b93b290dd2a35942976ae4b6ce61dd90a81f2c0a096"}}, "hash": "296aace91f3b34f32459305683440f8b84563b3e0cbd121fa6f5869439981733", "text": "44 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Mitigation potential from forest-related activities and incentives for enhanced action in developing countries Mitigation potential from forest- related activities and incentives for enhanced action in developing countries Chapter 6 Lead authors: Lera Miles (UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre), Denis Jean Sonwa (Center for International Forestry Research) Contributing authors: Riyong Kim Bakkegaard (UNEP DTU Partnership), Blaise Bodin (UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre), Re- becca Mant (UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre), Lisen Runsten (UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre), Maria Sanz Sanchez (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), Kimberly Todd (United Nations Development Programme), Francesco Tubiello (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations), Arief Wijaya (Centre for International Forestry Research / Thuenen Institute Hamburg) 6.1 Introduction Forest-related mitigation activities in both developing and developed countries represent important opportunities for climate change", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b2dcfd1-9b31-4b31-b219-c6f32a7da2d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b2dcfd1-9b31-4b31-b219-c6f32a7da2d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2b0636b21f0c4e7b228bd8586966f7f63009e92d88df461789465d3b2902986"}, "3": {"node_id": "5428d0b4-f592-49f0-9dc3-627b298f3fb1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "769e762a5da062fa61c324bed4b66d11362f60f65b511285201f609bbd20101d"}}, "hash": "5b1510efeac80d14d3c590d6a57e3b5343659e8548c2c4de64ecf35399ef3ca6", "text": "mitigation, and enhanced action on these activities could contribute significantly to narrowing the emissions gap. The IPCC AR5 (Smith et al., 2014) highlights that 12 per cent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (in the period 2000-2009) come from forests and other land use change. Forests hold large carbon stores within their living biomass (above and below ground), in dead organic matter (litter/dead wood) and in soil. Enhanced mitigation action could involve enhancing carbon stocks in new or existing forests, changes to forest management, and increased reforestation and afforestation. This chapter starts by providing a global overview of existing statements regarding intended forest-related mitigation actions by countries, including in their INDCs. This is followed by a review of the range of available forest-related mitigation options. International multi-stakeholder partnerships such as the New York Declaration on Forests and the Bonn Challenge on forest landscape restoration have focused on ambitious global objectives for the sector. Over the last ten years, there has also been considerable effort and progress under the UNFCCC in negotiating the set of policy approaches and interventions known as REDD+ (reducing GHG emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, \u2018plus\u2019 conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks), which is considered a key option under the UNFCCC for facilitating specific cost-effective contribution to climate change mitigation in developing countries (Eliasch, 2008; UNFCCC, 2009). Reflecting the political interest in REDD+, the chapter has a special focus on assessing the potential contribution of carbon dioxide emissions reductions and sequestration from forest-related activities in developing countries to bridging the emissions gap in 2030; and the role REDD+ can play as a key instrument to realize these reductions. 6.2 Global overview of forest-related mitigation engagement Countries are already committing to substantial efforts towards forest-related mitigation. To date a total of 109 countries (counting the EU as one), including 94 developing countries1, have made statements regarding their willingness to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, or to enhance forest carbon stocks. Figure 6.1 provides a global overview of these national statements2 that are made in a range of different texts and fora including: \u2022 Contributions under UNFCCC: m Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), conditional or unconditional (see Box 6.1): Several countries include quantitative information on anticipated forest-related activities and LULUCF. Of the 82 developing countries that submitted their INDC by 1 October 2015 and included forest-related contributions, the majority aim to undertake actions to reduce forest-related emissions and to enhance forest carbon stocks. Fifteen Annex I countries included forest-related contributions in their INDC of which eight specify these activities, which include reducing forest-related emissions, enhancing forest carbon stock or both 1 For analytical purposes, this chapter requires a list of developing countries. There is no standard UN list, but the UNFCCC states that most of the Con- vention\u2019s \u2018non-Annex I\u2019 Parties are developing, so this set is here used as an approximation (as in the former REDD+ Partnership\u2019s Voluntary REDD+ Da- tabase). In contrast, Annex I Parties are all industrialized or have economies in transition. http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/items/2704.php, see also http://unfccc.int/parties_and_observers/parties/negotiating_groups/ items/1031.php 2 Underlying data can be found in Annex C, which is available online. 45 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Mitigation potential from forest-related activities and incentives for enhanced action in developing countries Box 6.1: Forest-related mitigation in INDCs Countries that have submitted INDCs describe their forest-related activities in a variety of different ways (see also Chapter 3). Some countries mention that the forest sector is relevant, but do not provide any quantification. Some specify conditional and unconditional contributions without indicating how these are attributed to forests.

The forest-related mitigation potential under the INDCs will be less than this, as forestry comprises a subset of LULUCF activities described in the INDCs. The following sections put these numbers into a broader context of forest- related mitigation opportunities and potentials. 6.3 Forest-related mitigation opportunities Forest-related mitigation opportunities include maintaining or increasing forest areas and carbon density through reducing deforestation and degradation, afforestation or reforestation, or forest management to increase stand- and landscape-level carbon density (Nabuurs et al., 2007). Best practice policies to curb deforestation were reviewed in the 2012 Emissions Gap Report (UNEP, 2012). This report highlighted four distinct policy categories, including: \u2022 Establishing new protected areas \u2022 Using command-and-control measures (enacting, enforcing and monitoring of regulations on conversion of forest, may include investment in existing protected areas to prevent incursion (Scharlemann et al., 2010)) \u2022 Using economic instruments (taxes, subsidies, payments for ecosystem services), and \u2022 Creating policies affecting drivers and contexts that currently promote deforestation (sectoral policies, institutional frameworks, governance structures and agricultural subsidy reform). Addressing the drivers of deforestation is critical. On-the-ground measures to reduce pressure on forests include sustainable intensification of agriculture to improve yields on existing land, and alternative livelihoods development for communities dependent on deforestation. Designating new protected areas, indigenous lands and community-managed forests can be effective in preventing deforestation in situ3 and avoiding its displacement to other areas. However, forest- related mitigation approaches are generally found to be more effective if they also address the direct and indirect drivers of land-use change (Ewers and Rodrigues, 2008). Combinations of policies and measures that work at the landscape scale to reduce the drivers of deforestation, whilst identifying and protecting the most valued forests, are most likely to yield multiple benefits (New Climate Economy, 2015). Reducing degradation and promoting enhancement of forest carbon stocks can also benefit from policies ranging from incentives for best practice to actions to address drivers (for example, fire and unsustainable harvesting). Sustainable forest management can reduce emissions from forest degradation through specific policies and measures, including adoption of reduced-impact logging in areas designated as production forest; prevention of illegal logging; planting of woodlots for poles or charcoal; promotion of more sustainable extraction and efficient use of fuelwood and charcoal; and support to community forestry and development of systems to limit the spread of anthropogenic fires such as those used in agriculture. 3 Though around nine per cent of all deforestation emissions in the humid tropics between 2000 and 2005 resulted from forest cleared from within pro- tected areas (Scharlemann et al., 2010). Enhancing carbon stocks may involve afforestation or reforestation, with approaches ranging from assisted natural regeneration to tree planting.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "46cad66e-7237-4f68-af35-ace5245ec184": {"__data__": {"id_": "46cad66e-7237-4f68-af35-ace5245ec184", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6432e888d89c60a86aef10fe4fd90d21dc55419e5965fc8948fbaf31769467b0"}, "2": {"node_id": "f76aad6e-6dee-4c0a-a85d-a65bb5f8bc61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef05452bf844edbd7ee888be1b81f16a24ce4361eb24134d2cf9973fbda0d272"}}, "hash": "c7ae99f2a6439b09af954226b8455eadebba586da9a4fa19590dabbac96263ab", "text": "In areas of disturbed forest, carbon stocks may be enhanced by controlling the degradation drivers covered above and by direct interventions, for example, through enrichment planting (Paquette et al., 2009) or rewetting of drained peatland forest (Jaenicke et al., 2010).

Conserving, restoring and sustainably managing forests offers numerous benefits other than carbon storage, strengthening the case for prioritizing forest-related mitigation options. Forests provide essential ecosystem goods and services, such as water quality and regulation (providing more consistent flows of clean water for drinking and agriculture), erosion control (preventing sedimentation of hydropower dams, and protecting other lands downstream), forest products (directly supporting livelihoods, for example through timber, fuelwood, foods, medicine and fibre) and cultural services (supporting cultural traditions and tourism) (Shvidenko et al., 2005). Hence, well-chosen and implemented forest- related mitigation activities can contribute to many other domestic and international policy objectives, including those defined in the Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and the Aichi Targets (CBD, 2010), the Sustainable Development Goals (Goal 13 on urgent climate action and Goal 15 including to halt deforestation by 2020) (UNGA, 2015), the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UN, 2008), the UNCCD 10-year strategic plan and framework (UNCCD, 2007) and the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests (UNGA, 2007). Synergies between adaptation and mitigation also exist in many cases and can, for example, be achieved through ecosystem-based adaptation (Rizvi et al., 2015). Furthermore, forest-related mitigation opportunities are integral to landscape-level mitigation approaches, and complement actions to reduce emissions from agricultural land4 and from non-forested peatlands (Smith et al., 2014). The variety of forest-related mitigation opportunities presented here demonstrates the potential for broad participation by countries in forest-related mitigation according to their national circumstances. Drivers of land- use change, potential for restoration, and climate impacts on forest ecology among many other factors will differ between countries and regions, and determine the appropriate forest- related mitigation activities. 4 Responsible for a similar quantity of annual GHG emissions, based on CO2 only from deforestation and forest degradation (Table 6.1) compared to all greenhouse gases from agricultural land in 2005 (Smith et al., 2014, Figure 11.4). 47 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Mitigation potential from forest-related activities and incentives for enhanced action in developing countries 6.4 Emission reduction potential of forest- related mitigation activities The previous sections provided a global overview of countries\u2019 intentions regarding forest-related mitigation activities and illustrated the wide range of areas in which such activities can be undertaken. In addition, the estimated LULUCF mitigation contribution in the INDCs was highlighted. While acknowledging the importance of reducing forest-related emissions in all countries, the political interest and emphasis given to REDD+ as a key instrument to realizing forest-based emission reductions reflects the critical role of developing countries in reducing emissions from deforestation. This section assesses the total potential contribution to bridging the emissions gap in 2030 that could be brought about by forest-related emission reductions in developing countries. More specifically, the section assesses the technical potential for reducing emissions through forest- related activities in developing countries based on a review of the published literature. The technical potential represents the full biophysical potential of a mitigation option without accounting for economic or other constraints (as defined in Smith et al., 2014, p. 847). It represents a halt of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation including on peatland, and universal \u2018wide-scale\u2019 forest restoration on available and suitable areas. This represents an upper technical maximum and is estimated to be around 9 GtCO2 in 2030 (range: 6.7-11.9) (Table 6.1). Achieving the technical mitigation potential of the forest sector is limited by operational and socio-economic factors. Factors that can place increased demands on forest land include limited capacity to increase production in agriculture, national objectives for food self-sufficiency, infrastructure development, and wood product requirements. Demands can be reduced by factors such as restoring degraded lands to agricultural production, changing dietary preferences or reducing waste. Hence, country goals for forest-related emission reductions and enhancement of carbon stocks need to take into account potential competition with other land uses. 6.4.1 Technical mitigation potential of reducing carbon dioxide emissions A wide range of estimates of global CO2 emissions from deforestation and forest degradation exist (Ciais et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39cff1cf-0ede-4636-ba6c-6ae7988216ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "39cff1cf-0ede-4636-ba6c-6ae7988216ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6252ce8154a38d33b8c9e257e7868c4d1dd5878de5bac1760ac0d5e5ac20db97"}, "2": {"node_id": "a25ee2e4-c5ad-49b7-bee0-431996b25468", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "445288284cc88fbd21a4e5816e20476479042653b70368a9e1e8f18ae29ffef5"}}, "hash": "97b10988ab92dbd54a258cd131874e2f8cb6c65e0d1900a9adfcb2ae0dd31437", "text": "The range reflects uncertainty in data sources, use of different methodologies to estimate emissions, and differences in the land use change processes included, the range of emission sources included and the land-cover definitions adopted (Houghton et al., 2012).

However, national forest definitions vary widely in terms of thresholds for canopy cover and tree height, and land uses included (Sasaki and Putz, 2009), meaning that vegetation types such as savannas, agroforestry systems, and mangroves may or may not be addressed by forest policies, depending on the country. Differences in definition, not only of land cover types but also land-use change processes, influence both the overall estimated mitigation potential and whether certain emissions result from deforestation or from forest degradation (Romijn et al., 2013). To estimate the technical mitigation potential of reducing deforestation and degradation and enhancing forest management in 2030 (second and third columns of Table 6.1), recent emissions given by published studies (referenced below the table) are used to approximate future emissions, assuming no further forest-related mitigation action. The business-as-usual scenarios in Clarke et al. (2014) suggest that total emissions from AFOLU (agriculture, forestry and other land use) may remain stable or decline, as they assume a slowing of population growth and increased efficiencies of food production that will contribute to reducing deforestation. Emissions from forest degradation in non-Annex I countries have declined marginally from 1.1 GtCO2/yr in 2001-2010 to 1 GtCO2/yr in 2011-2015, but the relative emissions from degradation compared to deforestation have increased from a quarter to a third (Federici et al., 2015). Indeed, in scenarios that consider increased reliance on biofuels for energy generation and climate mitigation, demand for agricultural land continues to grow. Bottom-up assessments of drivers also suggest that pressures will increase (Kissinger et al., 2012). For example, emissions from deforestation in the Congo basin are expected to increase in the future, with average annual deforested area between 2020 and 2030 varying amongst policy scenarios from 0.4 to 1.3 million ha (Megevand, 2013). Hence, the technical mitigation potential from reduced deforestation and forest degradation and enhanced forest management are estimated at 5.2 GtCO2/yr (range: 2.1-6.3), and may be a relatively conservative approximation of total potential, assuming that emissions from these sources are likely to continue at present levels or increase. In the two decades up to 2010, tropical deforestation emissions have been found to represent around 98 per cent of reported deforestation emissions from non-Annex I countries5. Therefore tropical deforestation derived from published studies (Harris et al., 2012; Achard et al., 2014) has been used to approximate the technical potential for reduced deforestation in developing countries, which amounts to between 1.7-4.7 GtCO2/yr, with a mean of 3.4 GtCO2/yr (Table 6.1). Forest degradation in non-Annex I countries, including the effects of selective logging, fire or drought, and fuelwood harvest, accounts for around 1 GtCO2/yr (between 2011-2015 (Federici et al., 2015)), which is very similar to the results found by Grace et al. (2014) for 2000-2012 of a mean of 1 GtCO2/yr (range: 0.3-1.7). In addition, emissions from drainage and fire in forested or deforested peatlands in Southeast Asia were estimated at a mean of 0.8 GtCO2/yr (drainage in 2006, fire 1998-2009 (Smith et al., 2014, Box 11.1)).

This figure is greater than the maximum estimate of 3.4 GtCO2 for the similar area of 350 million hectares at 2030 by Wolosin (2014); however that analysis was not restricted to non-Annex I countries and averages over restoration scenarios that include a large proportion of mosaic restoration and improved secondary and naturally regenerated forest, of which will result in a lower average biomass growth per hectare. Use of the IPCC biomass growth figures for plantation forest would yield a still higher estimate. Single source, no range. technical potential of reducing degradation and enhancing forest management would equal 1.8 GtCO2/yr. 6.4.2 Technical mitigation potential of enhanced carbon sequestration As noted, increased sequestration, or enhanced removals, of carbon can result from increasing forest area, or through enhancing sequestration in existing forest (for example, rehabilitating degraded forest). When tree density increases, carbon is removed from the atmosphere by the increasing plant biomass, and soil carbon stocks are protected from erosion and may also increase. Reforestation can take place at a variety of scales, from increasing tree cover in small areas within a mosaic of other land uses (so called \u2018mosaic restoration\u2019) to restoring larger areas (\u2018wide-scale\u2019 restoration, see Glossary). The estimated global potential for \u2018wide-scale\u2019 restoration of closed-canopy forest is up to half a billion ha, excluding areas in intensive use (WRI, 2011)6. An additional 1.5 billion ha globally may have the potential for mosaic restoration (WRI, 2011). Mosaic restoration may be easier to undertake as it allows a greater range of land uses, whilst restoring areas to closed- canopy forest is likely to remove more CO2 per unit of area. Depending on ecosystem type, and whether the result is a natural forest or a plantation, areas converted to forest are estimated to remove between about 1 and 35 tCO2 per ha per year in above- and below-ground biomass (from default data in IPCC (2006)7). If natural forest were simultaneously restored over the 351 million ha with potential for wide-scale 6 In (WRI, 2011) closed-canopy forest has a canopy density greater than 45 per cent. 7 In (IPCC, 2006, Tables 4.4 and 4.12) ecosystems from boreal tundra woodland to tropical plantation. restoration in non-Annex I countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America and the Caribbean regions, calculated from WRI (2011), this could equate to 3.8 GtCO2/yr while the forest was re-growing. Standing, secondary and planted forests also contribute to the global \u2018terrestrial carbon sink\u2019, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. The forest carbon sink is estimated to be large and vary widely, from a global value of 3.4 \u00b1 1 GtCO2/yr (for the period 2001-2010 (Federici et al., 2015)), to estimates for tropical sinks alone of 6.8 GtCO2/yr (for the period 2005-2010 (Grace et al., 2014)). The IPCC states with high confidence that increased atmospheric CO2 will lead to increased terrestrial carbon uptake (Ciais et al., 2013), and a recent review suggests that the largest increase has been in woody biomass within savanna (included in some national forest definitions) and non-forest ecosystems (Liu et al., 2015). Carbon sink figures for existing forests are not included in the technical potential for reduced deforestation given here, as a result of the uncertainty surrounding how carbon sinks and their capacity to absorb CO2 will change in the changing climate (Bellassen and Luyssaert, 2014).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "409c2ae9-c135-4bd4-8c51-2ed25a9600af": {"__data__": {"id_": "409c2ae9-c135-4bd4-8c51-2ed25a9600af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1e1013b5ae46c28a25a074a6268736a6013230f6f6c639af2f7d2fec5c364e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "e31232d4-f844-43ea-bdb5-36ed39bb335e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44695b7d72dae617e4b1da394b3ce5782b48004777672daa80f0e8cd1deb6f70"}}, "hash": "79f909a079f5bd9f8613efb773bfb9f24733e59b6935e307b4364cfe57960f55", "text": "6.4.3 Economic mitigation potential of forest- related mitigation A number of recent studies estimate the global economic mitigation potential in 2030 of various forest-related activities given economic and land-use constraints, at different levels of costs and for different regions of the world. 49 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Mitigation potential from forest-related activities and incentives for enhanced action in developing countries Box 6.2: The REDD+ activities While the five REDD+ activities are listed in UNFCCC decision text, it is useful to further define these to understand how REDD+ can contribute to forest-related mitigation.

This contributes to reduced emissions from forest degradation, and rehabilitation of carbon stocks in degraded forest e) Enhancement of forest carbon stocks \u2013 both the restoration of carbon stocks in degraded forest, and through expansion of forest cover. They offer a very large range of estimates of global mitigation potential at different cost levels, ranging from 0-1.5 GtCO2e for costs <US$20/tCO2e, to mitigation potentials of 0.1-9.5 GtCO2e for costs <US$50/tCO2e, and ranging from 0-13.8 GtCO2e for costs <US$100/tCO2e (Smith et al., 2014). Differences among models reviewed include the cost levels used, the economic assumptions, model approach (bottom- up or top-down), and the mitigation options considered. The economic mitigation potential for developing countries is not provided separately. However, it is highlighted that for developing countries the most cost-effective mitigation options in forestry are reducing deforestation, sustainable forest management and afforestation (Nabuurs et al., 2007). Regional breakdowns show that reduced deforestation dominates as the most cost-effective forestry option for Latin America and Middle East and Africa regions, whereas forest management dominates the Asia region (Smith et al., 2014). In general, the economic mitigation potential will be smaller than the technical potential. Furthermore, estimates of economic mitigation potential do not consider policy incentives and socio-cultural and institutional barriers to implementation of forest-related mitigation activities (Smith et al., 2014), which further affect in either direction the extent to which emission reduction potentials are realized. Real-world examples of how the results of full-scale realisation of forest mitigation policies might compare to these economic mitigation potentials are limited. Nevertheless, Brazil\u2019s success in reducing deforestation by 82 per cent in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004-2014 (INPE, 2015) results from a mix of policies that included expansion of protected areas, supply chain interventions, and positive incentives for landholders (Nepstad et al., 2014) as well as exogenous economic factors such as falling commodity prices (Assun\u00e7\u00e3o et al., 2015). This emphasizes the role of socio-cultural, institutional and policy-related contexts for realising forest-related emission reductions. Nonetheless, the previous sections have indicated that there is significant potential to further reduce forest-related emissions, both compared to current practices and to the contributions indicated in the submitted INDCs. The last section of this chapter focuses on REDD+ as a key option under the UNFCCC for further enhancing forest-related mitigation in developing countries. 6.5 REDD+ as a key instrument to realize forest-related emission reductions in developing countries The immediate and relatively large impact of preserving carbon through reducing deforestation and degradation, as well as the cost-effectiveness of this land use option compared to other mitigation measures (Golub et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2014) has driven the momentum behind development of the REDD+ mechanism. Originally recognizing the contribution of \u201creducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries\u201d (\u2018RED\u2019) (UNFCCC, 2005), the scope was expanded in 2007 to include emissions from degradation and became a component of enhanced action on mitigation (\u2018REDD\u2019) (UNFCCC, 2007). In 2009 REDD+ was further expanded to include \u201cconservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks\u201d (\u2018REDD+\u2019) (UNFCCC, 2009) and now represents a specific suite of forest-related mitigation activities in the developing world (see Box 6.2) that countries can implement voluntarily to contribute to the global mitigation effort.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a5d8b7d-cc1e-4339-a707-d7233374573f": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a5d8b7d-cc1e-4339-a707-d7233374573f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3dafea91194d42cd488dcd0cb22b5711629a9362bb5320e982161647dba22af3"}, "2": {"node_id": "dbb32f7a-750c-487e-aa21-956e23f6d5dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0cb3538bd6ab7f88dd520fad39f2a23307de47b41287949855d2779e165b9feb"}}, "hash": "a466270908376b12db78910ca138ed378ac35137772eb9019ab46d447a09b0a6", "text": "Since 2005, the REDD+ framework has evolved under the UNFCCC, adapting to improved understanding of issues regarding potential impacts, methodological accounting, safeguards, and financing (Smith et al., 2014).

This was to provide a progressive pathway to full-scale REDD+ implementation, taking into account the differing capacities of countries. Moreover, interventions at the national level are needed to overcome internal displacement of pressures from one area to the next. For this to happen, nationally coordinated cross-sectoral strategies are required, and should be based on an analysis of the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and barriers to the sustainable management of forest and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. National, and often, subnational institutions need to be mandated, resourced and have the capacity to implement these strategies. Safeguards need to be promoted and supported - to protect or enhance the many social and environmental values of forest, to respect the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and member of local communities, and to enable the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities. A robust and transparent national forest monitoring system is also required, enabling consistency in data and information to support the implementation of REDD+ activities (UN-REDD Programme, 2013). Each of these pre-requisites to successful implementation is reflected in a series of decisions made under the 2013 Warsaw Framework on REDD+ (UNFCCC, 2013), which made significant progress on deciding on the coordination of financing, transparency and safeguards, development of national forest monitoring systems, verification at the international level, institutional arrangements to receive results-based finance, and action on drivers of deforestation (UNFCCC, 20139). To access results-based payments for REDD+ activities, actions need to be fully measured, reported and verified. To this end, countries need to have in place: \u2022 A national strategy or action plan, \u2022 A national forest monitoring system (or interim subnational system), \u2022 A safeguards information system and a summary of information on how the REDD+ safeguards have been addressed and respected, and \u2022 A forest reference emission level or forest reference level (or interim subnational reference level). The contribution of REDD+ to meeting the potential for forest-related mitigation is partly contingent on available resources, first to put these requirements in place and to develop enabling policy frameworks and institutional capacity to implement them (sometimes referred to as \u2018REDD+ readiness\u2019), and later to supply the financing that 8 Decision 1/CP.16 (UNFCCC, 2010). 9 Decision 9-15/ CP. 19 (UNFCCC, 2013). creates positive incentives for enhanced results-based action on mitigation by developing countries10. The series of decisions made under the 2013 Warsaw Framework on REDD+ (UNFCCC, 2013) has been accompanied by an ongoing and diverse set of early action REDD+ activities and other multilateral, bilateral or country driven initiatives being implemented that contribute to REDD+ readiness or complement the goals of REDD+ (for example, conservation and sustainable forest management). Despite the complexities that have slowed REDD+ implementation on the ground (Sills et al., 2014), REDD+ is seen as a unique approach to better integrate the forest sector in the broader climate change and sustainable development plans of developing countries. Indeed, support to REDD+ readiness actions offers national benefits to many countries, including the development of national forest monitoring systems, understanding of drivers of deforestation, the strengthening of policies, laws and regulations relevant to the UNFCCC\u2019s REDD+ safeguards, the adoption of wider stakeholder engagement in decision- making, and development of better data and information on the distribution of forest carbon stocks, biodiversity and ecosystem services (Lee and Pistorius, 2015). It involves implementing policies and measures that contribute substantially to climate change mitigation, are based on positive incentives for action, and can deliver additional co-benefits. Hence, REDD+ continues to receive political support from many developed and developing countries. Some major constraints on the potential for REDD+ implementation include the speed at which policies can be put in place and governance improvements can be implemented, as well as competition with other land uses (food security with a growing global population). In principle, national strategies and action plans should take account of these constraints when determining the scale of ambition for REDD+. The availability of finance to cover the readiness and upfront costs of REDD+, whether domestic or international, will also be a determining factor (Streck, 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9576ccee-d601-4a4d-9388-7d8062ccf311": {"__data__": {"id_": "9576ccee-d601-4a4d-9388-7d8062ccf311", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2015", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f85b71583650a0de87ed1b354c29d2c1dfd1b4acbdf10769b546c034648aaf3a"}, "2": {"node_id": "092c6d53-b2da-4279-a89d-150d07c74994", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2015", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a8c1284aeaf5712918960f43dad90fd6de595278e01e8618b1609fdd767289d"}}, "hash": "4d78b6958f89e8ced346085c6c94ee4e4415851578482db40787fa5fe5520e5f", "text": "Many countries have included forest-related mitigation contributions within their INDCs, which can contribute to setting the stage for large-scale implementation of REDD+ in the coming years.

Australia\u2019s target covers all sectors (energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, LULUCF, and waste) and gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6 and NF3). The four modelling groups which estimated the INDC scenario in 2030 all agree on the impact of Australia\u2019s INDC on its emissions in 2030. As an official estimate is not available in Australia\u2019s INDC itself, an alternative official country-specific data source was used (Australian Government, 2015). This source provided the \u2018official estimate\u2019 in the Figure below. All models demonstrate a significant difference between current policy trajectories and the INDC trajectory in 2030. 53 53 The Emissions Gap Report 2015 \u2013 Annex 1: Country-specific findings Brazil The Brazilian INDC establishes an absolute target relative to 2005, reducing GHG emissions by 37 per cent in 2025 and indicating further reductions by 43 per cent in 2030. These percentage reductions are relative to reported emissions of 2.1 GtCO2e in 2005, corresponding respectively to emission levels of 1.3 GtCO2e in 2025 and 1.2 GtCO2e in 2030, using IPCC AR5 GWP-100. Brazil\u00b4s INDC is economy-wide, covers all IPCC sectors and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and sF6), and is unconditional. Actions to achieve the targets focus mainly on the forest sector and on increasing the share of biofuels and renewable electricity in the Brazilian energy mix. Modelling groups estimate higher historical emission levels than official estimates, but do roughly agree with the projection of the current policy trajectory for 2020. Modelling group estimates for emission levels in 2025 and 2030 are similar to national estimates as they also used official INDC projections.

Although China\u2019s INDC is framed in terms of CO2, the discussion text also implies action on other gases. China\u2019s INDC also includes a comprehensive list of actions. The GHG targets cover CO2, but the sectors to which the targets apply are not specified. The studies assessed show a wide range of potential impacts of China\u2019s INDC on national emissions (varying from 12.8-14 GtCO2e by 2030), with higher estimates (LSE, CROADS, Climate Advisers), arising, inter alia, from different assumptions on GDP growth rate, different base year data (varying from 9.1-11.3 GtCO2e) and different estimates on emissions other than CO2 emissions from the energy sector (and cement), etc. The higher estimates of LSE, CROADS and Climate Advisers are confined to the INDC intensity target calculations only. An official estimate is not available, but two national estimates for CO2 emissions from the energy sector (and cement) are available from NCSC (Sha et al., 2015) and updated calculations from Energy Reserarch Institute (ERI) (Jiang et al., 2013). Three studies (CAT, 2015; IEA, 2014, 2015; PBL, 2015) that estimated both China\u2019s current policy trajectory and the INDC scenario, demonstrate a further reduction from current policy trajectories to the INDC in 2030. Only NCSC\u2019s estimate adjusts for the possible effect of including energy statistics from the 2014 economic census, which leads to a much higher estimate for China\u2019s CO2 emission in 2030 (around 1 GtCO2e higher than the pre- adjustment estimate) (Sha et al., 2015).

The sectors and gases covered by the intensity target are not specified. The studies assessed show a wide range of potential mitigation impacts of India\u2019s INDC on national emissions, varying from 3.7-4.8 GtCO2e by 2030 for the conditional INDCs (assuming a full implementation of the INDC, including the non-fossil fuel target), and varying from 3.7-6.5 GtCO2e by 2030 for the unconditional INDCs (assuming current policies, or only accounting for the intensity target). The wide ranges are caused mainly by different assumptions regarding GDP growth rate, different base year data, and interpretation of the conditionality of the INDCs. The higher estimates of LSE and the national study stem from a focus on the INDC intensity target calculations only, and do not consider other INDC elements, such as the non-fossil energy target. An official estimate of emissions under the INDC is not available. National estimates for CO2 emissions from the energy sector (and cement) are available from Dubash et al.

The studies assessed adopted the official estimate of 2030 emissions from the INDC, and therefore agree on this figure. The 2020 pledge presented here is measured from a different baseline than that presented in the INDC (Fransen et al., 2015).

The Republic of Korea intends to achieve a 25.7 per cent emissions reduction from BAU domestically. The INDC covers energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture and waste, and states that \u201c[\u2026] a decision will be made at a later stage on whether to include greenhouse gas emissions and sinks of the land sector as well as the method for doing so\u201d (UNFCCC, 2015). The target applies to five sectors (energy, industrial processes and product use, agriculture, LULUCF and waste) and six gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). The Republic of Korea provides an official estimate in its INDC document, which would equate to emission levels of about 535.9 MtCO2e in 2030. Modelling groups agree on the emission levels in 2030 since they use the emission level taken from the INDC document. The Climate Action Tracker (CAT, 2015) provides a higher estimate indicating the levels of intended domestic reductions.

Uncertainties are noted in relation to AFOLU emissions and trace gases, with the intention of reducing uncertainty over time and moving to a comprehensive accounting approach for land-based emissions and removals. South Africa proposes innovative methodologies for adaptation, both impacts and investments required, also noting that methodologies can be improved. Given that the INDC states emission ranges in absolute units (MtCO2e), modelling groups have greater certainty on the impact of South Africa\u2019s INDC.

Aerosols: Airborne solid or liquid particles, with a typical size of between 0.01 and 10 micrometer (a millionth of a meter) that reside in the atmosphere for at least several hours. They may influence the climate directly through scattering and absorbing radiation, and indirectly by modifying the optical properties and lifetime of clouds. Annex I parties/countries: The group of countries listed in Annex I to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Under Articles 4.2 (a) and 4.2 (b) of the convention, Annex I Parties were committed to adopting national policies and measures with the non-legally binding aim to return their greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. By default, the other countries are referred to as Non- Annex I Parties. Biomass plus carbon capture and storage (BioCCS or BECCS): Use of energy produced from biomass where the combustion gases are then captured and stored underground or used, for example, in industrial processes. It excludes gases generated through, for example, a fermentation process (as opposed to combustion). Biomass: The total mass of living organisms in a given area or volume, including products, by-products, and waste of biological origin (plants or animal matter) and excluding material embedded in geological formations and transformed to fossil fuels or peat. Black carbon: The substance formed through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass, which is emitted in both anthropogenic and naturally occurring soot. It consists of pure carbon in several linked forms. Black carbon warms the Earth by absorbing heat in the atmosphere and by reducing albedo \u2013 the ability to reflect sunlight \u2013 when deposited on snow and ice. Bottom-up model: In the context of this assessment, a model that represents a system by looking at its detailed underlying parts. Compared to so-called top-down models, which focus on economic inter- linkages, bottom-up models of energy use and emissions can provide greater resolution with regards to sectors or mitigation technologies. Business-as-usual: A scenario that describes future greenhouse gas emission levels in the absence of additional mitigation efforts and policies (with respect to an agreed set). Carbon dioxide emissions budget: For a given temperature rise limit, for example a 1.5 or 2 \u00b0C long-term limit, the corresponding carbon budget reflects the total amount of carbon emissions that can be emitted to stay within that limit. Stated differently, a carbon budget is the area under a greenhouse gas emissions trajectory that satisfies assumptions about limits on cumulative emissions estimated to avoid a certain level of global mean surface temperature rise. glossAry Glossary vi EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Carbon credits: An entitlement allocated by a government to a legal entity (company or other type of emitter) to emit a specified amount of a substance. These entitlements, which may be transferrable and tradable, can be used to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (by giving them a monetary value) or can be used for accounting of emissions. Carbon dioxide equivalent: A way to place emissions of various radiative forcing agents on a common footing by accounting for their effect on climate. It describes, for a given mixture and amount of greenhouse gases, the amount of carbon dioxide that would have the same global warming ability, when measured over a specified time period. For the purpose of this report, greenhouse gas emissions (unless otherwise specified) are the sum of the basket of greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents assuming a 100-year global warming potential. Carbon leakage: Phenomenon whereby the reduction in emissions (relative to a baseline) in a jurisdiction or sector associated with the implementation of mitigation policy is offset to some degree by an increase outside of that jurisdiction or sector which can be causally linked to the aforementioned reduction. Conditional pledges: Greenhouse gas emissions reduction pledges made by some countries that are contingent on the ability of national legislatures to enact the necessary laws, ambitious action from other countries, realization of finance and technical support, or other factors. Double counting: In the context of this assessment, double counting refers to a situation in which the same emission reductions are counted towards meeting two countries\u2019 pledges. Emission pathway: The trajectory of annual global greenhouse gas emissions over time. Global warming potential: An index, based on the radiative properties of greenhouse gases, measuring the radiative forcing following a pulse emission of a unit mass of a given greenhouse gas in the present-day atmosphere integrated over a chosen time horizon, relative to that of carbon dioxide. The global warming potential represents the combined effect of the differing times these gases remain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b71727f4-f9ac-4c0a-9a85-761e787632ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "b71727f4-f9ac-4c0a-9a85-761e787632ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "473f59bf681042d484f283437f59ac52993ac369b42723ceab7267babcca9d37"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3dd81ae-6bab-41dd-9f30-8c9a3794e1b5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b30b2df650abcf83c8d0160ee8b4e871e3f57931a0d9c38cbea68b5c901f683"}}, "hash": "4029d7f5cb1e238e0236f599f09c9386fc8ad40f819f0040fb596836d9a07aad", "text": "in the atmosphere and their relative effectiveness in causing radiative forcing. Greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol: The six greenhouse gases listed in Annex A to the Kyoto Protocol: carbon dioxide (CO2); methane (CH4); nitrous oxide (N2O); hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); perfluorocarbons (PFCs); and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6)1. Integrated assessment models: Models that seek to combine knowledge from multiple disciplines in the form of equations and/or algorithms in order to explore complex environmental problems. As such, they describe the full chain of climate change, from production of greenhouse gases to atmospheric responses. This necessarily includes relevant links and feedbacks between socio-economic and bio- physical processes. International cooperative initiatives: Initiatives outside of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at reducing emissions of climate forcers by, for example, promoting actions that are less greenhouse gas intensive, compared to prevailing alternatives. Cooperative initiatives also involve national and sub-national partners (they are often referred to as, simply, \u2018cooperative initiatives\u2019). Kyoto Protocol: A protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that contains legally binding commitments, in addition to those included in the UNFCCC. Countries included in Annex B of the Protocol (most Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and countries with economies in transition) agreed to reduce their anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulphur hexafluoride) by at least five per cent below 1990 levels in the commitment period 2008\u20132012. ____________________ 1 Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) is not included as it applies only from the beginning of the second commitment period. Glossary vii EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Later-action scenarios: Climate change mitigation scenarios in which emission levels in the near term, typically up to 2020 or 2030, are higher than those in the corresponding least-cost scenarios. Least-cost scenarios: Climate change mitigation scenarios assuming that emission reductions start immediately after the model base year, typically 2010, and are distributed optimally over time, such that aggregate costs of reaching the climate target are minimized. Lenient rules: Pledge cases with maximum Annex I land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and surplus emissions units, and maximum impact of double counting. Likely chance: A likelihood greater than 66 per cent. Used in this assessment to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Medium chance: A likelihood of 50\u201366 per cent. Used in this report to convey the probabilities of meeting temperature limits. Montreal Protocol: The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is an international treaty that was designed to reduce the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances in order to reduce their abundance in the atmosphere, and thereby protect the Earth\u2019s ozone layer. Non-Annex I countries/parties: See Annex I countries/parties. Pledges: For the purpose of this assessment, pledges include Annex I targets and non-Annex I actions, as included in Appendix I and Appendix II to the Copenhagen Accord, and subsequently revised and updated in some instances. Radiative forcing: Change in the net, downward minus upward, irradiance, expressed in watt per square meter (W/m2), at the tropopause due to a change in an external driver of climate change, such as, for example, a change in the concentration of carbon dioxide or the output of the Sun. For the purposes of this assessment, radiative forcing is further defined as the change relative to the year 1750 and, unless otherwise noted, refers to a global and annual average value. Scenario: A description of how the future may unfold based on if-then propositions. Scenarios typically include an initial socio-economic situation and a description of the key driving forces and future changes in emissions, temperature or other climate change-related variables. Strict rules: Pledge cases in which the impact of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) credits and surplus emissions units are set to zero. Top-down model: A model that applies macroeconomic theory, econometric and/or optimisation techniques to aggregate economic variables.

The risks of inaction are too high to be ignored, and the effects of global warming can already be felt in many aspects of human life. Further to the Copenhagen Accord of 2009 and the Cancun agreements of 2010, over 90 countries have made voluntary pledges and commitments toward cutting their emission levels. However, despite these and related efforts, current pledges and commitments are not sufficient to keep the average rise in global temperature below 2\u00b0 Celsius, compared to pre- industrial levels: the associated \u201cgap\u201d in required emission reductions is growing, not closing. Over the past four years the \u201cemissions gap\u201d series published by the United Nations Environment Programme has analysed the size of the gap and has provided insights on options to close it. This fifth report provides an updated measure of the emissions gap. In addition, this year\u2019s update of xi EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis the analysis calculates an emissions gap relative to expected emission levels in 2030, in recognition of the growing focus that action beyond 2020 is gaining in international climate change negotiations. Not least, the report provides an assessment of the carbon budget that is consistent with the 2\u00b0 Celsius temperature target. Consistent with the findings of the 2014 assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, our analysis reveals a worrisome worsening trend. Continued emissions of greenhouse gases will lead to an even warmer climate and exacerbate the devastating effects of climate change. Failure to curb climate change does not only undermine prosperity for millions of people, most acutely in the developing world: it threatens to roll back decades of development and to hamper the capacity of countries to achieve key societal goals, such as poverty reduction or economic growth. Against this background, this report explores the multiple benefits of tried and tested development policies \u2013 benefits in terms of, for example, employment creation, economic growth, improved environmental quality and, not least, reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike previous editions of the report, this year\u2019s update does not focus on a specific sector. Instead, we illustrate the multiple benefits of one greenhouse gas mitigation option \u2013 energy efficiency improvements \u2013 across a wide range of sectors. Our findings show that multiple benefits, including climate change mitigation, can indeed be achieved by implementing fundamentally simple and well-known development policies. The conclusions of the report are a stark reminder that, to meet the goals of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, consistent and decisive action is required without any further delay. I hope that the analysis presented in this fifth \u201cemissions gap\u201d report will help parties to the climate change convention negotiate positions that result in increased action. Everyone will gain if the outcome will enable more ambitious actions by more actors \u2013 sooner rather than later.

While recognizing that some climate change is unavoidable, global leaders at the 2010 Cancun Climate Conference1 agreed to limit global warming to 2 \u00b0C in this century, relative to the pre-industrial period. They also decided to review this limit to see if it should be further lowered to 1.5 \u00b0C. Given the aim to limit global temperature, the critical question has now become what level of global emissions would make this possible? The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has tackled this question since 2010 by convening a large group of knowledgeable scientists to prepare the Emissions Gap reports. These reports have examined the gap in 2020 between emission levels consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit, and levels expected if country pledges/commitments are met. In earlier reports the scientists conveyed the message that indeed a large gap exists, but also that there were many promising opportunities for bridging the gap. executive summAry 1 . What is the focus of this year\u2019s report? The focus of this year\u2019s update is on the emissions budget for staying within the 2\u00b0C limit . This fifth Emissions Gap report has a different focus from previous years. While it updates the 2020 emissions gap analysis, it gives particular attention to the implications of the global carbon dioxide emissions budget for staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit beyond 2020. It does so because countries are giving increasing attention to where they need to be in 2025, 2030 and beyond. Furthermore, this year\u2019s update of the report benefits from the findings on the emissions budget from the latest series of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports2. As noted by the IPCC, scientists have determined that an increase in global temperature is proportional to the build-up of long-lasting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide. Based on this finding, they have estimated the maximum amount of carbon dioxide that could be emitted over time to the atmosphere and still stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit. This is called the carbon dioxide emissions budget because, if the world stays within this budget, it should be possible to stay within the 2 \u00b0C global warming limit. In the hypothetical case that carbon dioxide was the only human-made greenhouse gas, the IPCC estimated a total carbon dioxide budget ____________________ 1 The 16th Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 2 Another reason for changing the report\u2019s focus is that previous reports have concentrated on findings from least-cost scenarios that begin in 2010 or earlier. However, these scenarios have become decreasingly useful because emissions in recent years have been consistently higher than, and thus not in line with, these scenarios. Second, it will be increasingly difficult to implement new large-scale emission control measures by 2020. Hence, looking beyond 2020 becomes even more important. Third, the move towards sustainable development goals will directly or indirectly influence climate targets, with countries likely to settle on 2025 and 2030 as the target year for these goals. xiv EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary of about 3 670 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) for a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit3. Since emissions began rapidly growing in the late 19th century, the world has already emitted around 1 900 Gt CO2 and so has used up a large part of this budget. Moreover, human activities also result in emissions of a variety of other substances that have an impact on global warming and these substances also reduce the total available budget to about 2 900 Gt CO2. This leaves less than about 1 000 Gt CO2 to \u201cspend\u201d in the future4. The key questions are: how can these emissions best be spread out over time; at what point in time should net carbon dioxide emissions fall to zero \u2013 that is, when should we become budget neutral in the sense that we sequester as much as we emit; and how much can we spend of the budget at different points in the future and still stay within the temperature limit? To tackle these questions this year\u2019s Emissions Gap report analyses the scenarios published in the latest IPCC reports. It also examines the great potential for improving energy efficiency, which would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also meet many other societal goals. Key findings from these analyses are presented in the following sections. ____________________ 3 A likely chance denotes a greater than 66 per cent chance, as specified by the IPCC. 4 The Working Group III", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53c64b6d-75e9-45bb-8c5d-be606cac8c77": {"__data__": {"id_": "53c64b6d-75e9-45bb-8c5d-be606cac8c77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f19e0430bbde14db5da349d16f5f274fcfa82013eddfc94c2e7cedf5038e9f1b"}}, "hash": "f19e0430bbde14db5da349d16f5f274fcfa82013eddfc94c2e7cedf5038e9f1b", "text": "contribution to the IPCC AR5 reports that scenarios in its category which is consistent with limiting warming to below 2 \u00b0C have carbon dioxide budgets between 2011 and 2100 of about 630-1 180 Gt CO2.

What does the budget approach say about emission levels and their timing to meet the 2 \u00b0C limit? To stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit, global carbon neutrality will need to be achieved sometime between 2055 and 2070 . Using the carbon budget approach and information from integrated assessment models it is possible to estimate when or if global carbon neutrality will need to be reached during the 21st century in order to have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit. Here global carbon neutrality means that annual anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions5 are net zero on the global scale (Figure ES.1). Net zero implies that some remaining carbon dioxide emissions could be compensated by the same amount of carbon dioxide uptake (negative emissions) so long as the net input of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to human activities is zero. The fact that global emissions will continue to be larger than zero in the immediate future means that at some point we will exhaust the carbon dioxide emissions budget and annual net emissions will have to drop to zero to avoid exceeding the budget. If we do exceed the budget, then negative emissions will be required to stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit (Figure ES.1). Based on a subset of scenarios from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) scenario database6, the best estimate is that global carbon neutrality is reached between 2055 and 2070 in order to have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit. This same subset of scenarios is used throughout this Summary for calculating emissions consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit, with the exception of the calculation of the 2020 gap, as explained in Section 5 of the Summary. To stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit, total global greenhouse gas emissions need to shrink to net zero some time between 2080 and 2100 . An important point about carbon neutrality is that it only refers to carbon dioxide emissions. Nonetheless, it is well known that other greenhouse gases also cause global temperature increases. Among these are methane, nitrous oxide and hydrofluorocarbons. Current and likely future emissions of these and other non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases have been taken into account in the above estimation of when carbon neutrality should be reached. The next question is, when must total greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide plus non-carbon dioxide)7 reach net zero in order to stay within the emissions budget? Based on additional assumptions about non- carbon dioxide emissions8, it has been estimated that global total greenhouse gas emissions will need to reach net zero sometime between ____________________ 5 In this Summary emissions always refer to anthropogenic emissions. 6 This subset (called Least-cost 2020 scenarios in this report) consists of scenarios that begin in 2010, have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit, have modest emission reductions up to 2020, assume country pledges are fully implemented in 2020, and follow least-cost emission pathways leading to rapid reductions after 2020. Modest here means that the pace of emission reductions up to 2020 is significantly slower than in scenarios that have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit and follow a least-cost emission pathway beginning in 2010. A least-cost emission pathway is an emissions pathway that takes advantage of lowest cost options for emission reductions and minimizes total costs of reduction up to 2100. These scenarios are often called delayed action or later action scenarios because they begin their least-cost pathway in 2020 rather than 2010. This subset of scenarios is used for three main reasons. First, because actual emissions since 2010 have been higher than in other types of scenarios in the IPCC scenarios database, particularly those that meet the 2 oC target and have a least-cost pathway beginning in 2010 rather than 2020.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03cf9dce-2926-4495-9600-49415e177eec": {"__data__": {"id_": "03cf9dce-2926-4495-9600-49415e177eec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94128a13016ecbe8b050c16092f4584cca59851269bc9a48186bfe97ec93300b"}}, "hash": "94128a13016ecbe8b050c16092f4584cca59851269bc9a48186bfe97ec93300b", "text": "(These are called Least-cost 2010 scenarios in this report. These scenarios have lower global emissions up to 2020 than the Least-cost 2020 scenarios because they follow a least-cost pathway from 2010 rather than 2020.) Second, because the Least-cost 2020 scenarios seem to be more in accord with current projections of emissions for 2020. Global emissions in 2020 under various pledge cases are estimated to be about 52\u201354 Gt CO2e. The Least-cost 2020 scenarios used here have global emissions close to this range (50\u201353 Gt CO2e). The Least-cost 2010 scenarios have much lower global emissions in 2020 (41\u201347 Gt CO2e). Third, the Least-cost 2020 scenarios are consistent with negotiations to deliver a new climate agreement, which provides a framework for higher ambition beginning in 2020. (Current negotiations aim to \u201cfurther raise the existing level of ... action and stated ambition to bring greenhouse gas emissions down.\u201d) For these reasons, the Least-cost 2020 scenarios are used for calculating emissions consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit, with the exception of the 2020 gap, as explained in Section 5 of the Summary. 7 Total greenhouse gas emissions here and elsewhere in the report refer to the sum of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorinated compounds and sulphur hexaflouride). 8 Since most scenarios assume that it will be difficult to remove 100 per cent of non-carbon dioxide emissions (for example, all of methane from agriculture) the scenarios assume that these residual emissions will be compensated for by net negative carbon dioxide emissions after total net zero greenhouse gas emissions are achieved. Under these circumstances, it is logical that first carbon neutrality is reached, and then net zero total greenhouse gas emissions. xvi EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary 2080 and 2100. Although this is somewhat later than the timing for carbon neutrality it does not assume slower reductions of non-carbon dioxide emissions. On the contrary, non-carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions are assumed to be reduced with about the same level of effort9. The estimates here are again based on a subset of scenarios that have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit10. As in the case of carbon neutrality, the net part of net zero emissions means that any global residual emissions from society could be compensated by enough uptake of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (negative emissions) to make sure that the net input of total greenhouse gases to the atmosphere is zero. Bringing global emissions down to below the pledge range in 2020 allows us to postpone the timing of carbon neutrality and net zero total emissions . An important consequence of the carbon budget is that the lower the annual emissions in the immediate future, including in the years up to 2020, the relatively higher they can be later, and the longer the time we have before exhausting the emissions budget. This would allow us to push back the timing of carbon neutrality and net-zero total emissions. Hence taking more action now reduces the need for taking more extreme action later to stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit. Following the budget approach, the levels of annual global emissions consistent with the 2 \u00b0C limit have been estimated. Under these circumstances, global emissions in 2050 are around 55 per cent below 2010 levels . By 2030 global emissions have already turned the corner and are more than 10 per cent below 2010 levels after earlier peaking . Countries took the important decision at the Durban Climate Conference11 to pursue a new climate agreement, expected to enter into effect in 2020. This raises the crucial question about which global emission levels after 2020 are consistent with staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit. The estimates in the following table (Table ES.1) were made with this question in mind12. These estimates are based on the same subset of scenarios from the IPCC AR5 database as used ____________________ 9 \u201cAbout the same level of effort\u201d means that both non-carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions are assumed to be reduced in the scenarios if they have similar costs (per carbon-equivalent) of reduction. The reason for the later timing of net zero total greenhouse gas emissions is explained in Footnote 8. 10 The same scenarios described in Footnote 6. 11 The 17th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. 12 Emission levels in this table are higher than those reported in the Emissions Gap report 2013.

Hence, emission levels in that report for the time frame up to 2050 were lower than in this report. It is worth noting, that because the scenarios used in this report have higher emissions over the next few years, they also assume that a much higher level of negative emissions will be needed to compensate for them later in the 21st century (see Section 3 of the Summary).

They have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit, assume pledge implementation in 2020, and then follow a least-cost emissions pathway after 202013. 3 . What are the consequences of delayed action? The consequences of postponing stringent emission reductions will be additional costs and higher risks to society . The current pathway of global emissions is consistent with scenarios that assume only modest emission reductions up to 2020 and then stringent mitigation thereafter14. By postponing rigorous action until 2020, this pathway will save on costs of mitigation in the near term. But it will bring much higher costs and risks later on, such as: i: much higher rates of global emission reductions in the medium term; ii: greater lock-in of carbon-intensive infrastructure; iii: greater dependence on using all available mitigation technologies in the medium-term; iv: greater costs of mitigation in the medium- and long-term, and greater risks of economic disruption; v: greater reliance on negative emissions; and vi: greater risks of failing to meet the 2 \u00b0C target, which would lead to substantially higher adaptation challenges and costs. xviii EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary Delaying stringent action till 2030 will further aggravate these risks and reduce the likelihood of meeting the 2 \u00b0C target to 50 per cent or less. Conversely, putting greater effort into reducing emissions over the next few years would reduce all of these risks and would bring many co-benefits along with climate mitigation (see Section 7 of the Summary). The higher the emissions level in the near term, the higher the level of negative emissions needed later in the century as compensation . Although scenarios routinely assume a substantial amount of global negative emissions, the feasibility of these assumptions still needs to be explored . Another consequence of the current pathway of emissions (see Section 2 of the Summary) is that it implies that net negative emissions are needed to stay within the 2 \u00b0C limit, to compensate for higher emissions in 2020 and following decades. Theoretically, carbon uptake or net negative emissions could be achieved by extensive reforestation and forest growth, or by schemes that combine bioenergy use with carbon capture and storage15. But the feasibility of such large-scale schemes is still uncertain. Even though they seem feasible on a small scale, the question remains as to how much they can be scaled up without having unacceptable social, economic or environmental consequences. As noted above, the quicker emissions are reduced now, the less society will be dependent on negative emissions later. 4 . Where are we headed under business-as- usual conditions? Although it is clear from the science that emissions soon need to peak to stay within the 2 \u00b0C target16, global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise . Without additional climate policies global emissions will increase hugely up to at least 2050 . Since 1990, global emissions have grown by more than 45 per cent and were approximately 54 Gt CO2e in 2012.

Under these scenarios, global greenhouse gas emissions would rise to about 59 Gt CO2e in 2020, 68 Gt CO2e in 2030 and 87 Gt CO2e in 2050. It is clear that global emissions are not expected to peak unless additional emission reduction policies are introduced. 5 . What about the 2020 emissions gap? The 2020 gap is not becoming smaller . Country pledges and commitments for 2020 result in only a moderate reduction in global emissions below business-as-usual levels . As an update of previous Emissions Gap reports, we have again estimated the expected level of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 under five pledge cases, which cover a range of variants for complying with country pledges and commitments. The range of median estimates is 52\u201354 Gt CO2e, about the same as in the 2013 report. It is 6\u201312 per cent above 2010 emissions of 49 Gt CO2e and about 7\u201312 per cent lower than the business-as-usual level in 2020. The 2020 emissions gap has been updated in this report. The gap in 2020 is defined as the difference between global emission levels consistent with the 2 \u00b0C target and the emission levels expected if country pledge cases are implemented. Global emissions in 2020 should not be higher than 44 Gt CO2e to have a likely chance of staying within ____________________ 15 Here and elsewhere in this Summary we refer to net negative emissions, meaning that on a global level, the sum of negative emissions exceeds any residual positive emissions to the atmosphere. Also, these are anthropogenic negative emissions and would have to be additional to any natural uptake of greenhouse gases by the biosphere or oceans. 16 About 85 per cent of scenarios in the IPCC scenario database with a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit have peak global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 or before. xix EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary the 2 \u00b0C target17. However, the range of expected global emissions (median estimates) from the pledge cases is 52\u201354 Gt CO2e in 2020, as noted above. The gap in 2020 is therefore 8\u201310 Gt CO2e (52 minus 44 and 54 minus 44). This is of the same magnitude as given in the 2013 report. For continuity, we base these estimates on the same kind of scenarios used in previous reports18. But these scenarios were computed some years ago and assume that a least-cost pathway with stringent emission reductions begins in 2010, whereas actual global emissions in recent years have been consistently higher. Hence, the 2020 gap estimate is becoming increasingly uncertain. Previous Emissions Gap reports pointed out that the potential exists to reduce emissions and narrow the gap in 2020, although this is becoming increasingly difficult as we get closer to that year. Nevertheless, the lower the emissions between now and 2020, the lower the risks caused by delaying emission reductions, as noted above. Without further action current pledges will not be met by a number of countries and global emissions could be above the top end of the pledge range . Above we saw that the current implementation level of pledges is not adequate for bridging the 2020 emissions gap, but it does slow down the growth in emissions. A further important question is whether countries are on track to realize the pledges. After reviewing available evidence from the G20 (with the EU 28 taken as a group) it appears that five parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 Brazil, China, the EU28, India and the Russian Federation \u2013 are on track to meet their pledges. Four parties \u2013 Australia, Canada, Mexico and the USA \u2013 are likely to require further action and/or purchased offsets to meet their pledges, according to government and independent estimates of projected national emissions in 2020. Conclusions are not drawn for Japan, the Republic of Korea, Indonesia and South Africa because of various uncertainties, nor for Argentina, Turkey and Saudi Arabia because they have not proposed pledges.

As countries discuss the contours of a new climate agreement for the period after 2020, the question arises whether an emissions gap will occur in 2030. The gap in 2030 is defined as the difference between global emission levels consistent with the 2 \u00b0C target versus the emissions levels expected if the pledge cases are extrapolated to 2030. This report estimates that global emissions in 2030 consistent with having a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C target are about 42 Gt CO2e19. As for expected emissions in 2030, the range of the pledge cases in 2020 (52\u201354 Gt CO2e) was extrapolated to give median estimates of 56\u201359 Gt CO2e in 2030. ____________________ 17 This estimate is based on the subset of emission scenarios from the IPCC AR5 database (called Least-cost 2010 scenarios in this report). These are the same type of scenarios used in previous Emissions Gap reports to compute the 2020 emissions gap. These scenarios begin in 2010, have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit, and follow a least-cost emissions pathway with stringent reductions (exceeding current pledges and commitments) after 2010. Least-cost emission pathway is defined in Footnote 6. 18 See Footnote 17. 19 This estimate is based on the subset of emission scenarios from the IPCC AR5 database described in Footnote 6. A different subset of scenarios was used for estimating the 2020 gap in order to be consistent with previous reports. xx EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary Figure ES .3: The emissions gap in 2030 Box S .1: The IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report* The findings in this report are consistent with those of the IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report, but not identical. Global emission reductions by 2050. The IPCC Synthesis report states: \u201cscenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2 oC are characterized by a 40\u201370 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, relative to 2010 levels\u201d. The numbers in this report (49\u201363 per cent) are consistent with the IPCC estimate. Timing of carbon neutrality. The IPCC Synthesis Report does not make an explicit statement about the timing of carbon neutrality. However, it can be inferred from Figure SPM.5a in the IPCC report that carbon neutrality is reached in the second half of the 21st century in scenarios of the IPCC\u2019s lowest scenario category, in line with a likely chance of limiting warming to below 2 \u00b0C. This is consistent with estimates here that carbon neutrality is reached between 2055 and 2070 (for scenarios that begin a least-cost pathway in 2020, as described in Footnote 6.) Timing of net zero global greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC Synthesis report states: \u201cscenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2 oC are characterized by ... emissions level[s] near zero or below in 2100\u201d. In this report it is estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions would reach net zero between 2080 and 2100, also based on scenarios that are likely to maintain warming at below 2 oC, but that specifically begin a least-cost pathway in 2020 (Footnote 6). * The Synthesis Report is available online at: http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_LONGERREPORT.pdf Median gap: 7\u201310 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 year 2025 2030 0 30 44 42 48 47 40 72 67 60 63 69 63 59 56 57 54 Median gap: 14\u201317 * Copenhagen Pledges in these scenarios were assumed to result in a range of 52 (50\u201353) Gt CO2e total greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

How can climate change mitigation be linked with actions to promote sustainable development? There is a strong case for integrating climate change mitigation in a policy framework that can deliver economic growth, social development and climate and environmental protection . Actions to mitigate climate change often have close synergies with policies that countries need for achieving domestic goals of improved energy access and energy security, or reduction in air pollution. The Sustainable Development Goals presented in the report of the Open Working Group20 underscore the many synergies between development goals and climate change mitigation goals. For example, efforts to eradicate energy poverty, promote universal access to cleaner forms of energy, and double energy efficiency, if fully realised, would go a long way towards bringing the world back to a path consistent with the temperature target set by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Linking development with climate mitigation also helps countries build energy efficient and low- emissions infrastructure for the coming decades, and achieve deep transformational changes in the economy and society worldwide. Policies and measures are being applied worldwide that promote both sustainable development and reduce greenhouse gas emissions . The good news is that countries and other actors are already widely applying policies that are very beneficial to both sustainable development and climate mitigation. About half the countries in the world have national policies for promoting more efficient use of energy in buildings, such as heating and/or cooling. About half are working on raising the efficiency of appliances and lighting. Other national policies and measures are promoting electricity generation with renewable energy, reducing transport demand and shifting transport modes, reducing process-related emissions from industry, and advancing sustainable agriculture. Significant public and private investments are flowing into energy efficiency (US$ 310\u2013360 billion in 2012) and renewable energy (US$ 244 billion in the same year). Non-state actors such as regions, cities and companies are also promoting policies that advance both sustainable development and emission reductions. Some of these non-state actors have come together (in some cases with governments) to form international cooperative initiatives (ICIs) for pursuing specific sustainable development, energy, environmental and climate mitigation objectives. These ICIs have the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in support of, and potentially beyond, national emission reduction pledges. The interest and importance of these initiatives is increasing and a plethora of new such initiatives were proposed at the UN Secretary General\u2019s Climate Summit in New York in September 201421. ____________________ 20 The report is available online at: http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/focussdgs.html 21 Further details are available online at: http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.html xxii EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary If climate mitigation actions already taking place were to be replicated and scaled up, they would provide a huge potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions . Experience shows that countries can make rapid progress in climate mitigation when they integrate climate policy into their core development strategy, lay out a long-term strategic vision, and build wide-ranging political support for those changes. Scaling up the many feasible actions that reduce emissions and promote sustainable development yields a large potential for reducing global emissions. In 2030 this potential adds up to no less than 29 Gt CO2e. As a reference point, this is equivalent to nearly 60 per cent of global emissions in 2010. New polices and measures based on proven approaches can provide the necessary incentives to achieve the full potential of climate mitigation and the associated short-term development benefits . New government policies are needed to overcome barriers and create the right incentives for climate mitigation. One approach is to adjust fuel prices, through carbon taxes or emissions trading systems, so that they incorporate the costs of climate change and other environmental damages. Another is to reduce or abolish subsidies on fossil fuels, estimated to be more than US$ 600 billion annually, and thereby avoid this huge annual governmental expenditure. To make investments in low-carbon and resource-efficient assets attractive, risks need to be reduced, the general investment climate improved, financing costs lowered and government budget support made available. New policies are needed to promote the diffusion of innovative technologies in order to overcome the risk aversion of potential users, and other obstacles. But the transition to a low-carbon future may create losers in some companies and segments of the population. The impact of new policies on these groups needs to be considered and enterprises and society need to be given time to adjust to the new paradigm. 8 .

Past Emissions Gap reports have focused on good practices in different sectors and their ability to stimulate economic activity and development, while reducing emissions. Following this tradition, this report focuses on the vast potential to improve energy efficiency across many different sectors. Globally the energy intensity between 2002 and 2012 was estimated to have improved on average by 1.6 per cent annually22. Improvements in energy efficiency in 18 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries over the period 2001\u20132011 have resulted in cumulative energy savings of 1 731 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) \u2013 more than the equivalent of the total energy demand of the EU in 2011. As a result, energy efficiency is increasingly called the \u2018first fuel\u2019. Improving energy efficiency comes with substantial multiple benefits. Not only does it reduce or avoid greenhouse emissions, but it has long been considered a main way to increase productivity and sustainability, primarily through the delivery of energy savings. Moreover, energy efficiency measures can contribute to economic growth and social development by increasing economic output, employment and energy security. In a scenario with carbon prices of US$ 70 per tonne, for example, improvements in energy efficiency are estimated to result in a ____________________ 22 Energy intensity and energy efficiency are not exactly equivalent since energy intensity is a function of both the economic structure and energy efficiency of an economy. However, as is often the case, if the economic structure does not change significantly over time, then the changes in energy intensity can be used as a proxy for changes in energy efficiency. xxiii EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary 0.2\u20130.5 per cent increase in gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030, relative to a baseline level23. Improving energy efficiency also has important positive social impacts. It reduces, for example, air pollution and its public health risks: nearly 100 000 premature deaths related to air pollution in six regions \u2013 Brazil, China, the EU, India, Mexico and the USA \u2013 could be avoided annually by 2030 through energy efficiency measures in the transport, buildings and industrial sectors. In many cases these benefits have a higher priority for governments than climate change mitigation. Hence improving energy efficiency can be seen as an excellent opportunity for linking sustainable development with climate mitigation. Improving energy efficiency has a high potential for reducing global emissions, and in a very cost effective way . Between 2015 and 2030, energy efficiency improvements worldwide could avoid 22\u201324 Gt CO2e (or 2.5\u20133.3 Gt CO2e annually in 2030) relative to a baseline scenario and assuming a carbon price of US$ 70 per tonne. This corresponds to a reduction in primary energy demand of about 5\u20137 per cent over the same 15-year period and relative to the same baseline scenario. Improvements in energy efficiency represent about one-fifth of all cost-effective emission reduction measures over the same 15-year period24. Depending on the assumptions, estimates are higher. For example, the International Energy Agency reports that end-use fuel and electricity efficiency could save 6.8 Gt CO2e in 2030, and power generation efficiency and fossil fuel switching could save 0.3 Gt CO2e, also in 2030. An assessment by the German Aerospace Centre estimates that 13 Gt CO2e could be saved in 2030 through energy efficiency improvements alone. Many energy efficiency measures can be implemented with negative or very low long-term costs due to reduced energy bills that offset the sometimes higher upfront costs, compared to less efficient technologies, not even considering positive economic effects and multiple societal benefits. There are great opportunities for improving the energy efficiency of heating, cooling, appliances and lighting in the buildings sector . There is tremendous potential for improving energy efficiency in the buildings sector. Because of advances in materials and know-how, new energy efficient buildings use 60\u201390 per cent less energy than conventional buildings of a similar type and configuration, and are cost-effective in all countries and climate zones. As compared to developed countries, the rate of new building construction in developing countries is much higher, which means that energy efficiency in buildings can best be achieved through regulations for building energy performance or codes for new construction. Several developing countries, and virtually all OECD countries, have some form of building code in place. Because they have an older building stock with a low rate of turnover, most developed countries also need to pay special attention to renovating their existing buildings in an energy efficient manner. The provision of heating, cooling and hot water is estimated to account for roughly half the global energy consumption in buildings.

The number of countries with these programmes has grown rapidly from 50\u201381 between 2004 and 2013. The two key policy measures used to improve energy efficiency of appliances and lighting include: i: mandating the energy performance of equipment through standards and regulation; and ii: labelling their energy performance. An important task is to acknowledge and tackle the many barriers to saving energy in buildings, including uneven dissemination of information, limited access to capital, high discount rates and market fragmentation. To overcome these and other barriers there are many successful and time- tested policies that can be drawn upon, including energy and carbon taxes, energy performance standards and regulations, investment grants, soft loans, mandatory energy audits, energy efficiency obligations (for example, for utilities) and energy labelling and certification schemes. Rather than applying standardized policies, the industrial sector uses a wide variety of country- and subsector-specific approaches to improve its energy efficiency . There is substantial potential for reducing energy use in the industrial sector. But due to its diverse nature, it has proven impractical to implement standardized policies and measures. Most policy packages are very country-, subsector- and size-specific. A typical approach is for governments to assist companies in identifying cost- effective investments, often through energy audits or in-depth energy reviews. Governments also provide incentives for making these investments by reducing the payback time of these investments, through subsidies and loans; by mandating, through energy-saving targets and emissions trading; or by encouraging implementation through voluntary agreements and differentiated electricity pricing. Three particularly promising policies and measures are worth highlighting: i: Corporate energy saving programmes lay down comprehensive requirements to reduce energy use in the industrial sector. China has one of the most extensive of these programmes, the Top-10,000 Energy-Consuming Enterprises. ii: Energy consumption targets are company- specific targets for energy-intensive sectors, such as aluminium or cement. India\u2019s Perform, Achieve and Trade, with its 478 target companies, is a major example. iii: Energy performance standards are common for three-phase electric motors \u2013 standards are now mandatory in 44 countries, including Brazil, China, the Republic of Korea and the USA. Another example is that China has applied specific energy efficiency standards to the production of 39 industrial commodities. Improving energy efficiency in the transport sector can slow down growing fuel consumption . Effective policies are available to make that happen . Worldwide, more than half of oil consumption is for transport; three-quarters of transport energy is consumed on roads. Without strong new policies, fuel use for road transport is projected to double between 2010 and 2050. Nevertheless, a huge amount of energy can be saved in the transport sector now and in the future through efficiency improvements. The principal means for improving energy efficiency in the transport sector is through mandatory fuel economy standards for road vehicles. Governments often supplement standards with other measures such as labelling, taxes and incentives, which aim to boost vehicle xxv EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Executive Summary efficiency and accelerate the market penetration of new efficient vehicle technologies. Vehicle fuel efficiency can also be increased by making the air conditioning, lighting and other non- engine components of vehicles more efficient or by modifying driving habits, which can reduce average fuel use by 10 per cent or more. An important approach to improving energy efficiency in the transport sector is to promote the use of more efficient transportation modes, especially by shifting from private vehicles to public transportation or bicycling. This shift in mode of transportation is being encouraged in many cities, especially in Europe, through local zoning policies that limit the use of private vehicles in certain areas.

The overall efficiency by which electricity is produced, transmitted and distributed can be greatly increased . Great potential exists for saving energy in the power sector. A key factor for improving energy efficiency is maintaining competition through appropriate legislation, regulations and policies with respect to open access, restructuring and deregulation. Another important approach is to support the retirement of inefficient and emissions- intensive production facilities as well as improving operating practices to make the production facilities, especially coal-based facilities, operate near their design heat-rate values. Improving energy efficiency in this sector also involves reducing transmission and distribution losses which amount to an annual global economic loss of more than US$ 61 billion and generate annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 700 million tonnes. One-third of network losses occur in transformers and as a response Australia, Canada, China and the USA have adopted energy performance standards to reduce these losses. Actions to improve energy efficiency sometimes have a rebound effect, in that they might stimulate further growth in energy demand and thus lower the greenhouse emissions reductions that are aimed for . The rebound effect, as applied to energy consumption, refers to the situation in which an efficiency improvement is counteracted by additional energy consumption. This could arise for various reasons, ranging from human behaviour to stimulated economic activity. The question arises whether some of the rebound effect can be viewed as an acceptable price for society to pay in order to get the multiple benefits described above. Considering the potential impact of this effect on the expectations of energy efficiency policies and measures, it is important to better understand its effects, and to take it into account when charting strategies for mitigating climate change. 1 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 1 Introduction chApter 1: Authors: Joseph Alcamo (University of Kassel), Daniel Puig (UNEP DTU Partnership), Joeri Rogelj (ETH Zurich / International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis) The road to a pivotal new climate treaty was laid out in Durban at the 17th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2011, where countries agreed to work towards a \u201cnew protocol, ... another legal instrument, or an agreed outcome with legal force\u201d. Now countries are moving along this road with the aim of adopting a new climate agreement in Paris at the 21st Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC, scheduled for December 2015. Although the time to the Paris Conference is short, the list of issues to be decided is long. Most are political, but some have an important scientific aspect. Among these are: \u201cwill current pledges and commitments in 2020 be enough to stay within temperature targets?\u201d and \u201cwhat long-term emissions are consistent with a 2 oC temperature limit?\u201d Since 2010 the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has produced an annual Emissions Gap Report to address these and other science-related issues of critical importance to the climate change negotiations. These reports have shown that an emissions gap is expected in 2020 between the level of global emissions consistent with the 2 oC limit and the level of ambition of countries. Nonetheless, they have also shown that the gap can be bridged through a wide range of policies and measures that will not only reduce emissions but also advance the sustainable development agenda. Since the publication of the first report in 2010, many parties to the UNFCCC and other stakeholders have asked for annual updates. This year the report not only updates the estimate of the emissions gap, but also has a new focus in response to the changing context of the climate Introduction negotiations, as governments look beyond 2020. Moreover, previous reports have concentrated on findings from least-cost scenarios that begin in 2010 or earlier. Using these, however, has become problematic because they do not take account of recent emission levels, which have been consistently higher than the scenarios. In preparing this report scientists have also been able to benefit from the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which has just published its Fifth Assessment Report (AR5; IPCC, 2014). The focus of this year\u2019s report is on the implications of the global emissions budget for staying within the 2 oC limit, a concept explored in the IPCC\u2019s AR5 (IPCC, 2014). As noted by the IPCC, scientists have found that an increase in global temperature is proportional to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fddda2a-4173-4a2d-bac7-1720bf7358b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fddda2a-4173-4a2d-bac7-1720bf7358b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcb859b19a8021826d74fc80d4b4ff9cfab9efbaf8b8bfa2e3a28874c7db4ad2"}}, "hash": "fcb859b19a8021826d74fc80d4b4ff9cfab9efbaf8b8bfa2e3a28874c7db4ad2", "text": "persist in the atmosphere. Building on this insight the IPCC has assessed the maximum amount of carbon dioxide that could be emitted to the atmosphere over time while keeping global warming below 2 oC. This is termed the \u201ccarbon dioxide emissions budget\u201d because if the world manages to stay within it, it should be possible to stay within the 2 oC global warming limit. Considering a theoretical situation in which carbon dioxide is the only anthropogenic greenhouse gas, the IPCC (IPCC, 2013) estimated a maximum total carbon budget of 3 670 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon dioxide for a \u201clikely chance\u201d of staying within the 2 oC limit1. However, since emissions began growing rapidly in the late 19th century, we have already emitted about 1 900 Gt carbon dioxide (IPCC, 2013). In addition, a variety of other substances that have an impact on global ____________________ 1 A \u201clikely\u201d chance denotes a greater than 66% chance, as specified by the IPCC. 2 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 1 Introduction warming are also emitted and further reduce the remaining budget to about 2 900 Gt CO2, leaving less than about 1 000 Gt carbon dioxide to emit in the future2. The key questions are: how can these emissions be best spread out over time; by which year should we target to be budget-neutral, that is, sequester as much as we emit; and, what is the maximum we can emit at different points in the future to stay on track? To tackle these questions, this year\u2019s report takes an emissions budget approach and analyses the scenarios published in the latest IPCC reports. Estimates are presented for future years in which carbon neutrality and net zero total emissions need to be reached to stay within the 2 oC temperature limit3. Here global carbon neutrality means that, globally, anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are net zero. Net zero implies that some remaining carbon dioxide emissions could be compensated by the same amount of carbon dioxide uptake (negative emissions), as long as the net input of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere due to human activities is zero. The report is organised into four chapters, including this introduction. Chapter 2 presents an update of current global emissions and business- as-usual projections, introduces the budget approach and presents emission levels consistent with temperature limits, as well as estimates of the timing of carbon neutrality and net zero emissions. Chapter 3 presents global emission projections under various cases of implementation of pledges and commitments. An update of the 2020 emissions gap is given, as well as a first estimate of the 2030 gap. While reporting on targets and gaps is useful, it is also important to provide guidance on how they can be reached or bridged. With this in mind, previous \u2018emissions gap\u2019 reports have given great attention to policies and measures that have the dual effect of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and promoting sustainable development. Chapter 4 in this year\u2019s report continues in this tradition and reviews a cross- cutting approach to mitigation that has clear, positive impacts on development. Chapter 4 shows that energy efficiency improvements not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, but also deliver multiple benefits, such as increased economic growth and job creation; improved health, by reducing air pollution; higher disposable income, by saving on energy costs; and other payoffs. Improving energy efficiency in combination with the many other mitigation approaches reviewed in previous reports can move the sustainable development agenda forward while reducing emissions and protecting the climate system. As in previous editions, this year\u2019s report has been put together by an international team of top scientists. This year 38 scientists from 22 scientific groups in 14 countries have contributed to the report. ____________________ 2 Working Group III of IPCC AR5 indicated that scenarios that have a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit have remaining carbon dioxide budgets between the years 2011 and 2100 of about 630 \u20131180 Gt CO2. The IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report highlights that limiting total human-induced warming to less than 2 \u00b0C relative to the period 1861\u20131880 with a probability greater than 66% would require cumulative CO2 emissions from all anthropogenic sources since 1870 to remain below about 2 900 Gt CO2. 3 The results in this report are fully consistent with those from the IPCC\u2019s AR5. However, the two reports give different types of projections. This report presents estimates of the timing of carbon neutrality and net zero total emissions, as well as emission levels consistent with temperature targets.

GWPs have been regularly updated in successive IPCC assessment reports and in the scientific literature. 2 Updated greenhouse gas emissions estimates as shown in Figure 2.1, based on Olivier et al.

This understanding has also made it possible to better estimate the levels of global emissions consistent with global temperature increase limits, such as 1.5 \u00b0C and 2 \u00b0C. This chapter first reviews estimates of recent global emission levels and trends; then examines business-as-usual emission levels that would theoretically be reached if no further action were taken to reduce emissions. Finally, it presents the levels of emissions that are consistent with limits to global temperature increases. 2 .1 Current global emission levels Different data sources give different estimates of global greenhouse gas emissions for 2010 (JRC/PBL, 2012; Blanco et al. 2014). The IPCC\u2019s AR5 gives a median estimate of 49 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (Gt CO2e; 49\u00b14.5 range, with a 5\u201395 per cent confidence interval)1. A recent update of trends in global emission levels (Figure 2.1) gives a median estimate of 51 Gt CO2e2. In this report (specifically, in Chapters 2 and 3) the AR5 value of 49 Gt CO2e is used. Figure 2.1 shows emission levels by major economic groupings for the period 1970\u20132012. Note that, due to different methodologies and data sources, these values may differ from data derived from national inventory submissions and communications. The general regional trends over recent years were described in last year\u2019s report. For 2010\u20132012, these preliminary estimates indicate that global emissions grew by an average of 3 per cent per year, to 53 and 54 Gt CO2e in 2011 and 2012, respectively (JRC/PBL, 2012; Olivier et al., 2013; Appendix 2-A). Trends varied from an increase of 6 per cent in the G20 countries that are not members of the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), to a decline of 1 and 2 per cent, respectively, in OECD Europe and OECD North America. Over the last decade, per person emissions also increased in non-OECD G20 countries and decreased in OECD Europe and OECD North America. 4 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits?

These emissions grew by about 2.4 per cent per year averaged over 2011 and 2012, and by 2.0 per cent in 20133. This represents a slowing of the 2.7 per cent per year rate of growth experienced over the preceding decade. At the global level, these emissions are fairly well estimated, within a range of \u00b18 per cent (5\u201395 per cent confidence interval; Andres et al., 2012). Cumulative carbon dioxide emissions are also a useful indicator of climate impact and the most recent trends, to 2010, are reviewed in AR5 (Blanco et al., 2014). Methane is the second largest greenhouse gas, and its apparent importance has increased because estimates of its global warming potential have increased from 21 to 284. Methane\u2019s share of total greenhouse gas emissions increases from 16 per cent to 20 per cent if the higher estimate of GWP is used (Edenhofer et al., 2014). The absolute value and trends in methane emissions are more uncertain (around \u00b120 per cent) than estimates of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production (Blanco et al., 2014). This uncertainty is apparent in the discrepancy between emission estimates based on emission inventories versus atmospheric measurements. While global (anthropogenic) methane emission levels have been steadily increasing over the last three decades according to global emission inventories, they have been stable ssor decreasing based on an inversion analysis of methane concentration trends in the atmosphere (Kirschke et al., 2013). Since 2006, however, both ways of estimating anthropogenic methane emissions indicate that global emissions have been increasing. 2 .2 Business-as-usual emission levels To track the progress of additional targeted climate policies, it is useful to have a reference point for estimating emission levels in the absence of additional policies. When these reference points are presented over a series of future years, they are called business-as-usual (BaU) scenarios. This part of the report presents BaU scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions5 up to 2050. The BaU scenarios shown here are based on an extrapolation of current economic, social and technological trends. They only take into account climate policies implemented up to around 2005\u201320106 (i.e. recent country pledges and policies are not considered) and therefore serve as a reference point for what would happen to emissions if planned climate mitigation policies were not implemented. The BaU scenarios presented here draw on a much larger and more diverse ensemble of scenarios than previously available. Since the 2013 report, a number of model inter-comparison projects have reported their findings7, on which the recently published AR5 drew heavily. In fact, a novel product of the AR5 exercise is an interactive scenario database containing all pathways that were reviewed, both BaU and greenhouse gas mitigation scenarios, including thorough explanations of their scenario designs and policy assumptions8. Nearly 1 200 scenarios populate the AR5 Database, and about 250 of these can be ____________________ 3 The average of estimates from JRC/PBL (2014) and Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al.

(1996) and the new estimate of 28 is from the IPCC AR5 based on new physical science understanding from Myhre et al. (2013). 5 Unless otherwise noted, greenhouse gas emissions or total greenhouse gas emissions refers to the sum of the six greenhouse gases included in the Kyoto Protocol (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs and SF6). It includes emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the energy and industry sectors, as well as from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). 6 Different models use different base years for their internal calibration. 7 Examples include AMPERE (Riahi et al., 2014; Kriegler et al., 2014a), EMF27 (Kriegler et al., 2014b), LIMITS (Kriegler et al., 2013; Tavoni et al., 2013), and RoSE (Luderer et al., 2013a). 8 The IPCC WG III AR5 Scenario Database can be accessed at: https://secure.iiasa.ac.at/web-apps/ene/AR5DB/ 6 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? considered BaU ones according to the definition applied here9.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dea7b127-3669-4e2e-a6e0-cb53cb80879f": {"__data__": {"id_": "dea7b127-3669-4e2e-a6e0-cb53cb80879f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "492fdf77bf7927cb1212fbfe6a85583e009e86a2cb652ccfda3c0d4a8b315ba7"}, "2": {"node_id": "1314621c-9ffa-4d76-9573-79b00466328c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "709e99c09b14ca8fb5083dfc21b10634c4e0b48089514e2ab5ef5ddf6779855e"}}, "hash": "d9e748aa90631b171ae9812142eb83754230de91f4ed938a3b60fc4c0f856f0f", "text": "considered BaU ones according to the definition applied here9.

Such steep upward trajectories are consistent with global average temperature levels that are around 4 \u00b0C warmer in the year 2100 than the period 1850\u20131900. The likelihood of staying below 2 \u00b0C warming is extremely small in this case (Table 6.3 of IPCC WGIII AR5). The uncertainty ranges of the BaU emissions projections shown in Figure 2.2 reflect different interpretations of economic, social and tech- nological trends. For example, scenarios that are optimistic about fossils fuels and/or are pessimistic about renewable or nuclear energy tend to have emissions near the top of the range. By contrast, scenarios that assume slower growth of the economy and/or energy demand, relative to economic activity, tend to have emissions at the lower part of the range. Although the differences between scenarios are fairly minor in the short- term (2020), they become more pronounced by 2030. 2 .3 Global emission levels linked with global warming limits 2 .3 .1 Introduction As noted above, countries have agreed to limit global warming to 2 \u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels, and to consider lowering that limit to 1.5 \u00b0C (UNFCCC, 2010). Findings reported here and elsewhere, have made it clear that society must limit emissions if it is to stay within its own global warming limits. This raises some important questions which are dealt with in this section: - What is the level of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions consistent with limiting warming to below 1.5 \u00b0C or 2 \u00b0C? - How can this budget of cumulative emissions be distributed over time? Under these budgetary constraints, when are global carbon dioxide emissions expected to reach zero? And how does this translate into a path for total greenhouse gases over time? - What are the implications of not increasing climate mitigation efforts significantly beyond their current levels? To address these and other questions, this section draws on the scenarios compiled by AR5 grouped according to their temperature outcomes (Appendix 2-D)12. ____________________ 9 Because the different scenarios have different base year (2010) estimates for emissions (most likely resulting from non-standardized data sources and conversion methodologies across models), the current analysis normalizes all 2010 emissions to the same value. An estimate of 49 Gt CO2e per year is used for doing this because that was the best available value at the time the models were running scenarios for the IPCC AR5 process. Future emissions growth in each scenario is then indexed to this common base-year value. The emission pathways reported in this section have all been indexed in this way. For the non-indexed emission pathways, including the 2010 ranges, see Appendix 2-B. It should be noted, however, that these adjustments via base-year indexing have only a small effect on the spread of future emissions: a variety of other factors are at play. To be sure, the indexing methodology, as applied here, leads to slight increases in emissions levels in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 relative to the raw scenario data, primarily because the majority of models/scenarios in the IPCC AR5-assessed literature use lower values for 2010 emissions. Note that previous studies of baseline emissions projections, for example Blanford et al. (2012), have utilized similar normalizing/ indexing methodologies to control for different base-year starting points across models. 10 For list of Kyoto gases, see Footnote 5. 11 Unless otherwise stated, all ranges in this and other sections of the report are expressed as 20th\u201380th percentiles. 12 The IPCC AR5 Working Group III Contribution grouped scenarios based on their resulting carbon dioxide-equivalent concentrations in 2100. This choice allows for a direct comparison with the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that were used by the other working groups of the IPCC AR5. In contrast, the main focus of this report is the temperature outcome of emission scenarios. Therefore, the IPCC scenarios are re-grouped based on their probabilities of limiting warming to below specific temperature levels. Appendix 2-D provides a detailed comparison of the results of this report and the findings of the IPCC AR5. 7 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis Chapter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e2ff2ad-3189-496b-aa5c-2dd79b0102e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e2ff2ad-3189-496b-aa5c-2dd79b0102e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebe7abd8872ca0c6eaab4e3e68dc4280bf22e80e159336b6dfefb9a4360777e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "b37d6268-ea80-431a-b4c4-244ba0822473", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bd038c4b1f6e8cb5c474166aaf89a5c2ece41964512ea12b828a8e688201beb"}}, "hash": "605df25c27cdf19c0979c1ed834efd5d43dbddfe5848772f264cf742036be6b1", "text": "Max 80% Median 20% Min # of scenarios = 191 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020 2030 2040 2050 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 time (years) Global annual greenhouse gas emissions (Gt CO2e) 59 Gt CO2e (57\u201361) 68 Gt CO2e (63\u201372) 77 Gt CO2e (69\u201383) 87 Gt CO2e (75\u201392) History (from FF&I and LULUCF) Figure 2 .2: Global greenhouse gas emissions in business-as-usual scenarios Notes: Consistent with IPCC WG", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e2e3495-bfb8-432b-be8f-2d0227d93d9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e2e3495-bfb8-432b-be8f-2d0227d93d9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Emissions Gap Report 2014", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.unep.org/resources/emissions-gap-report-2014", "Author": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Environment Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a2d1bfa4dd3fbe5babcfa467745854c68d6b83550235da8817318369373c2cd"}}, "hash": "4a2d1bfa4dd3fbe5babcfa467745854c68d6b83550235da8817318369373c2cd", "text": "III AR5 Chapter 6, carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions are constructed using GWPs over a 100-year time horizon derived from the IPCC Second Assessment Report (see Annex II.9.1 for the GWP values of the different greenhouse gases).

In doing so it assessed a new metric for expressing this sensitivity \u2013 the transient climate response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE). Using the TCRE concept, Working Group I showed that global mean temperature increases are almost directly proportional to cumulative carbon dioxide emissions since the pre-industrial period. This leads to the important conclusion that there is a maximum amount of carbon dioxide emissions, or budget that can be discharged to the atmosphere over time if society wishes to stay within a 2 \u00b0C or other global warming limit. Both Working Group I and III of AR5 provide carbon dioxide emission budgets in line with various temperature levels (Box 2.1). Because carbon dioxide plays a dominant role in determining long-term warming, we first focus on carbon dioxide emissions and later on total greenhouse gas emissions. 8 EMISSIONS GAP REPORT A UNEP Synthesis chApter 2 What emission levels will comply with temperature limits? Box 2 .1: IPCC AR5 and carbon dioxide emission budgets Figure B.2.1 (based on Figure SPM.10 of (IPCC, 2013) illustrates how cumulative carbon dioxide emissions are influenced by various factors. If we hypothetically assume that carbon dioxide is the only greenhouse gas affecting global temperature and the response of temperature to cumulative carbon dioxide emissions is constant and well known, then the relationship between global warming and emissions would be represented by a straight line (Panel A). However, since the response is not perfectly known, it has an uncertainty range as illustrated by the grey areas in Panels B, C, and D. Staying below a given temperature limit with a higher probability \u2013 for example very likely compared to likely \u2013 implies a smaller carbon dioxide budget (Panel B). Furthermore, lowering the temperature limit, say, from 2 \u00b0C to 1.5 \u00b0C, also implies a smaller budget (panel C). Finally, taking into account the additional global warming caused by non-carbon dioxide emissions at the time when global temperature peaks also reduces the emissions budget, and adds additional uncertainties as expressed by the larger light-orange area in Panel D.

All in all, this means that annual emissions must ultimately decline, and if they are high now they will have to decline faster later to stay within the budget. Conversely, if annual emissions are lower at the beginning of the budget period, they can be somewhat higher at a later time. This, however, implies a trade-off between earlier and later mitigation costs, and between risks linked to the different strategies (Section 2.3.4).

Here this uncertainty is taken into account by grouping scenarios according to their probability to limit warming to below a given temperature limit. A likely chance as used here denotes a greater than 66 per cent probability (Mastrandrea et al., 2010) and a medium chance a probability of 50\u201366 per cent. The idea of a carbon dioxide emissions budget implies that annual emissions at some point in time become zero or negative in order to stay As to the size of the carbon dioxide emissions budget, Working Group I of the IPCC indicated \u2013 again for the hypothetical case that carbon dioxide would be the only anthropogenic greenhouse gas \u2013 that there was a greater than 66 per cent chance that the 2 \u00b0C limit could be maintained if cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from around 1860\u20131880 to some point in the future could be held to 3 670 Gt CO2 or less. For a greater than 50 per cent chance, this figure is 4 440 Gt CO2 and for a 33 per cent chance it is 5 760 Gt CO2. Taking into account non-carbon dioxide emissions, these budgets are smaller. As a reference point, by year 2011 a total of 1 890 Gt CO2 (1 630\u20132 150, 95 per cent confidence range) had already been emitted into the atmosphere by human activities. Hence a large share of the carbon dioxide emissions budget for limiting global warming to 2 \u00b0C has already been used up. IPCC Working Group III also provided information on carbon dioxide emission budgets as part of their analyses of mitigation scenarios (Clarke et al., 2014). For scenarios with a likely chance of staying within the 2 \u00b0C limit, they found that cumulative carbon dioxide emissions from 2011 until 2050 are in the range of 550\u20131 300 Gt CO2 and from 2011 until 2100 in the range of 630\u20131 180 Gt CO2. These figures are broadly consistent with the results from Working Group I. However, the IPCC WGIII assessment, by further exploring the uncertainty in pathways and including a wide range of non-carbon dioxide forcing, has consistently lowered the estimates of carbon dioxide emission budgets in line with 2 \u00b0C as compared to those from WGI, which were based on the hypothetical assumption that carbon dioxide is the only anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Finally, based on multi-model results, the IPCC Synthesis Report stated that likely limiting total human-induced warming (accounting for both CO2 and other human influences on climate) to less than 2 \u00b0C relative to the period 1861\u20131880 would require total CO2 emissions from all anthro
