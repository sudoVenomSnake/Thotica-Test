the Ram Ghat bank, along Delhi\u2019s north-east stretch, 52-year-old Haldar and his two friends are enjoying a quiet smoke. \u201cI moved here from Kalindi Kunj Ghat three years ago. There\u2019s no fish there, earlier there was plenty. Only some catfish remain now. Quite a few of these are dirty and cause allergy, rash, fever and diarrhoea,\u201d he says, untangling a handmade net that resembles a puffy white cloud from afar. Unlike other species that live deeper in the water, the catfish is able to float to the surface and breathe \u2013 and so survives better than the others. Predators in this ecosystem, explains Delhi-based marine conservationist Divya Karnad, concentrate toxins in their body because of eating fish lower down in the food chain exposed to those poisons. \u201cSo it makes sense that people eating catfish \u2013 a scavenger-carnivore \u2013 suffer reactions.\u201d ***** Nearly 87 per cent of India's fish catch potential is available within waters of a 100 metres depth, says Occupation of the Coast: the Blue Economy in India , a publication of the Delhi-based Research Collective, a non-profit group active on these issues. Most of that is within reach of the country\u2019s fishing communities. It fosters not just food, but also daily lives and cultures. \u201cNow you're breaking the small-scale economy of the fishers,\u201d points out Pradip Chatterjee, head of the National Platform for Small Scale Fish Workers (Inland) (NPSSFWI).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b5bfca9-7e7a-45ea-808f-d966ff6b62d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b5bfca9-7e7a-45ea-808f-d966ff6b62d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-yamunas-dead-fish-will-be-fresher/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nShalini Singh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "When Yamuna\u2019s \u2018dead fish will be fresher\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-yamunas-dead-fish-will-be-fresher/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nShalini Singh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "b75f6bd82641cf0e9e0c0e228cdc8d6030695ed5220f4307137d7d2aa1ecfa31"}, "2": {"node_id": "697b1c4b-d188-42f5-a049-22fdac35f140", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/when-yamunas-dead-fish-will-be-fresher/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nShalini Singh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "a913c9ad341f7e4db51a6162312ff8aa2f9b1bfef874a0fa50b1512559e10ed7"}}, "hash": "2864e972c838fe6534a528856c3373d801876b7bec80aad3eb5eae51ae51b105", "text": "\u201cThey supply local fish to local markets, and if you don't get it, then you will bring fish from faraway places, again using transport which aggravates the crisis.\u201d Shifting to groundwater means \u201cusing more energy, which will then interfere with the water cycle.\u201d That, he points out, means \u201cwater bodies will get affected, and rivers won't get recharged.

But there are perhaps 7-8 times that number connected to or dependent on the fishing economy. And, says NPSSFWI\u2019s Chatterjee, 4 million of those could be inland fish-workers. There have been, over decades, millions dropping out of fishing as a full-time or organised activity. \u201cAlmost 60-70 per cent of marine fishers have turned to other things as the community gets decimated,\u201d says Chatterjee. But perhaps because the very idea of fisherfolk in the capital is so unusual, there seem to be no records, no published data, of how many fishermen there were and are in the Delhi stretch of the Yamuna. Also, several are migrants like Sahni, making counts more difficult. What the surviving fishermen agree on is that their numbers have shrunk. Retired Forest Service Officer Manoj Mishra, who leads the Long Live Yamuna movement, feels that from thousands prior to Independence, there are now less than a hundred full-timers. \u201cThe absence of fishers from Yamuna is an indication that the river is dead or dying. They are a marker of how things are,\u201d says Research Collective\u2019s Siddharth Chakravarty. And what\u2019s going on \u201cadds to, and is spurred by, a climate crisis that is driven by human activity. It also means that the biodiversity that rejuvenates the environment doesn't take place,\u201d says Chakravarty. \u201cThat in turn affects the cycle of life, given that 40 per cent of the carbon emission is absorbed by oceans globally.\u201d ***** With 40 per cent of Delhi having no sewer connection, countless tons of excrement and waste material from septic tanks and other sources, is just dumped into the water. The NGT notes that while less than 20 per cent of the 1,797 (unauthorised) colonies had sewage pipelines, \u201ca staggering 51,837 industries are operating illegally in residential areas whose effluents go directly into the drains and ultimately, the river.\u201d The current crisis can be seen in the context of a river's death, in terms of its links with the scale, pattern and economics of human activity.

In October 2019, for the first time in over 100 years, idol immersion during Durga Puja was banned in Delhi after an NGT report noted that such activities were hurting the river in a big way.

Their water system, considered almost an art form, today lies as historical ruins. The British in the 18th century treated water as a mere resource, even building New Delhi to face away from the Yamuna. Over time, the populace exploded and urbanised. In the book Narratives of the Environment of Delhi (published by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage), old timers recall how, between the 1940s and 1970s, fishing, boating, swimming and picnics at Delhi's Okhla area were a part of life.

India exported $4.8 billion worth of shrimp in 2017-18. Overwhelmingly, says Chakravarty, this was farmed fish of an exotic variety \u2013 the Pacific White shrimp from Mexican waters. India is into this monoculture because \u201cthere is a huge demand in the US for Mexican shrimp.\u201d Just 10 per cent of our shrimp export consists of Black Tiger prawn that is wild-caught in Indian waters. India is embracing a biodiversity loss that, in turn, affects livelihoods. \u201cIf the policy is going to be export oriented, it will be expensive and not geared towards local nutrition and needs.\u201d Faced with a bleak future, Haldar still takes pride in his craft.

Delhi is a catchment for the Yamuna. You can't clean the river without cleaning the catchment.\u201d Fishermen are the canaries in our coal-mine, points out marine conservationist Divya Karnad. \u201cHow can we not see that heavy metals cause central nervous system breakdowns? And then not see that drawing groundwater from areas near one of the most polluted rivers is having an impact on our mental health?

India\u2019s literary epics had it nailed down ages ago, asserts 75-year-old Delhi farmer Shiv Shankar. He believes he is paraphrasing lines from the 16th century classic Ramcharitamanas ( see video ). Shankar may be a bit rusty in his reading of the classics, and you might find it difficult to locate those lines in the original Tulsidas poem. But the words of this farmer in the floodplains of the Yamuna river seem well suited to our own era. Shankar, his family and many other cultivators describe, in painstaking detail, the many changes in temperature, weather and climate affecting what is one of the largest floodplains in an urban area anywhere. Just 22 of the 1,376 kilometres of the Yamuna flow through the National Capital Territory, and its 97 square kilometre floodplains account for barely 6.5 per cent of Delhi\u2019s area. But that seemingly small presence has a big impact in balancing the climate, also functioning like nature\u2019s thermostat for the capital. Farmers here note the changes now underway in their own idiom. Till 25 years ago, says Shiv Shankar\u2019s son Vijender Singh, people here started using light blankets by September. \u201cNow,\u201d says the 35-year-old, \u201cwinter doesn't start till December.

Their people lobbied with ministers and we were thrown out of business.\u201d And sometimes, weather extremes combine with political-administrative decisions to wreak havoc. The flooding of the Yamuna this year \u2013 when Haryana released water from the Hathni Kund barrage in August, it coincided with the rains in Delhi \u2013 destroyed several crops. Vijender shows us the shrunken chillies, shrivelled brinjals, and puny radish plants that will not bloom this season in their five bigha (one acre) plot here in Bela Estate (located just behind the national memorials of Rajghat and Shantivan). This capital city has for long had a semi-arid climate. It was a south-east division of the agricultural state of Punjab before it became the British capital in 1911, and is surrounded by the Rajasthan desert to the west, Himalayan mountains towards the north and Indo-Gangetic plains to the east. (All regions also grappling with climate change today). This meant cold winters and scorching summers, with the monsoon providing a 3 to 4 month reprieve. Now it\u2019s more erratic. Delhi recorded a rainfall deficit of 38 per cent in the June-August season this year according to the India Meteorological Department. It received 404.1 mm rain against a normal of 648.9 mm. Simply put, Delhi saw its poorest monsoon in five years.

It\u2019s pace of urbanisation \u2013 mainly, rapid construction activity, legal and illegal \u2013 means Delhi could be the most populous city in the world by 2030, according to UN estimates.

Untreated sewage from around 12 nallah s (open sewers) flowing from surrounding localities, industrial sludge, and effluents from two municipal wastewater treatment facilities in Versova and Malad West, now drain into the once-clear creek of Bhagwan\u2019s memory. \u201cThere is hardly any marine life. All this pollution goes 20 nautical miles into the sea.

Mangroves are critical spawning grounds for fish. A 2005 paper in the Indian Journal of Marine Sciences notes, \"Mangrove forests not only support coastal marine organisms, but also protect the coast from erosion and serve as breeding, feeding and nursery grounds for estuarine and marine organisms.\u201d In just 11 years from 1990 to 2001, the paper adds, a total of 36.54 square kilometres of mangroves was lost in just the Mumbai suburban region. \"The fish used to come to the coast to lay their eggs [in the mangroves], but that cannot happen now,\u201d Bhagwan says. \u201cWe have destroyed as many mangroves as we could. Very few are left. The buildings on the coastline in the suburbs and entire localities here, like Lokhandwala and Adarsh Nagar, were mangroves earlier.\u201d As a result, with the fish all but gone from Malad creek and the nearby shorelines, over the years, the fishermen of Versova Koliwada have been forced to go deeper into the sea. But in the deep seas too, rising sea temperatures, increasing cyclonic storms, and over-fishing by trawlers have hit their business. \u201cEarlier, they didn\u2019t have to go deep sea fishing [more than 20 kilometres from the shore] because the coastal ecology was so rich,\u201d says Ketaki Bhadgaonkar of Bombay 61, a group of architects studying the effects of coastal pollution and climate change in Versova Koliwada. \u201cDeep sea fishing has made fishing economically unviable because it involves a lot of investment in big boats, a crew and so on.

The number of boats has increased and the time that trawlers (some owned by koliwada locals too) and other big boats spend at sea has gone up too. In the year 2000, he notes, these boats would spend 6-8 days at sea; this rose to 10-15 days and is now 16-20 days. This has added to the pressure on the existing fish stock in the sea. And, he says, the floor ecology has degraded due to trawling, \u201cwhich scrapes the ground [sea floor], uproots plants and does not allow the organisms to grow naturally.\" The total fish catch in Maharashtra, Deshmukh says, touched a high in 2003, when it was around 4.5 lakh tonnes, the highest in its documented history since 1950. With overfishing the catch went down every year after that \u2013 it was 3.81 lakh tonnes in 2017. \u201cOver-harvesting and bottom trawling are degrading fish habitats and threatening the entire production of ocean biodiversity hotspots,\u201d says the book In Dead Water , \u201cmaking them more vulnerable to climate change.\u201d And, it says, the impacts of human activity (including pollution and mangrove-destruction) will be further compounded by sea level rise and increased frequency and intensity of storms. Both are in evidence in the Arabian Sea \u2013 and thereby in Versova Koliwada. \"...anthropogenic forcing has increased the probability of late-season ECSCs [extremely severe cyclonic storms] over the Arabian Sea\u2026\u201d says a paper published in Nature Climate Change in 2017. <img alt=\"Extensive land reclamation and construction along the shore have decimated mangroves, altered water patterns and severely impacted Mumbai's fishing communities\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/Low-res-P1000105-2.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/Low-res-P1000105-2.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:500px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Subuhi Jiwani Extensive land reclamation and construction along the shore have decimated mangroves, altered water patterns and severely impacted Mumbai's fishing communities var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); These storms hit fishing communities the hardest, observes Prof. D. Parthasarathy, convenor of the Climate Studies department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. \u201cBecause of the decline in the fish catch, fishermen are forced to go deeper into the sea. But [some of] their boats are quite small and they are not equipped for the deep sea. So when there are storms and cyclones, they get affected more. Fishing is becoming much more uncertain and much more risky.\u201d Rising sea levels is another linked problem. Along the Indian coast, the levels have risen by 8.5 centimetres during the past 50 years \u2013 or around 1.7 millimetres per year (said the government in the Rajya Sabha in November 2019, responding to a question raised in Parliament).

On August 3, 2019, for example, Mumbai received 204 millimetres of rain \u2013 the third highest 24-hour August rainfall in a decade \u2013 and a high tide of 4.9 metres (around 16 feet). On that day, several small boats docked at Versova Koliwada were thrashed around by strong waves, and the fishing community suffered heavy losses. \u201cThat side of koliwada [where the boats are kept] has been reclaimed, but for the last seven years, water had not risen as much as it did that day,\u201d says Dinesh Dhanga, chairman of the Versova Mashemari Laghu Nauka Sanghatana, an organisation of around 250 fishermen who work on 148 small boats. \u201cThe storm came during high tide, so the water level rose twice as high. Some boats drowned, some were broken. Fishermen lost their nets and water got into the engines of some boats.\u201d Each boat, Dinesh says, can cost up to Rs. 45,000. The nets cost up to Rs. 2,500 each. All this has had a huge impact on the livelihoods of Versova\u2019s fishing community \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a difference of 65-70 per cent in the catch,\u201d says Priya Bhanji. \u201cIf we\u2019re taking 10 tokri s [baskets] to the market now, we used to take 20 tokri s earlier [around two decades ago]. It\u2019s huge difference.\u201d And while the size of the catch has decreased, the price at which the women buy the fish at the wholesale market near the dock has risen \u2013 so their profits have steadily fallen. \"Earlier, we used to sell our biggest piece [of pomfret], about a foot long, for Rs. 500. Now for that price, we sell a six-inch pomfret. The size of pomfret has become smaller and the prices have gone up,\u201d adds Priya, who makes Rs. 500-600 a day on the three days she goes to sell fish. <img alt=\"Left: Dinesh Dhanga (on the right right) heads an organisation of around 250 fishermen operating small boats; its members include Sunil Kapatil (left) and Rakesh Sukacha (centre).

They\u2019re up by 3 each morning. They\u2019ve got to be at work by 5 a.m. and need to complete all their household tasks before that. The commute to their vast, wet workplace is a short walk. They just step out of their homes, stride up to the sea \u2013 and dive in. Sometimes they take a boat to nearby islands \u2013 and dive in around those. They will do this repeatedly for the next 7-10 hours, surfacing from each dive clutching a bundle of seaweed as if their lives depended on it \u2013 as indeed they do. Diving into the waters to collect those marine plants and algae is the main source of earning for these women from the fishing hamlet of Bharathinagar in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Ramanathapuram district. On a working day, they carry \u2018protective gear\u2019, along with clothes and net bags. While boatmen ferry them to the islands with waters rich in seaweed, the women tie their sarees dhoti-style between their legs, attach the net bags around their waists, and wear t-shirts atop their sarees. The \u2018protection\u2019 consists of goggles for their eyes, strips of cloth wound around their fingers or surgical gloves for some, and rubber slippers to prevent their feet from being cut on sharp rocks. These they use, whether just offshore or around the islands. Seaweed harvesting is a traditional occupation passed on from mother to daughter through the generations in this region. For some single and destitute women, it is the only source of income. An income that is dwindling as the seaweed gets less and less, a fallout of warming, rising sea levels, changing weather and climate, and overexploitation of this resource. \u201cThe growth of seaweed has drastically fallen,\u201d says P. Rakkamma, 42. Like the other women harvesters at work here, she is from Bharathinagar, which is near Mayakulam village of Thiruppullani block. \u201cWe do not find the same amount of it as we used to earlier. It now sometimes gives us work for only 10 days in a month.\u201d Given that there are only five months in a year when there is systematic harvesting by the women, that\u2019s a blow.

Palani Kumar P. Raniamma with her harvest of marikozhunthu , a small edible seaweed variety The yields reflect that fall. \u201cFive years ago, we used to harvest at least 10 kilograms of marikozhunthu in seven hours,\u201d says S. Amritham, 45. \u201cBut now, no more 3 to 4 kilos in a day. Also, the size of the seaweed has reduced over the years.\u201d The industry around it has shrunk too. As late as 2014, there were 37 agar units in Madurai, says A. Bose who owns a seaweed processing company in that district. Today, he says, there are just about 7 \u2013 and those are functioning at 40 per cent of their capacity. Bose used to be president of the All-India Agar and Alginate Manufacturers Welfare Association \u2013 a body dysfunctional for the last two years because of a shortage of members. \u201cThe number of days we get work has reduced,\u201d says M. Mariamma, 55, who has been diving for seaweed for over four decades. \u201cWe do not have any other job opportunities during the off-season.\u201d When Mariamma was born, in 1964, Mayakulam village could expect 179 days in a year when temperatures would reach 38 degrees Celsius or higher. In 2019, that would be 271 such hotter days \u2013 an over 50 per cent increase. In the next 25 years, the region could see between 286 and 324 such days, according to a calculation from an interactive tool on climate and global warming posted online by the New York Times this July. There is little doubt that the seas, too, are warming. All this has an impact on something beyond just the fisherwomen of Bharathinagar. The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mentions, without endorsing, studies that view seaweed as a potentially important factor in mitigating climate stress. The report itself concedes that: \u201cSeaweed aquaculture warrants further research attention.\" Prof. Tuhin Ghosh of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, was one of the lead authors of that report. His views seem to validate what the fisherwomen are saying about a decline in their yields. \u201cIt is not only seaweed, but a host of other processes that are declining or gaining pace [like migration],\u201d he told PARI on the phone. \u201cThat would be true of fish yields , prawn seed yields, and several things connected to both seas and land, including crab collection, honey collection, migrations ( as seen in the Sundarbans ) and more.\u201d <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/04-PK-20150104-0477-PK-Tamil_Nadus_seaweed_ha.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 M. Palani Kumar Sometimes, from here, the women take a boat to nearby islands to dive in from there What the fishing communities are saying, Prof. Ghosh says, has substance. \u201cHowever, in the case of fish, it is not just a matter of changing climate \u2013 but also the severe overexploitation by trawlers and industrial-scale fishing. That has sharply depleted the catch in the normal channels of the traditional fisherfolk.\u201d While trawlers may not affect seaweed, industrial overexploitation undoubtedly does. The women of Bharathinagar and their fellow harvesters appear to have pondered their own important, if small, role in that process. Activists and researchers who have worked with them say that, worried by the shrinking yields, they held meetings among themselves and decided to restrict systematic harvesting to five months from July.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60f18310-2ede-4700-8a32-3247e4aa463d": {"__data__": {"id_": "60f18310-2ede-4700-8a32-3247e4aa463d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/tamil-nadus-seaweed-harvesters-in-rough-seas/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nM.

They have understood that many changes are underway in their lives and occupation. They have observed and experienced the changes in the behaviour of the seas, and in temperatures, weather and climate. They have also realised something about the role of human activity (including their own) in the many changes taking place. At the same time, their only income is locked into the whole, complicated set of processes.

Their activity is anything but simple and not without risk. The seas are getting more difficult, and some weeks ago, four fishermen died in a storm in this region. Only three bodies were recovered, and locals believe the winds will get slower and the seas calmer only when the fourth is found as well. As the locals would say, without the favour of the winds, all sea-related work is challenging. With changes in larger climatic conditions, too many days are unpredictable.

If it had rained, you\u2019d see crabs swarming in the water on the farm, incubating, he adds, standing amid the drying yellowish-green paddy. \u201cMy tillers won\u2019t survive,\u201d is the anxious refrain of this farmer in his early 30s. In Rawanwadi, his village of 542 people (Census 2011), farmers sow seeds in nurseries \u2013 small plots on their land -- in the first half of June, for the arrival of the monsoon. After a few heavy showers, when the furrows bordered by bunds have accumulated muddy water, they transplant the 3 to 4 week-old shoots into their fields. But even six weeks after the usual start of the monsoon, as late as July 20 this year, it hadn\u2019t rained in Rawanwadi. Twice it drizzled, Bhongade says, but not enough. Farmers who have wells were managing to water the paddy shoots. With work drying up on most of the farms, landless labourers had left the village in search of daily wages. ***** Around 20 kilometres away, in Garada Jangli village, Laxman Bante too has been witnessing this scarcity for some time. June and July go by without any rain, he says, while the other farmers gathered nod in agreement. And once in 2 to 3 years they almost lose their kharif crop. Bante, who is around 50, recalls that in his childhood this was not the pattern. The rain was consistent, paddy was steady. But 2019 has been another year of loss, part of the new pattern. The farmers are anxious. \u201cMy land will go fallow in kharif ,\u201d says a fearful Narayan Uikey ( sitting on the floor: see the cover photo ). He is in his 70s and has farmed for over five decades on 1.5 acres, and also worked as a labourer most of his life. \u201cIt stayed fallow in 2017, in 2015\u2026\u201d he recalls. \u201cEven last year, my sowing was delayed because of the late rain.\u201d The delay, Uikey says, reduces yields and incomes. Agricultural wage work becomes scarce too when farmers cannot engage labourers for the sowing. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-JH-Belated_rains_beleaguered_farmers_in_Bh.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar Devendra Bhongade (top left), on his drying farm of dying paddy tillers in Rawanwadi, pointing to crab-holes (top right).

Like in Rawanwadi, most of the farmers here have small plots of land \u2013 between one and four acres \u2013 and depend on the rains for irrigation. If the rains fail, the farms fail, says Uikey, a Gond Adivasi. By July 20 this year, the sowing on almost all the farms in his village remained suspended, while the saplings in the nurseries began drying up. But on Durgabai Dighore\u2019s farm, there was a desperate rush to transplant the half-grown tillers. There is a borewell on her family\u2019s land. Only four or five farmers in Garada have that luxury. After their 80-foot dug-well dried up, the Dighores sank a borewell within the well two years ago, going 150 feet down.

Usually, they retain some water even through the drier months. He surmises that the growing number of borewells is drawing away groundwater from the tanks. These conservation tanks were constructed in the late 17th to mid-18th centuries in the eastern paddy-growing districts of Vidarbha under the supervision of local kings. After the creation of Maharashtra, the state irrigation department took over the maintenance and operation of the big tanks, while the zilla parishads took over the smaller tanks. These water bodies are meant to be managed by the local communities and used for fisheries and irrigation.

Borewells, people here say, are a new phenomenon in these parts. Workers on the the Dighores\u2019 farm (right) could transplant the paddy in July because of the borewell water Many young men, says Bante, have migrated \u2013 to Bhandara city, Nagpur, Mumbai, Pune, Hyderabad, Raipur and other places \u2013 to work as cleaners on trucks, itinerant labourers, for farm labour, or to do whatever work they might find. This growing migration is reflected in population numbers: while Maharashtra\u2019s population grew by 15.99 per cent from Census 2001 to 2011, Bhandara\u2019s grew just 5.66 per cent in that period. The main reason that comes up repeatedly in conversations here is that people are leaving due to the growing unpredictability of agriculture, declining farm work, and an inability to meet increasing household expenses. ***** Bhandara is a largely paddy-growing district, farmland interwoven with forests. The average annual here ranges from from 1,250 mm to 1,500 mm (notes a report of the Central Ground Water Board). The perennial Wainganga river flows through this district of seven talukas. Bhandara also has seasonal rivers and around 1,500 malgujari water tanks, notes the Vidarbha Irrigation Development Corporation. While it has a long history of seasonal migration, Bhandara has not reported extensive farmers\u2019 suicides \u2013 unlike some districts of western Vidarbha. With only 19.48 per cent urbanisation , it\u2019s an agrarian district of small and marginal farmers, who draw an income from their own land and from farm labour. But without robust irrigation systems, the farming here remains largely rain-fed; tank water is adequate only for some farmlands after October, with the end of the monsoon. Several reports suggest that central India, where Bhandara is located, is witnessing a weakening of the June to September monsoon and increasing events of heavy to extreme rainfall. A 2009 study by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, speaks of this trend. A 2018 World Bank study finds Bhandara district to be in the top 10 climate hotspots in India, the other nine being contiguous districts in Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, all in central India. A \u2018climate hotspot\u2019, the study says, is a location where changes in average weather will have a negative effect on living standards. The study warns of the huge economic shocks that people in these hotspots could face if the present scenario continues. In 2018, the Revitalising Rainfed Agriculture Network compiled a fact-sheet on Maharashtra, based on rainfall data of the India Meteorological Department. It explains: One, the frequency and gravity of dry spells increased in almost all the districts of Vidarbha from 2000 to 2017. Two: the rainy days shrank though the long-term annual average rainfall has remained almost constant.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

The study also notes that there will be an average increase (over the annual mean temperature of 27.19 degrees) for Nagpur division (where Bhandara is located) by 1.18 to 1.4 degrees (by 2030), 1.95 to 2.2 degrees (by 2050) and 2.88 to 3.16 degrees (by 2070). This is the highest for any region in the state. Bhandara agriculture officials too have noticed these incipient changes in their largely rain-dependent district that still gets categorised in government literature and district plans as a \u2018better-irrigated\u2019 region due to its traditional tanks, rivers and sufficient rainfall. \u201cWe are seeing a steady trend of delayed onset of rains over the district, which hurts sowing and yields,\u201d says the divisional superintending agriculture officer in Bhandara, Milind Lad. \u201cWe used to have 60-65 rainy days, but in the last decade or so, this is down to 40-45 in the June-September period.\u201d Some circles \u2013 clusters of 20 revenue villages \u2013 of Bhandara have got barely 6 or 7 days of rains this year in June and July, he observes. \u201cYou can\u2019t grow fine quality rice if the monsoon is delayed,\u201d adds Lad. \u201cProduction drops by 10 kilos per day per hectare if the paddy transplantation is delayed after the 21-day period of the nursery.\u201d The traditional method of broadcasting seeds \u2013 throwing the seeds into the soil rather than planting a nursery first and then transplanting the tillers \u2013 is steadily returning to the district. But broadcasting can bring poor yields due to a low rate of germination, unlike the transplantation method. Still, instead of losing the entire crop if the tillers don\u2019t grow in the nursery without the first rains, with broadcasting the farmers could face only a partial loss. <img alt=\" Durgabai Dighore\u2019s farm where transplantation is being done on borewell water. \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/05-DSC03171-JH-Belated_rains_beleaguered_f.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/05-DSC03171-JH-Belated_rains_beleaguered_farm.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:400px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Jaideep Hardikar Paddy occupies most of Bhandara\u2019s farms in the kharif season \u201cPaddy needs good rains in June-July for the nursery and transplantation,\u201d says Avil Borkar, chairman of the Gramin Yuva Pragatik Mandal, Bhandara, a voluntary organisation that works with paddy farmers in eastern Vidarbha on the conservation of native seeds. And the monsoon is altering, he notes. Small variations, people can deal with. \u201cBut a failure of the monsoon \u2013 they can\u2019t.\u201d ***** By the end of July, the rains have started to pick up in Bhandara. But by thenthe kharif sowing of paddy has been hit \u2013 only 12 per cent of sowing was done by the end of July in the district, says Milind Lad, the divisional superintending agriculture officer. Paddy occupies almost all of Bhandara\u2019s 1.25 lakhs hectare cultivable land in kharif, he adds. Many malgujari tanks that sustain fishing communities are also dry. The only talk among villagers is of water. Farms are the only avenue of employment now. In the first two monsoon months, people here say, Bhandara has not yielded any work for the landless, and even if it rains now, the kharif planting has been irreparably hit. For acres upon acres, you see empty patches of land \u2013 brown, ploughed soil, hardened by heat and a lack of moisture, interspersed with the burning yellow-green beds of the nursery, where the shoots are wilting. Some nurseries that look green are invariably helped by a desperate splash of fertiliser that aids a momentary growth spurt.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cb211ce-d0b3-40f9-ab90-dff0b5d36816": {"__data__": {"id_": "0cb211ce-d0b3-40f9-ab90-dff0b5d36816", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/belated-rains-beleaguered-farmers-in-bhandara/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Belated rains, beleaguered farmers in Bhandara", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/belated-rains-beleaguered-farmers-in-bhandara/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "edebd2af851a7da93e557dc13f050ecde9872e303fdfbba58fe01c82c7fe035c"}, "2": {"node_id": "81cdfe68-a462-4023-afe0-ae911c701c1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/belated-rains-beleaguered-farmers-in-bhandara/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nJaideep Hardikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "c0de7de6bd6232e23b787bb66e8972137b07618e5e99fe53579b6416b29deb6f"}}, "hash": "f3cc92b54dc0b1a179c487c1435a2b2186d98b174561832e7dd7c2b6ff56cc54", "text": "Besides Garada and Rawanwadi, some 20 villages in the Dhargaon circle of Bhandara, says Lad, haven\u2019t received good rains this year \u2013 and in the past few years too.

There are no village-level data on relative temperature, heat or humidity. On August 14, the district collector, Dr. Naresh Gite, instructed the insurance company to compensate all farmers who had not sown on 75 per cent of their land this year. Initial estimates said such farmers would number 1.67 lakh, with a cumulative unsown area of 75,440 hectares. By September, Bhandara had recorded 1,237.4 millimetres of rain (starting from June) or 96.7 per cent of its long-term annual average for this period (of 1,280.2 mm). Most of this rain came in August and September, after the June-July rain-dependent kharif sowing was already hit. The rain filled the malgujari tanks in Rawanwadi, Garada Jangli, and Wakeshwar. Many of the farmers attempted a re-sowing in the first week of August, some it it by broadcasting seeds of the early yielding varieties. Yields may be reduced though, and the harvest season may be pushed by a month to late November. ***** Back in July, Maroti, 66, and Nirmala Mhaske, 62, are troubled. Living with unpredictable rains is difficult, they say. The earlier patterns of prolonged periods of rain \u2013 lasting 4 or 5 or even 7 days at a stretch, no longer exist. Now, they say, it rains in spurts \u2013 heavy showers for a couple of hours, interspersed with long dry spells and heat. For around a decade, they haven\u2019t experienced good rains in the Mrig nakshatra , or the period from early June to early July. This was when they would sow their paddy nursery and transplant the 21-day tillers onto the water-drenched plots between bunds. By the end of October, their paddy would be ready to harvest. Now, they wait until November and sometimes even December to harvest the crop. The delayed rains affect per-acre yields and limit their options of cultivating long-duration fine-quality rice varieties. \u201cBy this time [July end],\u201d says Nirmala, when I visited their village, Wakeshwar, \u201cwe would be through with our transplantation.\u201d Like numerous other farmers, the Mhaskes are awaiting the showers so that the tillers can be spread out on their farm. For two months, there has practically been no work for the seven labourers who work on their land, they say. The Mhaskes\u2019 old house looks out to a two-acre farm on which they grow vegetables and local varieties of paddy. The family owns 15 acres. In his village, Maroti Mhaske is known for his meticulous crop planning and high yields. But the changes in rainfall pattern, its growing unpredictability, its uneven spread, has put them in a bind, he says: \u201cHow do you plan your crop if you don\u2019t know when and how much it will rain?\u201d PARI\u2019s nationwide reporting project on climate change is part of a UNDP-supported initiative to capture that phenomenon through the voices and lived experience of ordinary people.

In the last few years, however, it has become erratic.\u201d Both Sarangi and Nayak argue that Odisha's multi-cropping systems, with an emphasis on indigenous food crops, are better suited than cotton to cope with these vagaries. \u201cIt is our experience that multi-crop farmers are better able to cope with such erratic weather patterns,\u201d Sarangi says. \u201cFarmers who are linked to the market through a single crop of Bt cotton are sitting on a time bomb.\u201d ***** Several farmers sense the dangers to food security and autonomy of cultivation under the new GM monoculture dispensation \u2013 even as they are taking to the new practices. But many others, in particular women, insist that they should not abandon their traditional agriculture. In Kerandiguda village, against the backdrop of the Niyamgiri, we came across Kunuji Kulusika, a Kondh Adivasi woman dissuading her son Surendra from growing cotton this year. She was hard at work, barefoot in a mountainside plot of shifting cultivation. In her knee-length saree worn without a blouse, and hair pulled back in a side knot, Kunuji looked the archetype of the Adivasi woman who features in ads by governments, corporations and NGOs, promising to uplift her from \u2018backwardness\u2019. Yet, as Deb suggests, the erosion of the advanced knowledge and skills of people like Kunuji will be devastating for a world grappling with climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "789ff290-0052-4bf3-acb0-88e910f0c446": {"__data__": {"id_": "789ff290-0052-4bf3-acb0-88e910f0c446", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/cotton-has-now-become-a-headache/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporting :\n\n\n\nAniket Aga\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nChitrangada Choudhury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\u2018Cotton has now become a headache\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/cotton-has-now-become-a-headache/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporting :\n\n\n\nAniket Aga\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nChitrangada Choudhury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "a6c5889901ce8752b0ee6a4b30510cec9e858a85f1ac050b8e1ed548128efd14"}, "2": {"node_id": "15005799-de73-47b7-9a4c-712fa9427ffa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/cotton-has-now-become-a-headache/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporting :\n\n\n\nAniket Aga\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\nChitrangada Choudhury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "a682bfd232847be33429d0a7ac19a8a381b0cdcca4917b76f1ba297350fcd5aa"}}, "hash": "32d7f3d1b8a99f1688445ff30f6062bdeaec616514fe7669d40e666c08a376a5", "text": "\u201cIf we abandon our [own] crops even for a year,\u201d Kunuji said, explaining why she feared shifting to cotton, \u201chow will we replenish the seeds?

That has led to the decline in butterflies and moth populations, which depend on non-crop plants. \u201cThe ecological knowledge base of this region [and its biodiversity] has eroded alarmingly. More and more farmers are abandoning their traditional multi-cropping and agroforestry systems in favour of monocultures, which demand high amounts of pesticides. Cotton farmers are also using herbicides. Most of them\u2026 don't know which insects are actually pests and which are not. So they spray to eliminate all insects.\u201d With the shift to cotton, says Sharanya Nayak, \u201cevery insect, bird, animal is seen through just one lens \u2013 as an enemy of the crop.

He admitted that it was the state that had introduced and promoted cotton in villages here in the 1990s. The aggressive push from private seed and agri-chemical input dealers from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, followed. While the government is worried, the officer admitted that there was little being done to address the explosion of fake and illegal seeds, and the growing consumption of agri-chemicals. \u201cCotton has now become a headache,\u201d he said. Yet, the lure of money is powerful, especially for young farmers. With aspirations of English education for their children, smartphones and motorbikes, and impatience with their parents\u2019 ways of farming, cotton seems worth the risk. If markets are down one year, they may be up the next. Ecology, however, is less forgiving. \u201cThere is an undocumented increase in the frequency of hospitalisation and in the types of diseases. The number of people suffering from various nerve and kidney diseases is quite high,\u201d says Deb. \u201cI suspect these are from exposure to organophosphate pesticides and glyphosate herbicide, which are in wide use in the district.\u201d Dr. John Oommen, who practices at the 54-year-old Christian Hospital, Bissamcuttack, says that such causal links are hard to make in the absence of dedicated investigations. \u201cThe focus of the state is still on communicable diseases like malaria.

He dilutes it with water from the stream flowing by his farm, and sprays it over the land, preparing to sow Bt cotton (left and middle). Three days later, much of the vegetation on the land has wilted (right) The warnings on the glyphosate bottle, in English, Hindi and Gujarati, included these: Keep away from foodstuffs, empty foodstuff containers, and animal food; Avoid contact with mouth, eyes and skin; Avoid inhalation [of] the spray mist. Spray in direction of [the] wind; Wash thoroughly the contaminated clothes and parts of the body after spraying; Wear full protective clothing while mixing and spraying. Nag was bare-bodied except for a small garment around his waist. As he sprayed, droplets fell on his feet and legs, while the wind carried the mist of herbicide over to us, to the tree standing in the middle of his plot, and to adjoining fields. As well as into the stream flowing by his farm, which gushed down to other fields and skirted by a cluster of some 10 houses and their hand pump. Three days later we came by Nag\u2019s plot again, and found a small boy grazing cows close by. We asked Nag if the glyphosate he had sprayed could imperil the cows, and he said confidently: \u201cNo, it\u2019s been three days. Had they grazed the day I had sprayed, they would have fallen ill and maybe died.\u201d We asked the boy how he knew which fields were freshly sprayed with glyphosate to avoid taking his livestock into. He shrugged and said \u201cfarmers tell us if they have sprayed herbicides.\u201d The boy\u2019s father told us that a neighbouring village had seen some cattle deaths last year after the animals grazed on a freshly-sprayed plot. Meanwhile most of the grass on Nag\u2019s plot had wilted. It was ready for sowing cotton.

Pirikaka is a Kondh Adivasi farmer in her 40s. Every year, for over two decades, she would prepare a hill slope for dongar chaas \u2013 literally, \u2018mountain farming' (shifting cultivation). Following traditions honed by the region\u2019s farmers over centuries, Pirikaka would sow mixed plots of heirloom seeds which she had saved from family harvests the previous year. These would yield a basket of food crops: millets like mandia and kangu , pulses like pigeon pea and black gram, as well as traditional varieties of long beans, niger seeds and sesame. This July, for the first time, Pirikaka switched to Bt cotton. That was the time we met her, sowing the dark pink, chemical-doused seeds on a hill slope at her village in Bishamakatak block. The penetration of cotton into the shifting cultivation practices of the Adivasis was striking, making us ask her about this switch. \u201cOther crops like turmeric also give money,\u201d admits Pirikaka. \u201cBut nobody is doing that. Everyone is leaving mandia [millet]\u2026 and going after cotton.\u201d The area under cotton in Rayagada district has risen by over 5,200 per cent in barely 16 years. Official data show just 1,631 acres under cotton in 2002-03. In 2018-19 that was 86,907 acres, according to the district agriculture office. Rayagada, with close to 1 million people, is a part of the Koraput region, one of the world\u2019s great biodiversity hotspots, and a historical area of rice diversification.

Even today, many Kondh families across the region\u2019s emerald-green terraced fields and mountainside farms, cultivate a dizzying array of paddy and millet varieties, pulses and vegetables. Surveys by Living Farms, a non-profit in Rayagada, have recently documented 36 millet varieties and 250 forest foods. Most Adivasi farmers here work on individual or common property farms ranging from 1 to 5 acres in size. Their seeds are largely nurtured and shared within the community, using almost no synthetic fertilisers or other agri-chemicals (also called agro-chemicals). Yet, cotton has become the second-most cultivated crop in Rayagada after paddy, overtaking millets \u2013 the premier traditional food crops of the region. It covers a fifth of the 428,947 acres under cultivation in this district. Cotton\u2019s swift expansion is reshaping this land and people steeped in agro-ecological knowledge. Cotton occupies roughly 5 per cent of India\u2019s gross cropped area, but consumes 36 to 50 per cent of the total quantum of insecticides, herbicides and fungicides applied nationally. It is also a crop with the greatest correlation to indebtedness and farmer suicides across India. The scenario here is reminiscent of Vidarbha between 1998 and 2002 \u2013 initial excitement over the new miracle (and then illegal) seeds and dreams of great profits, followed by the effects of their water-guzzling nature, the huge spike in expenses and debt, and various ecological pressures. Vidarbha subsequently ended up as the epicentre of farmer suicides in the country for over a decade. Those farmers were overwhelmingly Bt cotton growers. ***** The shop we\u2019re standing in is owned by Chandra Kudruka (name changed), a 24-year-old Kondh youth.

He answered each one with an air of infallible authority. For them, he was the scientific expert, the extension officer, their advisor, all rolled into one. Their \u2018choice\u2019 was his command. The scenes of dependence we witnessed at Panda\u2019s shop played out across the cotton-growing villages we toured. The coming of \u2018the market\u2019 has had an impact way beyond the cotton crop. \u201cAs the farm land is entirely allocated for cotton, farmers have to buy all their household necessities from the market,\u201d Debal Deb, scientist and barefoot conservationist, told us. Based in Rayagada since 2011, Deb runs a remarkable in-situ rice conservation project and conducts farmer trainings. \u201cThe traditional knowledge of farm-related as well as non-farm occupations are rapidly disappearing,\u201d he said. In village after village, there is no potter, no carpenter, no weaver. All household goods are bought from the market, and most of these \u2013 from the pitcher to the mat \u2013 are made of plastics, imported from faraway towns. Bamboos have disappeared from most villages, and with them bamboo crafts. They are now substituted by wood from the forest and expensive concrete. Even for erecting a pole or making a fence, villagers have to cut trees from the forest. The more people depend on the market due to the lure of profit, the more the environment degrades.\u201d ***** \u201cThe shopkeeper said these were good,\u201d Ramdas (he only uses his first name) told us sheepishly, of the three Bt cotton seed packets he had bought on credit from Kudruka\u2019s shop.

Yet, the prospect of money was drawing them to cotton. \u201cIf we grow this, I might make some money I need this year for my son\u2019s fees in a private English-medium school\u201d \u2013 that was the hope of Shyamsundar Suna, a Dalit tenant farmer speaking to us in Kerandiguda village of Bishamakatak block. We found him, his Kondh Adivasi wife Kamala, and their two children Elizabeth and Ashish, hard at work sowing cotton seeds. Suna had applied all kinds of agri-chemicals, of which he knew little, to his seeds. \u201cThe retailer told me the cotton will come out well,\u201d he explained. Pirikaka, Ramdas, Suna and other farmers told us that cotton was unlike anything they had planted before. \u201cOur traditional crops do not require anything to grow \u2013 no fertiliser, no pesticide,\u201d said Pirikaka. But with cotton, Ramdas said, \u201ceach packet demands further expenses of 10,000 rupees. Only if you can spend on these seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, might you get some return at harvest time. If you can\u2019t do this\u2026 you will lose all your money. If you can, and things turn out good [with] stable weather \u2013 then you might sell it [his harvest] for Rs. 30,000- Rs. 40,000.\u201d Even as farmers were taking to cotton in the hope of making money,most were hard-pressed to say how much they earned through it. Come January-February, farmers will have to sell their produce back via the input retailer, who would recoup his costs with exorbitant interest, passing on what remained to them. \u201cI have just ordered 100 packets from the trader in Gunpur on credit,\u201d Chandra Kudruka told us. \u201cI will repay him at the time of harvest, and we will split the interest paid by the farmers.\u201d <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/05-CC-Sowing_the_seeds_of_climate_crisis_in_O.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Chitrangada Choudhury Top row: In mid-July, for the first time, Kondh Adivasi farmer Rupa Pirikaka sowed GM cotton seeds from the market in her mountainside plot in Karanjaguda village.

If they harvest just 1-2 quintals each, I will recover my dues from that.\u201d What went unsaid was that the farmers might be left with nothing. Rayagada will also be left shorn of its precious biodiversity. As Prof. Naeem puts it, globally, eliminating crop diversity means jeopardising food security and reducing the ability to adapt to global warming. He also warned that climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply linked: \u201ca planet that\u2019s less green and less biologically diverse is likely to be hotter and drier.\" And as Rayagada\u2019s Adivasi farmers abandon that biodiversity for a monoculture of Bt cotton, Odisha is undergoing a far-reaching shift in ecology and economy, sparking crises at both, the level of the individual household and at that of climate impact.

That he was speaking to a non-farmer in very urban Pune city, 900 kilometres away, didn\u2019t seem to matter to him, so great was his anxiety. Karabhai\u2019s complete focus on the rains arises from the centrality of the monsoons to the survival game he and his family play out each year. Twelve months had gone by since the 75-year-old pastoralist had left his village on his annual migration with his son, daughter-in-law, two grandsons, and a brother and his family. The 14-member group moved with their flock of over 300 sheep, three camels and the night guardian of their herd \u2013 a dog named Vichhio. And in those 12 months they had traversed \u2013 with their animals \u2013 over 800 kilometres across Kachchh, Surendranagar, Patan and Banaskantha districts. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/02-Migration_Route-NW-Counting_sheep_as_gr.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/02-Migration_Route-NW-Counting_sheep_as_grass.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:220px;\"/> The 800-kilometre route that Karabhai Aal\u2019s family traverses annually, across three regions of Gujarat. Source: Google Maps Karabhai\u2019s wife Dosibai and their youngest school-going grandchildren had remained at home in Jatavada village in Rapar taluka of Kachchh, Gujarat. The clan belongs to the Rabari community (listed as OBCs in that district), and leave their village each year for 8 to 10 months in search of pastures for their sheep. In a normal year, these nomadic pastoralists set out soon after Diwali (October-November) and return just as the next monsoon is set to break. This means they are on the move all year round, except during the rainy season. Even when they return, some family members remain outside their homes, taking the sheep to feed on the outskirts of Jatavada. The animals cannot reside within the village, needing their space and grazing grounds. var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); \u201cI thought the village patel had sent you to drive us away from here.\u201d That was how Karabhai had greeted us in early March when we traced him to a parched field in Gavana village of Surendranagar district. That\u2019s about 150 kilometres from Ahmedabad city. His suspicions had a basis. When times get tough, as they do during a prolonged drought, landowners drive pastoralists and their herds off their territory \u2013 they want to save the grass and crop stubble for their own cattle. \u201cThe dushkaal [drought] is very bad this time,\u201d Karabhai had told us. \u201cThat is why we left from Rapar in the month of Akhaad [June-July] last year , because there was simply no rain.\u201d The ongoing drought in their arid home district had forced an early start to their annual migration. \u201cWe wander with our sheep until the monsoon starts. If it doesn\u2019t rain, we don\u2019t go home! This is the life of a maldhari ,\u201d he told us. The term maldhari is derived from the Gujarati words mal (livestock) and dhari (guardian). \u201cThe 2018-19 drought in Gujarat\u2019s arid and semi-arid regions has been so severe that even some of those pastoralists who had become sedentarised in their village almost 25 years ago, began migrating again in search of grazing lands, fodder and livelihoods,\u201d says Neeta Pandya.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "694fe890-66c7-47cc-941d-3d1bf38664f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "694fe890-66c7-47cc-941d-3d1bf38664f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/counting-sheep-as-grasslands-shrink-in-gujarat/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nNamita Waikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Counting sheep as grasslands shrink in Gujarat", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/counting-sheep-as-grasslands-shrink-in-gujarat/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nNamita Waikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "aa34e77d31e3f31d30ca1a20b47461ddd9baab10736211a973366e1252abbd3e"}, "2": {"node_id": "13c8dc11-e463-4574-af01-7d98e196face", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/counting-sheep-as-grasslands-shrink-in-gujarat/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nNamita Waikar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "da231d00b954ae380e9ab872e2aee2e310dd71d1d0fe66ff9b5529a72ef491b4"}}, "hash": "3176a5564ec36e1abd46474784f0ba67fff4a1d6bbb8a4f1e6c7dc35bb49765a", "text": "She is the founder of the Maldhari Rural Action Group (MARAG), Ahmedabad, a non-profit active among pastoralists since 1994. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/03a-IMG_8523-NW-Counting_sheep_as_grasslan.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/03a-IMG_8523-NW-Counting_sheep_as_grasslands_.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:400px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Namita Waikar <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/03b-IMG_0593-NW-Counting_sheep_as_grasslan.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/03b-IMG_0593-NW-Counting_sheep_as_grasslands_.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:400px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Namita Waikar As the Aal family\u2019s 300 sheep spread out on a barren stretch that was once a field of jeera (cumin), Karabhai (right) speaks to a friend in his village Jatavada checking if all is well back home var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); In 2018, rainfall in Kachchh, home to this maldhari family, plummeted to a mere 131 millimetres.

In 1960, when Karabhai was a teenager, Surendranagar district would have seen temperatures crossing 32 degrees Celsius around 225 days a year. Today, that would be 274 days or more, an increase of at least 49 hotter days across 59 years, according to a calculation from an interactive tool on climate and global warming posted online by the New York Times this July. var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Over 63 per cent of working people in Surendranagar, where we met the pastoralists, are involved in agriculture. The figure for all of Gujarat is 49.61 per cent. The major crops grown here are cotton, cumin, wheat, millets, pulses, groundnut and castor. When harvested, their crop stubble is good fodder for the sheep. Of a total sheep population of 1.7 million in Gujarat\u2019s 33 districts, Kachchh alone is home to 570,000, or over a third of them, according to the 2012 Livestock Census of India. In the Wagad sub-region of the district, where Karabhai comes from, there are about 200 Rabari families like his own, travelling those 800 kilometres each year with a total of 30,000 sheep, according to the non-profit MARAG working with the community. They invariably move within a 200-kilometre radius from their homes. Traditionally, the herds provided post-harvest manure for the fields with their dung and urine. In return, the farmers gave the pastoralists bajra , sugar and tea.

By the time they\u2019re home they will have traversed three major regions: Kachchh, Saurashtra and North Gujarat. Amidst changing weather and climate conditions, the one constant is their hospitality \u2013 even in their temporary homes en route.

The family\u2019s sheep are of the Marwari breed, native to Gujarat and Rajasthan. In a year, they sell 25 to 30 rams for around Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 3,000 each. Sheep milk is another source of income for them, though this herd\u2019s yields are relatively low. Karabhai says 25-30 sheep give them about 9-10 litres of milk daily. Each litre fetches about Rs. 30 from small local dairies.

For him and millions of other pastoralists, landless, small and marginal farmers, sheep (and goats) are their wealth and central to their livelihoods .

That\u2019s a fall of 9 per cent. In Gujarat too, the number declined sharply by nearly 300,000 to its present 1.7 million figure. Kachchh too saw a decline, but the animal fared relatively better, thanks perhaps to the care of the maldhari s. Here there were just around 4,200 fewer sheep in 2012, compared to 2007. The 2017 Livestock Census data won\u2019t be out for six months, but Karabhai says he sees a declining trend and lists a mix of reasons for the fall in sheep numbers. \u201cWhen I was in my 30s, there was so much more grass, trees, there were no problems in grazing the sheep. Now the forests and trees are cut down, and grasslands are shrinking, becoming smaller. There is more heat,\u201d he says, asserting the role of human activity in spurring erratic weather and climate patterns. \u201cDuring drought years, just like we suffer, the sheep suffer too,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe shrinking of the grasslands means they have to walk and wander more in search of grass and fodder. The number of sheep is also perhaps going down because people might be selling off more animals to earn something.\u201d He\u2019s right about the shrinking of the grasslands and grazing grounds for his flock. About 4.5 per cent of land in Gujarat is grazing land or pasture, according to Prof. Indira Hirway of the Centre For Development Alternatives, Ahmedabad. But the official data, as she points out, do not factor in the large-scale illegal encroachment on these lands. So the real picture remains hidden. In March 2018, the government admitted in reply to questions in the state assembly that 4,725 hectares of gauchar (grazing) land in 33 districts had been encroached upon. Even that figure was attacked by some legislators as a gross underestimate. The government itself admitted that in 2018, there were 2,754 villages in the state with no grazing land at all. There was also an increase in the land \u2013 some of it acquired by the state \u2013 handed over to industry by the Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation. For SEZs alone, it handed over to industries 4,620 hectares between 1990 and 2001.

The extended Aal family jointly owns about eight acres of rain-fed land on which they have sown bajra . A combination of many factors has impacted the grazing of animals and migration patterns of the pastoralists. Failing or inadequate monsoons, recurrent drought, shrinking grasslands, rapid industrialisation and urbanisation in the state, deforestation and reduced availability of fodder and water. The lived experience of the maldharis suggests several of those factors both result from, and feed into, shifts in weather and climate. Ultimately, the movement of these communities is seriously affected, reshaping schedules they\u2019ve followed for centuries. \u201cWrite about all our difficulties,\u201d Karabhai says as we leave, \u201cand we will see if it brings any change.

Kajal Lata Biswas is still haunted by memories of the cyclone. Though it\u2019s been 10 years since Aila hit the Sundarbans, she still clearly recalls May 25, 2009. It was just before noon. \u201cThe [Kalindi] river water rushed into the village and flooded all the houses,\u201d says Kajal Lata. She was at a relative\u2019s house in Kumirmari village that day, around seven kilometres from her own village, Gobindakati. \u201cSome 40-50 of us took shelter in a boat where we stayed the whole day and night. We watched trees, boats, cattle and paddy being swept away. At night, we could not see a thing. Even the matchsticks were soaked. We could see only when lightning flashed across the sky.\u201d Sitting outside her house and cleaning fish for lunch, 48-year-old Kajal Lata, a farmer, continues, \u201cThat night can never be forgotten. There wasn\u2019t a drop of drinking water. Somehow, I collected a few raindrops in a plastic bag, which I used to wet the lips of my two daughters and niece, who were very thirsty.\u201d Her voice shakes with the memory. The next morning, they used a boat to to reach their village. Then waded through flood water to reach home. \u201cTanushree, my elder daughter, then 17, almost drowned where the water was very high. Luckily, she grabbed her aunt\u2019s saree pallu which had come loose,\u201d Kajal Lata says, her eyes relaying the fear she felt. In May 2019, her fear returned with cyclone Fani, its arrival coinciding with the wedding of her younger daughter, 25-year-old Anushree. <img alt=\"Kajal Lata Biswas cutting fresh fish\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/IMG_20190601_120646.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/IMG_20190601_120646.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:380px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Urvashi Sarkar <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/IMG_20190602_054624.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/IMG_20190602_054624.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:380px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Urvashi Sarkar Kajal Lata Biswas, cleaning fish outside her house in Gobindakati village, recalls the terror of approaching cyclones; paddy is stored in these huts (right) in her village, and the crop has taken a hit var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); The wedding was fixed for May 6. Loudspeaker announcements about Fani by the panchayat and on radio by the government had started a few days earlier. \u201cImagine our plight and fear,\u201d Kajal Lata says. \u201cWe were terrified that winds and rain would destroy all the preparations. There was some rain in the days before the wedding. But thankfully, the cyclone did not affect our village,\u201d she adds, clearly relieved. On May 2, the India Meteorological Department had issued a warning about Fani hitting Andhra Pradesh, Odisha (which turned out to be the worst affected) and West Bengal. Talking about Fani, Prafulla Mondal, an 80-year-old farmer and former teacher in Rajat Jubilee village, raises his voice a few notches: \u201cFani missed the Sundarbans very narrowly.

Dzomo? What\u2019s that? And what makes them popular here at 9,000 feet and above in the mountains of Arunachal Pradesh? The dzomo are a hybrid of yak and kot , a type of highland cattle. The male hybrid, called dzo, is sterile, so the herders prefer the female, the dzomo . While this is not a new breed, the Brokpa, a semi-nomadic pastoral community, have been adding more of these animals to their herds in recent times \u2013 to adapt to the changing climate in the eastern Himalayas. Pempa, whose herd of 45 animals includes both yaks and dzomos , says these yak-cattle hybrids \u201care more heat-resistant and can adapt better to lower altitudes and rising temperatures.\u201d In these high-altitude grazing grounds, heat or \u2018warming\u2019 are both very real and relative. Here there are no 32 degree Celsius days in the year. But yak, which can withstand minus-35 degrees with ease, struggle if the temperature rises beyond 12 or 13 degrees. Indeed, the entire ecosystem struggles when these changes occur \u2013 as they have in recent years in these mountains. The Brokpa, the nomadic herders within the larger Monpa tribe (of around 60,000 in Arunachal notes Census 2011), have for centuries reared yak and tend them at mountainous grazing grounds. During the harsh winters, they live in the lower regions, and in summer they migrate to higher altitudes \u2013 moving between 9,000 and 15,000 feet. But like the Changpa in the Changthang region of Ladakh, the Brokpa too have been severely hit by an ever-more erratic climate. For centuries, their livelihoods, their very societies, have been based on rearing and herding yak, cattle, goat, and sheep. Of these, they depend the most on the yak \u2013 at economic, social, and even spiritual levels. That bond is now severely undermined. \u201cThe yak start feeling exhausted as early as late February because of the heat,\u201d Leki Suzuk, a herder in Chandar (locally also spelt Chander) village, told me. I stayed with her family during my visit in May to Dirang block of West Kameng. \u201cThe summer is prolonged in the past several years, the temperature has risen. The yak have weakened,\u201d adds Leki, who is in her late 40s. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-Ritayan-02-RM-The_happy_days_are_now_just_.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Ritayan Mukherjee The dzomo are a hybrid of the yak and kot , a type of highland cattle. The Brokpa, a nomadic pastoral community, have been adding more of these animals to their herds to adapt to the changing climate in the eastern Himalayas Along with the temperatures, the Brokpa say, the entire weather pattern has become increasingly unpredictable in the past two decades in the mountains of Arunachal Pradesh, which border the Tibet Autonomous Region of China, Bhutan and Myanmar. \u201cEverything is delayed,\u201d says Pema Wange. \u201cThe arrival of summer is delayed. The arrival of snowfall is delayed. The seasonal migrations are delayed. The Brokpa go to their higher grazing locations to find them still covered in snow. That means even the melting of the snows is delayed.\u201d Pema, in his late 30s, is not a Brokpa, but a conservationist from Thembang village who belongs to the Monpa tribe and works for the World Wildlife Fund.

How do we tend to their ailments?\u201d Arunachal is normally a rainfall-rich state, which averages over 3,000 millimetres of rain annually. But it has suffered rainfall deficits for several years in the past decade, with the shortfall ranging, suggests India Meteorological Department data, between 25 and 30 per cent in at least four of those years. Though in July this year, the state saw torrential downpours washing away or sinking quite a few roads. Amid these fluctuations, the constant in the mountains is rising temperatures. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/03-Ritayan-03-RM-The_happy_days_are_now_just_.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Ritayan Mukherjee Naguli Tsopa, taking a tea break while grazing his animals at the high-altitude grasslands of West Kameng district, says, \u2018Because of the extended summers, some of the local medicinal herbs we use to treat the yaks don\u2019t seem to grow any more. How do we tend to their ailments?\u2019 In 2014, a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, recorded changes in temperatures in the eastern Tibetan Plateau (the larger geographical zone in which Arunachal is located). Daily low temperatures had \u201cincreased greatly over the last 24 years\u201d (between 1984 and 2008). Daily high temperatures had increased at a rate of 5 degrees Celsius in 100 years. \u201cWe are trying to deal with the issues of erratic weather,\u201d says Tsering Dondup, another herder, in his early 30s, who we ran into. \u201cWe have extended our migration time by two or three months. We are using pasture more scientifically [through more patterned rather than random grazing].\u201d Like him, the majority of the Brokpa are aware of climate change. They don\u2019t speak much of why this might be happening, but understand the damage it is doing. And here\u2019s something encouraging: they\u2019re figuring out various adaptation strategies, say several researchers. One group that surveyed the community pointed to this in 2014 in the Indian Journal of Traditional Knowledge . Their research concluded that 78.3 per cent of Brokpas in West Kameng and 85 per cent of those in Tawang \u2013 that\u2019s 81.6 per cent of this nomadic community in Arunachal \u2013 \u201cwere aware [of]\u2026the changing climatic scenario.\u201d And of these, over 75 per cent \u201cstated that they have adopted at least one adaptation strategy to cope up with climate change.\u201d The researchers note other strategies too \u2013 \u2018herd-diversification\u2019, migration to higher altitudes, changes in the migrations calendar. Their paper speaks of \u201c10 coping mechanisms\u201d to counter \u201cthe negative impacts of climate change.\u201d The other strategies include changes in pasture use, rejuvenation of degraded high-altitude grazing grounds, revised herding practices, and cattle-yak hybridisation. Also, supplementing feed with other items where grass is scarce, adopting new livestock healthcare methods, and seeking additional sources of income such as road construction labour, small businesses, and fruit collection. There is no way to know if any or all these will work and not be overwhelmed by larger processes. But they\u2019re doing something \u2013 and have to. The herders tell me the average family has lost 20-30 per cent of its annual income from the decline of the yak economy. A fall in milk yields also means a drop in the amount of homemade ghee and chhurpi (cheese from fermented yak milk).

His roof didn\u2019t quite come down on him, but it did chase Gunwant around his farm. That image remains vividly etched in his mind. \u201cThe tin-roof of the shed on the edge of our land was torn off and came flying towards me,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI hid under a pile of hay and managed to come out injury-free.\u201d It isn\u2019t every day you get chased by a roof. The one Gunwant Hulsulkar was running from in Ambulga village had been ripped off by deadly winds accompanying a hailstorm there this April. Emerging from under the hay-pile, Gunwant, 36, could barely recognise his own farm in Nilanga taluka . \u201cIt couldn\u2019t have lasted more than 18-20 minutes. But the trees had fallen off, dead birds were scattered around, and our livestock was badly injured,\u201d he says, pointing to the damage-marks left by the hailstorm on the trees. \u201cThere is a hailstorm or unseasonal rain every 16-18 months,\u201d says his mother Dhondabai, 60, sitting on the steps outside her two-room stone and mortar house in Ambulga. In 2001, her family shifted from cultivating pulses ( urad and moong ) to nurturing mango and guava orchards across their 11 acres. \u201cWe need to look after the trees through the year, but an extreme weather event of just a few minutes destroys our entire investment.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a one-off phenomenon that occurred this year. Extreme weather episodes, including torrential rainfall and even hailstorms, have showed up in this part of Maharashtra\u2019s Latur district for over a decade now. Uddhav Biradar\u2019s small one-acre mango orchard, also in Ambulga, collapsed in a 2014 hailstorm. \u201cI had 10-15 trees. They died with that storm. I made no effort to revive them,\u201d he says. \u201cThe hailstorms continue,\u201d 37-year-old Biradar adds. \u201cIt was painful to see the trees after the storm of 2014. You plant them, take care of them, and then they are blown away in minutes. I do not think I could go through all this again.\u201d <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/2-Hailstorms_at_43_Celsius_wreck_farming_in_L.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

In Latur district of the Marathwada region? This is a place where, for well over half the year, the mercury is at or above 32 degrees Celsius. The latest hailstorm struck in the first week of April this year when temperatures ranged between 41 and 43 degrees. But as almost every farmer here will tell you in exasperation, they can no longer figure out the behaviour of the taapman , havaman and vatavaran (temperature, weather and climate). What they do comprehend is that the number of rainy days annually has dropped, while the count of hotter days has risen. In 1960, the year Dhondabai was born, Latur could expect at least 147 days annually that would see temperatures of 32 degrees or above, as data from an app on climate change and global warming posted by the New York Times shows. This year, that would be 188 days. When Dhondabai turns 80, there could be 211 of these very hot days. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe we are approaching the end of July,\u201d Subash Shinde told me when I visited his 15-acre farm in Ambulga last month.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7db3cf66-9576-42a2-80c4-9e98da7a62e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "7db3cf66-9576-42a2-80c4-9e98da7a62e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/hailstorms-at-43-degrees-celsius-wreck-farming-in-latur/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nParth M.N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Hailstorms at 43\u00b0C wreck farming in Latur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/hailstorms-at-43-degrees-celsius-wreck-farming-in-latur/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nParth M.N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "4348abcf952b9228a1559acc5ebeafa2be5ed3be9ddf95da9802ab98bec22f0b"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f4ae6d8-e63a-43aa-9016-ccf8a8ddae86", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/hailstorms-at-43-degrees-celsius-wreck-farming-in-latur/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nParth M.N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "2f237d07d55b8821d64bdca8ca0e10beee15cc70487f2878aac6b7df94d0584a"}}, "hash": "72f32d73a19e05af9bcc29f44e3c31949eb111d9b7e342210eb23226a7ee3e1b", "text": "The farm looks barren, the soil is brown and bears not a hint of green buds.

At the end of July, Sreekanth told me that there had been a 47 per cent shortfall below the normal rainfall for that period. In the early 2000s, says Subash Shinde, an acre of soybean yielded 10-12 quintals on an investment of around Rs. 4,000. Nearly two decades later, the price of soybean may have doubled from Rs. 1,500 to Rs. 3,000 a quintal, but, he says, cultivation costs have tripled and per acre output has halved. The data of the State Agricultural Marketing Board support Shinde\u2019s observations. In 2010-11, soybean acreage was 1.94 lakh hectares, and production was 4.31 lakh tonnes, says the Board\u2019s website . In 2016, soybean covered 3.67 lakh hectares, but production was just 3.08 lakh tonnes. An 89 per cent increase in acreage, but a 28.5 per cent fall in production. Madhukar Hulsulkar, 63, Dhondabai\u2019s husband, points to another feature of the present decade. \u201cSince 2012, our use of pesticides has increased a lot.

It is impossible to farm in this weather.\u201d The India Meteorological Department\u2019s data for Latur support his observations. In 2014, rainfall in the four monsoon months was 430 mm. The next year, 317 mm. In 2016, the district got 1,010 mm in those four months. In 2017, that was 760 mm. Last year, Latur got 530 mm in the monsoon season, of which 252 mm came in the single month of June. Even in the years where the district receives its \u2018normal\u2019 rainfall, the spread and dispersal have been most uneven. As Chandrakant Bhoyar, senior geologist with the Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency, points out: \u201cTorrential rainfall in a limited time results in soil erosion. When, instead, it drizzles consistently, that helps the groundwater recharge.\u201d Shinde can no longer depend on groundwater because his four borewells are, more often than not, dry. \u201cWe used to strike water at 50 feet, but now even borewells 500 feet deep are dry.\u201d That throws up other problems. \u201cIf we do not sow enough, there is no fodder for the animals,\u201d says Shinde. \u201cWithout water and fodder, farmers are unable to maintain their livestock.

Once dominated by jowar (sorghum) and other millets, and to a lesser extent maize, it took to cotton in a big way from 1905. Then came sugarcane from 1970, sunflower briefly, and large-scale soybean cultivation from 2000. The spread of cane and soybean was quite spectacular. In 2018-19, cane covered 67,000 hectares (say data from the Vasantdada Sugar Institute, Pune). And from one sugar factory in 1982, Latur now has 11. With the cash crops came the inescapable borewell explosion \u2013 there is no count of how many have been drilled \u2013 and intense groundwater exploitation. Over a 100 years of cash cropping in a soil historically attuned to millets has had its inevitable impacts on water, soil, moisture and vegetation. Also, forest cover in Latur is just 0.54 per cent, says the state government website. Below even the pathetic Marathwada-wide average of 0.9 per cent. <img alt=\"Kaveribai\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/06a-IMG_20190713_135448_Bokeh-Hailstorms_a.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/06a-IMG_20190713_135448_Bokeh-Hailstorms_at_4.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:450px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N. <img alt=\"Madhukar and his son Gunwant walking through their orchards \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/06b-IMG_20190713_155511-Hailstorms_at_43_C.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/06b-IMG_20190713_155511-Hailstorms_at_43_Cels.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:450px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Parth M.N.

And it is intriguing that extreme weather episodes and hailstorms really arrived and surged a decade after the last big crop shift and major changes in land use and technologies.

(The campaign eventually lost steam when some of its leaders shifted focus to issues such as irrigation schemes for the region).

In 2016-17, Solapur district cultivated 633,000 tons of sugarcane on 100,505 hectares of land, says data of the Finance and Statistical Directorate, government of Maharashtra. According to some news reports, by January this year, Solapur was at the top in the sugarcane crushing season that started in October, with more than 10 million tons crushed by 33 registered sugar mills (Sugar Commissionerate data) in the district. Crushing just one ton of sugarcane, says Rajneesh Joshi, a Solapur-based journalist and water conservation activist, requires around 1,500 litres of water. This means that in the last sugarcane crushing season \u2013 October 2018 to January 2019 \u2013 over 15 million cubic metres of water were used for sugarcane in Solapur district alone. With this gigantic use of water on one cash crop, the water available for other crops drops even more drastically in a region already struggling with low rainfall and a lack of irrigation.

The land is completely dry,\u201d says Jotiram Khandagale, who owns around four acres and also runs a hair-cutting stall in Goudwadi. \u201cSince the last few years, there is no guarantee of a good yield in both kharif and rabi seasons,\u201d he adds. Mali estimates that in just Goudwadi, there are 150 private borewells, of which at least 130 have dried up \u2013 and people are digging even up to 1,000 feet to reach water. The massive shift to sugarcane has also added to the move away from food crops. In the 2018-19 rabi season, Solapur district recorded only 41 per cent of jowar and 46 per cent of maize cultivation, says the Department of Agriculture. Across Maharashtra, the area on which jowar is cultivated has reduced by 57 per cent, and maize by 65 per cent, says the state\u2019s Economic Survey 2018-19 . And the yields of both crops have dropped by around 70 per cent. var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setImageCaptionWidth(container); Both crops are a critical source of foodgrain for humans and fodder for livestock. The scarcity of fodder has compelled the government (and others) to start cattle camps in the dry months in Sangole \u2013 as many as 105 camps with close to 50,000 cattle so far in 2019, estimates Popat Gadade. He is the director of a milk cooperative and the man who started the cattle camp in Goudwadi. And what do the cattle eat in these camps? The same sugarcane that guzzles (as estimates show) 29.7 million litres of water per hectare. So, many intertwined shifts are underway in Sangole, those that are part of \u2018nature\u2019, but more so, those set in motion by humans. Among these are decreasing rainfall, fewer rain days, rising temperatures, more days of extreme heat, near-absent pre and post monsoon showers, and moisture loss in soil. As well as changes in cropping patterns \u2014 more shorter duration varieties and the resultant loss of crop cover, fewer desi varieties, cultivation of fewer food crops such as jowar and more cash crops like sugarcane \u2013 along with poor irrigation, depleted groundwater levels \u2013 and more.

Yashwanth on the Kadal Osai radio station. \u201cFor the last one week, or even a month or so, kachaan kaathu [the south wind] was very strong. The speed was as high as 40 to 60 [kilometres per hour]. Today, as if to help fishermen, it is down to 15 [kmph].\u201d That\u2019s great news for the fisherfolk of Pamban island in Tamil Nadu\u2019s Ramanathapuram district. \u201cIt means they can go to sea without any fear,\u201d explains Yashwanth, himself a fisherman. He is also a radio jockey at Kadal Osai (The Sound of the Sea), a neighbourhood station for the community in this region. As a prelude to a special broadcast on blood donation, Yashwanth reels off the weather report, ending with: \u201cThe temperature is at 32 degrees Celsius. So stay hydrated, do not go in the sun.\u201d It\u2019s a necessary precaution, because Pamban now sees far more hotter days than it did in 1996, when Yashwanth was born. Then, the island could expect at least 162 days a year where temperatures hit or crossed that 32C mark. When his father Anthony Samy Vas \u2013 still a full-time fisherman \u2013 was born in 1973, that was no more than 125 days annually. Today, those warmer days number at least 180 a year, according to a calculation from an interactive tool on climate and global warming posted online by the New York Times this July. So Yashwanth and his colleagues are trying hard to understand not just the weather, but also larger issues of climate. His father, fellow fish workers, indeed the close to 83,000 people in Pamban and Rameswaram \u2013 the two main towns on the island \u2013 are looking to them to make sense of the changes. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/yashwant-father.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/yashwant-father.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:450px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 A.

The station had been running shows on the sea, weather patterns, and climate change since it was launched on August 15, 2016 by the NGO Nesakkarangal. \u201cKadal Osai has a daily programme titled Samuthiram Pazhagu ( Know the Oceans ),\u201d says Gayathri. \u201cIts idea is conservation of the seas. We know the larger issues involved will affect the community long-term. Samuthiram Pazhagu is our effort to keep a dialogue on climate change going. We talk about practices detrimental to the health of the seas and how to avoid those [for example, over-fishing by trawlers, or how diesel and petrol are polluting the waters]. We have callers on the show narrating their own experiences. Sometimes, they speak of their mistakes \u2013 promising not to repeat them.\u201d \u201cSince its launch, the Kadal Osai team has been in touch with us\u201d says Christy Leema, communications manager at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF), Chennai, which supports the radio station. \u201cThey use our experts in their programmes. But since May, we have also worked with them on creating awareness about climate change. It\u2019s easier to do this through Kadal Osai, since as a community radio they are already hugely popular in Pamban.\u201d The station has aired four episodes in May and June specifically on climate change issues under the title \u2018Kadal oru athisayam, athai kaapathu nam avasiyam \u2019 (The sea is a wonder, we must protect it). Experts from the Coastal System Research unit of MSSRF, led by its head, V. Selvam have featured in these episodes. \u201cSuch shows are extremely important because when we talk about climate change, we mostly do that at the top or expert level,\u201d says Selvam. \u201cIt needs to be discussed at the ground level, among those actually experiencing its impact on a day-to-day basis.\u201d <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/WINZ0002.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/WINZ0002.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:350px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Kavitha Muralidharan <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/IMG_20190730_140029.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/IMG_20190730_140029.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:350px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Kadal Osai Left: Kadal Osai\u2019s office on a Pamban street that sees a busy trade in fish.

Till two decades ago, at least 100 families lived close to the 2,065-metre Pamban bridge that connects Rameswaram town to the Indian mainland. Rising sea levels forced them to leave and relocate. In the episode, Selvam explains to listeners how climate change accelerates such movements. Neither the experts, fishermen, nor the station\u2019s reporters attempt to oversimplify the issue and resist the temptation of finding single-event or uni-causal explanations for the changes.

Wayanad is no longer the cold, misty place it once was.\u201d From a maximum of 25 degrees Celsius by early March, temperatures here now easily cross 30 degrees by that time of the year. And the number of warmer days has more than doubled in Vadakil\u2019s lifetime. In 1960, the year he was born, \u201cthe Wayanad area could expect about 29 days per year to reach at least 32 degrees [Celsius]\u201d says a calculation from an interactive tool on climate and global warming posted online by the New York Times this July. \u201cToday the Wayanad area can expect 59 days at or above 32 degrees per year, on average.\u201d The changing weather patterns, Vadakil says, hurt heat-sensitive and vulnerable crops like pepper and orange trees that were once abundant in this district in the Western Ghats at the southern tip of the Deccan Plateau. Vadakil and his wife Valsa own a four-acre farm in Cherukottur village in Mananthavady taluk . His family left Kottayam for Wayanad around 80 years ago to try their luck in the booming cash crop economy here. That was a period of heavy migration which saw thousands of small and marginal farmers from central Kerala settle in this district in the north-east of the state. But over time, the boom seems to have gone bust. \u201cIf the rains prove to be erratic, like they have been in the last year, then the [organic Robusta] coffee we grow is doomed,\u201d says Vadakil. \u201cCoffee is profitable, but the weather is the biggest problem in its growth. Heat and erratic rainfall ruin it,\u201d adds Valsa. The ideal temperature to grow [Robusta] coffee is between 23-28 degrees Celsius, say those working in the sector. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/002-VG-Why_is_the_climate_changing_like_this.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Noel Benno , Vishaka George Top row: The coffee crop in Wayanad needs its first rain by late February or early March and it starts to flower a week later. Bottom row: Either dry spells or untimely rain can destroy the flower (left) that produces the Robusta coffee beans (right) All of Wayanad\u2019s coffee, which is of the stronger-in-body Robusta family (a tropical evergreen shrub), is cultivated between December and late March. The coffee plant needs its first rain by late February or early March \u2013 and starts to flower a week later. It is crucial that there are no rains for a week after the first shower as that destroys the delicate flowers. The second shower is needed a week after the first one for the coffee fruit or \u2018cherries\u2019 to start growing.\u2019 Once the flowers bloom and fall off the tree, the cherries that contain the beans begin to mature. \u201cTimely rains guarantee you an 85 per cent yield,\u201d says Vadakil. When we met in early March, he was hoping for this outcome, but anxious if it would happen. It did not. By early March, at the beginning of Kerala\u2019s severe summer, temperatures had already gone up to 37 degrees. \u201cThe second shower ( randamatha mazha ) came too soon this year and everything was destroyed,\u201d Vadakil told us at the end of March. For Vadakil, who gives two acres to this crop, that translated to losses of Rs. 70,000 this year.

Mono-cropping drives the spread of pests and diseases, which are then treated with chemical pesticides and fertilisers. These make their way into groundwater or become airborne, causing contamination and pollution \u2013 and severe environmental damage over time. It began, says Suma, with the deforestation unleashed by the British. \u201cThey cleared the forests for timber and converted many high elevation mountains into plantations.\u201d The alteration in climate is also linked, she adds, to \u201chow our landscape too changed with large-scale migration [into the district starting from the 1940s]. Prior to this, farmers in Wayanad primarily practised shifting cultivation.\u201d In those decades, the major crop here was wetland paddy, not coffee or pepper \u2013 even the word \u2018 wayanad \u2019 comes from \u2018 vayal nadu \u2019 or land of paddy fields.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e69dd89-2f01-4615-b207-0590180b3a8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e69dd89-2f01-4615-b207-0590180b3a8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/why-is-the-climate-changing-like-this/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nVishaka George\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "\u2018Why is the climate changing like this?\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/why-is-the-climate-changing-like-this/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nVishaka George\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "b070feb327f7e458d10e781632e77cad622b5b28b7d702b424a09c3f3b8cd111"}, "2": {"node_id": "b240534e-c56e-4835-97aa-5d5b8bd51c1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/why-is-the-climate-changing-like-this/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nVishaka George\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "5a77027c61f46805949f471d39c53bd9010fb8061f5a2ade6febdbaeb6469570"}}, "hash": "c9444b42c1689b365cefb55c7fdcc57d4d0a1c278c2bb310c9332a703f63d3ae", "text": "Those fields were vital to this region\u2019s \u2013 and Kerala\u2019s \u2013 environment and ecological systems.

Normally a high rainfall region, parts of Wayanad receive over 4,000 millimetres in some years. But the district average has fluctuated wildly for a while. It was 3,260 mm in 2014, saw a steep fall the next two years to 2,283 mm and 1,328 mm. Then, in 2017, it was 2,125 mm and in 2018, the year of Kerala\u2019s floods, was a high 3,832 mm. \u201cThe inter-annual variability of rainfall has changed in recent decades, most conspicuously from the 1980s, and accelerating in the \u201990s,\u201d says Dr. Gopakumar Cholayil, scientific officer at the Academy of Climate Change Education and Research of the Kerala Agricultural University, Thrissur. \u201cAnd the incidence of extreme rainfall events in both monsoon and post-monsoon periods has risen across Kerala. Wayanad is no exception to this trend.\u201d That, in fact, confirms the observations by Vadakil, George and other farmers. Even when they mourn the \u2018decrease\u2019 \u2013 and the long-term averages do suggest a decline \u2013 they mean the rain is much less on the days and seasons they need and expect it.

' 300 Himalayan yaks starve to death in Sikkim ' ' Trapped in Snow Nearly 300 Yaks Die Due to Starvation in North Sikkim ' ' Melting snow bares Sikkim yak tragedy ' Those headlines of May 12 this year hit me hard. From my own trips as a photojournalist into the Himalayas, I know that the nomadic pastoralists who rear these animals go to any length to protect them. Across vital stretches of those great mountains, yaks are the lifeline for high-altitude herders \u2013 nomadic pastoralists driving a seasonal movement of livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures. Yaks are among their primary means of earning and a food source during wintertime. Some of the articles with those headlines linked the yak deaths to global warming. It was clear that if the hardy animals were taking such a hit, their herders would be in trouble too. I decided to return to the Changpa families in Ladakh\u2019s Hanle Valley and look at how both were doing. The Changpas of the Changthang region in India \u2013 a western extension of the Tibetan Plateau \u2013 are among the foremost producers of cashmere wool, and they also rear yaks. Hanle Valley of Leh district\u2019s Nyoma block is home to several herding units of Changpa \u2013 Dique, Kharloog, Maque, Raque and Yulpa. The Dique and Raque are perhaps the finest yak herders there are. \u201cWe are losing a lot of yaks,\u201d says expert Dique herder Jhampal Tsering, 35, in Hanle. \u201cNow, the weather here [in the high mountains] is unpredictable.\u201d I met Tsering thanks to Sonam Dorjee of Khaldo village in the valley, who works at the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle. Tsering talked to us in his spacious khur (army tent in the Ladakhi language) at the Taknakpo grazing ground located at about 14,000 feet. Three years before the May 2019 disaster in Sikkim, the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development had published a paper noting \u201cthe yak population in Bhutan, India and Nepal has shown a declining trend in recent years.\u201d The researchers found a fall in the yak population in India \u201cfrom 132,000 in 1977 to 51,000 in 1997.\u201d A decline of over 60 per cent in just three decades. Data from the local Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying show that Leh district\u2019s yak population decreased from 30,000 in 1991 to 13,000 in 2010. That\u2019s a steep 57 per cent fall in two decades. The local data seem at variance with the \u2018official\u2019 figures at the top \u2013 which place the yak population in the district at 18,877 in 2012 (in which case the decline would still have been a sharp 37 per cent in 21 years) <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-_AMI724602-RM-Perhaps_we_made_the_mountain.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Ritayan Mukherjee A full grown Himalayan yak \u2013 the animal has for centuries been a lifeline for the Changpa pastoral nomads \u2013 at a high altitude pasture in Ladakh\u2019s Hanle Valley It wasn\u2019t easy reaching the Dique settlement. Their grazing grounds are higher than those of other herding units. Besides, some of the areas they tent in are close to the India-China border \u2013 places where civilians aren't allowed. Since it was springtime, though, with Sonam Dorjee\u2019s help, I reached the settlement. \u201cYaks are marvellous creatures,\u201d says Jhampal Tsering. \u201cThe yak is accustomed to freezing temperatures and can survive anything up to minus 35 or minus 40 degrees Celsius. However, it finds it troublesome when the temperature rises to 12 or 13 degrees.

The rest of the Changpas\u2019 income flows from khuloo (yak hair) and wool. So with the falling yak numbers and the decline in milk production, their earnings take a nasty hit. All these changes are placing the yak-related economy under great stress. \u201cIt also doesn't rain on time or snow on time anymore,\u201d says Tsering Chonchum. \u201cSo there is not enough grass on the mountains. Because of this, the number of [pastoral] nomads coming here has gone down. I will say that they have reduced to about 40 per cent [of the estimated 290 families of herders there] because of these changes, due to the scarcity of grass and the problems arising out of that.

I did not measure the temperature then myself but those who knew say that it would dip to minus 35 Celsius. So people's clothing had to be suited to bear that kind of harsh cold.

There is a clear declining trend in precipitation from November to March i.e. reduction in snow fall.\u201d They also say: \u201cOver the last few years, impacts of global climate change have been increasingly visible in Ladakh and Lahaul & Spiti. Rainfall and snowfall patterns have been changing; small glaciers and permanent snow fields are melting, affecting water runoff in the rivers/streams, and rise in temperature and humidity inducing favourable conditions for the invasion of insects and pest aggression.\u201d Back in Jhampal Tsering\u2019s tent, his friend Sangda Dorjee had asked us: \u201cHow many rebos have you seen this time?\u201d The Changpas live in tents known as rebos .

How and why does a full acre of jowar disappear from your fields at short notice? \u201cIt was the first time in two years that I left my village for a week during the season. In that time, they devoured all of it,\u201d says Ananda Salvi. \u2018They\u2019 is a herd of gaur ( bos gaurus , also sometimes called Indian bison) \u2013 the most massive bovine in existence in the world. Males can stand well over 6 feet at the shoulder and weigh anywhere between 500 and 1,000 kilograms. Normally peaceful residents of the Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra\u2019s Kolhapur district, the giant bovids have been getting out on to the highways and raiding the farms around them. \u201cThere was no one guarding my field,\u201d says Salvi sadly in Rakshi village. \u201cLuckily, I was able to save my one acre of sugarcane (about 80 tons of cane)].\u201d So how do you \u2018save\u2019 anything from a bunch of 1,000 kilo behemoths? With firecrackers. Two years ago, Salvi started sleeping in the fields every night. \u201cWe come at 8 p.m. daily and leave only at 4 a.m. after all the gava (local term for the gaur) have left,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd we burst crackers in the fields at night.\u201d That scares off the buffalo, he says, from entering his five acre farm. Several of his neighbours do likewise. Rakshi village, in Panhala taluka , has lost crops to bison for at least two years now. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/02-IMG_20190508_115624-SJ-Buffaloed_by_the_cl.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain The shrinking Savrai Sada lake is one of the main sources of water for animals and birds in the sanctuary \u201cWe spend nearly Rs. 50 every day in season, buying those crackers,\u201d says Salvi\u2019s wife Sunita. Which adds a whole new element to cultivation costs. \u201cIt\u2019s still a risk,\u201d she says, \u201cfarmers sleeping in the fields at night.\u201d There\u2019s other wildlife active in the fields in those hours. Snakes, for instance. People believe the buffalo will soon figure out that firecrackers won\u2019t do them real harm. So some farmers in Radhanagari taluka have begun using electrified fences. \u201cBut even those, they\u2019re getting used to,\u201d says Samrat Kerkar, co-founder of the Bison Nature Club, a Radhanagari-based wildlife NGO. \u201cWe have seen gaur placing their hooves or legs slowly on the fence to check if it gives a shock. Earlier, they feared humans, but now they don\u2019t run away so easily on seeing us.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t blame the gava ,\u201d says Sunita. \u201cIt\u2019s the forest department\u2019s mistake. If the forests aren\u2019t maintained properly, animals will come out.\u201d The gaur buffalo have increasingly been coming out of the wildlife sanctuary \u2013 in search of food and water. They\u2019re seeking, amongst other things, karvi leaves ( strobilanthes callosa ) which seem to be withering in the drying forests. And also, other sources of water \u2013 with the sanctuary\u2019s ponds shrinking. Further, forest guards and field researchers say they are also driven by the declining patches of grasslands within the sanctuary. <img alt=\"Anand Salvi lost an acre of jowar to a bison raid. \"", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77db8932-85c1-4d91-b88d-f9840353b4f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "77db8932-85c1-4d91-b88d-f9840353b4f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/buffaloed-by-the-climate-in-kolhapur/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSanket Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Buffaloed by the climate in Kolhapur", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/buffaloed-by-the-climate-in-kolhapur/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSanket Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "32f571bb4c15e456f7719325d64a45646b91ea963c197478823ef4e6e18fc844"}, "2": {"node_id": "ed1c1c1b-a179-42e1-b9a6-c5e92e5de5ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/buffaloed-by-the-climate-in-kolhapur/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nSanket Jain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "Publisher": "People's Archive of Rural India", "Type": "Web"}, "hash": "9f9cd10148d0fb5dea68c409e96c2c11c04321989ed624ed890804596abb458e"}}, "hash": "3bb54e02b15823173edab28b468e106548c4a998c50f3a15e3cd2465994e4bb8", "text": "class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/03a-IMG_20190516_130440Crop-SJ-Buffaloed_b.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/03a-IMG_20190516_130440Crop-SJ-Buffaloed_by_t.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:255px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain <img alt=\"Sunita Salvi says she blames the forest department.\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/03b-IMG_7139-SJ-Buffaloed_by_the_climate_i.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/03b-IMG_7139-SJ-Buffaloed_by_the_climate_in_K.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:255px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain <img alt=\"Metallic cots farmers sleep on in the fields, through the night. \" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"/media/images/03c-IMG_20190516_131416Crop-SJ-Buffaloed_b.max-1400x1120.jpg\" src=\"/media/images/03c-IMG_20190516_131416Crop-SJ-Buffaloed_by_t.height-560.jpg\" style=\" height:255px;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain Left: Anand Salvi lost an acre of jowar to a bison raid.

It\u2019s been on and off over some decades. \u201cOpen cast bauxite mining devastated Radhanagari over many years,\u201d says Bittu Sahgal, founder editor of Sanctuary Asia . \u201cThere was great resistance to it, but mining companies such as INDAL [later merged with HINDALCO] had far greater clout in the corridors of power than the protestors did. The companies were writing policy in government offices. Grazing grounds, water sources, all these suffered grave damage from mining activity.\u201d Indeed, since 1998, both the Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court of India have come down strongly on such activity, more than once. As late as October 2018, the apex court had ordered the presence of the chief secretary of the Maharashtra government over the \u2018total lack of concern\u2019 the state showed in the matter. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/04-SJ-Buffaloed_by_the_climate_in_Kolhapur.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Sanket Jain Top row left: Yuvraj Nirukhe fears cultivating rice this season.

Also, \u201cmost of the deforestation here has happened in the past decade. This has affected the [climate] cycles,\u201d says Amit Sayyed, a wildlife researcher and president of the Wildlife Protection and Research Society. Savrai Sada is one of the sites where the forest department has created artificial \u2018salt licks\u2019 for animals. A salt or mineral lick is a place from where animals can consume essential nutrients. Salt and konda (husk/bran) have been stored at some sites in both Dajipur and Radhanagari. There\u2019s another, less benign form of human intervention than salt licks: the spread of sugarcane. Kolhapur district, with its rich rainfall in some talukas , was for decades hospitable to sugarcane. It\u2019s growth, though, is a bit alarming.

The forest types in this sanctuary are southern semi-evergreen, southern moist-mixed deciduous and southern evergreen forest. While the impact of all the changes goes way beyond these sanctuaries, they have had profound consequences for their denizens. Human activity is growing, but the gaur herds are not. Believed to have had over 1,000 of these magnificent animals some decades ago, Radhanagari wildlife sanctuary now has 500, according to the forest department of Maharashtra. Forest range officer Prashant Tendulkar\u2019s personal estimate is 700. In India, the gaur is classified under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972, which gives absolute protection to the listed species. Offences against these animals invite the highest penalties. Gaur also figure in the \u2018Red List\u2019 of threatened species of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which classifies them as \u2018vulnerable.\u2019 The gaur are on the move, but: \u201cthey [the forest department] do not have data on their migration record,\u201d says Amit Sayyed. \u201cWhere are they going? What kind of corridor are they using? What kind of groups? How many individuals in a group? If they are monitoring the groups, then these kinds of things will not happen. Water bodies should be set up in these corridors.\u201d India Meteorological Department data show that rainfall in June 2014 in Kolhapur district was 64 per cent below the normal average for that month. In 2016, minus 39 per cent. In 2018, it was plus one per cent above the average. In July 2014, it was 5 per cent above the average for that month. In July the next year it was minus 76 per cent. This year, rainfall was above average by 21 per cent for the period June 1 to July 10. But, as many here point out, this April and May saw no real pre-monsoon showers. \u201cThe rainfall pattern has become erratic over the past decade,\u201d says Kerkar. That has sharpened the problem of fewer and fewer perennial water sources in these forests. <img alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload\" data-src=\"\" src=\"/media/images/06-SJ-Buffaloed_by_the_climate_in_Kolhapur.width-1440.jpg\" style=\" height:auto;\"/> PHOTO \u2022 Rohan Bhate , Sanket Jain Top row left: Inside Dajipur forest.

It\u2019s a classic Indian cinema fight-in-the-desert scene. Against the background of dunes and depressions with a tiny sprinkling of scrub vegetation, the hero rises from the burning sands of a barren wasteland to beat the bad guys to a pulp. Adding plenty of heat and dust to that already bestowed by nature, he brings the film to a happy conclusion (except for the villains). Countless Indian movies have staged those scenes in some desolate wilderness of Rajasthan. Or even in the ravines of the Chambal valley in Madhya Pradesh. Only, this arid wilderness scene (see video clip) used no locations from Rajasthan or the Chambal. It was shot deep in the southern peninsula, in Andhra Pradesh\u2019s Rayalaseema region. This specific patch of some 1,000 acres in Anantapur district \u2013 once covered by millet cultivation \u2013 has over many decades become more and more a desert. That has been driven by often paradoxical factors \u2013 and created the kind of space that filmmakers send out location scouts to look for. In Dargah Honnur village, where the major landowners of this patch reside, it was difficult to get anyone to believe we were not movie location scouts. \u201cWhich film is this for? When is it coming?\u201d was either an explicit question or one on their minds. With some, you could see a quick ebbing of interest when they learned we were journalists. The makers of the Telugu film that made the place famous \u2013 Jayam Manade Raa ( Victory is Ours ) \u2013 shot those fight scenes here between 1998 and 2000. Like any diligent commercial filmmakers would, they tinkered with their \u2018set\u2019 to enhance the desert effect. \u201cWe had to uproot our crop (for which they compensated us),\u201d says Pujari Linganna, 45, whose family owns the 34 acres where the fight was shot. \u201cWe also removed some vegetation and small trees so it would look more real.\u201d Deft camerawork and the intelligent use of filters did the rest. If the makers of Jayam Manade Raa were shooting a 20-years-after sequel today, they would have to do much less. Time and tormented nature, and relentless human intervention, have effected all the desert enhancements they could ask for. This arid wilderness scene (see video clip) used no locations from Rajasthan or the Chambal. It was shot deep in the southern peninsula, in Andhra's Rayalaseema region var container = document.currentScript.parentNode; setHeightOfVideo(container,270); But it\u2019s a curious desert patch. There is still cultivation \u2013 because there is still groundwater very close to surface. \u201cWe hit water in this patch at just 15 feet below,\u201d says P. Honnureddy, Linganna\u2019s son. In much of Anantapur, borewells won\u2019t find water before 500-600 feet. In parts of the district, they have breached the 1,000-foot mark. Yet here is water gushing out of a four-inch borewell as we speak. That much water, so close to the surface, in this hot and sandy patch? \u201cThat whole area lies in an extended riverbed,\u201d explains Palthuru Mukanna, a farmer from a nearby village. What river? We can see nothing. \u201cThey built a dam [around five] decades ago, some 25-30 kilometres from Honnur, on the Vedavathi river that ran through here. Our stretch of Vedavathi (a tributary of the Tungabhadra \u2013 also called the Aghari) simply dried up.\u201d \u201cThat is indeed what happened,\u201d says Malla Reddy of the Ecology Centre (of Anantapur\u2019s Rural Development Trust) \u2013 few know this region as well as he does. \u201cAnd the river may be dead but, over centuries, it helped create an underground reservoir of water that is now being relentlessly mined and extracted. At a rate which signals a coming disaster.\u201d That disaster won\u2019t be long in coming.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bfe56a3-1367-4971-bcf6-2586eb29779d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bfe56a3-1367-4971-bcf6-2586eb29779d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://ruralindiaonline.org/en/articles/its-raining-sand-in-rayalaseema/", "Author": "\n\n\n\nReporter :\n\n\n\nP.

What\u2019s being cultivated? What sticks out in the patch we\u2019re exploring is not even the district\u2019s all-pervasive groundnut crop, but bajra . That millet is cultivated here for seed multiplication. Not for consumption or the market, but for seed companies who have contracted the farmers for this job. You can see male and female plants laid out neatly in adjacent rows. The companies are creating a hybrid from two different strains of bajra. This operation will take a great deal of water. What\u2019s left of the plant after seed extraction will at best serve as fodder. \u201cWe get Rs. 3,800 per quintal for this seed replication work,\u201d says Pujari Linganna. That seems low, given the labour and care involved \u2013 and the fact that the companies will sell those seeds to the same class of farmers at very high prices. Another cultivator on this patch, Y. S. Shantamma, says her family gets Rs. 3,700 a quintal. Shantamma and her daughter Vandakshi say the problem of cultivating here is not water. \u201cWe even get water in the village though we have no piped connection at home.\u201d Their headache is the sand which \u2013 besides the huge volume that already exists \u2013 can accumulate very rapidly. And trudging across even short distances on sand several feet deep can be tiring. \u201cIt can simply destroy the work you\u2019ve put in,\u201d say mother and daughter. P. Honnureddy agrees, showing us the stretch beneath a sand dune where he had painstakingly laid out rows of plants \u2013 not four days ago. Now they are just furrows covered in sand.

It mentions that \u201ctransformative change for a system-wide reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is necessary. Based on this, the Climate Crisis Commission vision is a world in which global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels and society is adapting to manage climate risks in ways that enhance socio-ecological resilience, are Nature Positive, and promote just outcomes for all. For this, it must lead and support implementation of solutions proposed by all forms of science with a main focus on just decarbonization, synergies between climate and biodiversity, and addressing vulnerable nature and human sectors. To realize this vision, the Climate Crisis Commission must help consolidate IUCN\u2019s extensive climate-related policy as articulated through Congress resolutions, connect with existing efforts and synergies and build new ones, promote productive and constructive partnerships and leverage IUCN\u2019s convening power. Actions guided by principles including equity, social and climate justice, ecosystem integrity, environmental safeguards and a rights based approach, will be essential for rapid and sustainable transformations. It will also be important to engage all sectors in society, working with women and youth as key parts of the equation. It will also be important that new Commission\u2019s work recognizes the sustainable nature conservation practices of Indigenous Peoples, respects, protects and uphold their rights including to their lands, territories and resources, and ensures the application of Free Prior and Informed Consent. In addition to assisting IUCN\u2019s engagement with the formal intergovernmental processes addressing the climate and biodiversity crises, the Climate Crisis Commission recognizes the necessarily ambitious transformational change that must now occur; percolate the economic, political, cultural and social dimensions across multiple fronts; and be implemented by different actors at many-levels. 2 Neither climate nor nature goals will be achieved without fundamental reforms of our financial and economic architecture and a well planned systems transition, shaped through a convergence approach. This will undoubtedly require addressing real concerns such as the credibility and validity of \u201cNetZero\u201d approaches, and the further development of the \u201cNature Positive\u201d concept and actions. 2- Goal By 2025, IUCN CCC will have been effective in bringing a more holistic, integrated and just approach to the development and implementation of IUCN climate policy and programs and to IUCN\u2019s engagement with international and regional processes, effectively contributing to the efforts of the world community in limiting warming to below 1.5\u00baC and enabling the necessary adaptation and resilience. 3- Objectives \u25cf Develop and promote holistic policies and guidelines that facilitate the rapid transition away from fossil fuel to clean energy sources, climate and nature convergence and the enabling conditions to effectively address both challenges. \u25cf Through strong collaboration with other Commissions and the Secretariat, promote synergistic policies and approaches with relevant multilateral processes in addition to the UNFCCC and CBD including UNCCD, RAMSAR, CITES, UNEA, SDGs and those related oceans, food and materials management. Help mobilize, coordinate and collaborate with all components of the Union and external partners under a \u201cOne Union\u201d, \u201cwhole of society approach\u201d, leveraging IUCN convening power and knowledge. \u25cf Promote and implement solutions that advance synergistic climate-biodiversity outcomes, including by integrating science, Indigenous Peoples\u2019 knowledge systems, and local community knowledge in this effort. \u25cf Address the controversies that limit the climate and nature convergence. \u25cf Promote the use of accurate data and appropriate technology to bring solutions to address the climate and nature crises, whilst preventing, warning and limiting its use if it is contrary to climate, nature and sustainability objectives. \u25cf Promote innovative solutions and develop innovative tools/mechanisms, to address the climate and nature crises, through addressing the four climate transitions suggested by IPCC and the 5 key drivers of nature loss identified by IPBES. \u25cf Promote inclusiveness by working with and for local communities, Indigenous Peoples, women and youth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

Part 2 focuses on the analysis of the concerning issues and introduces the reader to the steps needed to: analyse in detail the existing governance structures; how to identify and characterise stakeholders; how to define the ideal state and what is needed to reach it; how to identify the root cause of the issue affecting the local marine environment by applying the 3 whys technique; to ultimately identify the best solutions to address the root cause. Part 3, focuses on the steps needed to develop and put together a policy brief. It introduces the reader to: the need to consider the context in detail before starting to write the brief; getting to know the audience to make sure the brief brings across the messages; what the key elements of a policy brief are and how to put them together; the best strategies to market the brief; and finally, how the brief can be tested to ensure it meets the necessary standards. 04 05 Early Problem Identification for Representative Species / Habitat Evaluating Environmental Conditions Identifying Impacts from Climate Change Identifying Impacts from Fishing Activities Identifying Impacts from Other Marine Activities Data Synthesis and Declaration of Major Findings Considerations for Existing Governance Structures Identification & Characterization Stakeholders Defining the Ideal State & What it Will Take to Achieve That Root Cause of the Problem Using the \u2018\u20183 Whys\u2019\u2019 Getting to Solutions That Address the Root Cause Context Considerations Before Getting Started Getting to Know Your Audience Key Elements of a Policy Brief Marketing Your Policy Brief for Successful Advocacy Testing the Policy Brief to See How It Holds Up DIAGNOSTIC ISSUE ANALYSIS DEVELOPING THE POLICY BRIEF 3-Part Process Model for Integrating Sustainable Fisheries and Biodiversity Protection Into a Policy Brief The Mediterranean Sea is home to some of the world\u2019s richest resources. It represents a unique convergence of complex ecological, economic, and social features. For centuries, the Mediterranean has provided coastal communities with a bounty of living marine resources, which propelled the development of the fishing industry and forged the identity of the dynamic communities that harness the cultural heritage of the region. It is estimated that the Mediterranean fleet counts up to 76,300 vessels, of which approximately 82% are considered Small-Scale Fisheries (SSFs)1 and 7.9% are trawlers. As a vital contributor to the economy of the region, marine capture fisheries provide direct employment to just under a quarter of a million people (248,000) on-board fishing vessels2. Current estimates as of 2020, however, indicate that 75% of the stocks in the Mediterranean and Black Sea are being fished beyond sustainable limits. And the volume of fishery discards in the Mediterranean is estimated at roughly 230,000 tonnes per year, which represents around 18 percent of the total catch2. The dramatic changes, particularly those concerning biodiversity loss and the overall decline in fishing captures witnessed over the last decades confirm the urgent need to apply sustainable mitigation measures in Mediterranean fisheries management. If Mediterranean marine wildlife and ecosystems as well as fisheries productivity are to be sustained, our society needs to shift towards more sustainable management. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development underscores the need to recognise sustainable development as multidimensional, requiring balanced policy action across economic, social, and environmental dimensions.

INTRODUCTION Developing policy briefs to protect biodiversity and fishing resources 06 Before starting to write a policy brief, it is important to follow some key steps, so asto ensure that the issue has been fully understood and can be clearly articulated. The following section outlines a process that can be applied to clearly identify the root cause and address it more appropriately. The first step is to analyse the process of problem solving, to uncover the different layers and establish which factors may be contributing to the issue and which not. Investing time in building a solid basis for getting to the source of the problem, will avoid jumping to solutions prematurely. The purpose of problem solving (the process of analyzing an issue to identify potential solutions) is to dig deep into the real issue and the root causes, otherwise the final solutions and recommendations put forward in the policy brief will not lead to the needed change. For example, if a policy brief written to improve the protection of sandbar sharks\u2019 states that the issue is overfishing, it may be failing to tackle the root cause. It is necessary to reconsider what \u201coverfishing\u201d means and why \u201coverfishing exists\u201d. Stating that the actual issue is \u201coverfishing\u201d is a construct and an idea, but it is missing the foundation. To identify a meaningful and lasting solution it is necessary to start from the bottom and build the foundations by giving sufficient time and resources to truly understand the problem. What is problem solving and why should we take the time to do it? We are living in world shaped and altered by humans, where biodiversity is in decline and conservation problems are on the rise. Almost all, if not all, of a conservation practitioner\u2019s job is focused on solving problems. But given the pressures of modern life, there are often demands to save time and energy by either avoiding decisions or rushing to solutions before taking the time to fully understand the problem being dealt with. There is often a misconception that the problem is already well known. The reality is that by failing to get to the bottom of the problem, there is a greater risk of applying band-aid solutions, which can make things worse and be as damaging in the long run as the problem that needs solving. Is the solution therefore simply replacing one problem with another? OBJECTIVE In this section the focus is on why it is so important to take time to develop a robust problem-solving process before identifying the solution, which will then build the focus of the policy brief. PART 1 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS Identification and diagnosis of a fisheries-related issue to better calibrate the root cause(s) 07 OBJECTIVE In this section the focus is on why it is so important to take time to develop a robust problem-solving process before identifying the solution, which will then build the focus of the policy brief. Clearly articulating the issue to build a strong basis for the policy brief So, what is problem solving? Problem solving is the act of defining a problem; determining the cause of the problem; identifying, prioritising, and selecting alternatives for a solution; and implementing a solution. The key to a good problem definition is ensuring that you deal with the real problem \u2013 not its symptoms. Before a problem can be solved, it is necessary to know exactly what needs solving. Advocacy often fails because we think we know the solution before we have explored the depths of the problem. BOX 1: What are some of the most common reasons why advocacy fails? PART 1 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS Identification and diagnosis of a fisheries-related issue to better calibrate the root cause(s) 08 TIPS FOR PROBLEM SOLVING Don\u2019t just rely on the data.

Think backwards from the problem to analyse the potential factors that lead to it. Keep asking \u201cwhy\u201d before settling on a conclusion to make sure you investigate root causes. Lack of patience \u2013 leading to move through the process too quickly and not building a sound foundation; as well as giving up too soon Failing to align with decision-makers\u2019 priorities Lack of a clear vision of the outcomes of a specific policy and sufficient research suggesting different policy options that account for a multitude of considerations that policy makers are accountable for Poorly articulated and implemented advocacy communication planning These shortcomings can be compensated by ensuring sufficient preparation and accurate planning. What might the problem be? It is not uncommon to start the search for a solution to a complex problem with some predetermined idea(s) of what the problem may be. However, this is just a starting point and often the \u201cproblem\u201d will be redefined, refined, or even completely changed once better understood. The process of complex problem solving can start by making a first statement of what the problem might be. For example: \u201coverfishing is having an impact on biodiversity\u201d But what does this actually mean? Trying to understand the problem It is necessary to try and understand the problem to see whether the first assumption is right or not. Although it may seem faster to stick with a fast solution, failing to detect the source of the problem means there will be no measures in place to stop the problem from reappearing in the future. Addressing impacts on biodiversity in this way is certainly not the path to take. The fact is, if the root cause of the problem has not been identified, then the problem has not truly been diagnosed. This also applies to the previous statement about overfishing. Before jumping to any conclusions about how overfishing is impacting biodiversity, the first step is to conduct some similar diagnostics on the setting where the fishery of interest is taking place. Stating that overfishing is the problem doesn\u2019t provide very much information at all. First, overfishing of what? Of a specific species? What is causing the overfishing? Who is overfishing? Are there too many boats? Is it a social or economic reason that is driving too many fishers to fish? Is biodiversity also being impacted by land-based pollution or mis-managed development? Is there a problem with the way fisheries are being managed? Is it a problem with enforcement? By stating the problem to be overfishing, the details needed to truly address the problem and arrive at the best solutions are missing. OBJECTIVE In this section the focus is on why it is so important to take time to develop a robust problem-solving process before identifying the solution, which will then build the focus of the policy brief. PART 1 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS 09 OBJECTIVE This section is an introduction to the process for building a strong and realistic foundation that tackles the root cause of a problem to avoid trying to solve a problem prematurely and developing a misinformed policy brief. Introducing the diagnostic phase Identification and diagnosis of a fisheries-related issue to better calibrate the root cause(s) BOX 2: Why is the problem often misdiagnosed? There are some common obstacles that are in the way of building a sound policy brief which integrates fisheries and biodiversity conservation. What the \u201cproblem\u201d is believed to be can often be exacerbated by yet another set of problems that prevent the problem being correctly diagnosed. For example: Fisheries jurisdictional boundaries and marine fish species boundaries may not be aligned. Problem diagnosis requires both a local and cross-sectoral focus. It is hard to distinguish between natural and human induced impacts. In haste, there is a tendency to jump to the solution without taking the time to diagnose the problem. Except for the last point, the most that can be done to address the above mentioned first three points, is just to be aware of them when trying to get to the root cause of the problem. The fourth point, however, can be addressed, and in fact, will help in being aware of some of the uncertainties associated with the first three points. It is necessary to address these additional challenges before developing the policy brief, otherwise the end product is an unfocused, poorly articulated, and weak policy brief.

The first place to look in the diagnostic phase is the environment where the \u201cspecies of concern\u201d lives. It is necessary to know and understand what conditions/circumstances/habitats are important to the survival of the species that is to be the subject of the policy brief. This of course will depend on what the representative species is. Throughout this guidebook the sandbar shark population from the Gulf of Gabes, Tunisia is used as an example representative species. This step in the process therefore entails asking: \u201cwhat are the conditions that need to be in place for the sandbar shark to survive in the Gulf of Gabes?\u201d Consider and evaluate the optimal environmental conditions needed for the representative species/habitat of interest in the policy brief to remain healthy and abundant: Note - any unique characteristics of the representative species Geography \u2013 large enough habitat to move according to the natural patterns Healthy Habitat \u2013 eat, live, grow, reproduce Successful Reproduction \u2013 location, timing, number, and body size PART 1 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS 12 Layer 1 Evaluating environmental conditions Based on and agreed upon understanding of what the problem is thought to be at this early stage, will first characterize the site by considering the following: Early identification of the problem/issue Mapping out the life history requirements of the target species (habitat requirements) Environmental/seasonal variables Condition of habitat Climate-driven impacts EXERCISE 1.1: Characterizing the Setting by Mapping Out the Life History Requirements of the Target Fish Species and Evaluating Optimal Conditions.

Identification and diagnosis of a fisheries-related issue to better calibrate the root cause(s) The following are the four basic needs that are required for marine resources to remain healthy, abundant, and therefore resilient: a. Healthy Habitat \u2013 Habitats are areas that are used by marine species to eat, live, grow, and reproduce. If a habitat used for any one of these functions is damaged, it could have negative impacts on the populations on all species that use that habitat during their life cycles. b.

The worksheet provides a system for capturing the data layer. The first step is to write down your early-stage problem statement. Then note any unique life history characteristics of the representative species. It is important to select a specific geographic range so that the problems, aka impacts, are identified, that are specific to an area, otherwise the conversation becomes too broad-based and abstract. Handout 1.2: provides a useful guide as to how to prepare a map. The next step is to map the area i.e., where the \u201crepresentative species\u201d lives. For the sandbar shark example, the area of interest is the Gulf of Gabes, an area designated as a \u201cmarine biodiversity hot spot\u201d, the most important fishery area of the Tunisian fishing fleet, and a nursery ground for the sandbar shark. Note: It can help to draw out a schematic that depicts the life history range and needs for the representative species, then identify where there are impacts by evaluating the condition of the different habitats (mapping component). Then indicate on the map where/when there are seasonal variables and potential corresponding impacts on the habitats. PART 1 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS 15 For the second layer of the database, it is necessary to move beyond focusing on the condition of the ideal environment and look at what some of the stressors might be that are impacting the environment. It is well known that the Mediterranean is strongly feeling the impacts of climate change. This layer is all about knowing and understanding how this might be contributing both directly and indirectly to the species/habitat of interest in the policy brief. What are some of the climate stressors and corresponding impacts that should be looked for? What impacts are being felt from: \u2022 Warming waters? \u2022 Rising sea levels? \u2022 Invasive species? \u2022 Jellyfish blooms? \u2022 Changes in salinity?

This information is then transferred into a map or represented in some other visual way such as a diagram or picture. The goal of most participatory mapping exercises is to simply create concrete opportunities for discussion about social, economic, and/or environmental resources and for individuals to learn about their own and others\u2019 perceptions surrounding these resources. Participatory mapping is an effective way for identifying and discussing primary and secondary impacts and contributes greatly to the assessment process. Define the scope and purpose. The first step in getting started is to define the scope and purpose of the mapping exercise. This should be done with all team members involved in conducting the assessment. This step will allow the group to decide on specific information that may be needed to assess impacts, and whether to limit the exercise to one or more specific assets within a social-ecological system. The first steps in this process for our workshop on Managing Fisheries for Biodiversity Protection include: 1- SPECIES IDENTIFICATION: Identify the representative species of concern that you believe is impacted by fisheries activities. This species will become the \u201cemblematic\u201d species for biodiversity \u2013 and eventually the centerpiece of your policy brief. 2- PROBLEM STATEMENT: Develop a brief and simple statement on what you think the problem is in regards what is impacting the population and health of this species. One line should be sufficient as this is just a starting point and we will come back and visit this problem statement after we have conducted a diagnostic. 3- LOCATION OF MAP: Determine the specific location of the place you are mapping and the geographic extant of the boundaries. To build the data layers on your map including the following parameters: A. Life History Requirement: Map the areas where the life history of your representative species takes place, including places for feeding spawning grounds, juvenile and adult stages of development. These areas are likely to have associated habitats or conditions that are necessary to the health of your species. B. Climate Change Impacts: Include areas on the map where your representative species might be or is known to be most vulnerable to climate changes such as sea level rise, ocean acidification, invasive species, warming sea surface temperatures, jellyfish blooms, etc. C. Fisheries Activities: Map those locations where fisheries are taking place and might, or are known to, directly impact your representative species. The impact may be on the species itself through incidental bycatch, or may have an impact on a habit important to the life history of the species, or even an impact on water quality. D. Other Human Use Activities in the Marine Environment: Map put the location of other human use activities taking place in the marine environment that may have an impact on your representative species such a recreational fishing, aquaculture, marine transportation, or wind farms. Additionally, there may be some permanent structures such as docks, marinas, or other infrastructure that is having an impact on your representative species or associated habitat. 16 HANDOUT 1.2: Mapping the Setting of Your Representative Species TIME TO GET STARTED Create a checklist. Begin the mapping exercise by creating a checklist of features to be mapped. This checklist can be compiled by the assessment team or members of the participant group. The selected features should reflect the purpose of the exercise. Avoid having too many (>10) features in the checklist as it often clutters the map and makes interpretation by others difficult. Prepare a base map. The preparation of a base map is useful and provides the participant group with common understanding of the orientation and scale of the area to be mapped. This can be accomplished by having the participants first draw features such as coastlines, rivers, islands, mountains, and other recognizable landmarks. To get people comfortable with sharing information, it is often helpful to have participants provide the names of the landmarks or reference points in the base map. The use of a Geographic Information System (GIS) can be quite helpful for creating simple base maps. However, caution should be used if using satellite imagery or aerial photographs in the base maps. Many individuals are not familiar with such views of a place, and they can be confusing and distracting. Begin mapping. Use the base map to begin identifying features from the checklist. Encourage all participants to contribute to the map. One or two individuals should not dominate the process. The use of colored pencils or pens to classify features, the use of labels, and the generation of a legend can make the map easier to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0c6bef5-e7f3-45af-b8e3-048c587f2ee4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0c6bef5-e7f3-45af-b8e3-048c587f2ee4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Advocacy for Mediterranean Sustainable Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation This", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c8a8d2f61a8cda4cc09729922cc3f7479a4943a1828cbe76a8b7e6dd13cf20f"}, "3": {"node_id": "faf72fc0-91d4-404c-96e5-b7ddc1c66efe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12ce5760f7935a13e7a2c7b191670a4591ba9a08c3e0d677a0c8b7697cd66a7e"}}, "hash": "d930942df5766efd9c5411c9eb0acab79ec96569f55a0b3361e5a843ef89fdf3", "text": "interpret later.

Six stories from an overheating sea\u201d WWF Mediterranean Marine Initiative, Rome, Italy, 2021) 2- Problem Statement (what you believe the problem is in terms of the status of the species and what is creating the problem): 1. Tropicalization of the Eastern Mediterranean is Spreading West Native species which prefer cooler waters are shifting the southern edge of their ranges northwards Species communities in some areas of the southern and eastern Mediterranean have changed completely The eastern Mediterranean is warming at a rate far above the global average and invasive species are extending their distribution in line with the rising temperatures, mostly arriving from the Red Sea by way of the Suez Canal Impoverished and dying reefs can turn from carbon sinks to carbon sources POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Networks pf MPA managers can restore biodiversity and rebuild stocks of native predatory species weakened through decades of overfishing and other human use activities. Fishers can target the new alien species to bring down the population numbers and in doing so create new revenue streams lost by the decline of previously targeted species. 2. Highly Destructive Invasive Species are Spreading Across the Mediterranean The Mediterranean is the most invaded sea in the world with alien species, completely interrupting and destabilizing native ecosystems Changing sea temperatures allow for the spread of invasive species, occupying and thriving in parts of the Mediterranean that were once considered too cold Both the rabbitfish and lionfish are amongst the most prevalent and damaging invaders Almost 1,000 invasive species have migrated into the Mediterranean 95% of lionfish prey are economically significant fish species Rabbitfish have caused a 40% reduction in the numbers of native species in parts of the Mediterranean POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Deliberately target rabbitfish and lionfish and create consumer demand for these fish as they are both good to eat. Additionally, an increase in native predators, such as dusky groupers which have been overfished in the past, could be achieved through effective management of MPAs. 3. Unprecedented Numbers of Jellyfish are Blooming in the Mediterranean, Disrupting Fisheries Although naturally part of a healthy marine ecosystem, when the system gets out of balance, jellyfish can become a problem Jellyfish blooms in the southern Mediterranean are happening more frequently and lasting longer, radically altering regional ecosystems Jellyfish fill up fishing nets, damaging gear and impeding efficiency Jellyfish can impact tourist areas, flood aquaculture cages, cause problems for water intake systems and power stations Overfishing has reduced predator and are among the most species competing with jellyfish for zooplankton POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Increasing competition by reducing overfishing of key fish species is critical, including the species that eat jellyfish eggs and adults. In addition, eutrophication and land-based sources of pollutants must be brought under control to reduce the dead zones in which jellyfish thrive. It might also be worth considering creating new markets for jellyfish. 18 4. Posidonia, the Mediterranean\u2019s Blue Carbon Sink is in Trouble Posidonia, endemic to the Mediterranean, is one of the most important species in the Mediterranean ecosystem, oxygenating the sea and providing vital habitat for 20% of the marine species Temperature stress from climate change is expected to change distribution of posidonia Temperatures also attract new invasive algae species which colonize the weakening meadows, offering less support to biodiversity and storing less carbon Sea level rise is causing the regression of meadows around the Mediterranean Posidonia stores between 11-42% of CO2 emissions from Mediterranean countries POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Increasing management and protection to guard against destructive anchoring and fishing in the remaining viable seabeds. Incentives should be provided for restoration for payments through ecosystem services schemes such as carbon and nutrient trading credits. MPAs should be considered one of the most effective nature-based solutions to the protection of posidonia. 5.

POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: MPAs can play an important role in reducing stress on remaining populations of gorgonian corals by prohibiting the use of recreational and commercial fishing gears that impact the seabed, and regulating or instilling Best Management Practices (BMPs) for recreational scuba divers. Ecological restoration and recruitment of larvae should also be considered. 6. Sudden Mass Die-offs of the Flagship Species Charismatic Pinna Nobilis Sudden mass die-off of the pinna nobilis may be linked to the warming taking place in the Mediterranean Climate change, along with other environmental stressors, has been linked to the mass die-off of pinna nobilis across large areas of their home range One of the largest endemic bivalves in the Mediterranean, pinna nobilis plays an important ecological role both in terms of providing important habitat and serving as a water filtration system Starting in 2016 in Spain, and spreading across the Mediterranean, there have been devastating mass mortality events Pinna Nobilis was listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2019 The mass mortality event was mainly caused by a pathogen and spread by currents Question as to the role warming temperatures played in this event It\u2019s not yet certain, but climate change could also be impacting reproduction and recruitment POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: Repopulating areas affected by the mass die-of through ecological restoration and recruitment of larvae, however, slow growth rates and low recruitment could make it problematic. Strengthening the resilience of pinna nobilis populations from other human-induced stressors will be critical. HANDOUT 1.3: 19 PART 1 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS 20 The third layer of the database is focused on identifying the impacts from fishing activities on the species of interest. What impacts are being felt from: \u2022 Over-exploitation of the fisher? \u2022 The use of different types of fishing gear on marine habitats? \u2022 Bycatch of non-target species? \u2022 Incidental take? Worksheets 1.2a and 1.2b: Worksheet 1.2b is populated with information about sandbar sharks as a reference guide to help complete 1.2a. Using the map, depict the spatial extent of these activities and use the worksheet to capture the data to identify if there are impacts and what the impacts might be from fishing activities on the representative species. Then prioritise which of these activities are the highest priority to address based on the following criteria: level of impact, ability to address the source of impact (capacity), and how likely it is that the results will be meaningful and last. Handouts 1.4 & 1.5: provide some guidance which might be helpful in getting started.

Marine mammals do become entangled in the marker lines connecting the pots to the buoy. Ghost-Fishing The effects of ghost-fishing by lost pots and traps can be very significant. The level of impact depends on several factors, including number of lost pots, rate of loss, density of pots in an area, bottom habitat and location of the lost pots, change in number of animals caught by ghost pots over time, degradation rates of pots, season of loss, catchability of unbaited pots (as well as the rebaiting of pots by dead and dying animals), rates of ingress and egress by organisms, and mortality of animals in lost pots. Mortality in pots depends on adverse environmental conditions (e.g., low oxygen), predation, injury by other animals in the pot, starvation, and disease. Delayed mortality may also occur after escape from pots. Examples of Threats Shellfishes and crabs may be caught in lost gear. Buoy lines of lobster pots in New England entangle marine mammals, such as the critically endangered Atlantic right whale. In the Caribbean, pots and traps are set on living organisms or substrates 40 percent of the time and may crush or damage these organisms. 22 Copyright: Bedis Elacheche HANDOUT 1.4: Impacts on Biodiversity by Fishing Gear Type 2. LONGLINES \u2013 BOTTOM Habitat Damage Damage to habitat caused by bottom longlines is limited because the gear is small in weight and area. However, hauling the lines from the bottom may cause the hooks to snag, and the lines may cause abrasions or entangle rocks, coral, or structural organisms such as sponges or gorgonians. When lines are hauled mechanically, this damage is magnified. Bycatch Bycatch of seabirds is a significant consequence of bottom longline fisheries. Deployment of longlines attracts seabirds, which dive for the baited hooks as the lines are released from the vessel. Seabirds may ingest these baited hooks and subsequently drown. Sharks and marine mammals are also caught when they mistake the bait for prey. When hooks are hauled in individually, nontarget catch may be released, but damage due to hooks, handling, and stress of capture decreases survival. Mechanical hauling and line-strippers prevent live release. Ghost-Fishing Unknown bycatch impact; lost gear continues to fish until bait is lost. Lost gear may entangle benthic species such as corals and gorgonians, resulting in damage or death. Examples of Threats Bycatch of seabirds in Alaska groundfish longline fisheries resulted in thousands to tens of thousands of birds killed per year, prior to the incorporation of streamer lines, a bycatch reduction device. Bottom longlines may damage corals, such as gorgonian corals in Alaska, when hooks snag during hauling. 23 Copyright: George Desipris HANDOUT 1.4: Impacts on Biodiversity by Fishing Gear Type 3. GILL NETS/ TRAMMEL NETS Habitat Damage In strong ocean currents or when being hauled out of the water, bottom gillnets may become tangled and snagged on rocks and living organisms, such as corals and aquatic plants, breaking or uprooting structures and organisms. Damage is higher with mechanical hauling gear. Bycatch Gillnets are a nonselective type of gear, often catching a wide range of nontarget species. By extending vertically into the water column, bottom gillnets cause bycatch of marine mammals, seabirds, sea turtles, sharks, and finfishes. Occasionally, benthic species such as crabs become entangled. In states where gillnets are legal, regulations limit soak times and net mesh size to reduce bycatch of nontarget and juvenile target species. Ghost-Fishing Gillnets often are intentionally placed near shipwrecks to take advantage of the fishes\u2019 attraction to these structures, resulting in the wrecks becoming covered with nets which continue to catch fish that cannot be recovered. The rate of continuous fishing by lost gillnets (ghost-fishing) depends on maintenance of a vertical profile, visibility to fish (older nets become more visible as a result of encrustation by algae, etc.), and abundance of fish in the area where the gillnet is lost. Lost nets can become tangled on seafloor structures such as coral heads and rocky outcroppings, damaging the seafloor and entangling organisms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cddea3a5-49cc-4ee5-8f54-37355ec8e14c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cddea3a5-49cc-4ee5-8f54-37355ec8e14c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Advocacy for Mediterranean Sustainable Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation This", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd3478d16261b731fc43b760b64fa3f0f2692738a20ed8f6fd529bcaaf9d9776"}, "2": {"node_id": "74bb7aea-da9c-4253-b76f-82489b53a093", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69f5e0293fa5a1edbccace779310752d82a76f75ffbda87cc1ba7352a330d891"}}, "hash": "a6e9199f49c8cb174e64de16b7cdec259ce4f211bb1bec870f86e98580fd086b", "text": "Examples of Threats In New England, gillnets cause bycatch of harbor porpoises, bottlenose and white-sided dolphins, pilot whales, harbor seals, gray seals, and harp seals.

DREDGES Habitat Damage Dredging reduces habitat complexity, leading to long-term effects including decreased species richness and biomass and increased presence of weedy species. Dredging damages organisms, reduces biomass and smothers submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and algae. On sand, mud, and silt bottoms, dredging smooths bedforms, resuspends sediments reducing the number of species living there as a result of burial or smothering, and reduces nutrients and microbial activity. Dredging of gravel, hard-bottom, and living habitats reduces species living in the interstices of the gravel and rocks, species attached to the seafloor, and habitat complexity. On oyster reefs dredging reduces reef height and decreases oyster resistance to low oxygen. Dredging also damages shellfish found in and on top of soft bottoms. Bycatch Dredge catch or damaged organisms not targeted, especially sponges, bivalves, aquatic vegetation, and bottom fishes. These organisms often are uprooted from the seafloor and then crushed by the weight of the bag and are unlikely to survive if captured and discarded. Bag ring size can be regulated to reduce the number of unwanted organisms retained in the bag. Ghost-Fishing No effects are expected, given that dredging gear is rarely lost, and if it is, it stops fishing. Examples of Threats Dredging for sea scallops and clams in New England causes significant bycatch of small crabs and other bottom dwelling organisms, such as flounder and barndoor skates. Dredges cause severe habitat damage, especially in areas of hard bottom and gravel. An example is seen off Swan Island in New England, where the coverage of living organisms attached to the seafloor has been greatly reduced. 5. TRAWL \u2013 BOTTOM Habitat Damage Trawling reduces habitat complexity, species richness and biomass, and increases the presence of weedy species by altering the species composition (e.g., long-lived and fragile species are less likely to withstand trawling). It reduces the biomass of SAV through loss of rhizomes and smothering, reduces coverage of organisms attached to the seafloor, smooths bedforms, and compresses sediments in sand and mud habitats. Bottom trawling also resuspends sediment (turbidity), lowers the nutritive quality of sediment, and reduces primary and microbial production. Turbidity impedes the normal functioning of benthic organisms\u2019 feeding and respiratory structures, resulting in hypoxia or anoxia. Turbidity may also increase primary and microbial production in certain situations. On hard-bottom and living habitats, trawling reduces the size and/or density of invertebrates such as sponges and coral colonies. Trawling displaces boulders and damages seafloor structures, reducing feeding and sheltering sites for marine life. 25 Copyright: Alexander Grigorian HANDOUT 1.4: Impacts on Biodiversity by Fishing Gear Type Bycatch Bycatch varies seasonally, temporally, and by target species. Bottom trawls catch nontarget species, including fishes, marine mammals, turtles, seabirds, and invertebrates, as the net sweeps across the ocean floor. Because such large quantities of ocean life are brought on board at once, the unwanted organisms are often returned to the ocean dead, having failed to recover from being crushed in the net, or unable to recover from being out of the water for the length of time it took to sort the catch. Ghost-Fishing Despite regulations, old nets and cod ends are dumped at sea. Lost trawl gear has low ghost-fishing potential unless the net is suspended by floats. Buoyant trawl web masses attract pelagic fishes and invertebrates, which in turn attract and entangle sea turtles and seals. Examples of Threats Bottom trawls continue to drown sea turtles, especially leatherbacks and adult loggerheads, in the Gulf of Mexico and South Atlantic FMC region shrimp trawl fisheries, despite regulations requiring the use of turtle excluder devices (TEDs). Shrimp trawls catch substantial numbers of shark pups and juveniles in shallow waters.

Examples of Threats In Alaska and Puget Sound, Washington, marbled murrelets and common murres are entangled and killed in salmon fisheries. High bycatch of sharks in midwater and drift gillnets occurs in swordfish fisheries. Threatened and endangered sea turtles, such as green, olive ridley, and leatherback turtles, are caught in fisheries along the coast of California and in the South Atlantic FMC region. Marine mammals are frequently taken as bycatch in midwater and drift gillnets, including approximately 2,000 harbor porpoises taken in New England and Mid- Atlantic FMC fisheries. Bycatch of juvenile swordfish and other billfishes occurs in Atlantic tuna and shark fisheries. HANDOUT 1.4: Impacts on Biodiversity by Fishing Gear Type 7. HOOK AND LINE Habitat Damage Hooks are often suspended in the water column and usually do not touch the seafloor. If they are set on or near the seafloor, damage can occur from entanglement, breakage, or minor degradation of seafloor organisms such as invertebrates (corals, sponges, or gorgonians), and lines and sinkers may cause abrasions. Bycatch Bycatch of finfish and sharks occurs when either undersized individuals or nontarget species are caught and discarded. As individual lines are retrieved, unwanted catch can be quickly returned to the water, increasing chances of survival; however, damage from hooking and handling and stress caused by capture decrease chances of survival. Ghost-Fishing Lost lines may affect habitat by entangling and damaging structures. Lines may also entangle and kill a variety of marine life. Examples of Threats \u2022 Lost gear can become tangled on seafloor structures such as coral heads and rocky outcroppings, damaging the seafloor and entangling organisms. 8. TRAWLS \u2013 MIDWATER Habitat Damage This gear is not configured to come into contact with the bottom. Seafloor contact that does occur is poorly studied. Bycatch Because midwater trawls target very large schools of fish, bycatch percentage is low, however the number of individuals in the bycatch is high. Ghost-Fishing Despite regulations, old nets and cod ends are dumped at sea. Lost trawl gear has low ghost-fishing potential unless the net is suspended by floats. Buoyant trawl web masses attract pelagic fishes and invertebrates, which in turn attract and entangle sea turtles and seals. Examples of Threats \u2022 Habitat damage occurs when trawls contact the seafloor, as in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. \u2022 Because of its enormous scale, the Bering Sea pollock fishery has the largest total bycatch of any fishery, although the overall rate relative to targeted catch is small. 27 Copyright: Sam Lim HANDOUT 1.4: Impacts on Biodiversity by Fishing Gear Type 9. LONGLINE \u2013 PELAGIC Habitat Damage Because pelagic longlines rarely come into contact with the seafloor, their effect on habitats is minimal. Bycatch Bycatch of seabirds, sea turtles, sharks, and billfishes is a significant consequence of pelagic longline fisheries. Deployment of longlines attracts seabirds, which dive for the baited hooks as the lines are released from the vessel. Seabirds may ingest these baited hooks and subsequently drown. Sharks, billfishes, sea turtles, and marine mammals are also caught when they mistake the bait for prey. When hooks are hauled in individually, nontarget catch may be released, but damage due to hooks, handling, and stress of capture decreases survival.

Marked decrease in size and abundance of high-value and once abundant fish 4. Change in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) Greater effort (more boats, more tonnage, etc.) results in same or smaller catch Calculate by first determining an appropriate measure of effort (number of fishers, number or tonnage or horsepower of boats, time spent, etc.); then compute CPUE by dividing total fish catch by the measure of effort. Compare past & present data with the same fishing area or other areas 5. Change in fishing methods and effort Increased use of fine-mesh nets to catch fish (e.g. triple-net, double-net, even mosquito net) Marked increase in illegal fishing and use of destructive fishing methods Fishers spending more hours to catch fish or unable to fish all year round More fishers traveling to distant fishing grounds (particularly for fish they used to catch locally) More boats not going out to fish or used less frequently Increasing use of fish aggregating devices including traps 6.

It is important to note at this point that the reason for the species\u2019 decline, for example the sandbar shark, cannot automatically be blamed solely on fishing. It is easy to jump to the conclusion that all impacts on marine biodiversity are from fishing, but often it is not so clear cut. It is more often only part of the \u201cimpact\u2019 equation, but in many cases the impacts from activities such as tourism, aquaculture, recreational fishing - not to mention land-based sources of impact \u2013 are just as harmful as fishing.

Early-stage problem statement: Overfishing is having an impact on biodiversity. Unique life history characteristics: The biological characteristics of this top predator include low fecundity, late maturity and slow growth making them a vulnerable species to begin with. Geographic focus: Gulf of Gabes is an important nursery for sandbar sharks, and in general, the extant of these shallow water biotic communities are increasingly reduced. Climate impacts: Warming waters in the Gulf of Gabes are impacting the availability of suitable habitat nursery areas, which the sandbar shark uses up to 10 years of age. Fishing impacts: The Gulf of Gabes is the most important fishing area in Tunisia and the intensity and the wide use of non-selective fishing practices is impacting sharks. Other activities: Aquaculture activities are contributing to the decline in the population of sandbar sharks due to destruction of bottom habitat and availability of spatial needs. This can be summarised further: Sandbar sharks are top predators; and their life cycle traits make them a vulnerable species The Gulf of Gabes sandbar shark nursery habitat is disturbed by human use and warming waters Non-selective fishing gear and intensive fishing activities are impacting sandbar shark populations Aquaculture is also contributing to the destruction of bottom habitat nursery grounds After this first phase of the diagnostic, the scope (focus) of the initial problem statement might be looking a little different and already need to be narrowed. Identification and diagnosis of a fisheries-related issue to better calibrate the root cause(s) Once data have been collected as part of the diagnostic or data collection process, there are 3 other points to consider in the issue analysis. The issue analysis involves looking at all the data sets together to start to determine what story they are telling. When the issue analysis is complete, it should be clear how some solutions can contribute to address the problem. At that stage it is time to develop the policy brief. But before that, it is necessary to complete the issue analysis. The issue analysis involves compiling information on three additional aspects: 1- Is there an existing governance structure in place and how is that working? 2- Who are the stakeholders that may be contributing to the impacts? 3- What is going to have to change to move from the current situation to the ideal situation? Bringing all the data layers together into a single model allows for a more in-depth look at the current state of the environment. Once these data layers have been brought together, the governance models have been reviewed and associated stakeholders explored, almost all the pieces of information needed to put the policy brief together have been assembled \u2013 except one. The final task needed to complete the issue analysis involves building the incremental steps to get from where you are today (the current situation) to where you want to be, say 5 or 10 years from now (vision for the future \u2013 this is the centrepiece of what the policy brief would like to see achieved.

OBJECTIVE In this section the focus is on why it is so important to take time to develop a robust problem-solving process before identifying the solution, which will then build the focus of the policy brief. PART 2 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS Finding the way from the source of the problem (root cause) to viable, realistic, and effective solutions 33 OBJECTIVE In this section a single model is introduced that helps move from site characterisation to identifying root causes, that then point to potential solutions. From Data Collection To Issue Analysis During the diagnostic phase, the aim was to try to understand the condition of the environment where the representative species lives and what the different sources of impacts were on that species. To go deeper, it is necessary to understand what kind of governance models are in place \u2013 is there a fisheries management plan in place? Is there an MPA or other type of managed area designation in place? Is there a guiding government policy in place? Are these governance approaches working? Why or why not? This information should be added to the previous data layers. Each of the identified impacts then needs to be examined to answer these questions: \u201cAre there stakeholders involved in creating these impacts, and if so, who are they, and why are they creating these impacts (what is the behaviour or root cause creating the impact)?\u201d OBJECTIVE In this section the focus is on why it is so important to take time to develop a robust problem-solving process before identifying the solution, which will then build the focus of the policy brief. OBJECTIVE In this section the aim is to work through the model moving from site characterisation to identifying root causes, that then point to potential solutions. Conducting an issue analysis PART 2 BUILDING THE FOUNDATIONS Finding the way from the source of the problem (root cause) to viable, realistic, and effective solutions 34 The \u201croot cause\u201d, may be multiple root causes. Returning to the initial problem statement of overfishing it is necessary to probe deeper \u2013 \u201cwhy is overfishing occurring?\u201d \u2013 is it an economic situation, over capacity of the fishery, poor fisheries management, non-existent enforcement \u2013 or maybe something completely different is contributing to the problem. Maybe the problem is not solely \u201coverfishing\u201d but rather the cumulative effects of climate change + non-point source pollution + too many boats participating in the fishery. The problem might end up being redefined from \u201coverfishing\u201d to \u201cdeclining fish stocks\u201d due to the cumulative effects of impacts from a range of sources\u201d. Once the problem is reframed and the root cause identified, the way forward for a more direct path to understanding what the appropriate solutions might be becomes much clearer. the below diagram is populated with information is populated with information about sandbar sharks as a reference guide to help complete 1.2a. Using the diagram and based on the data gathered during part 1, overlay any existing governance structures and determine how effective they are in addressing the impacts on the representative species. Next identify any stakeholders associated with the identified impacts on the representative species. The next step is to carefully re-evaluate the problem statement and craft (new) language as needed. Then craft a statement on the ideal state (what change to an optimal state looks like) and determine what kinds of incremental changes will have to occur to make the \u201cideal state a reality\u201d. Once complete the foundation has been built and a sound model has been compiled that will support and give form to the policy brief. By assembling all the data layers generated in Part 1 into the model and exploring the \u201croot cause\u201d of the impacts on the representative species, and a range of solutions for articulation in the policy brief will be much more apparent.

To achieve its objectives, a policy brief should: Be short and concise. Focusing on a particular problem or issue. It should provide enough information for the reader to understand the issue and come to a decision, without getting bogged down in all the details. Be based on firm evidence, not just opinions, one or two experiments or a single year\u2019s experience. It should draw evidence from various sources \u2013 preferably from several different areas or organisations. Focus on meanings, not methods. It should include what has been found and what is being recommend. It does not need to include the details of the methodology. Relate to the big picture. The policy brief may build on context-specific findings, but it should draw conclusions that are more generally applicable. How is a policy brief effective? \ufffd by being IMPACTFUL! \ufffd Targeted messaging focused on a single topic \ufffd Supported by facts \ufffd Politically feasible \ufffd Actionable \ufffd Costed \ufffd Timely Before a policy brief is written, time must be taken to consider who the brief is being written for and how to ensure the brief will be of interest and catch their attention. It is fundamental to be clear about who the audience is that the brief is speaking to. If the audience is not already known, then research should be conducted to find out this information before getting started. Tip: Policymakers are generally extremely busy and are most likely not specialists in the subject area. A policy brief needs to be prepared so it has the biggest chance of being read. A brief is mostly likely to be read if it: \ufffd Looks attractive \ufffd Appears interesting \ufffd Is short and easy to read \u2013 no technical words or jargon OBJECTIVE The importance of knowing the target audience is outlined in this section \u2013 who are you writing the policy brief for? Who is the policy brief for? PART 3 DEVELOPING THE POLICY BRIEF Policy and advocacy plan development for addressing a multi-faceted approach to addressing impacts from fisheries activities on biodiversity 40 What are the key things to consider? Audience: who are the prospective readers? How can the message be framed and tailored for the audience? Stakeholders: include their interests to make a viable policy recommendation Interests: what are the policy makers\u2019 interests and how do these interests complement or differ from that of the audience? What level of knowledge do they have on the subject? What information will they need to decide? Recommendations: policy recommendations should reflect the above analysis Decision time: what information will be needed to take a decision and is the target for the brief the final decision maker(s)? How to: should include suggestions on how to sell the policy to the public. Before starting to write, establish: \ufffd Is this a group or individual decision? \ufffd What questions might they ask? \ufffd What are their concerns? \ufffd Who are they accountable to? Worksheet 2.1: profiling the target audience. This worksheet helps determine who the primary and secondary decision makers are that the policy brief is being crafted for. Start by answering the questions which will help characterise the target audience, then based on those responses fill out the message box. The message box helps get clear about what the message is and how best to frame it. Handout 2.1 tapping into group identity, can help give some guidance on how to better understand the target audience.

In any given situation, an individual may call into play multiple iden\u00actities (household member, town resident, fish monger, parent, member of religious organization, government worker, lawyer, policy maker), even when the goals of the various identities may conflict with each other. To resolve that conflict, an individual has to decide which identity is most relevant in a situation. The strength of affiliation that someone feels toward other members of a group (or the people that may be affected by a decision) can determine which identity that person chooses to apply in a particular situation. Sometimes marine conservation communicators need to go beyond presenting to a general audience to brokering an environmental decision within a group setting. Many environmental decisions are group decisions, so it is vitally important for communicators to understand how people participate in group settings, whether public or \u201cclosed door.\u201d Some of the variables include: \u2022 the relationships that exist among the individuals and groups involved \u2022 the participants\u2019 individual and group goals \u2022 the different ways people participate in groups \u2022 norms concerning how the meeting should be run. [This handout was extracted from CRED materials] When people make decisions, they recognize the sit\u00acuation, their identity in that situation, and the rules that are most appropriate given the situation and their chosen identity. Center for Research on Environmental Decisions (CRED) research suggests that group affiliation may influence whether an individual decides to cooperate in a group decision or not for several reasons: Group affiliation can activate social goals (i.e., concern for others, maximizing the good of the group); Participating in a group allows group norms to exert a stronger influence on individuals; Participating in a group also leads to greater intrinsic reward for individuals when group goals are achieved. Communicators will find it effective to create a sense of group affiliation within an audience. Since affiliation with smaller groups can be stronger than with large groups, they should try to find the most common yet smallest affiliation that the audience can identify with. 43 OBJECTIVE This section of the guidebook provides a step-by-step guide of how to craft a policy brief to make sure that it can be as impactful and effective as possible. The incremental steps for building the policy brief There are a few parameters that should be considered when laying out a policy brief: A policy brief is often a stand-alone document (although some policy briefs are part of a series within an organisation and so check this with your team and communications department, especially for layout and formatting) Focused on a single topic May have multiple recommendations (solutions) No more than 2 pages (ideally policy briefs are 1 page 700 words max. There are options for longer briefs up to 8 pages. However, these longer documents are often supporting documents that contain relevant background information and are not a policy brief). A policy brief has some key elements.

As with all good marketing tools, the key to success is targeting the particular audience for your message. The most common audience for a policy brief is the decision-maker but, it is also not unusual to use the document to support broader advocacy initiatives targeting a wide but knowledgeable audience (e.g. decision makers, journalists, diplomats, administrators, researchers). In constructing a policy brief that can effectively serve its intended purpose, it is common for a brief to be: FOCUSED All aspects of the policy brief (from the message to the layout) need to strategically focused on achieving the intended goal of convincing the target audience. For example, the argument provided must build on what they do know about the problem, provide insight about what they don\u2019t know about the problem and be presented in language that reflects their values, i.e. using ideas, evidence and language that will convince them. PROFESSIONAL, NOT ACADEMIC The common audience for a policy brief is not interested in the research/analysis procedures conducted to produce the evidence, but are very interested to know the writer\u2019s perspective on the problem and potential solutions based on the new evidence. EVIDENCED-BASED The policy brief is a communication tool produced by policy analysts and therefore all potential audiences not only expect a rational argument but will only be convinced by argumentation supported by evidence that the problem exists and the consequences of adopting particular alternatives. LIMITED To provide adequately comprehensive but targeted argument within a limited space, the focus of the brief needs to be limited to a particular problem or area of a problem. SUCCINT The type of audiences targeted commonly do not have the time or inclination to read an in-depth 20 page argument on a policy problem. Therefore, it is common that policy briefs do not exceed 6 \u2013 8 pages in length (i.e. usually not longer than 3,000 words). UNDERSTANDABLE This not only refers to using clear and simple language (i.e. not the jargon and concepts of an academic discipline) but also to providing a well explained and easy to follow argument targeting a wide but knowledgeable audience. ACCESSIBLE The writer of the policy brief should facilitate the ease of use of the document by the target audience and therefore, should subdivide the text using clear descriptive titles to guide the reader. PROMOTIONAL The policy brief should catch the eye of the potential audience in order to create a favourable impression (e.g. professional, innovative etc) In this way many brief writers many of the features of the promotional leaflet (use of colour, use of logos, photographs, slogans, illustrative quotes etc).

Your brief should be tailored to the needs of your audience. It makes a fundamental difference for how you must frame your analysis and your recommendation. Is your audience an individual (i.e. Prime Minister) or an organization (i.e. the Government as a whole)? \ufffd Actors: identify the relevant actors for the issue you are dealing with. This is an essential step, since you will have to analyze their interests in order to make sensible and viable policy recommendations. Identifying the relevant actors is also essential to produce a good assessment of the context and of the interests that are plug into the issue. \ufffd Interests: once you have identified the relevant actors, it is necessary to analyze their interests. What are the actors' interests? Which of the relevant actors have similar interests to your audience? Which ones have different interests? How different? This step is important both for the context part of your brief and for the critique of policy options/policy recommendations. Without a clear identification of the actors involved in the issue and their interests, your brief will result vague, and therefore not useful. \ufffd Recommendations: your policy recommendations should reflect the above analysis. Remember that, according to the issue and the audience, your recommendation(s) might not suggest the best policy, but instead the most viable one. This should not limit your recommendation to just compromise policies. If you want to recommend radical change, you can; remember though that such radical action has to be implemented in some ways. \ufffd How-To: the last step is to suggest your audience the way to 'sell' the policy to its public (the public could be other members of the organizations, voters, other parties, etc.). This last step helps your audience build support/consensus to implement the policy you recommended. \ufffd Jazzin\u2019it Up: Making the policy brief visually appealing with photographs, clear and simple info-graphics /illustrations. 46 Step 1: The introduction section The introduction should leave the audience with a clear sense of the problem and draw them further into the policy brief. The Introduction should set up the rest of the document to clearly convey the argument. The introduction should set up the rest of the document by stating the argument upfront Define \u201dwhy\u201d the brief is being written (what is the problem?) Describe the urgency (why now) Describe the key questions and analysis of the conclusions Describe what is at stake Remember to keep in mind the target audience There are 4 areas to cover in the introduction \u20131) the problem, 2) the urgency of addressing the problem, 3) key questions about addressing the problem, and 4) what would happen if this problem is not addressed. Worksheet 2.2: provides guidance as to how to write the introduction. First, set-up the argument (may be combined with problem), then state what the problem is, indicate why this is an urgent issue, and highlight what is at stake if this is not addressed.

WORKSHEET 2.5: STEP 4: Crafting the Executive Statement Section to Your Policy Brief a. Introduction Section Bulleted Executive Statement: b. Approach and Results c. Concluding Recommendations EXAMPLES OF AN EXECUTIVE STATEMENT: Remember this is the first thing your audience will read at the top of your policy brief. It may be the only thing they ready so make it concise and cover all your main points! 1. Start by having each team narrow down their policy section and summarize into 3 bullet points for each section 2. Take two out of the three main points from each section and craft a bulleted Executive Statement Executive Statement in paragraph format: 3. Knit these 6 main bullet points into a knitted-together Executive Statement paragraph Making your policy brief stand out Once the text for your policy brief is written and assembled, it is time to think about the presentation of the brief. The focus should be narrowed down, and then the policy brief should be jazzed up using dynamic language and visual representations. Grab attention, emphasize key points, and show the audience why this is important: Bring in the visuals, don\u2019t leave anything up to the imagination Draw attention to and highlight the main points Provide a visual representation of the supporting data Put the recommendation(s) front and centre Headlines and Section Titles These should draw the reader into the story. The aim is for the target audience to sit up and take notice. One way to do this is through developing titles and subtitles that draw attention. \ufffd A title should read like a news headline and draw the reader into the policy brief (remember who your target audience is) \ufffd Subtitles should read like a roadmap, letting your audience know exactly where they are \ufffd Use dynamic verbs \ufffd Questions can pique curiosity \ufffd Remember be enticing but don\u2019t dramatize. There is no need to use sensationalism in a policy brief but provide enough of a hook to make the reader want to continue reading. 55 PART 3 DEVELOPING THE POLICY BRIEF Policy and advocacy plan development for addressing a multi-faceted approach to addressing impacts from fisheries activities on biodiversity OBJECTIVES The objective of this section is to learn to use some basic marketing tools to grab the audiences\u2019 attention and lead them to the singular policy conclusion that needs to be decided upon. BOX 4 Here are some examples of more eye-catching headlines and section titles that draw the reader into the story Policy Brief Title: ON THE ROAD TO EXTINCTION \u2013 Mediterranean Governments Have Fallen Short in Their Obligations to Protect Shark Species Executive Summary: Seeking Sandbar Shark Bycatch Solutions That Work Introduction: Why Sharks are So Vulnerable to Human Interactions Approaches and Results: Collateral Damage from Fishing Concluding Recommendations: Working with Fishers on Modifying Gear and BMPs Shows Great Promise Sidebars Sidebars help add depth to the story and are another way to catch the eye of the reader and emphasise key points. \ufffd Sidebars add an extra dimension to the main discussion points \ufffd Another \u201chook\u201d to bring the reader into the policy brief \ufffd Sidebars should be: - short - descriptive - stimulating (pose questions) - highlight a specific piece of information - visually distinctive (set apart from the rest of the text) Charts, Photos, Graphics Data points should be creative, giving a visual way to tell the story. This can be achieved using graphs, charts, and photographs. Graphs however, can sometimes be hard to both read and/or interpret. In general, infographics, pie charts and bar graphs are easier to read than tables as graphics simplify data. Captions can be used to explain content. Handout 2.3: gives an example of a jazzed-up version using headlines, photos, and graphics to help communicate more effectively and gain the readers\u2019 attention. The final step The final step of the process is to check how the policy brief is holding up. This step is critical before sending the brief out to the decision maker. Follow the below steps and ask the following questions: \ufffd Conduct a 20 second test \u2013 what stood out? \ufffd Does it speak to the target audience? \ufffd Is there any jargon that needs to be cleaned up? \ufffd Is there more data than is needed to tell the story and support the position? \ufffd Check soundness of arguments, proof and persuasion \ufffd Build a Q&A package to accompany the policy brief \ufffd Look backward, plan forward Worksheet 2.6: will also help evaluate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "708ec748-ee2d-4064-84ef-0436cb052de2": {"__data__": {"id_": "708ec748-ee2d-4064-84ef-0436cb052de2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Policy and Advocacy for Mediterranean Sustainable Fisheries and Biodiversity Conservation This", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "23ed81277d6b1b4f2f04ba470948dfaa092fc506bf51a305557789301bba049f"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca2a2de4-a923-4b86-b351-95430f55a8d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/policy-and-advocacy-mediterranean-sustainable-fisheries-and-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29701382c9dd0275f863ac9976b95db458f7cce86ba7ff98769f8767cb6d3889"}}, "hash": "bcec420cfdc77d09f44487ca72c52dbb2ea658dafdd579e78011beeafa8aecd6", "text": "the policy brief. 56 PART 3 DEVELOPING THE POLICY BRIEF Policy and advocacy plan development for addressing a multi-faceted approach to addressing impacts from fisheries activities on biodiversity HANDOUT 2.3: Seeking Sandbar Shark Bycatch Solutions That Work with Fisherman The Mediterranean Sea is an extinction hot spot for sharks and rays, with at least half of all species being threatened. The sandbar shark is amongst the most threatened species and is declared endangered (EN) in the Mediterranean according to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. One of the largest remaining nursery grounds for the sandbar shark is in Tunisia\u2019s Gulf of Gabes, which is also the most important fishing area of the Tunisian fishing fleet. Due to their size and behavior, sandbar sharks are often victims of overfishing, largely taken as bycatch. Unless this trend is reversed, it is expected that the sandbar sharks will become extinct in the Gulf of Gabes by 2030. A new study from IUCN identifies a four-fold approach to addressing the problem, in consultation with fisherman, which has been tried and tested in at least 4 regions of the globe and includes: 1) implement sandbar shark catch monitoring and data collection, 2) regulate gear types, 3) Install Best Management Practices, and 4) provide education on safe shark release. Working with Fishers on Gear Modifications and BMPs Shows Great Promise Sharks remain vulnerable and despite their IUCN Red Listing since 2007, more than 50% of sharks and rays native to the Mediterranean are at high risk of extinction due to overfishing. The sandbar shark is considered amongst the most threatened species, with important nursery grounds located in Tunisia\u2019s Gulf of Gabes. In order to reverse this trend of moving towards possible extinction by 2030, is the Tunisian government willing to support catch monitoring and data collection, regulate gear types and establish best management practices? The conclusion of the 30-member IUCN Shark Specialist Group is that a 4- pronged approach is imperative, and without immediate action what is at stake is this loss of top predators could hold serious implications for the entire Mediterranean ecosystem, greatly effecting food webs throughout the region. Reproductive maturity of sharks does not occur until 10-13 years Due to their size and behavior they are often victims of overfishing RECOMMENDATION 1: Data Collection Take action on collecting reliable statistics on landings and bycatch of sharks should be a priority for sandbar shark conservation RECOMMENDATION 2: Gear Regulations a) requiring the use of circular hooks rather than J-hooks: b) requiring the use of monofilament snoods which sharks can more easily cut; c) requiring the use of small magnets of steel alloy RECOMMENDATION 3: Further Mitigation a) eliminate night time longline fisheries and plunge hooks deeper; b) reduce the time of setting; c) avoid dumping garbage, viscera and unmarketable bycatch into fishing areas Why Sharks are So Vulnerable to Human Interactions ON THE ROAD TO EXTINCTION: Mediterranean Governments Have Fallen Short in Their Obligations to Protect Shark Species A POLICY BRIEF FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT HANDOUT 2.3: RECOMMENDATION 4: Safe Release Provide information on prompt and safe release of incidentally captured sharks to reduce stress and injury, while maximizing the safety risk to fishers ON THE ROAD TO EXTINCTION: Mediterranean Governments Have Fallen Short in Their Obligations to Protect Shark Species A POLICY BRIEF FOR THE TUNISIAN OF THE ENVIRONMENT Working with Fishers on Gear Modifications and BMPs Shows Great Promise Shark species in the Mediterranean are incidentally caught as bycatch. In the Mediterranean Sea, shark catches represent only 1.15 percent of the total landings (Statistic FAO 1980\u20132015). A decline in shark species landings has been observed while fishing effort has generally increased. According FAO statistics on sharks, the catches show a decreasing trend: 26000 tons in 1983\u20131984 and 14,000 in 2015. However, FAO data reveals that Tunisia and Libya contribute more than 70% of the shark production for the southeastern Mediterranean over the past 7 years, indicating the sandbar shark populations are still viable in Tunisia.

The Gulf of Gabe provides an important nursery area for the sandbar shark, as well as winter and foraging grounds for the loggerhead turtle; suitable habitat for fish species such as grouper and tuna; and, cetaceans such as bottlenose dolphin. Status uncertainty tends to be greatest along North African coasts, emphasizing the need for further research in this part of the Mediterranean region. By assuming varying fractions of the Data Deficient species are threatened, the overall level of threat ranges from 53% (if none of the DD species are threatened) to 71% if all DD species are threatened. Overfishing: The principal driver of decline and local extinction is overfishing. Most species are taken as retained valuable bycatch in small-scale and large-scale trawl and net multispecies fisheries. Additionally, the wide use of non-selective fishing practices and wide spread habitat destruction are leading to dramatic declines in sandbar sharks. 58 !\"#$%&#'!()#$!#&*$+\",$+!\"-# ./012/3345/45#678/359/52:#%48/#;4<</5#=>732#15# $>/13#!?<1@42175:#27#A372/B2#=>43C#=D/B1/:# !\"#$%&'(\")*&+,\",$*\"-.+\"-/0&1&!0\"2&0&1-*(\"$,\"-.+\"+03&*$02+0-!!

HANDOUT 2.3: ON THE ROAD TO EXTINCTION: Mediterranean Governments Have Fallen Short in Their Obligations to Protect Shark Species A POLICY BRIEF FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE ENVIRONMENT Land Surveys: Data were collected through landing surveys, interviews and a literature review, to assess the following potential management options for their technical effectiveness and socio-economic feasibility: (1) catch monitoring; (2) gear restrictions; and (3) a quota system. The study provides the first evidence-based and nuanced understanding of shark bycatch management for this fishery, and suggestions for future conservation and research efforts. Overall, the framework facilitates a holistic assessment of bycatch management to guide decision-making. Integrating such case studies across different species, fisheries and sites would support the formulation of a meaningful management plan for elasmobranch fisheries in the Gulf of Gabes. Stock Assessments: Stock assessments are underway, essential precursors to set catch limits for those more productive species that could be brought into sustainability. In 2010 and 2011 the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), the regional fisheries management organization for the Mediterranean Sea, adopted ad hoc measures to reduce the bycatch of pelagic sharks such as Thresher, Mako and Hammerhead sharks, which is already showing promise of reducing bycatch and is applicable to sandbar sharks in the Gulf of Gabes. 59 WORKSHEET 2.6: Evaluating Policy Briefs 1.

While a policy brief is usually directed at decision makers; a conservation campaign is typically directed specifically at the stakeholders whose behaviour we would like to see change. Identity Campaigning In \u201cidentity campaigning\u201d the goal is to try and understand what leads an individual to make a change \u2013 which really means understanding their values and life goals. \u201cIdentity\u201d, more than anything else, determines how people make choices about their lives \u2013 including their attitudes and behaviours. One\u2019s own values usually drive our behaviour. Many studies have established substantial correlation between people\u2019s values and their corresponding behaviour. However, people\u2019s values are often hidden and not expressed outwardly. So, the question remains, if the core values of an individual or group cannot be seen, how can they be reached? Story Telling One way to connect to values is by using some of the tools that resonate with the culture. Use personal stories to make connections. Just opening up and being ourselves opens many doors. By using the language, the metaphors, the humour, and the images relevant to the culture or values of a person or group of people, while framing our own story within this context \u2013 is a direct way to make this connection. One place to look for these stories that are laced with values is within the advertising industry. It\u2019s Marketing, Pure and Simple Nike shoes and other products present a classic case study to learn from. Nike founder Philip Knight with his coach at University of Oregon are the masters of storytelling (and appealing to one\u2019s values). Phil started Nike because he was an athlete that wasn\u2019t happy with his track shoes. This became part of the marketing story of Nike. The coach and the athlete venture out to create a better product \u2013 from very humble beginnings. The story and the values are emerging. And so, the story continues with the evolution of the running shoe and how they were continually striving to make a better product for all athletes \u2013 see how the values and the story are intertwined. Up to this point they have never asked anyone to buy their shoes \u2013 they are just telling their story. Then Nike starts marketing its mission statement: Bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. If you have a body, you are an athlete. So now they are appealing to everyone, athletic or not. The perfect evolution of a marketing campaign. And they never directly pushed people to buy shoes. NEVER! Nike sells 120,000,000 shoes a year by accessing peoples\u2019 values, and they never directly ask you to buy their shoes. Nike tells stories from a \u201cvalue\u201d platform, and consequently sells shoes. OBJECTIVES The objective of this final section is to highlight how a policy brief can sit inside a wider conservation campaign and why a campaign is key to creating behaviour change Building a conservation campaign to amplify the message 62 PART 3 DEVELOPING THE POLICY BRIEF Policy and advocacy plan development for addressing a multi-faceted approach to addressing impacts from fisheries activities on biodiversity Imagine how this same approach can be applied to advocating a policy brief to decision makers, while appealing to the values of stakeholders whose behaviour is impacting the representative species that requires change/protection. A conservation campaign can be developed to complement and amplify the effects of a policy brief \u2013 whether through social media outlets, billboard advertising or PSAs.

The aim of the document The aim of this document is to analyse the Croatian legislation and management practices in order to propose recommendations focused on the preservation and sustainable use of the Posidonia ecosystems, and thus contribute to the integrated/integral management of the coastal zone in the protected areas and the Natura 2000 sites in Croatia, as well as to create a framework for the preservation of the entire Posidonia ecosystem (littoral zone). 1.3. The area of interest The Adriatic Sea and its coast is an area full of valuable but extremely sensitive natural resources of the Republic of Croatia, and it is necessary to establish an adequate system of governance, use, and protection. The processes that depend on the interaction of the sea and the land take place in this area where the developmental pressure and negative impact on natural ecosystems are the most prominent.

Posidonia beds (Posidonion oceanicae) (Natura code: 1120) Seagrass meadows of Posidonia oceanica are ecologically very important areas which play a major role in the littoral zone ecosystems in more ways than one: 1. they provide a habitat for different fauna and flora 2. they significantly reduce coastal erosion 3. many young specimens of fish and invertebrates live there 4. they alleviate climate change. The significance of these meadows is also realised through the absorption of the CO2 from the atmosphere, the production of oxygen, an increase in seawater transparency, a decrease in wave intensity and consequently the reduction of coastal erosion, the solidifying of sediment and a reduction of its movement, their significant role in the nutrient salt cycling (nitrates and phosphates) in the sea, as well as a bioindicator of the state of the sea and the accumulation of heavy metals. The Posidonia meadows are areas of the greatest / very high biodiversity due to rich primary production, and because many organisms feed on them, breed and find shelter in them. Besides, the dead parts of the Posidonia help create marine deposits on the shore and settle the gravel berm. Since they absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere, they help alleviate climate change, and they also have a significant potential for carbon sequestration using their own biomass but also by filtering small organic particles from the surrounding seawater. Globally, seagrass meadows are responsible for over 10 % of the sequestered carbon in the ocean, even though they cover only 0.2 % of the world sea floor. 6 Moreover, the Posidonia meadows have an important 'defence' function when it comes to beach erosion because their rhizome and roots strengthen the sediment, which stabilises the sea floor and prevents coastal erosion. Besides, by keeping the sediment in meadows, the sea floor becomes shallower so waves occur further from the shore, which additionally alleviates coastal erosion during storms. Seagrass also slows down the sea currents between the sea floor and its leaves. Recent studies have shown that the height of waves in areas covered in dense seagrass meadows is 10 to 20 % lower in comparison to a bare sea floor. The distribution of Posidonia beds in Croatia has shown that Posidonia meadows are more common and developed in the central and eastern Adriatic than in its northern part. Keeping in mind that Posidonia beds are found in infralittoral zones, the anthropogenic impact on them is unavoidable and often detrimental. In shallower areas, the most common negative impact on these seagrass beds is linked to physical damage (due to construction, anchoring, waves), while at greater depths negative impacts are caused by the changes in the characteristics/quality of the water and the sediment. In previous years, the reduction in Posidonia populations due to mechanical damage caused by trawls, anchoring, urbanisation (such as the construction of marinas and harbours, coast levelling etc.), as well as eutrophication connected to it (such as submarine outfalls of wastewater, backfilling, and fish and shellfish farms) were recorded in the western and the northern Mediterranean. After the network of Posidonia stems (rhizome) is damaged by anchoring, it becomes susceptible to erosion by waves.2 Although the process of re-growth after the cessation of the anthropogenic impact is very slow, recovery was recorded in the areas where this species is protected, which indicated that these exceptionally valuable habitats must be protected in due time. 2.2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1afdc3fa-1dc5-48d4-af54-fa48aa6d5e26": {"__data__": {"id_": "1afdc3fa-1dc5-48d4-af54-fa48aa6d5e26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Recommendations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a87de76cb5d3413c6cf3e04710696f35edd90df82b3377f6d43b632312b29cc7"}, "2": {"node_id": "305d87ce-0a9a-41ff-8cf9-5a79a9ecafb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2073d6fc1bab49d97069ba87a390f2e8a259bec719f59466e321a0160631a965"}}, "hash": "1ead1062479a7e407637ab0fe02049e63cde16ac219aa86246c0f21dd716dd0a", "text": "2.2.

Except for the presence of the Posidonia beds in the sea, important factors are also the coast orientation and its exposure to the winds which can develop great strength and duration, which create deposits. Whether the deposits will remain on the shore or not, and for how long, once again depends mostly on winds, i.e. on the exposure of the shore to the strongest waves, which lead to deposit erosion.3 Banquettes are thick Posidonia rhizome and leaf deposits, which provide an important habitat to some species of amphipod and isopod crustaceans and small polychaetes, and are classified as endangered habitats. There are not many bays with such habitats in Croatia.4 Dried parts of such deposits are carried 2 Study of the anchorages of Split-Dalmatia County (2019) 3 Action plan of the management of coasts with Posidonia deposits in the north-western part of Dugi Otok focusing on Sakarun beach 4 Bakran-Petricioli T.

Besides being the habitat of many amphipod and isopod species, the network of Posidonia rhizomes and leaves also protects the sediment from erosion. Posidonia deposits also contribute to beach geomorphology due to the participation of organisms in the construction of landforms, and they are no less important than the well-known habitats such as coral reefs. They form a flexible and effective marine energy absorption system, which is one of the best forms of coastal protection and natural erosion protection (image 2). Image 2 Formation and destruction of Posidonia deposits (Source: Mateo et al., 2003), with marine energy absorption and prevention of beach erosion When they are removed from the beach, the sediment within and under the deposits is also removed, which results in premature beach erosion, the destruction of nutritional soil occupied by land plants, and the disruption of the sea-land relationship in the ecosystem. 8 3. LEGISLATION 3.1. Legislation recognising Posidonia The importance of the Posidonia seagrass and its protection in the Republic of Croatia is recognised in the following laws and regulations: 3.1.1. Nature Protection Act5 This law states that nature is preserved by conserving biodiversity, landscape diversity and geological diversity, as well as through the protection of parts of nature, and every physical and legal person is under the obligation to do so. Article 153 of the Nature Protection Act prohibits the picking, cutting, felling, excavating, collecting or destroying the individuals of strictly protected plants, fungi, lichens and algae from nature in their natural distribution range. Additional prohibitions, such as the prohibition of mooring vessels, apply in protected areas and are regulated by Article 139 of the Nature Protection Act, which prohibits the anchoring and/or mooring of vessels outside of the areas determined by the spatial plan and the legislation of the state authority competent for inland navigation in the protected areas if said protected area is located within an inland waterway, as well as the mooring of vessels outside of the areas defined as harbours in the spatial plan if the protected area is located within the maritime domain.

GOOD PRACTICE EXAMPLES: As the expert background for the amendments and the adoption of the new Split-Dalmatia County spatial plan, a STUDY OF ANCHORAGES has been conducted10 based on navigation and meteorological characteristics, as well as technical, technological, transportation and maritime transportation characteristics, maritime safety measures, the habitat map of the Natura 2000 ecological network, the list of recorded strictly protected species, technical and technological anchoring methods and anchorage organisation. The study determines the spatial extent of the concession field of special function ports \u2013 anchorages, and the conditions that must be met by the investor in order to get the necessary permits and authorisations. Considering that more than 73% of the locations included in the study are located within the Natura 2000 ecological network area, special emphasis should be put on the use of the technical and technological solutions of ecologically sustainable anchorages adapted to different habitats within the Natura 2000 ecological network when creating type solutions for the anchorages in the Spatial Plan, i.e. during the creation of conceptual designs by investors. Repeated anchoring in nautical destinations damages the submarine landscape more than the durable ecologically acceptable anchoring systems recommended by this Study to be used when creating type solutions for anchorages. Also, having in mind the reality of climate change and its consequences on the coastal zone, such as the sea level rise and common flooding in coastal areas endangering the low waterfront, which represents the land part of the maritime domain, when creating/improving the maritime domain management mechanisms, it is especially important to take into consideration climate change accommodation measures. 10 Study of the anchorages of Split-Dalmatia County (2019) 12 RECOMMENDATIONS: Locations in which anchoring is permitted in the spatial plan must be determined based on the study defining the spatial extent of the concession field of the special function port \u2013 anchorage and investor conditions, which will be a condition for adopting/amending the new spatial plan.

Spatial planning of areas with special features (protected areas) Spatial plans of areas with special features must be created for national parks and nature parks according to the legislation on physical planning and nature conservation, as well as for the areas determined by the Spatial Development Strategy of the Republic of Croatia, or the County Spatial Plan. In Croatia, those spatial plans were adopted for all national parks and nature parks, as well as two significant landscapes.

GOOD PRACTICE EXAMPLES: Spatial plan of the special features area of the significant landscape Lower Kamenjak and the Medulin Archipelago Spatial plan of the special features area of the significant landscape \u017dut-Sit Archipelago 13 RECOMMENDATIONS: Adopt spatial plans for areas with special features for all protected maritime areas in order to protect the entire Posidonia ecosystem more thoroughly and in accordance with professional standards through measures of use, development and protection of these areas with priority activities. When planning anchorage locations in protected maritime areas and Natura 2000 sites, one of the conditions should be to conduct a study which will define the spatial extent of the concession field of the special function port \u2013 anchorage and investor conditions. Promoting the construction of eco-friendly permanent anchorages. The approach to maritime spatial planning must include planning with the ecosystem in mind and managing human activity which impacts the marine environment in an integral way, promoting conservation and sustainable use. 3.2. 2. Maritime Domain (maritime common good) and Seaports Act11 The maritime domain management system is of great importance for the conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment and coastal area, which includes the Posidonia ecosystem. This Act defines the maritime domain as a common good of particular interest for the Republic of Croatia which is under its special protection. Neither ownership nor any other rights in rem over the maritime domain can be acquired. The maritime common good falls outside of the domain of the legal transactions and the state has no ownership authority over it. The maritime common good comprises the internal waters and the territorial sea, its floor and underground areas, as well as the part of the land intended for general purpose by its nature, or having been declared as such, and everything permanently connected to this part of the land on its surface or under it. For this purpose, the term \u201cpart of land\u201d can denote the seashore, harbours, embankments, sandbanks, islets, reefs, beaches, river mouths of the rivers flowing into the sea, channels connected to the sea, and all animate and inanimate natural resources in the sea and under the sea floor.12 Beaches, as one of the key maritime domain elements, albeit mentioned, are neglected and marginalised, which affects decision-making and conduct in management, protection and beach planning practices. A new draft of the Act is in the making and should eliminate this shortcoming to a substantial extent. According to the Act, the land area of the maritime domain stretches to the \u201cline reached by the biggest waves during a storm, as well as the part of the land which is by its nature and purpose intended for the use of the sea, and which is at least 6 metres wide measuring 11 Official Gazette No 158/03, 38/09, 141/06, 56/16, 98/19 12 Article 3 of the Act, Official Gazette No 158/03, 100/04, 123/11, 141/06, 38/09 14 horizontally from the line of the mean high water level. Because of this definition, as well as the institutional and administrative framework of the Republic of Croatia, determining the borders of the maritime common good is a very complicated, slow and expensive process, so a border is yet to be determined for a significant part of the seashore. Moreover, the number of entities having a certain amount of authority over the maritime domain is substantial, and their relationships are unclear. This significantly aggravates the management of the maritime domain and it is necessary to adopt a clearer and simpler division of competence in this area. To establish an optimal maritime domain management system, the focus should be on reaching full integration of the maritime domain management systems into one coastal zone management system. With regard to the given subject, this can be achieved by allocating the authority over the maritime domain in protected maritime areas to public institutions managing the protected area in question, since this Act, as well as the associated institutional framework, is highly important for the definition of obligations and responsibilities related to the conservation of the posidionia ecosystem (littoral zone). RECOMMENDATIONS: Define a clearer and simpler division of competence in the maritime domain area. Allocate authority over the maritime domain in protected maritime areas and the Natura 2000 sites to public institutions responsible for the given protected area. 3.2.2.1. Concessions and concessionary approval The Maritime Domain Act makes a clear distinction between the terms \u201cconcession\u201d and \u201cconcessionary approval\u201d in its introductory part, in Article 2, when providing definitions of certain expressions used in the legal text.

In the same Article, in item 6, the Act defines concessionary approval as an act on the basis of which physical and legal persons are given the right to use the maritime domain in order to perform activities which do not preclude nor limit the use of the maritime domain for general purposes. Both institutions enable the maritime domain to be used for certain activities. Concession partly or completely excludes the general use of the maritime domain, while concessionary approval does not exclude it, nor limit it. Furthermore, a concession is given for special and economic purposes, while concessionary approval is given for maritime domain utilisation. The final difference between these terms is that a concession is given in accordance with the spatial planning documentation, whereas this 15 documentation is not necessary in order to obtain a concessionary approval. This is understandable when taking into consideration the type and the nature of activities for which a concessionary approval is given; further articles of the Act prescribe the grantor of the concession in protected areas: Maritime Domain and Seaports Act Article 7 A concession may be given to physical and legal persons for special or economic utilisation of a part of the maritime domain in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Act. A concessional approval may be given to physical and legal persons for the conduct of activities which do not preclude or limit the general use of the maritime domain. Special or economic use of the maritime domain may be permitted in accordance with the regulation on environmental and nature protection. Article 19 Special utilisation of the maritime domain: Only the Republic of Croatia shall grant concessions for economic use of the maritime domain in national parks, and in other protected natural areas, concession is granted by the competent authority referred to in Article 20 of this Act13, after obtaining the consent of the ministry responsible for nature protection. Legal persons managing national parks, strict nature reserves, or special reserves may be given the right to special use of the maritime domain by a special decision of the government of the Republic of Croatia. There are two more bylaws which regulate the granting of concessions and concessionary approvals in the maritime domain in more detail: 1. Regulation on granting concessions in the maritime domain14 2. Regulation on granting concessionary approval in the maritime domain15 Regulation on granting concessions in the maritime domain III. PROCEDURE OF GRANTING A SPECIAL-PURPOSE CONCESSION IN THE MARITIME DOMAIN Article 24 The government of the Republic of Croatia shall grant special-purpose concessions in the maritime domain for a maximum period of up to 99 years for structures of national importance, and preliminary procedures shall be conducted by the Ministry of the Sea, Tourism, Transport and Development. The county authority shall grant special-purpose concessions in the maritime domain for the maximum period of up to 20 years for structures of county importance, and the preliminary procedure shall be conducted by the competent county authority. The municipality or the city council shall grant special- purpose concessions in the maritime domain for the maximum period of up to 20 years for structures of local importance, and the preliminary procedure shall be conducted by the competent municipality or city authority. Article 25 A special-purpose concession shall be granted on the basis of a written application submitted to the competent authority for the concession procedure referred to in Article 24 of this Regulation. The regulation defines granting concessions in the maritime part of the Posidonia ecosystem, i.e. where nautical anchorages are most commonly located. The anchorages are often located within the seagrass distribution range because boaters and seagrass 13 The County Assembly, the City Council, and the Municipal Council 14 Official Gazette No 23/04, 101/04, 39/06, 63/08, 125/10, 102/11 and 83/12 15 Official Gazette No 36/04, 63/08, 133/13 and 63/14. 16 favour similar habitats \u2013 shallower areas with more moderate water movement and wave impact.16 Croatia has a great number of potential anchorages and refuges due to its indented coastline.

When it comes to permanent anchorages, countless examples in practice show that such interventions in nautical destinations can serve as a maritime habitat protection measure against repeated anchoring, especially regarding priority Posidonia meadows, with the application of certain technical-technological anchoring systems.17 GOOD PRACTICE EXAMPLES: On 24 January 2018, the government of the Republic of Croatia granted the \u201cKornati National Park\u201d Public Institution the special-purpose concession of the maritime domain for the period of 20 years for the purpose of installing and utilising an anchoring system at Kornati National Park. The total area of the maritime domain in concession is 415,358.79 m2 and includes 223 anchorages with the annual concession fee of HRK 1.00 per square metre of the occupied maritime domain area, i.e. HRK 415,358.79 per year. RECOMMENDATIONS: Enable granting special-purpose concessions of the maritime domain (anchorages), if possible free of charge, to public institutions governing protected maritime areas and/or Natura 2000 sites with target Posidonia habitats. If the public institution itself lacks the capacity for the implementation of the special- purpose concession of the maritime domain, another (simpler) way in which Posidonia ecosystem conservation could be supported is to earmark a portion of the proceeds from concessions and concessionary approvals in the protected areas / Natura 2000 sites within the maritime domain for the public institution, because at the moment the proceeds are not allocated to the authorities which are, according to the Nature Protection 16 Demers, M.A., Davis, A.R. & Knott, N.A. (2013) 17 Study of the anchorages of Split-Dalmatia County (2019) 17 Act, competent for managing such areas. The act prescribes that such revenues be divided between the local government units, the county, and the country in the following way: Maritime Domain and Seaports Act Article 12 Maritime domain management resources shall be as follows: 1. Proceeds from concession and concessionary approval fees. 2. Article 13 The contracted concession fee shall be paid in the following way: - One third to the state budget, - One third to the county budget, - And one third to the city or the municipality budget. The resources referred to in Article 12, paragraph 1, item 2 of this Act shall be the proceeds of the county budget, and resources from paragraph 1, item 3 shall be the proceeds of the state budget. The proceeds from concessionary approval fees shall go towards the city/municipal budget. Public institutions managing maritime protected areas, and especially county public institutions which manage a great number of Natura 2000 sites as well, lack financial and human resources so they are not able to fulfil their basic obligations in a professional manner. It is necessary to find a way to finance the conservation of the ecological network areas. One possible way would be to grant a portion of the proceeds from concession and concessionary approval fees to the public institution managing the protected area or the ecological network area in question. RECOMMENDATIONS: Amend the Maritime Domain and Seaports Act so that a portion of the proceeds from the concession and concessionary approval fees, if said concessions and concessionary approvals are granted in protected areas or Natura 2000 sites, is given in a certain amount to public institutions managing those areas. Granting concessionary approvals in protected areas is also regulated by the Ordinance on concessionary approvals in protected areas,18 but it will not be discussed in this document, since, according to Article 1, paragraph 4 of the ordinance, concessionary approval may not be granted within the maritime domain because it is covered by the aforementioned acts and regulations. According to the Regulation on granting concessionary approval in the maritime domain, regular maritime domain management includes the following: care for the protection and maintenance of the maritime domain in general use, which is done in accordance with the Maritime domain management plan which this falls under the responsibility of local government units (cities/municipalities). This plan also defines the list of activities which may be performed and the exact location where concessionary approval can be given.

Regulation on granting concessionary approval in the maritime domain Article 8 When dealing with requests, the Council shall determine if the request is in compliance with the annual maritime domain management plan referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1 of this Regulation. The Council shall request, ex officio, the consent of the competent Harbour Master's Office regarding the safety of navigation for activities using resources specified in the Single List of Activities on the Maritime Domain. If the Council determines that the request does not comply with the annual maritime domain management plan referred to in Article 5, paragraph 1 of this Regulation, or if the Harbour Master's Office does not provide consent referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, the Council shall reject the request for concessionary approval. By way of derogation, if the approval is granted for a period longer than 1 (one) calendar year, and the activity in question requires a microlocation within the maritime domain, the Council shall first obtain a special certificate of the competent county authority which confirms that the concession procedure will not be initiated during the concessionary approval period. The applicant shall be required by the Council to pay a determined amount as a concessionary approval fee, if the Council deems their request to be in compliance with the annual maritime domain management plan, according to paragraph 1 of this Article, and if the competent Harbour Master's Office issues the consent referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, and, in the case defined in paragraph 4 of this Article, after receiving special authorisation from the competent county authority. If the concessionary approval request refers to specially protected locations of natural value in the maritime domain, the Council may grant the approval having obtained the consent of the ministry responsible for nature conservation. According to the aforementioned article, the Ministry may, but is not required to, seek an opinion from the public institution managing the protected area where concessionary approval is requested. It is hereby clear that public institutions for nature conservation managing the areas in question are not parties in the concessionary approval granting procedure. The competent bodies consult them only if needed. RECOMMENDATIONS: Prescribe by law that the opinion of the institution managing the maritime protected area or the Natura 2000 sites is obligatory during the concessionary approval granting procedures in the areas the institution manages. 19 The Maritime Code is also an important law with regard to the Posidonia ecosystem. 3.2.3. Maritime Code19 The Maritime Code, among else, prescribes measures for pollution prevention, as well as procedures in the case that pollution occurs. Article 24 (1) The Minister may within the internal waters and in the territorial sea of the Republic of Croatia determine and prescribe compulsory navigable waterways or traffic separation schemes, vessel communication systems as well as the procedure for managing maritime traffic for reasons of safety of navigation for all or for certain kinds of waterborne craft. (2) For the purposes of safety of navigation, protection of the sea from pollution, preventing the endangerment of biological and landscape diversity, as well as to decrease the danger of more serious maritime accidents, the Minister may ban navigation in certain parts of the internal waters or the territorial sea, either for vessels of certain type or size or for vessels transporting certain types of cargo (3) The navigable waterways and traffic separation schemes referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be established in the specially protected nature areas with the consent of the ministry in charge of environmental protection. (4) Waterways, traffic separation schemes and ship reporting systems referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall be indicated in the official navigational charts published by the Hydrographic Institute of the Republic of Croatia and published in the \u201cNotice to Mariners\u201d. RECOMMENDATIONS: Determine traffic separation schemes in bigger areas where Posidonia meadows have already been recognised as endangered, or there is a real risk of this happening. Article 49(b) (5) It is prohibited to release or discard solid or liquid waste, oily water, faeces, or cargo residue from crafts, as well as all other substances which pollute the sea, air or the coast into the sea or onto the seashore.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Develop the capacities of competent authorities (governing authorities, maritime administration, inspectorate, maritime police force) for the purpose of efficient supervision and control of maritime activities. Increase supervision and inspections in order to control the pollution caused by the discharge of waste from ships over Posidonia meadows. 3.2.4. Marine Fisheries Act20 This Act prescribes fines if seines are towed over Posidonia meadows. Article 85 (1) Legal persons shall be fined with a HRK 5000.00 to 30,000.00 fine for an offence in the following cases: 1. If they perform fishing activities with trawls, dredges, purse seines, seines, shore seines or similar nets over the sea floor covered in seagrass, in particular Posidonia oceanica or other marine spermatophytes contrary to Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006. Even though the law prescribes fines for trawling nets over Posidonia meadows, this is difficult to control due to the insufficient financial and human resources of the competent authorities. RECOMMENDATIONS: Develop the capacities of competent authorities (governing authorities, fisheries inspectorate, maritime police force) for the purpose of efficient supervision and control of fishing activities. Except for the aforementioned acts and regulations, there are two more acts concerning the littoral zone important for the conservation of the posidionia ecosystem: 3.2. 5.

Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) The coastal zone is shaped by the mutual action of land, sea and atmosphere, which makes it dynamic and susceptible to change. Integrated Coastal Zone Management is a dynamic process of sustainable management and use of coastal zones, which at the same time takes into consideration the fragility of coastal ecosystems and landscapes, the diversity of activities and utilisation possibilities, their mutual action, the maritime focus of certain activities and utilisation possibilities, and their impact on sea and land parts of the area. The document which recognises the need for integrated coastal zone management is the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean. Within the framework of the Mediterranean action plan of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP/MAP), the contracting parties of the Barcelona convention signed the 22 Protocol in Madrid in 2008, which came into force in March 2011. The aim of the Protocol was to establish a common framework of integrated coastal zone management in the Mediterranean and to undertake necessary measures in order to strengthen international cooperation. The Republic of Croatia ratified the Protocol in 2012 by adopting the Act on the Ratification of the Protocol on Integrated Coastal Zone Management in the Mediterranean.22 One of the countries\u2019 obligations is to draft national ICZM strategies. With this in mind, Croatia started the drafting of this strategy, which will, along with the \u201cmarine strategy\u201d, which is drafted pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act, be integrated into the Strategy for the Management of the Marine Environment and the coastal zone. The Protocol sets the legal framework for integrated coastal zone management as well. By adopting the Act on the Ratification of the Protocol, the Republic of Croatia also defined the land scope of the coastal zone, as well as all local administrative areas that border the sea. On the sea, the scope is defined by the territorial sea border. Even though ICZM is a good tool for the conservation of coastal ecosystems, the existing Croatian legislation does not provide for the drafting of coastal management plans which would in our case include the entire Posidonia ecosystem. The Republic of Croatia signed and ratified the aforementioned Protocol which provides for the drafting of such plans, but their implementation is not legislative. ICZM provides plans which provide guidelines and recommendations which can be integrated into other plans, such as, for example, county spatial plans, municipal plans, etc. 22 Official Gazette No 8/12 23 4. PROTECTED AREAS AND NATURA 2000 SITES IN THE REPUBLIC OF CROATIA A protected area is a geographically clearly defined area with the intended purpose of nature protection, which is managed for the purpose of long-term conservation of nature and other accompanying ecological services. It is defined by the Nature Protection Act,23 which is at the same time the basic legal act used to prescribe regulations on the protection of natural values in the Republic of Croatia. Activities of nature protection in Croatia include preserving biodiversity, geodiversity and landscape diversity, and by protecting parts of nature, which include the following: 1. protected areas, 2. protected species, 3. protected minerals and fossils. 4.1 Protected areas in the Republic of Croatia The Croatian law on nature protection recognises nine different protection categories depending on basic values intended to be preserved. They include the following: 1. strict nature reserve 2. national park 3. special reserve 4. nature park 5. regional park 6. natural monument 7. significant landscape 8. forest park 9. monument of park architecture area of national importance area of local importance National parks and nature parks are managed by public institutions within the competence of the ministry responsible for nature protection (currently The Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development), and other areas are managed by county public institutions in the county territory. There is a total of 410 protected areas in Croatia24 (image 3), with 17 including the coastal zone and the sea. They include three national parks: Brijuni, Kornati, and Mljet, and two nature parks: Tela\u0161\u0107ica and Lastovo Islands, two marine special reserves: Mali Ston Bay and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3f1fccf-251f-40f9-8d83-b714ba8ea20d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3f1fccf-251f-40f9-8d83-b714ba8ea20d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Recommendations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "101c78f4dfafdc68b0b8a55047f2e8d1431bf6e859ec8021b4d93239e9a3cafd"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cfb5254-7845-4db8-80d9-bcdb94bc0464", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d1f4340e8e5ea963c91b1d97e0c5ef1d184e36a030e8ed06a2e3d7e27dbe4b8"}}, "hash": "3d0844a1eac330aa44e0e464d46b812a3b542da5ec87be8f7355697ad82315b1", "text": "Malo More as well as Lim Bay; four special reserves: botanical \u2013 Prvi\u0107 island with coastal waters and Grgur Channel, ornithological \u2013 the south-eastern part of the Neretva River Delta, Pantan by Trogir, palaeontological \u2013 Datule and Barbariga; three significant landscapes: Luka Channel (by \u0160ibenik), \u017dut-Sit Archipelago, Zavratnica; two geomorphological natural monuments: the Blue Grotto and the Medvidina \u0160pilja cave on Bi\u0161evo.

The competent authority in protected areas of national importance (strict and special reserve, national park and nature park) is not the institution which manages the protected area in question, instead, the permission is issued by MINESD, and for protected areas of local importance, the competent authority is the competent county department. Beaches are specific because they are protected as significant parts of nature due to their extraordinary valuable natural characteristics. For example, such beaches are Sakarun (Dugi Otok island), Saplunara (Mljet island), and Prapratna (Pelje\u0161ac island \u2013 significant landscapes), Stiniva and Zlatni Rat \u2013 natural monuments, the Neretva River Delta \u2013 ichthyological and ornithological reserve, etc. The county PIs manage those beaches (except for Saplunara, which is managed by Mljet National Park as of 2018). However, those institutions most commonly lack financial and human resources and they cannot implement the measures necessary for the management of such nature parts in their entirety. There is also the aforementioned problem of competence overlapping when it comes to the management of beach areas which are a part of the maritime domain. This results in a situation where public institutions are responsible for such areas, but they are not the competent authority. Image 2 Representation of protected areas in the Republic of Croatia (Source: Database, MINESD, 2022 strict nature reserve national park special reserve nature park regional park natural monument significant landscape forest park monument of park architecture 25 One of the ways to protect and preserve nature would certainly be to implement surveillance carried out by the wildlife officers of the public institution managing the protected area. Without them the nature protection system would not be complete, because they carry out direct surveillance as authorised by the Nature Protection Act and the Ordinance on the manner of work and conduct of wildlife officers.26 The challenges often encountered by the public institutions managing the areas include insufficient legislative framework regarding the procedure, and lack of clear instructions and authority necessary for efficient wildlife officers' conduct, especially in the Natura 2000 sites. Although the Act and the Ordinance in question prescribe certain competence and conduct of wildlife officers, they are not wide nor restrictive enough to ensure efficient protection. One of the ways would be to create institutional and material conditions for wildlife officers within the framework of the police, but such systemic changes are quite challenging. RECOMMENDATIONS: Include provisions for cases of non-compliance with the management plans as infringement in the Nature Protection Act. Develop the capacities and the authority of wildlife officers for the purposes of efficient supervision and control of activities in protected areas and Natura 2000 sites. 26 Official Gazette No 35/2021 26 4.2 Ecological network of the Republic of Croatia The ecological network (Natura 2000 sites) of the Republic of Croatia was defined by the Regulation on the ecological network and the competence of public institutions for the management of ecological network areas27; it encompasses 36.67 % of the land territory and 16,26 % of the coastal sea (image 4).28 Image 4 Natura 2000 sites in Croatia (Source: Database, MINESD, 2022) Even though social and economic activities are not prohibited in the Natura 2000 sites, EU member states must guarantee that the condition of the area will not worsen and that they will undertake all conservation measures necessary to conserve the protected species and habitats in good condition, or to return them to such condition.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cfb5254-7845-4db8-80d9-bcdb94bc0464": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cfb5254-7845-4db8-80d9-bcdb94bc0464", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Recommendations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "101c78f4dfafdc68b0b8a55047f2e8d1431bf6e859ec8021b4d93239e9a3cafd"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3f1fccf-251f-40f9-8d83-b714ba8ea20d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d0844a1eac330aa44e0e464d46b812a3b542da5ec87be8f7355697ad82315b1"}}, "hash": "0d1f4340e8e5ea963c91b1d97e0c5ef1d184e36a030e8ed06a2e3d7e27dbe4b8", "text": "According to the Nature Protection Act and the Regulation, the competent authorities for the management of the Natura 2000 sites are the public institutions responsible for the management of national parks and natural parks, as well as institutions managing other protected areas and/or other protected parts of nature founded by counties / local government units.

The basic method of Natura 2000 sites management is implementing conservation measures for target species and habitat types, which are integrated into the management plan, as well as sector plans of natural resources management. In accordance with the provisions of Directive 92/43/EEC on habitats, the European Union members must adopt conservation goals and measures for such areas within six years in order to ensure the favourable conservation status of target species and habitat types in the Natura 2000 sites, as well as to preserve its integrity. This important six-year deadline for Croatia ended on December 4 2020. Croatia adopted conservation goals and measures in conservation areas important for birds, but for species and habitat types which include Posidonia meadows, ordinances are yet to be adopted. The EU project \u201cDevelopment of management framework for the Natura 2000 sites\u201d is currently being implemented in Croatia, with the aim of drafting management plans for 40 % of the Natura 2000 sites. The project beneficiary is MINESD, Department for Nature Conservation, the project partner is the State Institute for Nature Protection, while public institutions are collaborators on the project. RECOMMENDATIONS: Include conservation measures for the entire Posidonia ecosystem (littoral zone) in the conservation measures related to 1120 Posidonia beds, which form a constituent part of the Ordinance on conservation goals and measures. Another bylaw resulting from the Regulation is the Regulation on assessment of the acceptability for the ecological network, according to which all interventions (as well as plans and programmes) conducted on the Natura 2000 sites, and thus in the sea as well, which by themselves or in combination with other interventions may have a negative impact on the conservation goal and the Natura 2000 ecological network integrity, must undergo an acceptability assessment procedure for the ecological network. In this procedure, a competent authority assesses if the negative impact on the Natura 2000 ecological network can be prevented. If it can, the intervention may continue with the regular permission obtaining procedure. If it is not possible, the investor must conduct a Study on the assessment of the acceptability of the intervention for the ecological network (a constituent part of the Main Assessment Application) in which the possible adverse effects will be analysed more thoroughly and the investor will try to find alternative solutions and protection measures which may alleviate the effects. The Study on the assessment of the acceptability of the intervention for the Natura 2000 ecological network will be assessed by the Department for Nature Conservation at the State Institute for Nature Protection, however, the competent authority alone makes the decision if such an intervention is acceptable for the ecological network, i.e. a positive opinion of the Institute is non-binding for the competent authority when making a decision. It is 28 important to highlight that during the acceptability assessment procedure for the Natura 2000 ecological network not only the impact of a single intervention of anchorage installation is assessed, but the cumulative impact of all operations which can affect an 28ecological network site. The possibility of a significant adverse effect can only be determined by implementing the acceptability assessment procedure for the ecological network. The intervention within the Natura 2000 sites which must be most thoroughly discussed in this document is the construction of anchorages (special-purpose ports) because it has the greatest impact on Posidonia meadows. 4.2.1. Anchorages in protected areas and Natura 2000 sites Marine (and land) protected areas attract tourists, and especially boaters, due to their natural, aesthetic and cultural attractions. The Posidonia ecosystem (the littoral zone) is the most endangered in the locations directly susceptible to human activities, such as: - anchoring - excessive and unsustainable tourism - congestion and increased opacity due to construction material for backfilling and construction of structures on the coast - eutrophication and other pollution types - illegal fishing activities using bottom-trawling equipment - invasive species distribution - presence of rubbish and large waste, sea pollution (plastic bags, styrofoam) - temperature changes (e.g. temperature increase and extreme events) 29 This document does not address the solution to all of the threats to the Posidonia ecosystem, rather, it focuses on the priority threats which can be alleviated by these recommendations \u2013 anchoring and beach activities which include alluvium. From the position of the regulatory framework, for the purposes of sustainable tourism, it is necessary to consider the issuing of nautical permits with a daily maximum according to the load capacity of the area and the prohibition of free anchoring with provided alternatives,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1c725b4-d343-4dd1-b174-7c18a0fc236f": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1c725b4-d343-4dd1-b174-7c18a0fc236f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Recommendations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7a45e22046ed075f0f83af326e3f1b980327f2678989c38b72df900c4d99895"}}, "hash": "b7a45e22046ed075f0f83af326e3f1b980327f2678989c38b72df900c4d99895", "text": "i.e. eco-friendly anchorages. In the context of sea conservation, we can distinguish two anchorage categories: temporary and permanent. Permanent anchorages refer to special-purpose ports \u2013 anchorages which cannot be moved simply and quickly. Temporary anchorages mostly refer to boat anchors, which have a significant impact on Posidonia meadows; therefore, they are often emphasised as the cause of meadow condition deterioration. Experiments on anchor impacts on seagrass meadows have shown that during one anchoring manoeuvre 34 shoots are destroyed, especially if population density is low and if rhizomes are greatly denuded.30 There are many examples in practice which prove that permanent eco-friendly anchorage systems protect the sea floor from devastation resulting from repeated boat anchoring, and it is, therefore, necessary to install permanent, eco-friendly anchorages where possible. Total prohibition of anchoring is 29 Study of the anchorages of Split-Dalmatia County (2019) 30 Francour, P., Ganteaume, A., Poulain, M. (1999) Effects of boat anchoring in Posidonia oceanica seagrass beds in the Port-Cros National Park (north-west Mediterranean Sea). Aquatic Conservation 9, 391-400. 29 difficult to implement in practice. This is why permanent anchoring must be done according to the rules of the profession, keeping the space and the capacity of the concession area in mind. It is certainly vital to adopt management plans as soon as possible, as well as to prescribe conservation measures in order to reach a consensus on the impact of anchorage development for the purposes of long-term conservation of target marine habitats. This would also shorten and simplify the acceptability assessment procedure for the Natura 2000 ecological network sites. The basic intended use of the anchoring systems should be to realise a simple and safe way to anchor vessels, even for less experienced boaters. Additionally, installing anchoring systems reduces the need to use one\u2019s own anchor for anchoring, which ensures greater protection and conservation of the sea floor, but also introduces an anchorage surveillance method. By applying modern electronic and information technologies (for example smart buoys) it is possible to further increase all of the advantages of the installation of organised anchorages from the standpoint of safety and simplicity of use, as well as simplified surveillance and protection. The utilisation of additional possibilities of modern electronic and information technology enables these systems to be used for collecting data, which can be used for different analyses, such as anchorage load capacity, boaters\u2019 patterns of behaviour, planning and optimisation of anchoring systems, and other scientific and other purposes. It is important to notice that concessions of the maritime domain for anchorages within protected marine areas and ecological network areas are granted by the county assembly. Public nature conservation institutions cannot submit a concession application for economic purposes granted for anchorages if they are not registered as economic operators, instead, they can only apply for the special-purpose concession which is rarely granted in practice. Also, the proceeds from the maritime domain area under concession within the Natura 2000 sites are not allocated to the bodies which manage these areas but are divided among local self-government units, the county and the state, according to the Nature Protection Act and the Regulation on the ecological network (see page 16). Public institutions for nature conservation are not the parties in the maritime domain concession procedure or the acceptability assessment procedure for the Natura 2000 sites. The competent bodies consult them only if needed, depending on interest and personal relationships, even though the public institutions know the area in question best and are legally designated to manage those areas. The habitat and species conservation objectives of the Natura 2000 network cannot be fulfilled if the legislative framework does not provide for the mechanisms which will enable public institutions to actively contribute to the conservation of the Natura 2000 site and to obtain sufficient financial resources for the conduct of their activities, which primarily include the supervision of anchorage development projects and the monitoring of target habitats during anchorage operation with the possibility to act in the case of non-compliance with the conditions prescribed by the competent authorities. In order to ensure temporary mooring, recreational crafts prefer to anchor in seagrass meadows rather than on other sea floors. Anchoring, in addition to trawling, is emphasised as one of the mechanical impacts which damage Posidonia, which is one of the reasons why all of the complainants of the anchorage installation initiative within the Natura 2000 network must undergo the aforementioned acceptability assessment procedure for the ecological network.

RECOMMENDATIONS: Allocate anchorages in ports which are located within marine protected areas and Natura 2000 sites to public institutions under the special-purpose concession model. RECOMMENDATIONS: Anchoring: - instead of dropping anchor, when possible other mooring methods should be used, which include permanent permitted anchorages designed based on expert studies. - define zones where anchoring is prohibited in sensitive Posidonia meadow habitats - regulate anchoring in a way that it is permitted only on soft (sand) sea floor with a limited number of vessels and anchoring duration - determine areas which allow vessels to anchor safely without the need for port construction, and where only eco-friendly anchoring systems are permitted which do not impact Posidonia meadows - use smart buoy systems where possible. Allow entrance into marine protected areas and Natura 2000 sites only to vessels equipped with tanks which do not discard wastewater into the sea. Limit the number of vessels which may enter the protected marine area by issuing a limited number of day tickets according to the assessed load-bearing capacity of the area. Promote the use of eco-friendly anti-fouling products and cleaning products. 31 4.3 Management plans Protected areas of national importance and Natura 2000 sites in these areas are managed by national park and nature park public institutions. Other protected areas of local importance and Natura 2000 sites in county areas are governed by county public institutions for management of protected areas. The management of protected areas includes the adoption of a management plan which defines the conservation goals, activities implemented to achieve management goals and efficient management indicators. Unfortunately, these plans fall into the category of indicative plans, i.e. non- legislative plans which provide guidelines on how to manage a certain problem. The only article in the Nature Protection Act that to an extent helps to strengthen management plans is Article 139, which states that legal and physical persons who operate in a protected area are required to follow the management plan, but there are no penalties if they fail to do so. Nature Protection Act Management plan Article 138 (1) Protected areas shall be managed according to the management plan. (2) The management plan shall be adopted for a period of ten years, with the possibility of amendment after five years. (3) The management plan shall determine the following: - management objectives, - activities implemented in order to fulfil management objectives, - management efficiency indicators. (4) The contents of the management plan, the procedure of its adoption and/or amendment shall be further regulated by the minister with an ordinance. (5) Legal and physical persons operating in a protected area are obliged to adhere to the management plan. (6) Public institutions are obliged to make available the draft of the management plan to the public in accordance with the special regulation on environmental protection. (7) The management plan of cross-border protected areas shall be determined in agreement with the competent authority of the cross-border part of the protected area. (8) The management plan may include more protected areas within the competence of one public institution. (9) The management plan of the protected area proclaimed by the Government and the representing body of the local (regional) self-government unit, and extending over more than one unit of local (regional) self-government, shall be jointly adopted by the governing councils of public institutions that manage it. Prohibited actions Article 139 (1) In protected areas, the following activities are prohibited in particular: - anchoring and/or mooring vessels outside of the places determined by the spatial plan and the legislation of the state authority competent for inland navigation in the protected areas, if said protected area is located within an inland waterway, - mooring vessels outside of the areas defined as harbours in the spatial plan if the protected area is located within the maritime domain. The way to strengthen the management plan and the authority of wildlife officers is to include provisions in case of non-compliance with the management plans in the Nature Protection Act, since without it, the plan is non-legislative, which brings into question the legal implementation of the ecological network at sea. 32 RECOMMENDATIONS: Include provisions for cases of non-compliance with the management plans in the Nature Protection Act Through the implementation of the aforementioned project \u201cDevelopment of management framework for the Natura 2000 sites\u201d31 the management plans for 40 % of the Natura 2000 sites in Croatia are currently being drafted since management plans are yet to be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "71ea74b5-ab54-45e5-9c03-60e7a4ab77d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "71ea74b5-ab54-45e5-9c03-60e7a4ab77d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Recommendations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "137bb24786f54fb1a93a3f5fcfdfbfbabc3e06a5347d3cdefe3abd57d5d80a06"}, "3": {"node_id": "60e8ee72-446b-4ff8-afc0-65ad16a4abcf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9b291e4a919474d334839c54423a06211edf00412454c35baa5568229c5f4e8"}}, "hash": "346b908bd4cb8cf4676a5959f45e1a896fd9764873363fa711902d102e7ece3b", "text": "adopted for almost all Natura 2000 sites including the Ordinance on the measures on target species and habitats conservation.

This represents a significant problem in the context of the conservation of marine habitats and the adoption of management plans. 4.4. Significant landscape North-western part of Dugi Otok and the Sakarun Bay Natura 2000 site In Zadar County, the protected areas of local importance, as well as Natura 2000 sites are managed by \u201cNatura-Jadera\u201d, the county public institution for management of protected areas in Zadar County, in compliance with the Nature Protection Act and the Regulation on the ecological network. The protected area which includes Sakarun beach (image 5) belongs to the category of significant landscape, and by the beach is the Natura 2000 site Sakarun Bay (HR 3000069) spreading over 438.55 hectares. The target priority habitats in this area are 1120 Posidonia meadows, 1110 sand sea floors permanently covered by the sea and 1170 reefs. 31 https://mingor.gov.hr/o-ministarstvu-1065/djelokrug/uprava-za-zastitu-prirode-1180/ekoloska- mreza-natura-2000/projekt-razvoj-okvira-za-upravljanje-ekoloskom-mrezom-natura-2000/5990 33 Image 5: Croatian map indicating the location of the North-western part of Dugi Otok and the Sakarun beach protected area According to the Nature Protection Act, the category of a significant landscape refers to a natural or a cultivated area of a significant landscape value and biodiversity and/or geodiversity, or a landscape with preserved unique features typical for a certain area. The category of significant landscape permits interventions and activities which do not damage those features which characterise it as a significant landscape. Nature Protection Act Article 118 (1) A significant landscape is a natural or a cultivated area of a significant landscape value and biodiversity and/or geodiversity, or a landscape with preserved unique features typical for a certain area. (2) The category of significant landscape permits interventions and activities which do not damage those features which characterise it as a significant landscape. What makes Sakarun beach even more special is the origin of its sand. Namely, on most Croatian sand beaches, sand is created as a result of coastal rock wear, while at Sakarun beach, the sand mostly consists of marine biogenic carbonate. Since Sakarun beach is precisely one of the characteristics because of which the area is protected, it means that all interventions threatening its existence are prohibited there, which, according to the latest scientific studies, includes removing the Posidonia deposits. Sakarun beach is a favourable location for the occurrence of Posidonia deposits because of its orientation, configuration and the position of the coast and the sea floor, as well as the large surfaces of Posidonia beds nearby. 34 Image 6 Map of Posidonia seagrass meadows near Sakarun beach Source: Exploration of Posidonia oceanica in Sakarun Bay, Zadar County, 2017, Expert Report, Society of Marine Researchers \u2013 20,000 Miles, Zadar According to Pikelj (2021), the thickest Posidonia deposits occur in the beach face area. In the autumn, the beach relatively quickly loses its volume, and this negative trend continues during the winter. The type and the size of waves have the largest impact on the banquette size. The waves mix the sand and the pebbles with the banquettes, creating a berm where plant communities grow and strengthen the beach with their roots. The stabilisation and an increase in volume start to occur immediately before the tourist season, mostly in May. This is when the Posidonia banquette is most often removed as part of the preparations for the tourist season, which removes a significant amount of sediment as well. Research has shown that by removing 1560 m3 of Posidonia, 99,840 kg, i.e.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60e8ee72-446b-4ff8-afc0-65ad16a4abcf": {"__data__": {"id_": "60e8ee72-446b-4ff8-afc0-65ad16a4abcf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Recommendations", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "137bb24786f54fb1a93a3f5fcfdfbfbabc3e06a5347d3cdefe3abd57d5d80a06"}, "2": {"node_id": "71ea74b5-ab54-45e5-9c03-60e7a4ab77d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/recommendations", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "346b908bd4cb8cf4676a5959f45e1a896fd9764873363fa711902d102e7ece3b"}}, "hash": "d9b291e4a919474d334839c54423a06211edf00412454c35baa5568229c5f4e8", "text": "37 m3 of sediment is removed as well (if the average weight of sediment per 1 m3 of Posidonia is 64 kg), which can amount to 37 m3 annually, while at the same time only 14 m3 of sediment is deposited.

Define that Posidonia alluvium should be cleaned from anthropogenic waste by hand. Monitor illegal operations of sand and pebble removal from Sakarun beach. Advocate for Sakarun beach to gain the status of a natural beach according to the Regulation on the development and protection of protected coastal zones. Advocate for the inclusion of measures which preserve the whole Posidonia ecosystem in the Regional programme of development and management of marine beaches. Determine the reception capacity of Sakarun beach taking into consideration the necessity that the Posidonia deposits remain at the beach. Sakarun Bay is a spacious bay (approx. 80 hectares) mostly up to 10 m deep. The sea floor is rich in Posidonia oceanica meadows. The sea at the beach is of the highest quality, but because it is exposed to winds and currents (especially during winter), high deposits of different rubbish can be found there. Thanks to the efforts of the Natura Jadera PI the beach is cleaned regularly. The beach is also an attractive destination for boaters and in 2009, the PI was granted a concession for the period of five years to install an anchorage on 7,200 square metres in order to reduce the adverse effects of boaters (anchoring) on the environment, and especially Posidonia meadows.32 Unfortunately, after the concession period, the County carried out a public tendering procedure, and the PI was not chosen. 32 Sustainable management of the beaches in the Republic of Croatia \u2013 guidelines and priority actions 36 MP RECOMMENDATIONS / sea Advocate for the public institution to be granted a special-purpose concession for anchoring in Sakarun Bay. Prohibit boat anchor dropping in Sakarun Bay. Advocate for the implementation of eco-friendly anchors and mooring methods which have minimal impact on marine habitats. Recommend the removal of concrete blocks from Sakarun Bay before installing new, eco-friendly anchorages. 37 6. CONCLUSIONS The Posidonia ecosystem (the littoral zone) is the most endangered in the locations directly susceptible to human activities, such as: anchoring, illegal fishing activities using bottom-trawling equipment, excessive tourism \u2013 the most common cause of banquette deterioration, sea pollution, and the presence of rubbish and large waste on the coast. All of those threats to the ecosystem can be alleviated by prescribing conservation measures formulated and controlled by competent authorities which should be followed by all of the beneficiaries of this area, and, above all, by raising awareness of the sea and beach conservation efforts (and nature in general) in the local community, but with visitors as well. Considering the extremely high pressure of tourism, the land and the sea should be viewed as a whole. The recommendations for the efficient coastal zone management which encompasses the entire Posidonia ecosystem are primarily concerned with amendments to the legislation which would result in the development of capacities and authority of the public institutions managing those areas (national, regional and local), which operate in those areas and are responsible for it, within their jurisdiction. Keeping in mind the significance of protected marine and coastal zone management, it is important to clearly determine authority over maritime domain (maritime common good ) of protected areas, alongside capacity building. Namely, public institutions managing protected areas and Natura 2000 sites in practice have almost no jurisdiction over the marine part of these areas. This applies especially to public institutions managing the areas of county and local importance. As the first step in this integration, public institutions could be granted the right to manage the maritime domain within the boundaries of the protected area they manage. This would enable them to view the area and the entire Posidonia ecosystem as a whole (littoral zone). The main obstacle when it comes to integration and coordination of institutions is most commonly the fragmented division of responsibilities, as well as fragmented sources and allocation of resources. Institutions and their resources are limited to narrow objectives, different deadlines and limited human resources, which results in the implementation of conservation measures in only one aspect of their scope of action. Although this may seem small, this often represents an insurmountable obstacle to public institutions managing protected areas and Natura 2000 network sites.

Except for the cooperation of different sectors operating in the same area, in order to alleviate the barrier of institutional jurisdiction, one of the solutions would be to enable integrated management of the land and the sea parts of the coastal zone. This functional connection between the land and the sea part should most importantly be recognised on a national, county and local level in order to prevent the partial implementation of measures, as well as to ensure making decisions which lead to the sustainable development of the entire coastal and marine area. In addition, since the largest adverse effects of climate change are expected in the narrow 38 coastal zone and at the very coastline, where the problem of institutional jurisdiction is most prominent, integrated management of land and sea will be of great importance. We are aware that climate change is happening, and we know that there is an increase in variability and the mean sea level. Science will help to get increasingly precise values of the changes before us, but decisions should be made today. Except for the cooperation of institutions, the cooperation of science and politics, and business and civil sectors is no less important and requires additional efforts. Adjustment to climate change and its integration in development and other plans is a subject which should be included into management plans of protected areas and the practices of other sectors, especially spatial and development planning. Measures to alleviate climate change should be included in such plans. The measures should concern the quality of the constructed environment, the conservation of natural values, the measures of rational use of the coastal zone and the strengthening of the spatial planning systems and nature conservation systems. Nature conservation is no longer concerned only with the preservation of areas, species, habitats or geodiversity, but the survival of humans as a species as well. Nature and ecosystems in good condition are the basis for ensuring ecosystem services necessary for a better quality of human life and economic growth. Posidonia ecosystem conservation offers many known benefits, but its protection is mostly motivated by its importance for the marine biodiversity, and not its entire role, which also includes the preservation of the coast (primarily from erosion). The improvement of knowledge on the role of Posidonia in the protection of the coast and the role of the entire ecosystem, and not only its marine part, presents a new challenge for local, regional and national governments responsible for the conservation of nature, sea and coast. 39 7.
