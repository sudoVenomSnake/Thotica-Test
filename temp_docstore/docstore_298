UNDP strives to use opportunities by negotiating with countries to share resources and technical expertise made available to LDC and/or SIDS countries by UN agencies and funds. In this case, UNDP CO in Samoa negotiated the participation of Niue\u2019s POPs Team to the upcoming UNITAR training for the development of POPs National Implementation Plans (NIP). In addition, the Technical Cooperation between Developing Countries (TCDC) fund by UNDP and donors provided the opportunity for practical attachments by Policy Analyst and Planners for the Governments of Niue and Cook Islands to exchange valuable knowledge between countries experience in national planning, aid coordination and resource allocation as a viable means to advance MDG achievements.

Brief Description: Why. The project is exhibited as a \u2018Good Practice\u2019 since it managed to build from the scratch the Government\u2019s capacity to coordinate an aid \ufb02ow for the reconstruction of the war torn country and to develop the national budget process as the central coordination mechanism of the government. What. The following key products de\ufb01ne the project as the \u2018Good practice\u2019: 1. Donors Assistance Database (DAD). A Government owned and led aid coordination system used by international, national and sub-national partners in the reconstruction process; 2. A Uni\ufb01ed National Budget founded on principles of transparency and accountability, emerged from combination of ordinary and development budgets; 3. A national team running grants and loans management and portfolio monitoring and providing professional leadership and support to the Government and its partners; 4. The National Development Framework and the Consultative Group mechanisms established for promoting a consultative process of the Government Programmes\u2019 development and implementation, and 5. Coordination of 12 National Priority Programmes of the Government. How. In the course of the project implementation the successful outputs have been achieved due to concrete implementation methods entailing the institutionalization of the methodology and best practices, building national human resources and close partnership and coordination with all the stakeholders. Lessons learned and replicability. The key lesson learned is that in order to achieve successful results of any similar project UNDP needs to build national capacity with strong traditions and commitments within the implementing agency, as well to establish clear partnership and coordination mechanisms. \u2018From the Aid Coordination to the National Budget \u2013 a Giant Step Forward\u2019 can be replicable in other countries provided the above lessons and each country\u2019s speci\ufb01cs are taken into account. At the moment a number of countries have requested UNDP Afghanistan to share the experience and help with developing similar programmes.

Team work and active involvement - Capacity building from the bottom up. Brief Description: Trying to recruit local staff with western business knowledge\u2014from \ufb01nancial statement to basic accounting practices\u2014is virtually impossible in present day Afghanistan. As a result we sought out local staff that possessed basic business skills, were talented, motivated and attempted to build business consultants in-house. This entailed providing staff with educational materials from the internet and brought in from outside, setting up in-house training sessions, presenting staff with challenging problems, letting them work out solutions to dif\ufb01cult business problems with guidance, as well as giving \ufb02exible schedules to allow outside enrichment. To do this effectively and ef\ufb01ciently, we make concerted efforts to operate both locally and globally to international standards while working within the strictures and limitations of Afghanistan and the rigid UNDP system. International consultants operate the business center as they would in any country. National staff are expected to perform to those standards as well. Every expectation is outlined and clearly presented from the very \ufb01rst day and every member (Intl. or Natl.) are treated equally. The international consultants often pay for team-building lunches and outside programs that inspire the dedication to the BDS team. This is entirely voluntary because the UNDP system does not permit funding these social activities from the budget. Already within three months time local staff members are capable of preparing \ufb01nancial statements according to International Accounting Standards and conducting client meetings. Within 2-3 years working at our BDS center, they will be ready to take over the ABC and make the jobs of international consultants super\ufb02uous.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3205f6cb-addc-4737-b153-2c753440a364": {"__data__": {"id_": "3205f6cb-addc-4737-b153-2c753440a364", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "925b9fc954a3b4f8664e698e45c404b9b616099dc09133b9e1b387489dc97f9d"}, "2": {"node_id": "23aa7c5d-a43a-4cab-82c0-8f241a86d201", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be286869b2c145955abb59740b1653f46fa8c5bde4c7ad4e208e92009d0481c7"}}, "hash": "19ea0e110f8ca8d82714457b8b3fe4c1e47fe28a95d022a279fe45d028edbd4a", "text": "CO Focal Point: Karen Jorgensen CO Focal Point Email address: karen.jorgensen@undp.org Operational Focal Point: Sha\ufb01q Qarizada Operational Focal Point Email address: sha\ufb01q.qarizada@undp.org 32 \ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Building Bridges of Con\ufb01dence and Opportunity for Development BANGLADESH The Chittagong Hill Tracts, lying in the southeast corner of Bangladesh, has a long history as an exclusive indigenous area (with 12 tribal groups) that erupted in con\ufb02ict in the early 1970s over Government-sponsored \u2018settlement\u2019 policies which created a Bengali majority and resulted in land grabbing that led to tribal insurgency and 25 years of con\ufb02ict.

Unfortunately, the Accord was not honored by a splinter tribal party, which has since violently fought against those who signed the Accord, and equally, has not be honored or implemented in any signi\ufb01cant manner by the Government (either political party). In this context, UNDP foresaw a potentially signi\ufb01cant role to \u2018facilitate\u2019 the building of trust between peoples, local institutions and Government, focused on development opportunity rather than political issues. Brief Description: UNDP initiated \u2018Risk Assessment Mission\u2019, carried out jointly with the Government, and aimed at demonstrating the factual reality of reasonable \u2018safety and security\u2019 in the Hill Tracts, to \u2018reopen the door\u2019 for the donor development assistance to the region. The Report simultaneously covered a review of development needs and opportunities, and recommended a Multi-Dimensional Development Strategy for donor-wide and Government support, which eventually led to a UNDP Preparatory Assistance programme consisting of: (i) Capacity Building of the CHT Institutions to transform them into Development Agencies; (ii) Community Empowerment across an initial 6 pilot sub-districts (Upazilas) of the CHT; (iii) Region-Wide Initiatives: employment of youth; marketing; private sector investment; health and education services; environmental protection/management; gender mainstreaming; (iv) Con\ufb01dence Building to address the root issues: dialogue and cooperation between ethnic groups on common development opportunities; land dispute resolution; police reform (opening the way for reduced military presence); holding of elections; promoting minority rights and cultural diversity; sports for peace; support to returned refugees and ex-combatants; etc. Gaining Government (Army) Approval: Quiet diplomacy was the key, meeting with (and through intermediaries) the inside power structure, to ensure our genuine intentions to work for development and poverty reduction. This was eventually suf\ufb01cient for the Prime Minister to approve UNDP locating themselves in the CHT. Establish UNDP Infrastructure and Capacity: this was a year long process of setting up of a CHT Development Facility (CHTDF) consisting of a Unit in the UNDP Country Of\ufb01ce, a Field Of\ufb01ce in the regional headquarters, and Sub-Of\ufb01ces in the other two districts; identifying quali\ufb01ed (Masters degrees, NGO grass root experience, computer skills, etc.) young tribal and Bengali professionals, and eventually hiring and training (through contract with CARE) a staff of 60; assembling a large \ufb02eet of vehicles and boats for mobility and HF/VHF radio communication systems; etc. Gaining Trust of Tribal Leadership: Strong opposition (and boycott of our programme) by the tribal leadership over the issue of inclusion/exclusion of Bengali settlers in the programme was overcome with the help of a UNDP/Headquarters Mission to negotiate a politically acceptable formula (any community which has 50% of residents receiving Government aid is not eligible). Launching the Programme: A period of one year to launch and operationalize our community empowerment activities. That provided an environment that allowed electing their own development bodies (Para Development Committees--PDCs); deciding their own development priorities and assessing technical feasibility (with support of Government Line Departments); and receiving resources from the programme\u2019s Quick Impact Fund (QIF) to implement small projects ($7,000 upper limit). In the one year, 600 communities have been engaged, and a multitude of small projects have proliferated across the Hill Tracts that have not taken place for more than a quarter century of neglect. Focus is on using this experience and the skills acquired as a basis for self-reliant and sustainable community initiatives. 33 CO Focal Point: Larry Maramis CO Focal Point Email address: larry.maramis@undp.org Operational Focal Point: Michael Heyn, Director, CHT Development Facility Operational Focal Point Email address: michael.heyn@undp.org Telephone: +880 2 811 8600-06 ext. 2453 34 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Cash for Trash: Community-based Urban Solid Waste Management in Dhaka BANGLADESH A unique public-private partnership model which considers waste as a resource.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4779268b-10cd-42f0-b60b-7fa3880ab1ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "4779268b-10cd-42f0-b60b-7fa3880ab1ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ec0df2454f426def87b55ad2b4ff834ed50c59a7f20ccd86a6a35053adebfd0"}, "2": {"node_id": "99518234-7aca-4d15-9d60-ec186d217534", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6bcf42e9caba6a3359207c2c876afafd2d5ae4cde9ba9997421125773c243d6f"}}, "hash": "02f3f5404c783f5e688500d46a62acb0fdd50d38c928d755460f1ca44bdc0ec0", "text": "The model demonstrates the \ufb01nancial viability of small-scale labour-intensive composting systems (3 tonnes capacity) with US$ 8,800 as capital investment and payback period 23 months.

UNESCAP selected 3 best local government service practices from Asia and Paci\ufb01c region for the Commonwealth Local Government Forum to be held in Kula Lumpur during 11-14 July 2005. The model is selected as one of the best practices. \u2018what\u2019 were the impacts and results: Diversifying the income opportunities of destitute and hardcore poor people (mainly waste pickers) who were involved for risky waste segregation at street-side containers or land\ufb01ll site. Generated employment for urban poor women in addressing the poverty. Promotes the productive use of waste and facilitates micro-enterprises. Increased public awareness on waste management. Reduces the harmful effects of chemical fertilizer. Making cleaner and healthier communities and environment. Attracted US$ 10 million FDI using clean development mechanism. \u2018how\u2019 was this implemented: The Government makes land available free of charge for waste management, communities/service provider collects, separates and turns solid waste into organic compost. Households pay a charge for waste collection and oversee the activities in their neighbourhoods and private business market the organic compost. It reduces both the cost and workload of municipalities and City Corporation for waste management. People\u2019s perception on waste has changed, more waste are segregated at source. Scattered throwing/dropping of waste has been stopped in the intervened areas. Compost with added nutrients improves the organic contents of soils and increases yields.

Brief Description: The M&E Panel is a \u201cgood practice\u201d because it (a) signi\ufb01cantly saves staff time (who no longer have to run around trying to \ufb01nd essential documents); (b) it highlights monitoring gaps that are not mandated by UNDP\u2019s corporate M&E guidelines, but which should be in place for effective monitoring, (c) it saves a considerable amount of paper, since all main documents are available electronically, and (d) it fosters understanding of issues and programmes across practice areas, as the information is available to all staff in the CO to consult. The M&E Panel highlighted the fact that programme indicator tracking tables were not being systematically completed, nor was the information being used by decision-makers. We therefore worked with the Government to insure that it became mandatory for programme managers to table the latest results indicators at their Steering Committee Meetings to stimulate discussion on progress toward intended results, and to take decision based on this. The \ufb01nal link on our RBM chain was thus made \u2013 decisions based on results indicator analysis.

The Millennium Development Goals have been successfully transformed into a layman\u2019s language, with our national partners fully aware of what they mean, thus making it easier to collectively plot the way forward. Secondly, the achievement of the MDGs is no longer seen as the responsibility of the development partners or the Royal Government alone. They are now viewed as a collective responsibility of the people and the Government, with help from development partners. Thus, people\u2019s perception on the MDGs has changed. I would like to focus your attention on the MDG video clip song, which was produced for both radio and TV with support from UNDP. Both the radio and TV in Bhutan are nationally owned. Radio has a wider reach and is an important vehicle to make national policies known to people in remote far-\ufb02ung areas. The national TV, which was introduced just six years ago, is the main source of entertainment and infotainment in the urban areas. Besides the radio, there is the bi-weekly national newspaper, as the other source of information in Bhutan. All branches of the national media were utilized in our MDG campaign. Lessons learned and replicability: The use of a MDG video clip song in the local dialect has enabled a large section of the Bhutanese society, particularly the younger generation, to understand what the MDGs are and their role in helping to achieve them by the 2015 deadline. The song: \u2022 was the most cost-effective method of disseminating messages to the broadest audience with least amount of time spent on actual preparation. \u2022 can be re-used as and when required and has a lifetime of its own. \u2022 can be easily replicated by other country of\ufb01ces.

Since its initial stage of IT introduction, UNDP has been a leading partner of the Government in its ICT related policy formulation and its implementation at the various levels. ICT in Bhutan is still in its early stage of development, but the Government with UNDP support is very much convinced of the potential and needs for ICT4D for equitable and human development of the people and communities of Bhutan. Brief Description: Information era of Bhutan started in 1999 when the Government introduced TV Program and Internet services for the \ufb01rst time in the country\u2019s history. UNDP Bhutan has been instrumental in convincing the Royal Government of Bhutan in taking advantage of ICT for equitable human development. In 2003, the new Ministry of Information and Communications (MoIC) was created. UNDP has been supporting the MoIC and other relevant institutions by providing technical assistance at three different levels: policy and legislation; institutional capacity building; and grassroots level experimentations. At the policy level, UNDP supported the MoIC in developing the Bhutan ICT Policy and Strategies (BIPS), which has been approved by the Council of Ministers. UNDP also assisted the MoIC in preparing ICT Act, which will be discussed at the next National Assembly. At the institutional level, UNDP collaborates with the MoIC and other relevant Ministries to make more government\u2019s documents and application forms to be accessible on-line. UNDP also supported the Department of Planning to develop the Gewog Pro\ufb01le Information System (GPIS), which provides on-line access to the data/information of all 201 Gewogs (sub-districts).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f01ccbdf-dff0-489a-a4b4-32d809a39af4": {"__data__": {"id_": "f01ccbdf-dff0-489a-a4b4-32d809a39af4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f13059ea0127181289bca0f7c5d61090d49d77da0d3c5f8f7b19d4dd88afe27"}, "2": {"node_id": "2794f4bd-c16d-4d3a-8943-342186f7d997", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d943af6842cdfe51b76a9fc48418c3794523ef7016ce92688afde6515d1b4ec7"}}, "hash": "73d1a65d352ed841c3c33f09c8eb7085caa516379f4431b268a535da41857175", "text": "UNDP is also a focal point for donor coordination in ICT4D, and issues periodic newsletter of ICT4D to update the government agencies, donors, media, academic institutions and other interested development practitioners on the progress of ICT in Bhutan.

It has made a successful transition from a rehabilitation/post con\ufb02ict project (1992-1995), to providing the single largest core support for the implementation of the decentralization reform programme in Cambodia (1996-2005). Brief Description: The Seila programme was established in 1996 as a pilot in decentralized planning, \ufb01nancing and management of rural development. With the support of UNDP and donors, the Seila programme has evolved over the years in its focus, orientation, and geographic coverage. Starting in 1996 with the pilot implementation of local level planning and investments in 4 communes in 2 provinces, the Seila programme now covers all of Cambodia\u2019s 24 provinces comprising 1,621 communes. The Seila /Partnership for Local Governance programme is acknowledged as one of UNDP\u2019s success stories due to a number of good practices and factors, to wit: \u2022 Structured participatory development planning and implementation of community projects that matched identi\ufb01ed priorities with local needs, fostered local ownership and support. These participatory bottom-up processes played a key role in the reconciliation process by bringing con\ufb02icting groups in communities to discuss development concerns, identify priorities and solutions, and implement projects together. This helped build con\ufb01dence and mutual trust shattered by the history of con\ufb02ict and violence in Cambodia\u2019s society. \u2022 Establishment of development committees at the village, commune and district levels at the earliest stages of the reconciliation process provided an appropriate framework for restoring state authority in war-torn areas and facilitated the integration of former opposition leadership in of\ufb01cial governance structures. \u2022 Despite the high risks associated with the programme both in its design and the volatile political and economic environment within which Seila is implemented, the donors lead by UNDP, took a long-term view and adopted a \ufb02exible approach in the allocation of resources. This allowed an experimental process oriented design of the project, revising and reacting to emerging issues and challenges in a timely and decisive manner. \u2022 Concepts are re\ufb01ned in light of experience, processes and procedures adapted in a \ufb02exible manner according to local conditions. Government staff and communities learn by implementing the activities under the guidance of advisors. This has helped design national and provincial management and execution systems based on international standards. They are now being used by 10 donors to deliver support in a harmonized manner amounting to an annual US$ 40 million. \u2022 A multi-pronged approach that combines development of concepts, structures, design and delivery of investment and services. This approach was key to developing the capacity of the Government and the communities for planning and management of local development by translating policy concepts and project priorities into programmes and investments projects. It provided the mechanism for testing the implementation feasibility of decentralized planning, \ufb01nancing and implementation of rural development; and for developing and re\ufb01ning the requisite regulatory procedures. Without the demonstrated feasibility of implementing a decentralized local development approach under the Seila programme, a national decentralization reform program would have taken a much longer time to be adopted by the Royal Government. \u2022 Seila developed and implemented systems and procedures that promoted transparency and accountability among the various partners. These included: formalized procedures for the \ufb02ow of funds from the national level to the local implementing agencies; accounting procedures for the use of fund; procedures for bidding and contracting small local infrastructure; contracts between the project and the ministries and provincial authorities for the delivery of services; formulation for the allocation of funding among provinces and the preannouncement of these allocations. \u2022 Development of broad-based partnership with various stakeholders.

In this way, they contribute to the ongoing National Legal and Judicial Reform Process, and strengthen democracy. - The initiative reaches out to the most disadvantaged and excluded communities, for example the indigenous communities in Mondulkiri using plain language and visual support materials to connect with the audience and empower members of the community to make short presentations on grievances encountered. - It also evaluates the supply of justice services including the Judiciary, the police, governmental authorities, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and community based con\ufb02ict resolution mechanisms, considering customary law applied by indigenous peoples in Cambodia. - The research team combines international and national expertise, researchers and government counterparts. - The research study has an interdisciplinary approach, using different tools and techniques for the \ufb01eld research. - Action oriented research to inform the design of pilots of local systems of justice that will lead to policy change for legal recognition of local justice mechanism complementing the formal justice systems.

Brief Description: In June 2004, and in line with the OECD/DAC harmonization process, the UN Country Team in Cambodia decided to join the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and DFID\u2019s joint planning exercise for the preparation of new country strategies. The initiative resulted in a common assessment of the country development challenges and risks; created an opportunity to compare programmes identifying gaps, avoiding duplications and building synergies; reduced transaction costs holding joint consultation meetings with all stakeholders (government, donors, civil society, and private sector) and future joint monitoring meetings; and established \u201cpartnership principles\u201d in working together and with the government and civil society. Building on the new Government\u2019s \u201cRectangular Development Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, and Ef\ufb01ciency\u201d, a tool to implement its political platform and to meet the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs), the partners agreed that this represented the basis for the development of their own country programmes. As an extension of the teamwork that had been developed through the joint strategy process, the identi\ufb01cation and elaboration of agency projects and programmes was undertaken in an open and consultative manner, with the agencies freely sharing information and giving particular attention to effective division of labor as well as potential synergies through collaborative action. In the same spirit of better coordination and cooperation, the Royal Government of Cambodia and its development partners agreed in 2004 to establish 18 Technical Working Groups (TWGs) at the sector/ thematic level. These TWGs are each chaired by the Government, co-facilitated by donors and have a wide participation. To ensure coordination among the 18 joint TWGs, a \u201cGovernment \u2013 Donor Coordination Committee (GDCC)\u201d has been established to provide policy guidance, to set priorities, monitor progress in the various sectors, and to propose measures to solve problems raised by the TWGs. The TWGs report back on a quarterly basis to the GDCC, which in turn informs the Consultative Group on a six-monthly basis on progress achieved in reaching the CG set priorities, in line with the Cambodia MDGs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9dc7e23-f48d-4bf7-8f99-b590f3baa417": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9dc7e23-f48d-4bf7-8f99-b590f3baa417", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb4110c16bd19dc2de572d2150b7a46a5311db255752dc1ac223cd53b0c83e3e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c787edb2-a79f-4be6-9b0e-e6cbe1303bd2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9de78a6b5e37a6ca017ab3e5f413ade6b7c442b02d1dda57473b0fffbd1a3340"}}, "hash": "70cf707c72f6b5dae834206279c09de2eef8e4d7bc8b0f3de15f476eb02ecb32", "text": "The efforts described above have had the following key-results: Stronger relationships and trust The Government and 12 development partners (including the UN) agree on a Partnership Agreement establishing partnership principles in line with the Rome Declaration in December 2004 Shared analysis leading to agreement on how best to support Government development efforts Enhanced sharing of information leading to real complementarity, selectivity, and division of labor Clear and consistent messages to Government Improved intraministerial communication Reduced transaction costs for the Government as well as other stakeholders/development partners Better programming as a result of joint, informed expertise (including combined outreach to other stakeholders/development partners)", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e79621ad-1e95-4bde-8f0d-53fdeb3b28d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "e79621ad-1e95-4bde-8f0d-53fdeb3b28d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dfb83ea39b4e3237a9456fc75b05e13bf32bb7b796a245de019afc93a049444"}, "3": {"node_id": "a14f13be-7a67-4449-a113-a708e2f4e01c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9f7adebe91d8eeab1019bd149c1a487a26e3dd0dd4622b0dd51909fe5abfcbc"}}, "hash": "51f743fb00be04692b0c126b92c1f8c3019457f0abfb93d599494b2598847d0f", "text": "Country-led example of harmonization CO Focal Point: Ricarda Rieger CO Focal Point Email address: ricarda.rieger@undp.org Operational Focal Point: Ms. Yoko Konishi, Ms. Dania Marzouki Operational Focal Point Email address: yoko.konishi@undp.org 42 Energising China CHINA The China End Use Energy E\ufb03ciency Project is a 12-year umbrella programme to foster a strategic approach to developing and implementing a comprehensive and e\ufb00ective energy conservation policy and regulatory system and to removing institutional, technical, \ufb01nancial and information barriers to the widespread application of energy e\ufb03ciency improvement in the major energy consuming sectors. Brief Description: Chinese Government has been paying close attention to energy conservation efforts and decoupling of energy consumption and economic growth has been realized in China in last years. UNDP China has been contributing to this process through several UNDP/GEF supported projects such as the Green Lights, the Refrigerator, Township and Village Enterprises (TVEs) projects. One of lessons learnt from those projects is that those speci\ufb01c products energy conservation efforts just touched an angle of the huge iceberg of barriers to energy ef\ufb01ciency improvement. It was hard to achieve without inter-ministerial coordination and regulation enforcement and market transformation. Based on those, Chinese Government set up more ambitious targets for further energy conservation and energy ef\ufb01ciency improvement for major energy intensive sectors (industry, building and transportation). The Government came up with a proposal to UNDP for support of a \ufb02agship project End Use Energy Ef\ufb01ciency Project (EUEEP) to set up and implement the roadmap towards energy ef\ufb01ciency improvement. The proposal was to design a 12-year umbrella programme instead of project to foster a strategical approach to developing and implementing a comprehensive and effective energy conservation policy and regulatory system and to removing institutional, technical, \ufb01nancial and information barriers to the widespread application of energy ef\ufb01ciency improvement in the major energy consuming sectors. The \ufb01rst phase of the project with the budget of USD 17,000,000 was approved and started the implementation. The project has the following features: Inter-ministerial Coordination: From the very begin of the concept development, most of governmental, associations, research institutions and private sector which have connections with energy were mobilised to participate in the process. Shift from products to policies: It is still designed to be \ufb01tted into GEF OP 5: removal of barriers, however, the strategy here is no longer target speci\ufb01c products such as lights and boilers, but the legal system and market environment for those main energy consuming sectors.

Brief Description: China\u2019s development and integration highlights the increasing importance of the norms, conventions and standards that have been established by the UN system. It calls for a collective, coherent and integrated UN system response to the national priorities and needs within the framework of the MDGs and UN reforms. UNDP very much takes up these concerns with an emphasis on rights-based approaches and issues of equity. In the past few years, UNDP/China has intensi\ufb01ed its work to promote international norms, conventions and standards. Through advocacy, policy dialogue, capacity building, networking and partnering, UNDP has provided support to China in the process of ratifying, implementing and promoting key UN conventions, including by enhancing the relationship between China as a state party to the various instruments and the international monitoring mechanisms established by these instruments. Our efforts have generated increased awareness and support among UN agencies, Government line ministries and the civil society in the preparation of the new UNDAF for 2006-2010.

Brief Description: The UNDP Fiji Country Of\ufb01ce, in collaboration with the UN CT, used a major national annual cultural event, called Tadra Kahani (a combination of Fijian and Hindi, meaning \u201cdream story\u201d), as awareness raising tool on MDG\u2019s. The Tadra Kahani is about school children expressing a development or socio-economic theme using creative arts in dance and music. In the course of preparing for the event, the students also learn about the issues surrounding the theme. The involvement of parents, the media (through FM radio and TV and newspapers) in the month leading up to the event and afterwards in broadcasting the event has lead to a country-wide awareness amongst the general public on the MDG\u2019s and related issues of governance and human rights. It is considered a best practice because of the following reasons: \u2022 Reaching a large audience through radio, tv and major cultural event for relative low cost (sponsorship contribution amounting to around $10,000) \u2022 Making the MDG\u2019s meaningful to people\u2019s own situation \u2022 Opportunity to reach out to schools all across the country \u2022 Demonstrating that MDG advocacy can be fun and entertaining \u2022 It is a joint UN CT effort, bringing the CT together in preparation and showing that achievement of MDG\u2019s is a UN issue. \u2022 It creates a strong and continuing bond between UN and the community, schools, the media and general public. Creates a growing generation of young people very familiar with the MDGs This model of using a major cultural event, having partnerships with the organizers, the participants and the media is not unique to Fiji and can be easily replicated in other countries. Lessons learned from the two events that have been held so far are: \u2022 Preparation of the event is as important an advocacy tool as the event itself. By going out to the schools to brief the students and teachers on the issue of MDG\u2019s, involving also the media, the impact on the awareness is already considerable. \u2022 The media can be effectively mobilized to be a tool for advocacy, with limited \ufb01nancial consequence, as long as it has elements of fun and entertainment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95cc577d-f5e7-44b0-9659-319fced2c0aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "95cc577d-f5e7-44b0-9659-319fced2c0aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec8e25fceceac1436ccaf0f97e560e5c583a027d2b9372b9d815d9b0a07b7540"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7a06a80-0e09-4b2e-95e3-065185d12732", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26bf46438e68de5418ff8b8821c18ae7e9177e8a4ef318abc7f2185234788b3f"}}, "hash": "477bdb6e1bbf611d4d62bf3776ea71bf8668cfa0bd9a1c63b517cbb1ce650dba", "text": "\u2022 The school children\u2019s expression of an MDG theme sometimes brings out important perspectives on the MDG\u2019s which are overlooked by policy makers and planner.

The organization, which has more than 10,000 members and is a recipient of UNDP support under the \u201cCommunity-based Pro-poor Initiatives Programme\u201d of the Government of India, works to develop local leadership. When a local survey indicated that radio was a suitable medium for expansion of literacy as well as to build an information network, UNDP provided funding support to the KMVS to launch a weekly radio programme \u2018Kunjal Panchchi KutchJi\u2019. Loosely translated, the title means \u201c\ufb02ying with the crane\u201d, the crane being the \ufb01ctional central character of the programme. B) Initiatives: \u201cDuring these four years of radio programming and communicating with the people of Kutch, we have learnt many things. We realized radio\u2019s af\ufb01nity with oral, non-literate cultures; how it can easily re\ufb02ect and generate debate on local concerns, needs, priorities and issues; why this highly localized programming brings pluralism into our broadcast culture; its power to enhance a sense of self respect and how a radio programme in the local language af\ufb01rms local cultural identities. These kinds of programmes are participatory in contrast to the alienated spectatorship on the part of the audience in mainstream media,\u201d says Latabhen, a local woman of Kutch. The weekly programme is a runaway success enjoying high listenership. Some of the issues raised on the radio programme are women\u2019s leadership and governance, girl\u2019s right to education, female foeticide, harassment of brides for dowry, unnatural deaths and suicides of women, pressure on women to produce boys, maternal mortality and disregard for natural environment, cyclical drought and lack of water resources,\u201d says Preeti Soni, Project Coordinator. The group has developed the capacity to produce the programmes themselves, and has established their own production studio, which cuts their costs to increase sustainability. The UNDP-supported community radio programme in the remote Kutch area of the Indian state of Gujarat, laid the ground for the systematic advocacy by the India UNDP Country Of\ufb01ce for a progressive, and enabling Community Radio policy that would facilitate more poor communities using this medium for social empowerment. The advocacy strategy included a workshop series that allowed policy and decision-makers from the Government to interact, for the \ufb01rst time, directly with community-based groups and other advocates and practitioners of community radio. C) Mainstreaming and upscaling: The advocacy process led to a greater appreciation on the part of the government of the signi\ufb01cance of this medium for the poor for giving expression to their voices. The result has been that the federal Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has approved the new policy for Community Radio which is now due for clearance by the Union Cabinet. The Government of India has duly acknowledged UNDP\u2019s role in formulation of the new policy, which will allow Community Radio to \ufb02ourish on a large scale in India. With the new policy on the anvil that is estimated to open the door to over 4,000 new community radio stations (from around six today).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c46517f-fdea-4871-acab-1aa480054a69": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c46517f-fdea-4871-acab-1aa480054a69", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54767a633811c45499b846114d8e2f0181b6b478e4063cf6d8fbe3aa0e026fdb"}, "2": {"node_id": "f54ba04c-9d69-4fb1-a0fb-247b34d37fc0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5281f43d765212455f159e5500e882d2c0d02c5945026f1e1f9a79725d6b1fb7"}}, "hash": "d3d325bf7ce570f0ff1187e5cc6c234721ecfcebf706e5e0bf6e4081eec9cfca", "text": "CR has also been identi\ufb01ed as a tool for last-mile connectivity in the Government supported larger initiative Vision 2007 to make every village a knowledge centre.

The fatalities in Samiyarpetti were far less compared to the adjoining villages as the villagers were well trained in emergency survival and management. \u201cMany more of us would have been killed had we not done what we were trained for\u201d, said Chandiran, one of the survivors. Brief Description: A) The Context: Samiyarpettai village is a \u201cliving\u201d example of how a community can survive the worst disaster if people are prepared and trained to deal with such crises. Providentially, in October 2004, barely a couple of months before the Tsunami struck on December 26 2004, the villagers had been trained under the UNDP-Government of India Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Programme with active support from the District Collector\u2019s of\ufb01ce. This one factor alone resulted in the saving of countless lives. Compared to many other neighboring worst affected villages, Samiyarpettai villagers lived to tell the tale. Samiyarpettai is just one of the hundreds of villages that is the focus of the Government of India and UNDP supported Disaster Risk Management (DRM) initiative being implemented in 169 most multi hazards prone districts of the 17 selected States during 2002-2007. The initiative builds on the experience in community-based disaster preparedness gathered over the last decade, particularly following successive earthquakes in Latur (Maharashtra, 1993), Uttarkashi (Uttaranchal, 1997) and Bhuj (Gujarat, 2001) and the 1999 super cyclone in Orissa. The main objectives of the programme are: 1. Multi-hazard preparedness and mitigation plans for disaster risk management at State, district, block, village and ward levels in 169 districts of 17 selected most hazard prone states and 38 cities for comprehensive Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction. 2. Networking knowledge on effective approaches, methods and tools for disaster risk management, developing and promoting policy frameworks at State and National levels 3. Capacity building to institutionalize the system for disaster risk management in the Ministry of Home Affairs 4. Environment building and education programme in disaster reduction and recovery in most hazard prone states Working with the poor and marginalized communities, the focus of the UN is to facilitate the rapid recovery of the affected populations in a way that leads to the sustainable reduction of disaster risks and expands the opportunities for development. It also ensures the mainstreaming of issues pertaining to long-term vulnerability reduction, sustainability and environmental conservation. B): The initiative: Community empowerment is at the heart of the Government of India-UNDP Disaster Risk Management Programme for reducing vulnerabilities of people to recurrent natural disasters. The approach promotes community involvement in disaster preparedness and strengthens preparedness through a process of decentralized planning. The training given to the Samiyarpettai villagers speci\ufb01cally in the areas of search, rescue and prevention from drowning, resulted in keeping the death toll down to 24. In the adjoining village of Pudupettai , a little less than 2 km away, the death toll was as high as 92. If basic training could save 68 precious lives in one small area, one can imagine the bene\ufb01ts of training on a more extensive scale. The initiatives taken at the village level included constitution of Village Disaster Committees, elaboration of Village Disaster Management Plans, training the teams on search and rescue and First Aid, conducting mock drills and teaching villagers about higher safe spots and to prevent drowning using empty barrels and banana stems. Promoting appropriate and low cost alternate housing technologies are major mitigation priorities under this programme. The promotion of local building materials and technologies takes into account indigenous knowledge of communities. Capacity building of local construction institutions is being enhanced through comprehensive training of masons and upgrading their skills by providing them additional livelihood opportunities and bene\ufb01ts to practice within the local construction industry. C) \u201cthe Why\u201d - Why this is considered a good practice: While building Early Warning Systems are essential to prevent and reduce massive damage, simple disaster preparedness at the local community level is the need of the hour. It spells the difference between death and disaster or life and hope.

D) The \u201cWhat\u201d - Impact: The recent experiences during the Tsunami on 26 December 2004, which hit Samiyarpettai village in Cuddalore district of Tamilnadu, showed that such a strategy adopted is very effective in saving lives. Villagers from Samiyarpettai had received training under UNDP- GOI Disaster Risk Management Programme which included developing survival skills, establishment of search and rescue teams, mock drills, and general disaster awareness training. 22 lives were lost in the disaster while in neighboring villages, like Pudukuppam, the death toll was much higher. In the wake of the recent tsunami, the India Country Of\ufb01ce of UNDP deputed trained professionals from India with expertise in areas such as information management and coordination support in relief and recovery operations, to UNDP of\ufb01ces in other tsunami-affected countries such as Maldives , Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

Through a process of meaningful engagement with local partners, UNDP is building sustainable partnerships for development. Brief Description: UNDP was requested by the local and central government to provide assistance based on priority needs determined by key stakeholders in the light of local realities, perceptions and aspirations \u2013 a challenge and an opportunity not least because Papua is home to over 250 groups of indigenous peoples. Historically, many external development actors have supported development in Papua by \ufb02ying-in experts for a short time to assess and make recommendations. There has also been a tendency to use non-Papuan- based organizations to conduct donor-led surveys. Sometimes local organizations have been included to the extent of \ufb01lling in questionnaires \u2013 unfortunately not always as equal development partners with special knowledge and capacities. While this approach may be because of seemingly limited professional capacities in Papua, the approach is likely to contribute to a further decline of local capacities. UNDP took the decision early on to partner with Papua-based NGOs and universities to conduct an assessment and further engage in discussions of the \ufb01ndings with stakeholders through a series of consultations. The process of engagement has included providing technical assistance to the partners to further develop their capacities. Engaging with local stakeholders as equal partners throughout the process has ensured that local knowledge and experiences are informing the preparation of appropriate development support, and that there is broad ownership of the strategies agreed upon. Based on the UNDP-supported assessment, a group of local government, academia, and civil society representatives are now working (with facilitation support from UNDP) towards developing a Framework for providing development assistance for Papua. UNDP and other development partners will be able to identify areas within the Framework where they can provide the most strategic support. The local government is also using the assessment and the framework as inputs into the development of the government\u2019s strategic planning document for Papua \u2013 an example of UNDP\u2019s support adding value to a key local planning process. Because of the trust and partnerships developed, the UNDP has been requested to assist the government with the coordination of external and internal development actors in Papua. \ufffd Key Lessons A key lesson learned is that by engaging meaningfully with local stakeholders from the outset of the process, UNDP can develop real partnerships. Furthermore, by tapping into existing expertise in the country of\ufb01ce, UNDP can respond to a range of development issues in the same region, which may otherwise be dif\ufb01cult when UNDP programmes operate independently from each other.

The epidemic is primarily driven by injecting drug use and commercial sex; however, there is a consensus by all partners working in the HIV/AIDS response that there needs to be a targeted and intensi\ufb01ed response if Indonesia is going to halt and begin to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS infection. Based on the recognized work of UNDP in the past on preparing the National Strategy on HIV/AIDS, multiple stakeholders approached UNDP Indonesia to develop a comprehensive program to build sustainable partnerships for HIV/AIDS. Therefore, UNDP Indonesia in collaboration with UNAIDS, recruited a team of consultants to lead consultations with key partners working in HIV/AIDS, including people living with HIV/ AIDS, community based organizations, UN agencies, bilaterals, National and International NGOs, private sector and Indonesian Government to develop \u201cThe Indonesian Partnership Fund for HIV/AIDS\u201d. The Fund is being established as one of the mechanisms for the Government of Indonesia to expand the national response to the epidemic by increasing program effectiveness and coverage. The fund will support the implementation of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy 2003-2007 to build sustainable partnerships for HIV/ AIDS. Its goals are to prevent and limit the spread of HIV, to improve the quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS and to alleviate the socio-economic and health impacts of the epidemic on the people of Indonesia. The UK Government is the \ufb01rst donor to pledge a total of \u00a325 million over 3 years (2005-2007) to the Indonesian Partnership Fund , which will be administered by UNDP in collaboration with the National AIDS Commission and with technical assistance from UNAIDS. Lessons Learned: A key lesson learned was to consult closely with all the key stakeholders (i.e. the bilaterals, who have signi\ufb01cant programs in Indonesia) and address their issues and concerns and work together to reach a viable and sustainable solution. HIV/ AIDS has become a priority for the UN agencies in Indonesia. Leadership and commitment from the senior management and Country Team (Heads of UN Agencies), appointing key focal points in the UN Agencies who can dedicate their time and energy to advocate and design HIV/AIDS programs that can be integrated in the work of the UN system. The \ufb01ve priority areas are: 1. Individual risk of sexual transmission of HIV reduced; 2. Individual risk of HIV transmission among injecting drug users and sexual transmission to their partners reduced; 3. Awareness of general population, particularly young people, increased of their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS infection and discriminatory behaviors towards people living with HIV/AIDS; 4. Access and quality of care, treatment, and support for people living with HIV/AIDS improved with a focus on increasing voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), treatment for opportunistic infections and community based care and support; and 5. Capacity to prioritize and allocate resources for HIV/AIDS strengthened through operationalisation of the \u20183 Ones\u2019 framework at national, province and district levels.

The PDA is based on UNDP\u2019s global con\ufb02ict analysis methodology developed by the BCPR, and was adapted to address the speci\ufb01c Indonesian country context. Brief Description: Violent con\ufb02ict in Indonesia is a feature of the development landscape both in its \u201cvertical\u201d (Aceh and Papua), and \u201chorizontal\u201d (Malukus, Kalimantan and Sulawesi) expressions. Con\ufb02ict erupted at a time of social, economic and political transformation following the economic crisis of 1997 and the fall of the New Order. The sudden loss of executive control and the introduction of substantive institutional change (e.g. decentralization processes, democratization, etc) allowed latent con\ufb02icts to spill into different kinds of regional violence. While different con\ufb02icts are rooted in comparable problems (i.e. forty years of New Order rule which led to a striking debilitation of social institutions, absence of institutions to regulate such tensions and redistribute resources in a fair and equitable manner) and, have erupted during Indonesia\u2019s uneasy political, economic, social and cultural transition of the post New Order period, less is understood about the speci\ufb01c factors, which in\ufb02uence differing levels of con\ufb02ict across the archipelago and, above all, the priorities for affected communities via a vis development, reconciliation and peace-building. Similarly, little is known about the entry points to support sustainable peace processes, priorities for strategic responses, the key institutions to work with and the levels at which support should be provided to address root causes. UNDP/CPRU in collaboration with key partners at national and sub-national levels, undertook the PDA process to enhance its understanding of the con\ufb02ict and development context and engage all stake-holders in the de\ufb01nition of priorities. This PDA process was designed to: (1) Enhance multi- stakeholder consensus on priorities for supporting sustainable peace through development in target areas and nationally; (2) Strengthen national capacity for con\ufb02ict analysis and applying con\ufb02ict-sensitive development approaches; (3) Improve knowledge of peace-building dynamics relevant to development programme design and implementation; and (4) Develop, customize and test methodologies and tools for peace-oriented development priority setting and planning in Indonesia and globally. The PDA process was undertaken through three main pillars of activities in close collaboration with national and provincial universities, civil society and local/national government: \u2022 Multi-stakeholder consultative PDA Workshops to facilitate stakeholders to re\ufb02ect on past experiences of con\ufb02ict and peace, as well as to identify future visions and scenarios and prioritize key areas for action; \u2022 Thematic assessments to complement the PDA workshops by providing more speci\ufb01c contextual information undertaken in the areas of governance, social cohesion, gender, youth, media, natural resource management and local economic development; Qualitative and quantitative research aimed at providing a more comprehensive understanding of con\ufb02ict and peace dynamics at national and sub-national levels. Activities through Provincial Advisory Groups comprised of government and civil society that guided the PDA process in each province, and acted as key consultative stakeholder groups. The preparatory phase for the PDA workshops included over 150 interviews, focus group discussions conducted with local stakeholders, three district-level PDA workshops bringing in community-based organizations and district government. These were followed by Provincial Level Workshops and a National PDA workshop in December 2004. Workshops build on each other both in terms of participants and, above all, in gaining an understanding of con\ufb02ict and peace from the bottom up.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bf79872-b842-4643-aa05-f4c8ac0e938b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bf79872-b842-4643-aa05-f4c8ac0e938b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "984a47ec46fbfa458f10f59d50c7e694034593121ec02dc07fc3b3d16f7affc8"}, "2": {"node_id": "69a6abea-b9c5-48fd-bcf9-56be2047e85f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a76063e15ddd0839fb8e1fe91f90f80e42ee94e6652832dad7ac15a24970836a"}}, "hash": "33d519040814539506425feacb00417942f2227379c50634f88c4beb7f23be30", "text": "An underlying objective across all pillars was to build capacity for con\ufb02ict and peace analysis of key institutions at national and sub-national levels and to create spaces for dialogue facilitated by local stakeholders.

To ensure sustainability, the project strongly focuses on capacity development of local partners to work on access to justice activities in predominantly con\ufb02ict a\ufb00ected regions. Brief Description: The project has identi\ufb01ed poor and disadvantaged groups in 40 villages across 5 predominantly con\ufb02ict- affected provinces in Indonesia and is assessing the key factors obstructing their access to justice. The assessment will provide a basis for the development of a longer-term programme for UNDP and partners to improve access to justice for poor, marginalized and con\ufb02ict-affected communities. Under a rights-based approach, understanding the roles, responsibilities, capacities and obstacles faced by both duty-bearers and claim-holders helps to clarify how access to justice can be improved in even the most challenging settings. Through its participatory approach, the Access to Justice project is bolstering people\u2019s awareness of justice services. The project is guided by the principles of participation, accountability, non-discrimination, equality and attention to vulnerable groups, empowerment, linkages to human rights standards, progressive realization of rights and non-retrogression. Multi-disciplinary teams of seven local researchers with either academic or NGO backgrounds - re\ufb02ecting ethnic, religious and gender diversities are working in each province. A primary focus of the project is on the capacity development of our provincial team members and building up of networks in each of the provinces, and on developing a community of practitioners to engage in access to justice activities in the future programme and beyond. This approach is adopted in order to ensure long term sustainability and impact beyond the life of the project. Small-scale pilot projects aimed at either reducing one or more obstacles that currently prevent people from accessing justice, or alternatively strengthening resolution mechanisms that already enjoy some degree of success are also being developed. This activity could be termed as one of the most important activities in this Project - especially under a rights programming framework - as it brings together duty-bearers and claim- holders on a common platform to dialogue on what activities best suits the demands of the communities in accessing justice mechanisms. The main purpose of these small-scale projects is to experiment with different approaches to \ufb01nd those with the greatest chances of succeeding in the longer-term Access to Justice Project. The methodology and tools developed for this project are already being adapted by other country of\ufb01ces in the region and discussions are underway on replication of access to justice activities in other provinces in Indonesia CO Focal Point: Gwi-yeop Son CO Focal Point Email address: gwi-yeop.son@undp.org Operational Focal Point: Ewa Wojkowska Operational Focal Point Email address: ewa.wojkowska@undp.org 55 Voting for the future: Supporting free and fair elections INDONESIA Coordinating international assistance and developing local capacity for democratic elections.

Brief Description: Following the devastating earthquake of 26 December 2003 that struck the south-eastern city of Bam in Iran, killing more than 320,000 people, under conditions that the affected families felt pressured to take decisions on the rebuilding of their houses without having proper information and knowledge, while the authorities and donors had expressed urgent need for feedback from communities about their real needs and responses to the proposed initiatives, there was an immediate need for a sound information exchange and dissemination system for this purpose. To this end, production of a bi-weekly community newsletter for Bam - with a circulation of 10,000- was initiated by UNDP. Under this ongoing project, some 52 young local volunteers, who were identi\ufb01ed and are being trained continuously on reporting and journalism by UNDP, are involved in the whole process of producing the newsletter from preparing reports to its distribution throughout the affected area. The newsletter not only provides information to communities about government policies and all aspects of the recovery and reconstruction processes, but also allows the community to voice their concerns about the process. In addition, it acts as a medium for dissemination of successful community-driven initiatives and has also provided a platform for cultural expression by the people. It also helps all the actors and bene\ufb01ciaries in the area to access the required information like job opportunities, people\u2019s entitlements, safety and risk reduction messages with different subjects such as health, shelters, etc. One big challenge was the issue of ownership of the newsletter. Some counterparts intended to adopt it as their formal information tool, which was rejected internally owing to the involvement of a foreign donor country (Switzerland). After some discussions on the issue of adopting the newssheet, the Bam Municipality undertook its production. It has now allocated an of\ufb01ce for the production of the newssheet, and some IT kiosks for its regular distribution.

The \ufb01rst forum meeting discussed various aspects of project formulation and implementation under the National Execution (NEX) modality and provided an opportunity for UNDP to hear the stakeholders\u2019 feedback. In its deliberations, the Forum focused on issues related to programme formulation and delivery, roles and responsibilities of various parties, and other pertinent issues. It also provided an opportunity for the participants to share their experiences related to the implementation of UNDP projects. The \ufb01rst NPD Forum was important in the sense that it provided a platform for the stakeholders as well as UNDP to raise their concerns about and address such issues as lack of active consultative/participatory process in the formulation stage of the projects, the need for a project management support system within the Government, the slow process in project implementation in some cases, failure to consult stakeholders (down to the community level) and to suf\ufb01ciently factoring in local conditions and input during project formulation stage, etc. Motivated by the success of the \ufb01rst forum, UNPD organised a second NPD Forum in March 2005. The second meeting focused on ATLAS, where the participants voiced their feedback on its advantages as well as what they viewed as its shortcomings. In further consultation with the Government counterparts, it was agreed that the NPDs Forum was a useful means to discuss and address project-related issues, a platform to establish networking among NPDs, and a check-point to monitor progress. The Forum was therefore recommended to become incorporated in the national execution mechanism. To that end, the UNDP Country Programme Action Plan (CPAP) 2005-2009 gave a legal mandate to the Forum by making it a formal entity to assist the tripartite Country Programme Committee (CPC) oversee programme management and implementation, and monitor results.

MALAYSIA A Country O\ufb03ce produced 5-minute photo-essay video that vividly demonstrates results, advocates UNDP\u2019s role in rebuilding livelihoods of poor communities in a post-Tsunami crisis setting, and supports resource mobilisation. Brief Description: The 26 December tsunami was Malaysia\u2019s worst ever natural disaster, striking poor coastal \ufb01shing communities of Kedah and Penang. Among others, som 6000 \ufb01shermen were affected with more than 3000 boats being damaged or destroyed. The CO mobilized some limited resources through BCPR to help tsunami victims. Based on a participatory assessment, the CO chose to use these resources to procure locally made \ufb01shing boats, nets and related gear. Such assistance contributes towards income-generation and rebuilding the livelihood of the poor \ufb01shermen, their families and communities. It is the emergency relief efforts of other (non-UNDP) agencies that tend to grab the headlines when humanitarian crises break. UNDP\u2019s role, which tends to occur in a media-scarce environment, may be less glamorous but has greater impact from a development perspective. The production of this photo-essay video helps to demonstrate this. The video enhances an understanding of impact and response, and captures the emotions of people. It helps foster partnerships with government, NGOs, community and the media. Through this communication tool, the work of UNDP as an effective development partner is made visible. It advocates UNDP\u2019s role in post- crisis recovery and shows UNDP\u2019s comparative strength in facilitating the transition from emergency relief to development. This photo essay is easily replicable with minimal production costs and high potential bene\ufb01ts.

Initially the small nation of islands was largely overlooked by the international community, so to raise awareness about the situation in the Maldives, and to broaden fund-raising opportunities beyond the public sector, UNDP Maldives launched Adopt-An-Island. Brief Description: The December 26 2004 tsunami affected one-third of the population in the Maldives: leaving thousands homeless and many others with lost livelihoods. The Government and the international community moved quickly to deliver emergency aid, however, much external support is now needed to help the nation regain the development momentum that had propelled this country forward in previous years. Through Adopt- An-Island, the private sector, civil society, governments or individuals can directly support communities in the Maldives to get back on their feet. UNDP has identi\ufb01ed community-based projects on some of the worst affected islands. Support can be matched directly to critical recovery projects like the reconstruction of a home, jetty, or the rebuilding of damaged \ufb01shing boats. Adopt-An-Island supporters can see exactly where their contribution goes and can also see, \ufb01rst-hand, the results. UNDP Maldives provides all supporters with a colorful semi-annual and annual progress report with information about the communities they are assisting, and details of the recovery activities made possible through their support.

This legislation gives an opportunity to align the national development policies with the vision and strategies agreed upon in the Millennium Declaration from which the MDGs are emanated. Brief Description The Parliament of Mongolia has endorsed on 21st April 2005 a historic resolution on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), thus renewing and demonstrating country\u2019s \ufb01rm commitment to the Millennium Declaration signed by the President of Mongolia in September 2000 and related responsibilities to achieve MDGs by 2015. Through this legislative act Mongolia set a new 9th goal on \u201cFostering Democratic Governance and Strengthening Human Rights\u201d, with three additional country speci\ufb01c targets to respect and abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: ensure freedom of mass media and access to information; mainstream democratic principles and practice into life; and create an environment of zero- tolerance for corruption. The resolution is an outcome of a Special Session on MDGs for newly elected members of the national legislature, organized on November 2nd, 2004 by UNDP Mongolia in collaboration with the Parliament Secretariat. During this parliamentary session, local issues of aligning the MDGs to the country speci\ufb01c conditions, a need to monitor their implementation, and creation of a broad based partnership achieving the MDGs were discussed in detail. Also, the CO shared other country the global best undertake MDGs costing exercise with the state annual budget process. It was noted that without active involvement of parliamentarians, achieving MDGs may be impossible. Following this session a group of Parliament Members from across the party lines initiated a bill on the Mongolia speci\ufb01c MDGs, which now has been realized in the abovementioned legislative act. With \ufb01nancial help and technical expertise of UNDP and other UN agencies, the Government of Mongolia has led the process of preparing its \ufb01rst national MDG report which was launched by the President of Mongolia Mr. N. Bagabandi, in October 2004. The launch was followed by extensive advocacy activities aimed at raising awareness at all levels of the society, including general public, youth, policy makers and government of\ufb01cials. Now, UNDP Mongolia is supporting the Government of Mongolia\u2019s initiatives to achieve MDGs, including further alignment with the Economic Growth & Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGPRSP) monitoring and evaluation, its costing and budgeting, and localization. Full implementation of the 9th MDG is being assisted through our on- going support to the National Human Rights Action Programme (NHRAP), the National Programme for Combating Corruption (NPCC) and the formulation of the National Plan of Action for Consolidation of Democracy (NPACD), including piloting of country-speci\ufb01c Democratic Governance Indicators (DGIs), that could be replicated in many countries as follow-up to the 5th International Conference of New or Restored Democracies (ICNRD), held in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, 10-12 September 2003.

Self Reliance Groups incorporate gender issues into the community development and by giving voice to the women, the entire village bene\ufb01ts. Brief Description: When UNDP Myanmar began the Human Development Initiative (HDI) in 1994, major humanitarian challenges were poverty reduction at community level in rural areas. As the HDI was designed under an Executive Board mandate that stipulated that all aid must go directly to the grassroots, UNDP Myanmar responded by implementing community-based projects; constructing schools, providing sanitation and clean water and focusing on livelihoods. These attempts to aid communities in need were essential \ufb01rst steps. But over time UNDP began to realize that some segments of the villagers were slipping through the cracks. UNDP Myanmar resolved to put decision making into the hands of community at large, in order to redress these incongruities. At the same time UNDP Myanmar also acknowledged that an organization cannot simply \u201cgive\u201d voice, or \u201cempower\u201d marginalized people-, willingness to participate and feelings of social strength must originate within social actors themselves. UNDP began addressing this issue by encouraging the very poor to form af\ufb01nity associations called Self Reliance Groups (SRGs). Composed mostly of poor women, these groups pool savings and eventually invest in their own small income- generating activities. These groups experience social empowerment and begin to assertively articulate their needs. UNDP Myanmar combined this very localized form of community based organization with a slightly larger one: the community \u2013wide Village Assembly. In these community wide forums, townspeople now come together on more equal grounds to debate the priorities of the village. With help from UNDP, villages survey themselves to determine their own capacities and requirements; the people then come to an agreement on their collective needs and on what methods they will employ to address them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d08443d9-a802-4f38-a531-8f6913ea7c38": {"__data__": {"id_": "d08443d9-a802-4f38-a531-8f6913ea7c38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49c822ff8c04cadaae4db100f1174e63836566930be24b8928918ef33e988235"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c30c727-a2b4-4e28-8a42-07ca21521f43", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66c35fb46216df393659e9f83a6dc8f342c89ec9330d8698d06dd5e577ddd82e"}}, "hash": "f9749134365732c1d1cea311c3e8aaf36f358e944fca655575fde71a318c0a6c", "text": "In this way, communities feel ownership of development projects and everyone feels ownership of their communities.

Communities are empowered, rural energy policy and institutional capacities developed, and \ufb01nancing/ implementation partnership operationalised. Issues of poverty reduction, gender empowerment, vulnerability, governance and environmental sustainability are addressed. Brief Description: The system consists of micro-hydro electricity, biogas (attached to toilet), solar-home system and improved cooking stoves (ICS) operational in remote areas to provide urgent energy needs of the people (lighting, cooking, heating, health, communications, enterprise through rural energy technologies). A salient feature and a \u2018good practice\u2019 in energy technology provision is social capital formation (community mobilization, capacitation) as a necessary ingrained feature of the Rural Energy Development Programme (REDP) initiated since 1996 with UNDP support. This is the key reason for the success and continuation of the programme despite the current con\ufb02ict. The programme covers 25 out of the 75 districts of the country. National efforts are underway to replicate to other districts. Over 140 Systems are operational bene\ufb01ting 200,000 rural people with 50 per cent being the women bene\ufb01ciaries. Community mobilization process ensures inclusion of the disadvantaged groups. Village level micro-enterprises fostered by energy system, namely, agro-processing mills, carpentry, photo-studio, cable TV, tailoring, weaving-knitting, woodcarving, dairy, tea stalls, poultry- raising and fresh vegetable production, have been directly helping in employment promotion and sustainable livelihoods. The saving and credit systems have so far accumulated a total sum of NPR 22,103,095 and have invested NPR 48,123,663 (US$ 1 = approx. NPR 70) and strengthened rural multiplier effects Access to light and information technology such as TV, has increased children\u2019s school enrollment rates, study hours by 2-3 hours and educational performance, reduced \ufb01rewood collection burden of girl children and increased community awareness on issues beyond village boundaries. Toilet attached biogas plants, in addition to providing clean energy for cooking (and lighting) has signi\ufb01cantly reduced indoor air pollution of poorly ventilated rural kitchens and improved village sanitation. In places where biogas plants are not easily feasible ICSs have a positive gender dimension through reduced indoor air pollution. Additionally, the ICS and biogas plants reduce household \ufb01rewood requirement, and conserve local forests. Key lessons are (i) technology promotion and social capital formation go together, (ii) an appropriate energy-mix to address the multiple needs of rural people is important, (iii) lack of upfront capital means that rural people requires external support through grants and/or loan, (iv) in the context of Nepalese hills micro-hydro based systems, on the average, including transmission is cost-effective and has up-scaling potential (US$ 2000 vs. US$ 4000 for on-grid transmission), (v) private partnership for energy services, service delivery is crucial, and (vi) favourable policy and institutional mechanisms should be promoted. The formulation of national rural energy policy supported by the Energy Thematic Trust Fund validates these lessons. Similarly, provision of funding by the World Bank (US$ 5.5 million) to up-scale the REDP in over 150 villages attests its success. Global knowledge sharing is supported through academic exchanges with the University of Flensburg, Germany and participation in expo-fairs.

The trainings were on best practices of conducting mediation, legal education and capacity building of the people in understanding the cases. The guidelines for community mediation were made. During 2002-2004 more than 500 community people (basically backward ethnic groups i.e. Tharus, Sherpas, Thakalis and Bhotes) were trained on local con\ufb02ict mediation skills. The programme was successful in urging the district courts to promote community mediation by letting the two disputing parties settle their disputes outside the court. This practice reduced the feeling of winning or loosing, the threat, pressure upon judges during con\ufb02ict situation was eased, and justice was done when the poor people got a chance for fair settlement than a harsh verdict. One of the major achievements of the mediation programme in court cases is that the Supreme Court of Nepal has amended the District Court Rules (Fourth Amendment) 2003, that has institutionalized possibility of mediation in cases under trial in District Courts of Nepal. In 2002 as well as in 2003 and 2004, there were more cases of mediation and settlements than the targets. In total, in the last three years, over 4650 cases were mediated and 2833 cases were settled through the mediation process under this Programme. The total number of bene\ufb01ciaries was 15000. The total Programme cost in 3 years was US$ 6,72,191. During the programme period of 2002-2004, about 650 judges, lawyers, staff of courts and quasi-judicial bodies, retired judges and administrators were trained on court referred case mediation. Even after the closure of the mediation programme, many cases were mediated and amicably settled by the lawyers of the Programme districts without grants from UNDP. A Mediation Centre has been established, as an NGO, at the national level to promote mediation practices in different sectors in Nepal. Preparation of a draft umbrella law on mediation is also underway and expected to be \ufb01nalized by 2005-6.

Brief Description: Why: \u2022 All studies so far been conducted report reduced consumption of fuel wood and timber. Average saving of 60 percent of fuel wood per household annually \u2013 2.8 tones of fuel wood per year \u2022 Among other fuel-ef\ufb01cient products, the roof hatch window in Gilgit can be cited as one of the most ef\ufb01cient technology that has lowered \ufb01rewood and heating expenses \u2022 Women development has occurred through increased improvement in women\u2019s awareness, their role as resource persons, commission agents and increased comfort level and convenience in performing household chores and reduced work load. \u2022 Products are said to be economically viable and studies indicate that there is a lot of potential for wide scale replication of the products. What: \u2022 Fuel ef\ufb01cient stoves save energy and less biomass resources used for cooking and heating and water heating. \u2022 Light roofs with improved construction techniques saves 60% of timber for construction and thus natural biomass resources are conserved. \u2022 Thermal ef\ufb01cient housing construction techniques (insulation) lead to lower energy use, particularly fuel wood. (up to 70%) \u2022 Use of Galvanized iron wire for wall reinforcement as direct replacement of timber reinforcement for house construction in mountain (hence up to 100% reduction of timber use). \u2022 Improved lighting, ventilation, warmth, and hygienic in-house environment. How: \u2022 The GEF (Small Grants Programme) has provided funds to BACIP for training and development of Entrepreneurs. \u2022 The community participates in participatory research, development, extension, training and replication of the Interventions. \u2022 The BACIP programme of the Aga Khan Planning and Building services , Pakistan provides the technical research, intervention development & extension, training.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdc3883a-dc05-4014-990d-694eb63151d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdc3883a-dc05-4014-990d-694eb63151d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41c91b44fda1cb2d940fc65ac5cd51970268b80b78b870219c0eba62a0ec5c95"}, "2": {"node_id": "7b3edc74-eff0-4498-bb7e-82bc427a032d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4a8fee12694abf604c97d63c908706505f94a819d959e6b8d16b778fbe24c0c"}}, "hash": "257aa25e335f537efd71e67125f22babde028f6035427e3664e7efee4b10305a", "text": "Lessons Learned: \u2022 Signi\ufb01cant impact of BACIP products is expected on improved health, poverty alleviation and environmental conservation.

Brief Description: Why\u2018: \u2022 Devolution was introduced in Pakistan in 2001. The devolution reform in Pakistan, envisaged in the Local Government Ordinance 2001 is a far-reaching reform process, intended to empower citizens, improve delivery of public services, facilitate sustainability of local development initiatives, and to add to public sector resources through community mobilization of resources that most importantly will ensure community ownership. \u2022 The devolution process requires that monitoring information should be available frequently and there should be sound evidence for making policy decisions. \u2022 The social audit provides evidence for measuring the performance and impact of devolution in the country. The \ufb01ndings are based on citizens\u2019 feedback, information obtained from service providers and consultation with elected representatives at the local levels in all the provinces. \u2022 The \ufb01ndings of social audit provided a baseline for assessing improvements in key indicators of citizen experience of delivery of public services in health, education, water and sanitation, police, access to justice and local government. \u2022 Findings of social audit are used by National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB) for policy discussions and actions related to devolution. What: \u2022 The baseline social audit in all districts of Pakistan was undertaken in 2002-03 in collaboration with NRB to assess overall satisfaction of citizens with the devolution and public services. \u2022 The social audit covered about 57,000 households and included information from service facilities and service providers. \u2022 The 2002-03 social audit provided a baseline of citizens satisfaction with a range of public services including roads and transport; sewage and sanitation; garbage disposal; gas supply; electricity supply; health services; education; water supply; police; courts; and local government. \u2022 The second social audit cycle was initiated in 2004 to provide a basis to measure the performance of devolved system in Pakistan. The social audit process is being undertaken as part of overall activities of the Devolution Trust for Community Empowerment (DTCE) project for monitoring the state of devolution in Pakistan. How: \u2022 The social audit is anchored within NRB, which is the national think tank on reforms including devolution and police reforms. \u2022 A partnership has been forged among key donors to support the process. UNDP (Pakistan and PARAGON) and UNESCO provided seed money for the pilot audit in 10 districts. It was replicated in all the districts with funding from Canadian CIDA to establish the 2002 baseline. \u2022 The 2004 cycle of social audit is being undertaken with support from key partners under DTCE project to provide a basis of comparison with the baseline. Lessons learned and replicability: \u2022 Social audit is a long and complex exercise that is currently being undertaken with donor funding through international sub-contract with CIET International. There is a high cost involved in conducting this exercise, which requires reliance on donor funding unless national capacities are built to conduct this exercise. \u2022 The results of social audit are often sensitive and can have strong political implications in terms of regional and sub-regional variations of results and \ufb01ndings. This often delays sharing and dissemination of results.

With the harsh impacts of these activities in the early 80\u2019s such as \ufb02ooding that led to massive destruction of major parts of the island, engaging communities to become active partners in the program was uncomplicated. Multi-sectoral stakeholders who were mobilized to support the collective resolve of pursuing biodiversity conservation in Samar Island included civil society groups (local NGOs, community-based / people\u2019s / faith-based organizations), legislators (Congressmen in the three provinces of Samar Island) and the protected area & wildlife sector of the Environment ministry. The highlight of the process was the Samar Island Caravan, characterized by a street parade / mass demonstration participated by students, teachers, women and members of the affected communities, together with the major groups of stakeholders. This launched the series of dialogues and other advocacy activities that yielded signed Executive Proclamation for the SINP by President Macapagal-Arroyo and the issuance of local ordinances against mining. These results could well be attributed to the uni\ufb01ed purpose and political will among stakeholders after having understood the implications of the issue and the decision required of them. The process has effectively generated common understanding, call to action and fervent participation among affected stakeholders. The impact of the efforts was far reaching, considering that this was a community-based initiative that yielded a national governance response. It is a strategy that can well support Environmental Governance initiatives in other unique protected areas.

With a chemical-intensive strategy for food production, the country is one of heaviest users of pesticides in the world but this is now changing rapidly. 1) UNDP helped introduce IPM and EFA to policy-makers, researchers, extension of\ufb01cers and farmers alike, training more than 10,000 farmers and over 600 guidance of\ufb01cers nationwide in its use. 2) Dissemination of the results of farmers\u2019 trials and of the integration and harmonization of technologies and activities on agriculture to national and local policy-makers encouraged the formulation of a strategy combining food security with environmental preservation. 3) ROK became the \ufb01rst Asian nation to adopt a pesticide and fertilizer reduction policy and 4) established a commercial natural enemy production system. 5) Current targets call for reducing the use of pesticides and fertilizer by 40 per cent by the year 2013 under the Sustainable Agriculture Promotion Act legislated in 1997.

In addition to infrastructural damages, the natural environment was also particularly a\ufb00ected. Speci\ufb01cally, the \ufb02ying foxes, pigeons and the avifauna of Niue were highly a\ufb00ected as their habitats were destroyed by the cyclone. Further, there was no food for these animals as all the fruit trees were damaged. In a response to save the birds, pigeons and in particular the \ufb02ying foxes, a local environmentalist with the assistance of the UNDP-GEF Biodiversity project assisted by feeding the birds and the bats with fruit cans. It was the best available alternative at a very critical time. Brief Description: The fruit bat is the only native land mammal found on Niue and it has signi\ufb01cant importance to the biodiversity of Niue. The feeding programme was carried out in the backyard of the local environmentalist\u2019s house. This initiative helped the \ufb02ying foxes and other avifauna, which had lost not only their natural habitats but also source of food. The local environmentalist was awarded with an Award of Recognition from the Bats International Organization for his efforts in saving the \ufb02ying foxes.

The use of strategies within other national plans to achieve desired outcomes is lacking and absent in most PICs, a condition symptomatic with \u201cheadless chicken\u201d running in an uncoordinated fashion and in all directions. In this practice, the UNDP CO in Samoa is leading the charge in advising countries to be strategic by mirroring the format of the NBSAP process when preparing other national environment plans and strategies. Brief Description: By providing policy advice, UNDP Samoa is endeavoring to support Government\u2019s to redesign their approach to developing national plans/strategies by using more strategic tools that resonate positive impacts to ensure project sustainability when funding ceases and improving national coordination to achieve desired outcomes. These tools are: (a) Strategy for securing \ufb01nancial resources whereby a strategy outlining sources for funding particular activities of a plan; (b) Communication strategy for upfront planning and preparation to effectively communicate a project\u2019s purpose and outcomes with the public. It consists of stakeholder analysis that identi\ufb01es the target group for raising awareness and more importantly researching interest groups and opinion leaders who will carry the message. Simpli\ufb01cation of message for all audience is important and this is re\ufb02ected in Niue\u2019s approach whereby public awareness campaigns where identi\ufb01ed as inception phase activities. The use of billboards to raise awareness of POPs in Niue is a great example of using both English and Indigenous language; (c) Strategy for monitoring national plans/strategies that provides a clear and concise process on how Government Ministries and stakeholders intends to monitor the performance of a national plan. This strategy will also identify each players role and responsibilities in the implementation of certain activities; (d) Strategy for national coordination entails the use of National Task Team framework as the of\ufb01cial mechanism for coordinating national plans/strategies activities. A prime example is found in Samoa\u2019s Persistent Organic Pollutant (POPs) Project acceptance in principle to integrate these plans in their National Implementation Plan (NIP. This will provide clear direction as to the level of commitment and support of Governments to sustain project activities that are recommended in national plans/strategies.

The project resulted in a good collaboration between 2 UN agencies, the Government of Samoa and the Samoa Umbrella of Non Governmental Organization (SUNGO). The execution was originally with UNDP but was handed over to the SUNGO o\ufb03ce in the hope to increase SUNGO\u2019s capacity building in project management.

UNDP strives to use opportunities by negotiating with countries to share resources and technical expertise made available to LDC and/or SIDS countries by UN agencies and funds. In this case, UNDP CO in Samoa negotiated the participation of Niue\u2019s POPs Team to the upcoming UNITAR training for the development of POPs National Implementation Plans (NIP). In addition, the Technical Cooperation between Developing Countries (TCDC) fund by UNDP and donors provided the opportunity for practical attachments by Policy Analyst and Planners for the Governments of Niue and Cook Islands to exchange valuable knowledge between countries experience in national planning, aid coordination and resource allocation as a viable means to advance MDG achievements. Brief Description: The upcoming UNITAR training for Samoa\u2019s POPs NIP will invite 2 participants from Niue\u2019s POPs project who are at the similar stage with Samoa\u2019s NIP. This practice ensures that training bene\ufb01ts for LDC countries may be extended to other Paci\ufb01c Island Countries who are not LDC such as Niue but have similar projects such as the POPs. This also supports the exchanging of knowledge, lessons learned and challenges and their possible solutions among countries who would not have had the opportunity to do so given their status recognition as a Non-LDC.

The program brings together local and foreign volunteers to repair damaged reefs and plans for the future of Thailand\u2019s coastal environment. Brief Description: The tsunami blanketed areas of coral reef with sand and land-based backwash. Some of this coral is in danger of being killed off. The majority of Thais to be adversely affected by coral reef degradation are poor people whose livelihoods depend on coastal \ufb01shing and tourism industries \u2013 both of these depend in part on healthy coral eco-systems. UNDP provided funding for a volunteer clean-up operation which has attracted the attention of divers from all over the globe. UNDP also provided heavy equipment and training on how to effectively remove debris from stricken areas. An assessment mission following the tsunami concluded that a fast response by way of coral reef cleaning was needed. The clean-up operation expanded to one of rehabilitation, which in turn will lead to another project to \u201cremap\u201d Andaman coastal areas in terms of socio-economic and environmental sustainability. The programme has solidi\ufb01ed positive relationships between UNDP and the Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, and at the local level with the Phuket Marine Biological Marine Research Centre, the main implementing body. UNDP\u2019s chief role has been one of \ufb01nancier, coordinator, and provider of expertise. The greatest lesson leaned has been the importance of \u201cfast response\u201d during environmentally catastrophic situations. The Thai government has lauded UNDP Thailand for the speed in which this program was implemented. While the programme is ongoing, it will be used as a case study to determine the needs of reefs damaged by natural disasters. It has also been bene\ufb01cial to the Thai government and UNDP on the need for public awareness to garner international support. This programme could be replicated anywhere coral reefs have suffered damage due to naturally occurring disasters.

The district court judges, prosecutors and public defenders were all recent graduates from Indonesian faculties, when appointed by the UN administration (UNTAET) in 2000, without any professional experience, on a temporary basis, after a brief training course. These court actors have gained valuable hands-on experience in their functions, in the new Timor-Leste\u2019s courts. But their education and legal language is decreasingly relevant. In the Timor-Leste system, a Judicial Training Centre (JTC), sorting administratively under the Ministry of Justice, is responsible for providing post-graduate professional training for judges, prosecutors and public defenders. In the beginning of the project the JTC was partially inactive for lack of a legal framework, curriculum and trainers. Getting things in motion in JTC as early as possible was a matter of strategic importance. The \ufb01rst task was to introduce a legal framework. In August-September 2004, the project assisted the Ministry of Justice in drafting two decrees, the legal framework to activate JTC, and submitting them to the Council of Ministers. The decrees in question were: \u2022 Decree Law 6/2004 - Organic Law for the Judicial Training Centre, which organizes the institution, and \u2022 Decree Law 15/2004 on Recruitment and Training for Access to the Careers of the Magistrates and Public Defenders, which makes JTC graduation a condition for appointment. Between September-November 2004, the JTC offered preparatory training in legal Portuguese and basic legal principles. A subsequent evaluation would regulate access to the \ufb01rst class of trainees undergoing a full, 2 \u00bd-year training programme, which started in early 2005 under Decree Law 15/2004. The project staff assisted the Executive Committee of JTC in drafting the preparatory programme. Ordinary training at JTC consists of three parts: \ufb01rst a one-year curriculum at JTC; then a six-month practical training period under mentoring in an institution, followed by one year on provisional appointment, leading up to permanent appointment. There will be consecutive evaluation processes along the way. A total of 61 trainees started the preparatory training, of which 40 passed and had access to the full, ordinary training programme, which started in January 2005. As a matter of policy, the JTC favors the use of Portuguese. Many trainees had dif\ufb01culties in accompanying the classes for lack of language skills. To help alleviate the problem, the project provided all trainees with language-training books, legal and language dictionaries, and offered to set up extra-curricular language classes. As such, JTC plays a crucial role in standardised quality control. In addition to training contemporary court actors, the JTC should eventually become self-sustainable and prepare future personnel.

Brief Description: As Timor-Leste became the world\u2019s youngest independent country on 20 May 2005, its 1m people had no traditions of statehood whatsoever. An entire state apparatus \u2013 president, parliament, government and judiciary \u2013 is being introduced from scratch. In the period 2000-2002, the UN administration of East Timor (UNTAET) set up embryonic institutions for the new country. The international community was mainly preoccupied with the government and civil service. The executive was therefore evolving faster than the accountability mechanisms (legislature and judiciary).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3fd09533-6b5d-4aca-a940-d86749a4964c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3fd09533-6b5d-4aca-a940-d86749a4964c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Compendium of RBAP Country Office \u2018Good Practices\u2019", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc68349dba4c95170631f99b1872e1aa7ea318d60430dfc96171433ecb1bcd86"}, "2": {"node_id": "047875f5-d526-4acb-abef-5539e2bf0d23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/compendium-rbap-country-office-good-practices", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb6c3a445b8ba0e4bbc0d1dfe315fd751c29ca527ca41d10c824515d4c6af5fb"}}, "hash": "69bc7ff83c47501fc51bd1b959691628ed13f38b14bb4bb27ecdd582a24f13de", "text": "The executive was therefore evolving faster than the accountability mechanisms (legislature and judiciary). In this setting, a \ufb01rst \u201cbest practice\u201d by UNDP was to detect, at an early stage, a growing imbalance between the constitutional powers, and to realize that the justice system needed increased support. A second \u201cbest practice\u201d relates to how the support was increased: The justice system in Timor-Leste includes three constitutionally separate institutions \u2013 the courts and prosecution on one hand, and the justice ministry on the other, often referred to as the \u201cthree pillars\u201d of the justice system. UNDP early realized that justice delivery would be heading for chaos if these three set different priorities and introduced incompatible routines. Instead of launching separate projects \u2013 one for the courts, one for the prosecution service, and another for the justice ministry \u2013 UNDP set about to unite the \u201cthree pillars\u201d behind a common development plan.

By mid-2003, the \u201cthree pillars\u201d agreed it would be easier to sit down together and discuss things directly. The good proposals were assembled and made into a UNDP project document. The justice minister, chief judge and prosecutor- general agreed to form a Council of Coordination (CoC) to act as the steering committee of the project, and in general to coordinate donor support and policies for institutional development. The council has since matured into an effective coordinating body. As a result, there is now a clear sense of direction in the sector. The government\u2019s policy for sector development has the full backing of the courts and prosecution. There is no longer any doubt which languages, or laws, to use in legal affairs. Compulsory, standardised training has been introduced for judges, prosecutors and public defenders. The prisons service is aiming for international standards. A uniform case management system is being designed for all the involved in a legal matter \u2013 from police, to prosecutors and defenders, all the way up to the courts. CO Focal Point: Naoki.

Brief Description: Covering a sample of 1,000 people across Viet Nam, the survey commissioned by UNDP in 2003 (analysed and reported on in 2004) provided some unique, disaggregated data on the Access to Justice - situation in the country. The survey shows that legal awareness and access to key judicial institutions is generally low, and that there are great disparities in A2J between different groups in society. At the same time, it indicates that people\u2019s perceptions of the ongoing legal reforms are generally positive. The results of the survey were very timely released as Viet Nam put the \ufb01nal touches to the Legal Systems Development Strategy (LSDS) and prepared for the drafting of the Judicial Reform Strategy \u2013 and served as a key basis for UNDP\u2019s advocacy and policy dialogue with the Government in this connection. The publication of the survey report also coincided with the \ufb01nalisation of the CCA and the UNDAF, and thus could help substantiate the arguments of these two documents in an area (governance) that is otherwise suffering form an acute need of data and indicators. The survey can serve as a best practice for other similar initiatives in other governance areas in Viet Nam as well as in neighbouring countries, where A2J is still perceived to be a politically sensitive area and opportunities for donor interventions are few.

More than 5 years have already elapsed since the Millennium Declara- tion was adopted and considering the distance still to traverse by 2015, there is little time to lose. If success is to be achieved, ensuring gender equality and women's empowerment will be essential, given the relevance of gender concerns to all of the MDGs. This fact was recognized by governments at the September 2005 World Sum- mit who collectively affirmed that \u201cprogress for women is progress for all.\u201d The Asia and Pacific region\u2019s performance on gender-related issues has been mixed. Despite substantial progress toward gender parity in edu- cation, the region is seriously \u201coff track\u201d on other indicators of women\u2019s capabilities and opportu- nities. Given the importance of gender equality to the MDGs in general, slow progress on gender issues may harm the overall MDG achievement. It is essential, therefore, to prioritize efforts toward gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. This paper has been prepared to inform policymakers in the region about the current situ- ation and provide a guide to interventions urgently needed in this crucial area. It is the result of a tripartite regional partnership on the MDGs between the Asian Development Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commis- sion for Asia and the Pacific. The partnership supports preparation of reports and technical papers, the dissemination of their findings and consultation, and dialogue with policymakers and stakeholders in order to ensure that the MDGs are achieved in the region. This technical paper is part of a series study- ing in detail identified critical issues and prob- lems concerning the timely achievement of the MDGs and complementing the regional MDG reports, two of which have so far been published: the first in June 2003 (Promoting the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific: Meet- ing the Challenges of Poverty Reduction) and the second in September 2005 (A Future Within Reach: Reshaping Institutions in a Region of Disparities to meet the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific). The paper as- sesses regional performance related to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, identifies some of the main challenges to further progress, and provides examples of promising interven- tions and supportive institutions to guide future actions. This paper is intended to help all those com- mitted to achieving the MDGs and improving the lives of the millions of poor and marginalized women, men, and children in this region. We hope that they find the information and technical advice presented here useful in their endeavors.

Gender, Development, and the Millennium Development Goals The countries of Asia and the Pacific recognize equality between men and women as a matter of fundamental rights and citizenship. Virtually all countries in the region are parties to the Con- vention on the Elimination of All Forms of Dis- crimination Against Women (CEDAW), and equality between the sexes is expressly guaran- teed in many constitutions and statutes. Yet despite these formal commitments, and the dem- onstrated benefits of gender equality to societies and economies, gender discrimination remains pervasive in the region. At the UN Millennium Summit in Septem- ber 2000, governments from this region and else- where committed to address gender inequities in several areas in order to reduce poverty, hun- ger, and disease and promote more sustainable development. In addition to the general commit- ment to gender equality and women\u2019s empow- erment, the Millennium Declaration adopted at the Summit included time-bound targets to achieve equal access at all levels of education, to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters, to combat all forms of violence against women, and to implement CEDAW. The MDGs that were sub- sequently developed to implement the Millen- nium Declaration capture most, but not all, of these commitments. While there is broad sup- port for the gender-specific MDGs\u2013Goal 3 on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, and Goal 5 on maternal health\u2014the MDGs as a whole have been widely critiqued for their nar- row approach to gender issues. In addition to Goals 3 and 5, only two other MDGs\u2013Goal 2 on education and Goal 6/Target 7 on HIV/AIDS- Executive Summary x Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific include gender-specific or gender-disaggregated indicators. (In contrast, international instru- ments, such as CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action,3 and national policies and action plans to promote gender equality, take a much more comprehensive approach to address gender inequities.) In light of these limitations, there is widespread agreement that Goals 3 and 5 need to be broadly interpreted within the frameworks of CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action. Notably, the World Summit held in September 2005 endorsed the broader view of gender equal- ity goals reflected in the Beijing Platform. Sev- eral countries in Asia and the Pacific have already interpreted Goals 3 and 5 more broadly through their own MDG targets and indicators. Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals Despite substantial progress in narrowing gen- der gaps in educational enrollments, the region\u2019s overall performance in promoting gender equal- ity and women\u2019s empowerment has been mixed. This is reflected most clearly in the \u201ctracking\u201d analysis undertaken by the joint regional MDG report prepared by the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB),4 which found that more than three quar- ters of countries in the region are \u201con track\u201d in narrowing gender gaps in educational enroll- ments (Goal 3/Target 4), while more than two thirds of countries are clearly \u201coff track\u201d in reducing maternal mortality (Goal 5/Target 6). When all of the indicators for Goal 3 are consid- ered including nonagricultural wage employment and representation in national parliaments the picture is even more uneven. Goal 3\u2013promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Virtually no country in Asia and the Pacific is making equal progress on all of the indicators for Goal 3. Several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand, as well as Sri Lanka and some Pacific countries, have achieved gender parity in education at rela- tively high levels of enrollment, but this has not translated into equal participation in economic and political affairs. Cambodia has one of the highest levels of women\u2019s economic participation in the region, but women\u2019s education and literacy remain low with gender gaps at all levels. Cen- tral Asian countries, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyz Republic, have struggled to maintain education services since the fall of the Soviet Union, and girls\u2019 enrollment levels have remained high although gender gaps are widen- ing at the secondary level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1ec2ed92-904d-47b6-951a-03cc1b165836": {"__data__": {"id_": "1ec2ed92-904d-47b6-951a-03cc1b165836", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7eb2191a548dc81c22fc20eb6c53d33f994ea605fc16f061b7bce29352f7b8c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "3b5a7175-2eeb-48d4-802f-dcce20a9e474", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "391df2a9930787180634f7b6672e86d3834607a6ff061fc50d46057ba9f26478"}}, "hash": "6c593b6b4f7eec4e6b260bbf3fdc281f9d7dc0ecba635ff9fda828524a4863c1", "text": "At the same time, women\u2019s wage employment and representation in national parliaments have fallen sharply.

These groups are particularly affected by limited access to basic services. Refugee and internally- displaced women, and women in conflict- affected areas, are also exposed to high levels of harassment and violence. Most of the MDG progress reports for coun- tries in the Asia and Pacific region go beyond the international target and indicators for Goal 3, and report on progress and challenges in other areas related to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Some of the frequently identi- fied issues include (1) the persistence of gender- based stereotypes and discriminatory practices; (2) pervasive patterns of violence against women; (3) gender inequality in landownership; and (4) different impacts of migration, trafficking, and displacement of women and men. Several countries have also developed additional targets and indicators beyond the core international indicators for Goal 3 that are consistent with the broader set of gender equality objectives endorsed at the World Summit. Despite substan- tial progress in narrowing gender gaps in educational enrollments, the region\u2019s overall performance in promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment has been mixed. Further progress also requires strong political commitment at all levels and changes in prevailing social norms and attitudes. xi Goal 5\u2013improving maternal health. Despite substantial investments in health inter- ventions by governments, donors, and nongov- ernment organizations (NGOs), women in many countries across Asia and the Pacific continue to suffer high rates of death or disability associated with childbirth, respiratory and waterborne dis- eases, and malnutrition and anemia, as well as increasing rates of HIV infection. The MDGs take a fragmented approach to women\u2019s health, with the main focus being on maternal health (Goal 5) and more specifically maternal mortality (Tar- get 6). Conspicuously absent from the MDGs is a goal directly addressing women\u2019s sexual and reproductive health, although this is a core ele- ment of women\u2019s general health and also critical to women\u2019s control over their own lives. The recent World Summit addressed this omission by explicitly endorsing \u201cequal access to reproduc- tive health\u201d in its commitments to gender equal- ity and women\u2019s empowerment. As in education, some regional patterns emerge. In the Greater Mekong Subregion5 and South Asia, most countries started from extremely high levels of maternal mortality, with very lim- ited maternal health services provided in rural areas. These countries are reducing maternal deaths as they extend and improve basic health services in the rural areas (albeit at very differ- ent rates of progress). In contrast, before 1990, the Central Asian countries generally had well- developed health facilities staffed with skilled personnel in rural as well as urban areas, and relatively low maternal mortality rates. These health systems came under considerable strain during the 1990s as health budgets were cut, and several of these countries as well as Mongolia have seen their maternal mortality rates climb as the quality of rural health services has deteriorated (in Azerbaijan, from 22 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 94 in 2000). By 1990, Southeast Asian countries, such as Malaysia and Thailand, had already made significant progress in lowering their maternal mortality rates through steady and strategic investment in their rural health systems. Now they are finding it harder and more expen- sive to extend maternal health services to the most underserved groups, migrant women and women in the very remote rural areas. In the Pacific, maternal mortality rates and rates of skilled attendance at birth are generally better than for the region as a whole (with Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands lagging behind). However, women on remote islands and in the highlands of Papua New Guinea have little access to maternal health services. Notwithstanding these regional differences, MDG progress reports and other sources point to several common factors contributing to the high levels of maternal deaths in Asia and the Pacific. These include: (1) lack of quality emer- gency obstetric care provided by skilled and cul- turally appropriate health personnel; (2) lack of public investment in basic health services, espe- cially in poor provinces in the context of decen- tralization; (3) formal and informal fees for health services; (4) low levels of contraceptive use; (5) women\u2019s poor nutrition and overall health; (6) adolescent pregnancy and early mar- riage; and (7) lack of male involvement in reproductive health matters.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d50c5bb-0b69-4ef6-9bf0-9d734adeb8c2": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d50c5bb-0b69-4ef6-9bf0-9d734adeb8c2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0361244f49caa2280395894543d1925ef52b02c21e5590fc53d6f78e15121fa4"}, "2": {"node_id": "82c22a5c-b215-45f9-8ea6-1ca13964659e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "711e9055cc856bf77eab5764b489d6a4bce487c752d5545c1b3d2cf429245ee6"}}, "hash": "4495708ed6022c9c44f34833c0d9a660b213b5c5925961577f9ba6c0ab947bfa", "text": "Consistent with the commitments made at the World Summit, sev- eral countries in the region have expanded their national targets and indicators under Goal 5 to include access to reproductive health services.

Even so, MDG progress reports and other studies from Asian and Pacific countries confirm the interrelationships between the gen- der-specific MDGs and all of the other goals, as well as the importance of including a gender per- spective in any strategy to achieve these goals. The paper reviews the gender dimensions of regional progress under several of the MDGs, including Goal 1 (eradicating extreme poverty and hunger), Goal 2 (achieving universal pri- mary education), Goal 4 (reducing child mor- Executive Summary xii Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific tality), Goal 6 (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases), Goal 7 (ensuring environ- mental sustainability), and Goal 8 (developing a global partnership for development). Future Directions The Asia and Pacific region has made progress toward Goal 3, particularly in narrowing gender gaps in primary and secondary education and raising literacy rates. However, progress on the indicators of economic and political empower- ment under Goal 3 has been mixed, and most countries are not reducing maternal mortality rates fast enough under Goal 5. The region\u2019s uneven performance under the other MDGs also affects the prospects for improving women\u2019s capabilities, access to resources and opportuni- ties, and security. The paper summarizes some of the common challenges to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the region, and then provides examples of promising interventions and supportive institutions to guide future actions. Regional challenges. Some of the chal- lenges to gender equality shared by countries in the region include (1) addressing entrenched at- titudes and behaviors related to gender roles and women\u2019s status; (2) mitigating the risks and negative impacts of migration and displacement, especially on young women and girls; (3) maxi- mizing the benefits and minimizing the costs of regional integration, especially for poor women and men; (4) managing decentralization pro- cesses to ensure equitable delivery of basic ser- vices and opportunities for women to participate in local decision making; and (5) strengthening the implementation of national laws and poli- cies and the effectiveness of national institutions to promote gender equality, and improving legal awareness and access to justice, especially among women in poor and marginalized communities. Promising initiatives. Based on a compre- hensive survey of worldwide trends, initiatives, and research results, the UN Millennium Project6 has recommended seven strategic priority areas for achieving gender equality and empowering women, almost all of which were endorsed by governments at the recent World Summit. These include: (1) ensuring postprimary education for girls and young women; (2) guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health and rights; (3) provid- ing time-saving infrastructure; (4) ensuring equal property rights; (5) improving employment opportunities and working conditions, especially for poor women; (6) combating all forms of vio- lence against women and girls; and (7) improv- ing women\u2019s representation in political bodies, especially at the local level. These strategic pri- orities are already reflected in the national gen- der action plans of most countries in the region, as well as in specific initiatives supported by gov- ernments, development agencies and banks, NGOs, and community-based organizations. The paper highlights examples of initiatives already being taken in each strategic area. Supportive institutions. Strategic initia- tives to reduce gender gaps and empower women and girls are more effective when they are sup- ported by equitable and responsive institutions. These include law and policy frameworks, gov- ernment planning and budget processes, accountability and enforcement mechanisms, and partnerships with women\u2019s organizations and other key actors. Regional partnerships can also play a key role, especially on gender issues that have cross-border implications. The paper con- siders some of the gender-responsive institutions already in place in Asia and the Pacific, drawing on countries\u2019 recent progress reports on their implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. Conclusions and Recommendations The Asia and Pacific region faces a number of challenges to the achievement of gender equal- ity, but it is also home to some of the world\u2019s most innovative and successful strategies for nar- rowing gender gaps and empowering women.

These World Summit commitments sup- port the broader view of MDGs 3 and 5 that many countries in the region have already taken through their own national development goals, targets, and indicators. The World Summit com- mitments to gender equality, therefore, provide a sound framework for governments, civil soci- ety groups, and development agencies to pursue more gender-equitable development outcomes in the region. The final section of the paper rec- ommends a number of actions that each of these key stakeholder groups can take to implement these commitments and further their own gen- der equality goals. However, meaningful progress will not be made without strong political com- mitment at all levels and changes in prevailing social norms and attitudes. xiv Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific 1 I. Introduction The Millennium Declaration endorsed by the world\u2019s governments in September 2000 recog- nizes that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are among the most effective ways to \u201ccombat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustain- able.\u201d7 At the World Summit in September 2005, governments reaffirmed their conviction that \u201cprogress for women is progress for all.\u201d8 This paper (a) analyzes the progress of developing countries in Asia and the Pacific toward achieve- ment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that explicitly promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; (b) examines the gender dimensions of countries\u2019 progress toward the other MDGs; and (c) recommends future directions that countries and their development partners can take, indi- vidually or regionally, to make more consistent and sustainable progress in closing gender gaps and empowering women and girls in the region. The paper is based on a review of data from the Millennium Indicators Database hosted by the United Nations (UN) Statistical Division and trend analysis prepared for the 2005 joint United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and Asian Development Bank (ADB) MDG Report: A Future Within Reach: Reshaping Institutions in a Region of Disparities to Meet the Millennium Develop- ment Goals in Asia and the Pacific; MDG progress reports and national poverty reduction strate- gies of countries in the region; recent country gender assessments; and other relevant sources.9 The paper also draws on the findings and rec- ommendations from recent reports on worldwide trends related to gender equality, women\u2019s empowerment and women\u2019s health\u2014including reports from the UN Millennium Project10\u2014and considers their relevance in the Asian and Pacific context.

For a country with substantial gender gaps at primary and secondary levels, the estimated costs between 2005 and 2015 could include an average annual loss of 0.4 percentage points in economic growth, up to 0.6 additional children per women, up to an additional 32 child deaths per year (per 1,000 live births), and an average 2.5 percentage points higher prevalence of underweight children.12 Yet despite countries\u2019 formal commitments to gender equality, and the demonstrated ben- efits to societies and economies, gender discrimi- nation remains pervasive throughout Asia and the Pacific. There have been advances in several ar- eas over the past 20 years. However, there are significant variations across and within countries, and gender gaps persist in access to education and quality health care, employment and busi- ness opportunities, political participation and decision making, personal security, and access to justice. At the UN Millennium Summit in Septem- ber 2000, governments from this region and else- where committed to address gender inequities in several areas in order reduce poverty, hunger and disease and promote more sustainable de- velopment. In addition to a general commitment to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, the UN Millennium Declaration adopted at the Summit included time-bound targets to achieve equal access at all levels of education, to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters, to combat all forms of violence against women and to imple- ment CEDAW. The MDGs that were subse- quently developed to implement the Millennium Declaration capture most, but not all, of these commitments (see Box 1).

However, there is no corresponding MDG for the Millennium Declaration commit- ments to combat violence against women and to implement CEDAW. While there is broad support for the gender- specific MDGs\u2014Goal 3 on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, and Goal 5 on mater- nal health\u2014the MDGs as a whole have been widely critiqued for their narrow approach to gender issues. Gender inequalities operate on several levels\u2014within households and in com- munities, markets and government institutions\u2014 and in virtually all spheres of social, economic and political activity. International instruments, such as CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action,13 and national policies and action plans to promote gender equality, therefore, have taken a comprehensive approach to address gender inequities. The Beijing Platform, for example, includes 12 critical areas of concern, including poverty, education, health, violence, armed con- flict, the economy, power and decision making, human rights, media, the environment, and the particular needs and vulnerabilities of girls. In contrast, the MDG targets only address educa- tion and maternal deaths (although the indica- tors for MDG 3 also include women\u2019s participation in nonagricultural employment and national legislatures). In addition to Goals 3 and 5, only two other MDGs\u2014Goal 2 on education and Goal 6/Target 7 on HIV/AIDS\u2014include gen- der-specific or gender-disaggregated indicators. In light of these limitations, there is wide- spread agreement that Goals 3 and 5 need to be broadly interpreted within the frameworks of CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action. At the same time, the gender dimensions of all of the other MDGs need to be recognized and moni- tored.14 As the UN Millennium Project and others have pointed out, the MDGs are interdependent. Countries are unlikely to make meaningful progress in reducing poverty, improving children\u2019s access to education and quality health care, reducing the burden of infectious diseases, or improving access to safe water and improved sanitation, unless they take into account the dif- ferent vulnerabilities of poor women and men, and the sociocultural and other conditions that limit poor women\u2019s and girls\u2019 access to basic ser- vices (see Box 2). As discussed further below, sev- eral countries have also \u201clocalized\u201d the MDGs, including Goals 3 and 5, to better reflect the progress they have already made in several areas as well as the more ambitious targets they have set in their national development plans. In September 2004, 44 governments from Asia and the Pacific convened in Bangkok to review the region\u2019s 10-year progress in imple- menting the Beijing Platform for Action. The \u201cBangkok Communiqu\u00e9\u201d issued at the conclu- sion of the meeting confirmed the importance of linking governments\u2019 commitments in the Mil- lennium Declaration, the Beijing Platform, and CEDAW. The Communiqu\u00e9 also identified areas of progress, continuing gaps, and challenges in pursuing gender equality and women\u2019s empow- erment in Asia and the Pacific. These findings are also pertinent to this year\u2019s review of the region\u2019s progress toward the MDGs, and particu- larly Goals 3 and 5 (see Appendix 1). Notably, the World Summit held in September 2005 endorsed the broader view of gender equality goals reflected in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (see Appendix 2).

Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals Regional Patterns and Variations Given the diversity of cultures, economic systems, and levels of development, forms of governance and physical environments across Asia and the Pacific, it is not surprising to find diverse pat- terns among regional countries in their progress toward the MDGs. For the gender-specific goals, wide divergence could also be expected in view of the very different gender profiles of countries in the major subregions. In most of the countries of South Asia, for example, conservative norms, particularly in the rural areas, continue to re- strict women\u2019s activities outside the home, with wide-ranging implications for their access to ser- vices, economic activities and participation in decision making. In contrast, Soviet-era policies in the Central Asian countries strongly encour- aged women\u2019s employment and participation in government, and supported a wide range of so- cial services to enable women to juggle work with household duties. The gender-equitable norms of the Soviet era were severely undermined, how- ever, by the economic and social upheaval that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union, with profound consequences for both women and men. In East and Southeast Asia, the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and the Pacific, gen- der-related norms are generally less rigid than in South Asia, but there is considerable diversity even within countries, with stark contrasts between urban and rural areas and between matriarchal and patriarchal social groups.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "701eec73-4e39-474a-9455-c5b51850faa8": {"__data__": {"id_": "701eec73-4e39-474a-9455-c5b51850faa8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5bd9ac2f3ac8bd8835577650263dbefe3b5ebaa1c9d0b5076224e83d68e2d9c9"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7acd517-0c50-4d46-b517-553e8366f5ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "079100c0169d95b7848c8ad718a7abc36bbb29e3624cf8279d5830b2f9adfd8a"}}, "hash": "5f7fd2749fa93a0ca86e59ab58ba81d4174f9eb89dcc99beafb889c6563e7823", "text": "This regional diversity is reflected in coun- tries\u2019 progress toward the MDGs, including Goals 3 and 5.

In contrast, coun- tries in Central Asia are struggling to restore their human development indicators to the levels of the 1980s. The less-developed countries of South Asia and the GMS are making progress toward many of the goals, but from extremely low lev- els. The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and India, with the largest economies and popula- tions in the region, have seen substantial declines in income poverty, but their progress on the nonincome MDGs has been mixed. Most coun- tries\u2019 progress toward the MDGs, as reflected in national-level targets and indicators, masks wide disparities between urban and rural areas, with the least progress found in remote rural and con- flict-affected areas, and among disadvantaged ethnic minority groups and castes, internally dis- placed people and migrants. As discussed below, these intra-country disparities are particularly evident for Goals 3 and 5 (gender parity in edu- cation and maternal mortality). Despite substantial progress in narrowing gender gaps in educational enrollments, the region\u2019s overall performance in promoting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment has been mixed. This is reflected most clearly in the \u201ctrack- ing\u201d analysis undertaken in the UNESCAP/ UNDP/ADB joint regional MDG report,15 which found that more than three quarters of countries Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals 8 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific are \u201con track\u201d in narrowing gender gaps in edu- cational enrollments (Goal 3/Target 4), while more than two thirds of countries are clearly \u201coff track\u201d in reducing maternal mortality (Goal 5/ Target 6). When all of the indicators for Goal 3 are considered\u2014including nonagricultural wage employment and representation in national par- liaments\u2014the picture is even more mixed. It is therefore extremely important not to conflate Goal 3 (to promote gender equality and empower women) with Target 4 (to eliminate gender dis- parities in education). While equal access to qual- ity education is a key component of Goal 3, it is not an adequate indicator in itself of gender equality or women\u2019s empowerment. As discussed below, such countries as the Fiji Islands and Sri Lanka have achieved close to gender parity in education, but this has not automatically trans- lated into high levels of economic and political participation for women. Any assessment of progress under Goal 3 should, at a minimum, take into account all of the Goal 3 indicators as well as the Goal 5 indicators. In their own as- sessments of progress on Goal 3, many countries in the region have gone farther and considered women\u2019s access to nonformal education, repro- ductive health services, land and credit; gender segregation and gender wage gaps in employ- ment; increases in women\u2019s informal sector work and migration; increasing HIV infections among women; increased trafficking of women and girls; and the prevalence of domestic violence and other forms of violence against women. Indexes such as the Gender-Related Devel- opment Index and Gender Empowerment Mea- sure developed by UNDP provide composite measures of gender equality and women\u2019s em- powerment, and permit the ranking of countries in terms of their gender-related achievements. Alternatively, countries can also be ranked in terms of their performance under the gender- related MDGs. For purposes of this paper, coun- tries in the Asia and Pacific region have been ranked on their performance under eight gen- der-related MDG indicators. Countries that are among the 10 most poorly performing in the re- gion on five or more of these indicators include several countries in South Asia (Afghanistan, In- dia, Nepal and Pakistan), as well as countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (Cambodia and Lao PDR) and the Pacific (Papua New Guinea)16 (see Appendix 3). Countries\u2019 performance on the individual MDG indicators is discussed further below. There has been much discussion of the links between the MDGs and other development goals, such as economic growth. It is commonly accepted that economic growth is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for achieving the MDGs, particularly Goal 1 (eradicating extreme poverty and hunger).

As a consequence, these two large and dynamic economies together account for 80% of the \u201cmissing women\u201d in the world, or about 80 million women.18 The following subsections analyze in greater depth the regional and intra-country trends for the gender-specific MDGs, Goals 3 and 5. Goal 3\u2013Promote Gender Equality and Empower Women Gender discrimination exists to some extent in all areas of social, economic, and political life, and in all institutions including households, com- munities, markets, and local and national gov- ernments. Gender equality therefore needs to be understood as a cross-cutting policy goal that More than three quarters of countries in the region are \u201con track\u201d in nar- rowing gender gaps in educa- tional enroll- ments, while more than two- thirds are clearly \u201coff track\u201d in reducing mater- nal mortality. When all of the MDG indicators for gender equality are considered, the picture is even more mixed. 9 applies to all sectors and institutions. In terms of content, the UN Millennium Project has sug- gested that gender equality encompasses three main dimensions: (a) capabilities (including basic human abili- ties related to education, health, and nutri- tion); (b) access to resources and opportunities (including access to economic assets, such as land and infrastructure; resources, such as income and employment; and political opportunities such as representation in political bodies); and (c) security (including reduced vulnerability to violence and conflict).19 These dimensions are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Together, they contribute to women\u2019s individual well-being and enable women and girls to make strategic choices and decisions\u2014that is, to be empowered.20 However, while progress in one domain (such as educa- tion) should improve women\u2019s chances of suc- cess in other domains (such as employment), gender biases or other factors can weaken or break these links. For example, patterns of gen- der segregation in labor markets can limit women\u2019s employment prospects even if they have comparable educational backgrounds to men. Because gender inequities exist on many levels, different policy initiatives may be needed to pro- mote gender equality in different sectors and institutions. As noted earlier, the target and indicators for Goal 3 have been critiqued as too narrowly drawn to provide a basis for measuring countries\u2019 progress toward gender equality. It has also been noted that the target and indicators focus on gen- der parity in education, literacy, employment, and politics, but that this does not necessarily indicate the quality of outcomes in these areas. The UN Millennium Project and others there- fore have proposed several additional indicators for Goal 3, and several countries in the region have developed their own \u201clocalized\u201d targets and indicators for the Goal (see Box 3). The basic target and indicators for Goal 3 nevertheless pro- vide a starting point for analyzing regional and intra-country trends related to gender equality.21 Virtually no country in Asia and the Pacific is making equal progress on all of the indicators for Goal 3. Several countries in Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, as well as Sri Lanka and some Pacific countries, have achieved gender parity in education at rela- tively high levels of enrollment, but this has not translated into equal participation in economic and political affairs. In fact, the Pacific has the lowest level of women\u2019s political participation in the world. Cambodia has one of the highest lev- els of women\u2019s economic participation in the region, but women\u2019s education and literacy re- main low with gender gaps at all levels. Central Asian countries, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic, have struggled to main- tain education services since the fall of the Soviet Union, and girls\u2019 enrollment levels have remained high although gender gaps are widening at the secondary level. At the same time, women\u2019s wage employment and representation in national par- liaments have fallen sharply.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "beda5db5-a6e2-4521-9be5-dc79daf802b8": {"__data__": {"id_": "beda5db5-a6e2-4521-9be5-dc79daf802b8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dcbbae778dc9a3ce36e6d4f0ee4ae8851905a92c0cb1c0a76cfe2b2caf8dd9aa"}, "2": {"node_id": "c04e7b4c-218f-44cd-80d2-98bde3cef049", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e722bb115d4bf5cbfb7ba121d22d69913bba8bc88fc320ea5ad610d3b4dc74c1"}}, "hash": "7ba44c9397f38eb16364191347f4c4d93a91c88d106a5398ad3cff788833b844", "text": "Although the basic Goal 3 indicators track progress only at the national level, several coun- tries\u2019 MDG progress reports also note much slower rates of progress in rural areas, among ethnic minorities and disadvantaged castes, and among displaced people and migrants.

Countries par- ticularly report slow progress in rural areas, and among ethnic minorities, disadvantaged castes, displaced people and migrants. 10 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific tries of the region are particularly vulnerable, but they are unlikely to be captured in national statistics. Gender Parity in Education Primary Education Eliminating gender disparity in education is the only time-bound target for Goal 3, and also the earliest target for any of the MDGs. (Gender par- ity in elementary and secondary education should be reached by 2005, with gender parity at all levels by 2015.) However, the main indicator\u2014 the enrollment ratio\u2014does not reflect the level of girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 enrollment, or their levels of attendance and completion, which are often much lower. At the primary level, both enroll- ment and completion rates are readily available for most countries, and provide a fuller picture of girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 access to education. Table 1 shows regional countries with low enrollment ratios, low levels of girls\u2019 or boys\u2019 enrollment, and/ or low girls\u2019 or boys\u2019 completion rates.22 Based on available 2001 data, the UNESCAP/UNDP/ADB joint regional MDG report estimates that the vast majority of coun- tries in the Asia and Pacific region will reach gen- der parity in primary enrollments by 2005.23 The countries that are farthest from the Goal 3 target are in South Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal), the GMS (Cambodia and Lao PDR) and the Pacific (Papua New Guinea). Based on recent trends, the joint regional MDG report estimates that Nepal will close the gender gap by 2003. However, the country\u2019s MDG progress report confirms that gender disparities persist, although there has been substantial progress in increasing both boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 enrollments. In addition, PRC, Macao, and Viet Nam and sev- eral Pacific countries (Niue, Palau, and Papua New Guinea) may narrowly miss the target in 2005 because of slow progress in closing the gap, or a recent decline in the enrollment ratio. Tajikistan predicts that it will miss the gender parity target, while the Pacific MDG progress report notes low enrollment ratios for Cook Islands, Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands. If recent trends continue, the joint regional MDG report estimates that Cambodia, India, Lao PDR, and Nepal would reach gender parity by 2015, but prospects for the other \u201coff-target\u201d countries are uncertain. By comparison, the UN Millen- nium Project, using 2000 data, projects that Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tajikistan will still be \u201coff track\u201d in 2015.24 To gauge country performance in providing equal access to primary education for girls and boys, it is also relevant to consider the levels of enrollment and completion rates. Achieving gen- der parity in enrollments under Goal 3 is obvi- ously less meaningful if a country is making slow progress toward Goal 2 (achieving universal pri- mary education). Some countries with large gen- der gaps in primary enrollments also have low net enrollment rates and even lower completion rates for girls.

In ethnic minority areas, there is also greater effort to recruit teachers from the relevant ethnic groups. As discussed in Sec- tion IV.B, many of these strategies also improve boys\u2019 school attendance, especially in remote rural areas. The strategies have proven extremely successful in such countries as Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, which invested for decades in basic education, especially in the rural areas. Other countries, such as Bangladesh, report recent progress in increasing girls\u2019 attendance, but they also note that more attention needs to be paid to the basic competencies and life skills that girls are acquiring in primary school. Secu- rity concerns in conflict-affected countries, such as Nepal and Sri Lanka, also can dissuade par- ents from sending their daughters to school. Secondary Education The UN Millennium Project has argued persua- sively that secondary and higher levels of education provide the highest returns for women\u2019s Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals 12 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific empowerment, in terms of employment oppor- tunities and impact on age of marriage, fertility, and health, as well as the health and education of children (especially girls).25 Countries in the Asia and Pacific region have made substantial progress in reducing gender gaps at the second- ary level, but gaps persist in several countries, and enrollment and completion rates are much lower than at primary level. Table 2 shows coun- tries with low enrollment ratios and/or low net enrollment rates for girls or boys.26 (Compara- tive data on completion rates were not available.) Based on available 2001 data, the UNESCAP/UNDP/ADB joint regional MDG report estimates27 that the large majority of coun- tries in Asia and the Pacific will meet the Goal 3 target of gender parity in secondary enrollment by 2005. The countries that are farthest from the target are the same as for primary educa- tion: India, Nepal and Pakistan in South Asia; Cambodia and Lao PDR in the GMS; and Papua New Guinea in the Pacific. Afghanistan\u2019s MDG progress report makes clear that it is even far- ther \u201coff-target,\u201d although it was not included in the analysis of the joint regional MDG report because of lack of comparable data. Starting from higher enrollment levels, Myanmar, Tajikistan, Tuvalu and Viet Nam are also projected to miss the target in 2005 because of slow progress or a decline in the enrollment ratio. The Pacific MDG progress report also indicates low enrollment ratios for Nauru, Niue, Palau, and Solomon Islands. The joint regional MDG report projects that if recent trends continue, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and PNG could reach gender parity in secondary enrollments by 2015, but prospects for the other countries are unclear. Based on 2000 data, the UN Millennium Project estimates that Cambodia, PRC, India, Kazakhstan, Lao PDR, PNG, and Samoa will still be \u201coff-track\u201d in 2015. In contrast, in several countries, a larger propor- tion of girls than boys are now enrolled at sec- ondary level, and Mongolia, Samoa, and Tonga have enrollment ratios greater than 1.1. Table 2 shows that the countries with the widest gender gaps in secondary enrollments also tend to have extremely low enrollment levels for girls. Over three quarters of girls in Cambodia, Pakistan, and PNG, and about two thirds of girls in Lao PDR, Nepal, and Myanmar, are not enrolled in secondary school. Several countries that have reached gender parity or that have \u201cre- verse gender gaps\u201d also have relatively low lev- els of girls\u2019 (and boys\u2019) enrollment. Vanuatu, for example, has an enrollment ratio of 1.03, but the net enrollment rates for girls and boys are only 28% and 27%, respectively. Thus, about two thirds of both girls and boys are not in secondary school.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "536aa128-58fc-446e-97ac-023ffa53dc5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "536aa128-58fc-446e-97ac-023ffa53dc5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cadf725a06b6c0a1e1a801694a41567cf625f58c47bc328ba200d16adcde1a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "99754352-0392-43ad-96a5-3c2d0db4ff45", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82cc5e02245e5008199516a1d88ef2ea8b763dd3dbfa0477ad583dcb75f921fe"}}, "hash": "e36074eae7a4271a04c7524eedbffe386eb772a16e338be316b91e59998f49d4", "text": "Thus, about two thirds of both girls and boys are not in secondary school.

Early mar- riage also continues to be the norm among some rural ethnic groups in Mekong countries, such as the Lao PDR. Given the high dropout risk for girls at the secondary level, it is especially important to monitor girls\u2019 completion rates in lower and upper secondary school. Qualitative indicators are also needed to monitor the curriculum and teachers\u2019 attitudes to ensure that girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 capabilities are equally supported and that gen- der stereotypes are not reinforced through the school system. Most of the factors that influence girls\u2019 attendance in primary school\u2014such as cost, distance to school, separate toilet facilities and presence of female teachers\u2014apply even more at the secondary level. Therefore, countries in the region are generally pursuing similar strategies to encourage girls to continue on to secondary school. However, the social pressure for early marriage in many rural areas represents an additional barrier, and calls for special efforts to persuade community leaders and parents of the benefits of continued education for adolescent girls. Education policies and regulations may also prohibit married adolescents from attending sec- ondary school. These policies and regulations 13 need to be reexamined, and appropriate pro- grams need to be developed to allow married adolescents to continue their education. Tertiary Education A substantial number of countries in Asia and the Pacific have achieved gender parity in tertiary education, and several have reverse gender gaps. However, enrollment rates tend to be much lower than for secondary school.

below 10%, and the rates for men are only slightly higher.) The Pacific MDG progress report notes that Solomon Islands and Vanuatu also have low enrollment ratios. The UNESCAP/UNDP/ADB joint regional MDG report estimates that if current trends con- tinue, Cambodia, India, and Lao PDR can reach gender parity by 2015, but prospects for the other countries are less promising.29 Based on 2000 data, the UN Millennium Project estimates that PRC, India, Nepal, Republic of Korea, and Tajikistan will be falling behind or off-track in 2015. In contrast, several countries in the region have reverse gender gaps in enrollment at the tertiary level. These include most of the Central Asian countries (excluding Tajikistan), Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and several Pacific countries (Nauru, Niue, Palau, and Samoa). However, even in countries with reverse gender gaps, MDG progress reports note strong patterns of \u201cgender tracking\u201d in the selection of courses at the tertiary level, with women concentrating in education and health courses, while men predominate in science and engineering. Gender Parity in Literacy In principle, literacy rates for women and men, and the ratio of these literacy rates, should indi- cate the quality of basic education that women and men receive. However, countries measure literacy differently, which raises questions about the accuracy and comparability of literacy data. Nevertheless, literacy rates and ratios provide a general indication of regional trends, and are useful for comparing basic educational capabili- ties of segments of the population within a coun- try (e.g., women and men, urban and rural residents, and different caste and ethnic groups). Table 4 shows regional countries with the lowest literacy ratios and female and male literacy rates for ages 15\u201324.30 Based on 2004 data, the vast majority of countries in Asia and the Pacific have relatively high women\u2019s literacy rates (over 90%) and high literacy ratios (over 0.90) for ages 15\u201324. Not surprisingly, the countries with the lowest literacy rates and literacy ratios also tend to be those with the lowest primary and secondary enrollment rates and ratios.", "start_char_idx": null,

Based on 2000 data, the UN Millennium Project esti- mates that only three countries in South Asia\u2014 Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan\u2014will have literacy ratios below 0.90 by 2015. However, sev- eral country MDG progress reports note that lit- eracy rates and ratios are much lower in rural areas and among ethnic minorities and disad- vantaged castes, reflecting their more limited access to quality education, including nonformal education. In Pakistan, for example, only 24% of women in rural areas are literate. For women in remote areas and in seclusion because of strict social norms, there is also the risk of \u201clost lit- eracy\u201d if they do not have opportunities to regu- larly use their reading, writing, and numeric skills. Women\u2019s Representation in Wage Employment Participation in wage employment can contrib- ute to women\u2019s empowerment by providing independent income, autonomy, and status within the family.31 A number of studies have demonstrated that women are more likely than men to spend their income on basic household expenses, such as food, education, and healthcare, and therefore women\u2019s paid employ- ment also provides substantial benefits to house- holds, and to children in particular.32 For these reasons, women\u2019s representation in nonagricul- tural wage employment was included as an indicator of progress on Goal 3. However, the limitations of the indicator need to be borne in mind. First, it captures only formal sector employment, and therefore excludes the vast majority of women in developing countries who are working in the informal sector and in agri- culture. In India, for example, it is estimated that 86% of women\u2019s nonagricultural employment is in the informal sector.33 Second, the indicator provides no information on the sectors in which women are working, their wages and levels of responsibility relative to men, or conditions of work. Finally, the indicator does not capture the unpaid household work that most women continue to do in addition to their income- generating activities. Nevertheless, data on women\u2019s paid work outside agriculture provide a starting point for tracking changes in women\u2019s economic activities in the region. Table 5 shows countries in the region with the lowest levels of women\u2019s participation in nonagricultural wage employment.34 Across the region, some distinct patterns can be seen in women\u2019s employment, related not only to the dominant social norms within countries, but also to larger economic and political forces influencing the structure of national economies. As Table 5 illustrates, the lowest levels of women\u2019s participation in wage employment are in South Asia, where conservative social norms have his- torically limited most women\u2019s access to educa- tion and work outside the home.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator":

Some of the notable exceptions are Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan, in which women\u2019s participation has dropped.

MDG progress reports and other sources confirm the general precariousness of women\u2019s jobs in the manufacturing sector, particularly the garment industry.

UNESCAP estimates that women in the region earn on average less than two thirds of men\u2019s income, with women in several countries earn- ing 50% or less.38 Women\u2019s Representation in National Politics Women\u2019s participation in public decision mak- ing is another important indicator of women\u2019s empowerment, and also has been linked to im- provements in the implementation of government programs and reduced levels of corruption.39 Women\u2019s opportunities to influence public deci- sion making are generally greater at the local level, but it is difficult to monitor across coun- tries because of limited data. Cross-country data are available on women\u2019s representation in na- tional parliaments, and therefore this indicator has been included as a proxy for women\u2019s politi- cal participation under Goal 3. Women\u2019s pres- ence in national parliaments does not guarantee that they will be able to influence national policy, especially where they are excluded from power- ful legislative committees and in one-party sys- tems where they have little representation in the party apparatus. Nevertheless, this indicator pro- vides a rough gauge of the openness of political systems to women\u2019s voices. Table 6 provides a snapshot of the \u201chighs\u201d and \u201clows\u201d in women\u2019s representation in national parliaments across the region.40 Although no target was established for this indicator under Goal 3, governments commit- ted in the Beijing Platform for Action to aim for gender balance in all government bodies, build- ing on an initial target of 30% women\u2019s partici- pation set earlier by the UN Economic and Social Council. No country in the Asia and Pacific region has yet reached the 30% target in its national parliament, but Timor-Leste and Viet Nam are approaching it and the PRC, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Lao PDR, Pakistan, and Tajikistan have reached or exceeded 20%. At the other end of the spectrum, several Pacific coun- tries have no women parliamentarians at all, and Marshall Islands, PNG, and Tonga have only one each. (Although not yet reflected in the Inter- Parliamentary Union [IPU] database, a recent gender assessment of Azerbaijan reports that women\u2019s representation in its national parliament dropped to 1% in 2004. The MDG progress report for Bangladesh also notes that, as of early 2005, only 2% of parliamentarians were women, which is a substantial drop from the 13% reported to the IPU in 2001.) According to the IPU, Asian countries average 15% women in their Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals 18 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific national parliaments, while Pacific countries average 11%.41 The regional countries with the highest rates of women\u2019s representation in national parlia- ments tend to be one-party states (such as PRC, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam) or countries that have introduced gender quotas for party lists or reserved seats for women (such as Pakistan). Timor-Leste\u2019s success was mainly due to the grassroots advocacy of women\u2019s organizations. Even without an official gender quota, women\u2019s organizations successfully lobbied for the inclu- sion of women candidates on party lists. About half of the countries in the region have seen gradual increases in women\u2019s representa- tion over the past decade. However, roughly an equal number have seen no change or declined. The most dramatic drops in women\u2019s represen- tation were in the Central Asian countries and Mongolia after the removal of Soviet-era quo- tas. Women\u2019s representation levels are rebound- ing in some of these countries, especially where gender quotas have been reintroduced (as in Uzbekistan), but are still well below earlier lev- els. In Azerbaijan, however, women\u2019s represen- tation has continued to deteriorate and now stands at 1% (compared with 40% during the Soviet era).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7aa40416-3ee0-481e-ba0e-8ec415a78a7e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7aa40416-3ee0-481e-ba0e-8ec415a78a7e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0dc978d91a198b8cac03f4cd72dfa7e58d2e9a88248c6ddd2416ed7f2680eb8"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fc4cb9d-db4c-46b7-847c-4186969739d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "69913f2e2ff8b5664546e23768ab72c396b4056d47b2c1daa3210f3bf3d955e6"}}, "hash": "c8edf863389eb6834e9e942e45e752ba76acf81d368cac10e37b247082b8b284", "text": "Even in countries with relatively high levels of women\u2019s representation, female parlia- mentarians tend to be excluded from the most powerful committees and channeled mainly into committees dealing with the social sectors and women\u2019s and children\u2019s affairs.

Some of the highest reported rates are in the Philippines (35%) and Mongolia (31%). Other Gender Issues Most of the MDG progress reports for countries in the Asia and Pacific region go beyond the in- ternational target and indicators for Goal 3, and report on progress and challenges in other areas related to gender equality and women\u2019s empow- erment. Some of the frequently identified issues follow. Traditional assumptions, stereotypes and practices. MDG progress reports and other sources note that traditional assumptions about gender roles and women\u2019s and girls\u2019 capabilities continue to raise barriers to girls\u2019 education, par- ticularly at the secondary level and higher. At the tertiary level, young women\u2019s own socialization appears to steer them to traditional areas of study such as education and health. Early marriage continues to be the norm in rural areas of many countries, not only in South Asia but also in some Mekong and Southeast Asian countries. Unreg- istered early marriages are also becoming more common in rural areas of Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan, along with other tra- ditional practices such as polygamy and bride abductions (in Kyrgyz Republic).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "640f1dc3-0c0b-45c6-a161-5874954a8a12": {"__data__": {"id_": "640f1dc3-0c0b-45c6-a161-5874954a8a12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6295a982beecdf099fadc78d6c40d25c0f3a30f15434ee6ed7339c08512d394"}, "2": {"node_id": "a71e5f72-9de5-4a02-881a-435ca63606d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d3de6970c0096301a0dcff389e35c75ab7963233bb96f7302d32d84c35797cc"}}, "hash": "01df9cf4e3df2e2cc569a08370c4e9992440ddc9b24870cb6c42651756dc48d7", "text": "These practices directly undermine countries\u2019 efforts to empower girls and women through education, and also imperil their health (discussed further in the next section) and limit their life choices.

As discussed further in the next section, son preference continues to exert a strong influence in many countries in the region. Deteriorating sex ratios and child mortality ratios in several South Asian countries, as well as in the PRC and recently Azerbaijan, point to a rise in sex-selec- tive abortions and the neglect of infant girls. This is not solely a rural phenomenon; in most dis- tricts in the Indian state of Punjab, for example, child sex ratios are actually lower in urban ar- eas, probably due to the larger number of \u201csex determination clinics\u201d there.44 Ironically, this Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals 20 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific trend is continuing and even accelerating at a time when the same countries have made sig- nificant progress in improving child survival rates and increasing life expectancies. Women from marginalized groups\u2014includ- ing ethnic minorities, disadvantaged castes, refu- gees, internally displaced persons, migrants and people with disabilities\u2014suffer multiple forms of discrimination and disempowerment. Specific strategies are needed to ensure that they have access to basic services and income-generating opportunities, security from harassment and vio- lence, and a voice in public decision making. For example, Lao PDR and Viet Nam have been sup- porting programs to train more teachers and health workers from ethnic minority communi- ties. In India and Nepal, NGOs have been work- ing successfully with women\u2019s self-help groups in disadvantaged caste and tribal communities to promote literacy, better health care, and eco- nomic and legal empowerment. Violence against women. Countries across the region have also identified violence against women as a major obstacle to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment under Goal 3. The Millennium Declaration includes a specific com- mitment to \u201ccombat all forms of violence against women.\u201d Thus, it is particularly appropriate for countries to emphasize the issue in relation to Goal 3. Although data on the incidence of vio- lence are not generally captured in official cen- suses, national health surveys increasingly include questions about domestic and other forms of vio- lence, and small-scale surveys conducted by NGOs and others provide additional informa- tion. Several MDG progress reports and recent country gender assessments include statistics from these surveys. While not necessarily repre- sentative of the region as a whole, the statistics are disturbing and indicate the magnitude of the problem. Thailand\u2019s MDG progress report notes that 40% of women surveyed had experienced domestic violence. The PRC progress report notes that violence occurs in 30% of households, and that this contributes to the country\u2019s high sui- cide rate among women. An official survey in Tajikistan finds that 50% of women have experi- enced sexual violence by their husbands. In the Fiji Islands, 80% of women surveyed had wit- nessed violence within their households, and 47% knew a rape victim. A number of reports link domestic violence to increased alcohol and drug abuse by male family members, particularly in Central Asian countries. While domestic violence and rape are common problems across the region, other forms of violence are more locally specific, such as bride abductions in the Kyrgyz Repub- lic, and acid-throwing, dowry deaths and honor killings in parts of South Asia. Women and girls in conflict-affected areas are particularly vulnerable to violence. The mass rape of women in East Timor by pro-Indonesian militia at the time of the referendum on inde- pendence is but one harrowing example.45 In Nepal, there are reports of women being raped by both Maoist insurgents and government sol- diers, and fear of abduction or rape deters girls from attending school and prevents women from traveling to health centers even in cases of emer- gency.46 Cambodia\u2019s experience also demon- strates that even after a conflict has ceased, men may continue to act out on their wives and other family members the violence they observed or inflicted during the conflict.47 Several MDG progress reports note recent efforts by governments and women\u2019s organiza- tions to tackle this problem, including enactment of laws against domestic (and other forms of) violence; establishment of special courts and women\u2019s police cells; treatment centers, safe houses, and hotlines to assist victims; women- only buses and train cars, and awareness-rais- ing campaigns.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f42e57ac-245d-4be1-8630-5c4f862e80b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f42e57ac-245d-4be1-8630-5c4f862e80b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94470f84c45e73b9d61af83b3eb2c9f1fbdb4f16d37e823cb4285bdfecb84d8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "bbc2b2a6-92f5-4af9-9731-a7a36fc46d03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82c47c2943e64a9e7a9af8f5f6a147ed87f7b67fbd7d6d9ece2a432c4ab10019"}}, "hash": "5f337ba30584f03c900a985dd6af073acf5703ba21fd75f1bdd2763aa26e5b40", "text": "However, a major challenge is to change common perceptions\u2014confirmed by surveys in several countries\u2014that domestic vio- lence is acceptable and that victims of violence are themselves at fault.

Under Goal 3, it has added a target to reduce significantly all forms of violence against women and children, together with indicators of public awareness, counseling of domestic violence victims, devel- opment and implementation of appropriate laws and a prevention plan, and regular collection of statistics. Landownership. MDG progress reports and other sources record continuing problems re- lated to women\u2019s ownership of land. Patrilineal 21 rules and practices in many countries in the re- gion have traditionally excluded women from in- heriting and owning land, and these practices continue in many rural areas. For example, in its progress report on implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, Nepal notes that in the lat- est census only 11% of women reported owning land and 5% reported owning houses. Within the last decade, gender and land issues have also surfaced in transition countries where previously state-owned land and collective farms have been privatized into commercial farms and family- owned plots. Reports indicate that in the Cen- tral Asian countries and Mongolia, newly privatized land plots have generally been regis- tered to \u201cheads of households,\u201d usually male. As a consequence, relatively few women in these countries now own farmland, and if they do, the plots tend to be small and of inferior quality. Efforts are underway in some countries, such as the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, to remedy this problem through legislative changes. The Women\u2019s Union in Lao PDR and the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs in Cambodia took a proactive role in the land reform and land titling processes in those countries, and as a result their new land laws expressly provide for registration of land in the names of both husbands and wives. Viet Nam has also taken steps to issue land-use certificates in the names of both husbands and wives. Migration, trafficking, and displace- ment. Another major regional trend linked to Goal 3 is the increased mobility of women and men, both within countries and across borders. Poverty and underemployment in rural areas, and the perception of better job opportunities in urban areas and other countries, fuel much of the migration. While migration can improve fam- ily incomes, it also places severe strains on both the migrants and those who remain behind. Fam- ily members who stay behind in rural areas\u2014 typically married women, children and the elderly\u2014often struggle to manage the family farm or business with limited resources. Migrant workers\u2014both those from rural areas and from neighboring countries\u2014often settle in slum areas of cities and have limited or no access to basic services. Migrants often work long hours under harsh or unsafe conditions for low pay, mainly in the informal sector where they have little or no legal protection. While migrants in the past tended to be primarily male, in recent years in- creasing numbers of women in the region\u2014in- cluding young women\u2014are migrating for work. They include shuttle traders and day laborers in Central Asia; factory workers in Bangladesh, Cambodia, PRC, Fiji Islands, and other coun- tries; domestic workers from Indonesia, Philip- pines, and Sri Lanka working elsewhere in the region and in the Middle East; and many oth- ers. In terms of Goal 3, migration can expand women\u2019s employment opportunities and increase their autonomy and status within their families. However, migration can also cut short young women\u2019s education and draw them into harsh working environments where they are vulnerable to abuse. At worst, young women and girls intending to migrate for work may instead be trafficked and forced to work in sweatshops, pri- vate homes, or brothels under slave-like condi- tions. It is estimated that about 1.4 million people in Asia and the Pacific have been trafficked into forced labor. Of these, 98% of persons trafficked into sex work, and 56% of those trafficked into other types of forced work, are women and girls.48 MDG progress reports for countries across the region\u2014panning Central Asia, the GMS and South Asia\u2014confirm that trafficking in women and girls is a growing problem that they are attempting to address through legislation and law enforcement, awareness-raising, and support services for trafficking victims.

Other Gender-Related Indicators Recognizing the limitations of the international target and indicators for Goal 3, the UN Millen- nium Project has recommended additional \u201ccore\u201d indicators to better track countries\u2019 progress in key dimensions of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, and has encouraged countries to develop their own locally appropri- ate targets and indicators.50 UNDP has also rec- ommended disaggregating the main Goal 3 indicators\u2014for example, by urban/rural, prov- ince and ethnicity\u2014and to disaggregate indica- tors for the other MDGs by sex.51 In fact, several countries in the region are already providing dis- aggregated data for Goal 3 by urban/rural, by province and, in some respects, by ethnicity. Sev- eral have also identified other national targets and indicators for Goal 3, many of which over- lap with those suggested by the UN Millennium Project (see Box 3). These expanded targets and indicators are also consistent with the broader set of gender equality objectives endorsed at the World Summit in September 2005 (see Appen- dix 2). Goal 5\u2013Improve Maternal Health Women\u2019s health is an essential capability, and is also closely linked to the well-being of children and other family members. Despite substantial investments in health interventions by govern- ments, donors, and NGOs, women in many countries across the Asia and Pacific region con- tinue to suffer high rates of death or disability associated with childbirth, respiratory and water- borne diseases, malnutrition and anemia, as well as increasing rates of HIV infection. The MDGs take a fragmented approach to women\u2019s health, with the main focus being on maternal health (Goal 5) and more specifically maternal mortal- ity (Target 6). As discussed in the next section, most of the other goals implicitly support women\u2019s and girls\u2019 health, including Goal 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and hunger), Goal 4 (reduce child mortality), Goal 6 (combat HIV/ AIDS, malaria and other diseases), and Goal 7 (ensure environmental sustainability\u2014including access to safe drinking water and sanitation). Conspicuously absent from the MDGs is a goal directly addressing women\u2019s sexual and repro- ductive health, although this is a core element of women\u2019s general health and also critical to women\u2019s control over their own lives. In response, the UN Millennium Project and others have rec- ommended that Goals 3 and 5 be interpreted broadly to encompass sexual and reproductive health,52 and several countries in the region have already included a separate target and indica- tors on sexual/reproductive health in their na- tional MDGs (see Box 4). The World Summit in September 2005 explicitly endorsed \u201cequal access to reproductive health\u201d in its commitments to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment (see Appendix 2). Deaths and complications associated with pregnancy and childbirth account for a large portion of women\u2019s deaths and health-related disabilities overall. Despite international and national commitments to invest in maternal health care, maternal deaths are still extraordi- narily high\u2014over 500,000 deaths each year worldwide, with about 50% of these deaths in Asia and the Pacific (and over 25% in India alone). Moreover, for every maternal death, it is estimated that 30\u201350 additional women suffer debilitating complications from pregnancy or childbirth.53 This translates into between 7.5 and 12.5 million women suffering pregnancy or birth- related complications in Asia and the Pacific each year. These sobering figures explain the strong MDG focus on reducing maternal mortality under Goal 5, and the particular relevance of this goal in Asia and the Pacific.

The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel\u2014the other main indicator for Goal 5\u2014provides a partial measure of the capability of health systems to prevent maternal deaths. Table 7 shows coun- tries in the region with the highest maternal mortality ratios.55 Not surprisingly, these coun- tries also tend to have the lowest rates of skilled attendance at births in the region. Based on 2000 data, 14 countries in the region have maternal mortality ratios of 200 (per 100,000 live births) or more, and 6 countries have ratios of 500 or more, with the highest ratio by far in Afghanistan (1,900). Afghanistan\u2019s is also one of the highest reported national maternal mortality ratios in the world, second only to Sierra Leone. In terms of absolute numbers of mater- nal deaths, India ranks highest in the world with an estimated 136,000 deaths in 2000. Based on 2000 data, the UNESCAP/UNDP/ADB joint regional MDG report estimates that over half of the region\u2019s countries with high maternal mor- tality ratios will fail to meet the Goal 5 target (reducing the ratio by three quarters between 1990 and 2015).56 In Afghanistan, Timor-Leste, Lao PDR, and Philippines, maternal deaths are coming down too slowly. In India, Pakistan, Myanmar, and Kazakhstan, official maternal mortality rates have actually risen since 1995. The joint regional MDG report finds that a sig- nificant number of countries with lower mater- nal mortality rates in 1990 will also fail to meet their Goal 5 targets because of slow progress in reducing the rates further, or recent increases in the rates. These include even Malaysia and Sri Lanka, which have been widely praised for their past success in significantly reducing maternal deaths.57 These projections need to be treated cautiously, however, because of the basic unreliability of maternal mortality statistics and the possibility that some recent increases in offi- cial ratios may be due to improvements in data collection. Country MDG progress reports provide important supplemental information on varia- tions in maternal mortality rates within coun- tries, and on the country-specific factors contributing to maternal deaths. Some progress reports (for example, for Indonesia and PNG) are less optimistic than the UNESCAP/UNDP/ ADB joint regional MDG report estimates, and predict that the countries will not reach their Goal 5 targets by 2015. Others note that the actual maternal death rate is probably much higher than the official figure (close to five times higher in Viet Nam). Virtually all progress reports note wide variations in maternal mortality rates between urban and rural areas, with extremely high mortality rates in some remote provinces or areas. In Afghanistan, for example, Badakstan has a maternal mortality rate of 6,500, about the highest ever reported in the world. In Tajikistan, with a national maternal mortality rate of 100, one region reports a mortality rate of 1,075. In Viet Nam, provincial rates range from 45 to 411. Malaysia and Mongolia report higher maternal mortality rates among migrant work- ers who have little or no access to health care services. In Malaysia, for example, 42% of maternal deaths are now among non-Malaysian women. In the GMS and South Asia, women from ethnic minority groups or scheduled castes also have higher mortality rates. Similar variations are found in levels of skilled attendance at birth. In Viet Nam, for example, over 80% of ethnic minority women deliver at home, compared with less than 30% of women in the dominant Kinh ethnic group. As in education, some regional patterns emerge. In the GMS and South Asia, most coun- tries started from extremely high levels of maternal mortality, with very limited maternal health services provided in rural areas. These countries are reducing maternal deaths as they extend and improve basic health services in the rural areas (albeit at very different rates of progress). In contrast, the Central Asian coun- tries generally had well-developed health facili- ties before 1990, staffed with skilled personnel in rural as well as urban areas, and relatively low maternal mortality rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68af2756-d7c6-43c8-a972-4e052204a4f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "68af2756-d7c6-43c8-a972-4e052204a4f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc3aa404e6a37bfbe148c6b93a04db5765261c7b403234a3c83be41e5576b9fc"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e47c626-fdf5-4f28-bda8-d06a5b6772a3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8dc62f3cfdc111a5318e1d2ee2fda808bf3295178c7b875b3c059bd1d918e145"}}, "hash": "a0818d5b3102b95fb76281cb240ee276aff70a9b2f60b7bd04b12f54356f4ff1", "text": "These health sys- tems came under considerable strain during the 1990s as health budgets were cut, and several of these countries as well as Mongolia have seen their maternal mortality rates climb as the qual- Progress on the Gender-Specific Goals Despite substan- tial investments in health inter- ventions by governments, donors and NGOs, women in many coun- tries across the region continue to suffer high rates of death or disability associ- ated with child- birth, respira- tory and water- borne diseases, malnutrition and anemia, as well as increasing rates of HIV infection. 24 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific ity of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38473f80-8475-46fd-b758-196b0798599e": {"__data__": {"id_": "38473f80-8475-46fd-b758-196b0798599e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7eed07c91c1bcb4ff9e7346e044b8b83648a7da0e3f13800a67d4a90df144a24"}, "3": {"node_id": "172c2801-e299-42db-a935-2968bd26f2f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "775a11e542dcfbd7c4f0408f26546a33d0e4075eb1294462d3d7d605ea8c7bee"}}, "hash": "9d1783eeb9d84ff80cb47fb97250ae2373c12690d322fe2a27115ad2945d7742", "text": "rural health services has deteriorated (in Azerbaijan, from 22 in 1990 to 94 in 2000). By 1990, Southeast Asian countries, such as Malay- sia and Thailand, had already made significant progress in lowering their maternal mortality rates through steady and strategic investment in their rural health systems. Now they are finding it harder and more expensive to extend mater- nal health services to the most underserved groups\u2014migrant women and women in the very remote rural areas. In the Pacific, maternal mor- tality rates and rates of skilled attendance at birth are generally better than for the region as a whole (with PNG and Solomon Islands lagging behind). However, women on remote islands and in the highlands of PNG have much less access to maternal health services. Factors Contributing to Maternal Health (or Health Risk) Notwithstanding these regional differences, MDG progress reports and other sources point to sev- eral common factors contributing to the high lev- els of maternal deaths in Asia and the Pacific: Quality emergency obstetric care pro- vided by skilled and culturally appropriate health personnel. Virtually all countries recog- nize the need to equip health centers to handle basic obstetric complications, with procedures to refer more complicated cases to district or pro- vincial hospitals. In the Kyrgyz Republic, for ex- ample, the deterioration of rural health facilities has resulted in more women delivering at home. Equally important is the staffing of health cen- ters with skilled personnel who are available at all times (24/7) and who are trusted by women patients. In rural areas of South Asia where con- servative gender norms prevail, female health professionals play a critical role. Pakistan\u2019s MDG progress report, for example, notes that only 5% of government health facilities provide emergency obstetric care 24/7, that female health workers lack skills in basic obstetric care, and that there are too few female doctors to handle more com- plicated cases. Afghanistan\u2019s progress report notes that only 40% of health facilities have female workers, and that this is a major limitation on women\u2019s access to health services. The Lao PDR also reports that language and cultural differ- ences are major challenges in extending mater- nal health services to ethnic minority women. Many countries are finding it difficult to recruit and retain female health workers in rural areas, particularly where rural health facilities are poorly equipped, living conditions are harsh, and there are higher-paying jobs in urban areas. In rural Pakistan, for example, female health work- ers face the same restrictive gender norms as their female patients, which can affect their mobility, their treatment by male co-workers and com- munity leaders, and their effectiveness.58 Several countries, including Fiji Islands, Philippines and Tajikistan, are also seeing emigration of many doctors and nurses, and this has ripple effects throughout the health system. Access to repro- ductive health services, and especially to emer- gency obstetric care, is especially limited in conflict-affected areas and among refugee and internally displaced groups.59 Public investment, decentralization, and fees for services. The financing of maternal health services strongly influences the quality of services and their affordability, especially to poor women. The PRC\u2019s MDG progress report notes that public expenditures on health are only 15% of 1999 levels, and that chronic underfunding of public health services is hampering further reductions in maternal mortality. Similar cut- backs in funding have also curtailed maternal health services in Mongolia and Central Asian countries. MDG progress reports for the PRC, Indonesia, and Philippines note that the decen- tralization of basic services also has had a nega- tive impact on maternal health services, especially in the poorest provinces. Poor prov- inces have limited capacity to generate their own financial resources to fund local health services, and also have more limited human resources and technical capacity to manage a multi-tiered health system, including referrals of obstetric emergencies. To compensate for the reduced public funding of health services, many health systems have introduced fees for services (both formal and informal). However, fees and other costs are a major deterrent to poor women in need of antenatal and obstetric care.

Several countries also report increases in sexual activity among unmarried adolescents. Without access to contraceptives, adolescent girls are more likely to resort to unsafe abortions in the event of pregnancy. Tajikistan reports increases in adolescent abortions, and Turkmenistan notes that 25% of all maternal deaths are among women under 25 years old. In response, Turkmenistan has established several centers dedicated to adolescent reproductive health. Several other countries recognize the need, but have not yet developed concrete pro- grams to extend reproductive health services to adolescents. Role of men in reproductive health mat- ters. At the International Conference on Popula- tion and Development in Cairo in 1994, the world\u2019s governments committed to promote men\u2019s involvement and shared responsibility in family and reproductive health matters. In light of the looming HIV/AIDS crisis, several countries in Asia and the Pacific have introduced programs targeting men and adolescent boys to promote safer sexual behavior. India and Indonesia, among other countries, have also introduced programs to encourage men to be more involved in their wives\u2019 pregnancies and childbirth, including ac- companying their wives to antenatal clinics and arranging transport to health centers for the de- liveries. Other countries, such as Viet Nam, are promoting more equitable sharing of household and parenting responsibilities. However, these programs tend to be relatively small and frag- mented. As the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) argues, men\u2019s participation and partnership are essential to the achievement of gender equality and the other gender-related MDGs, including Goal 5.60 Other Targets and Indicators of Maternal Health Recognizing the limitations of the Goal 5 target and indicators, the UN Millennium Project and others have recommended an additional indica- tor for the current Goal 5 target on maternal mortality and a new target and indicators for reproductive health services. The expanded set of targets and indicators for Goal 5 are summa- rized in Box 4. The proposed indicator for reducing mater- nal deaths (coverage of emergency obstetric care) directly addresses the main systemic gap con- tributing to maternal deaths. The proposed tar- get on reproductive health services is not new, but builds on commitments governments made at the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo in 1994. Several coun- tries in the region (including Bangladesh, Cam- bodia, PRC, Mongolia, and Philippines) have already established a national goal or target on reproductive health services, and virtually all countries are already reporting on two or more of the suggested indicators under Goal 5 or Goal 6. Two of the suggested indicators for reproduc- tive health services overlap with supplemental indicators recommended for Goal 3 (see Box 3) These expanded targets and indicators are also consistent with the commitment made by gov- ernments at the 2005 World Summit to ensure \u201cequal access to reproductive health\u201d (see Appendix 2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null,

However, this is not always the case. Viet Nam, for example, reports that female-headed households gener- ally have lower poverty rates, perhaps because the households are smaller or because male fam- ily members are working elsewhere and sending back remittances. A recent country gender assessment for Timor-Leste also reports that male-headed households are generally poorer in terms of income poverty, although female house- hold heads are at a disadvantage in many other respects (including access to land and employ- ment opportunities). Female-headed households also are not a homogeneous category.

In virtually all countries, the vast majority of households are headed by men. Other techniques are needed to estimate the relative well-being of women, girls, and boys within these households. For example, a recent study recalculated pov- erty levels within households in Tajikistan based on various assumptions about the allocation of resources between men and women within the households.61 Time use surveys can also illumi- nate the constraints of \u201ctime poverty\u201d on women, resulting from the unequal distribution of care work within households and communities.62 Participatory poverty assessments, country gen- der assessments, and other qualitative studies Gender Dimensions of Progress on Other Goals For most coun- tries in the region, poverty continues to be concentrated mainly in rural areas. However, other develop- ments affecting gender relations include poverty and lack of social security resulting from layoffs and plant closures as well as from internal conflicts and natural disas- ters. 32 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific also illuminate the different impacts of poverty on women and men, as well as their different coping strategies. In Central Asian countries, for example, many women who lost formal sector jobs during the economic transition have turned to informal activities such as the \u201cshuttle trade.\u201d In Mongolia, many poor herding families have taken their sons out of school to help with herd- ing activities. The Lao PDR\u2019s national poverty reduction strategy notes that poor women in ru- ral areas generally use a wider range of positive coping strategies than men, including reducing expenses, raising small livestock and poultry, gardening, and producing handicrafts. Other studies note that women in poor rural areas often cope with food insecurity by reducing their own food intake (eating less and eating last). An increasingly common coping strategy for poor households across the region is for one or more family members to migrate for work\u2014either to an urban area within the country or to another country. As discussed in Section III.B.5, migra- tion can increase household income, but invari- ably places strains on both the migrant and those who remain behind. Migration also poses par- ticular risks for women, especially young women. For most countries in the region, poverty continues to be concentrated primarily in rural areas. However, MDG progress reports also point out several \u201cnew\u201d forms of poverty that have emerged, often with specific impacts on women. In the Central Asian countries and Mongolia, for example, massive layoffs during the economic transition left many unemployed. With few al- ternatives, many women turned to informal work including the \u201cshuttle trade\u201d and day labor. As discussed in Section III.B.5, land reform pro- grams introduced after the transition allocated relatively little land to women farmers, and they had less access to irrigation and agricultural ser- vices. In Mongolia, many women have migrated to urban centers for work, and female-headed households in urban slums are now among the poorest groups. In several countries, the expan- sion of the garment-manufacturing sector over the past 10 years has provided jobs to large num- bers of young women, mostly from poor rural areas. However, recent declines in global de- mand, coupled with greater competition from the PRC and India, have resulted in layoffs and plant closures in some countries, and more are ex- pected. With limited education and technical training, laid-off garment workers have few alternatives, and microstudies in some countries indicate that many of them are turning to sex work to support themselves. Internal conflicts and natural disasters in several countries have also driven many people into poverty by causing death and injuries, destroying homes and liveli- hoods, and disrupting basic services. Both Nepal and Sri Lanka, for example, report that women in conflict areas are particularly vulnerable to poverty, deprivation of basic services and vio- lence.

Broader nutrition programs, particu- larly those targeting adolescent girls, hold greater promise for young women and their children. At another level, women\u2019s awareness of healthy feeding practices for newborns\u2014particu- larly the importance of breastfeeding\u2014is a ma- jor determinant of infant health. As noted earlier, several studies also show that women tend to spend a larger portion of their income than men on food and medicines, illustrating the link between women\u2019s economic empowerment and children\u2019s health and nutrition levels.64 At a third level, in countries with strong pat- terns of son preference, girls can have less access to nutritious food than boys, resulting in lower nutrition rates. Bangladesh, for example, reports that nutrition levels are much lower in rural ar- eas, especially among girls. However, this is not the case in all countries. Indonesia, for example, 33 reports lower nutrition levels in boys. In other countries, health surveys find little difference in girls\u2019 and boys\u2019 nutrition levels. Gender-related differences in either direction underscore the need to disaggregate nutrition data by sex in order to identify gender-related patterns and develop appropriate responses. Finally, it should be noted that several coun- tries in the region, including the PRC, Thailand and several Pacific countries, are now confront- ing obesity as a major nutrition and health prob- lem. The Pacific has some of the highest obesity rates in the world, linked to the increasing avail- ability of high-calorie, high-fat and processed foods, mainly imports. Complications related to obesity include diabetes and heart disease. In the Fiji Islands, the obesity and diabetes rates in women are twice those in men. Goal 2\u2013Achieve Universal Primary Education Goals 2 and 3 are strongly interlinked. Gender parity in education is the official target for Goal 3, and access to quality education is a key build- ing block for women\u2019s empowerment.65 Access to education for women also has intergenerational benefits, since higher literacy and education levels in women are associated with higher levels of enrollment and school performance in their chil- dren.66 As discussed in Section III.B, gender par- ity in education only makes sense as a development objective in the context of high or rising levels of participation by both girls and boys. A scenario in which gender gaps in educa- tion are narrowing because boys\u2019 enrollment rates are falling cannot be counted as a success under Goal 3. Goal 2 therefore is an essential comple- ment to Goal 3 in that it aims for high levels of access to primary education for both girls and boys. The Goal 2 indicators track completion as well as enrollment rates such that they also encourage attention to factors such as the qual- ity of school facilities, teachers and teaching ma- terials, which influence whether students remain in school or drop out. As noted in Section III.B, completion rates are also relevant to Goal 3, be- cause the underlying objective is to ensure that girls as well as boys receive a quality education, and not simply that they are enrolled in equal numbers. Countries\u2019 progress reports on Goal 2 con- firm that many of the factors underlying success (or failure) in achieving universal primary edu- cation are the same as for achieving gender par- ity in education under Goal 3. This suggests that strategies to increase girls\u2019 enrollment and par- ticipation in primary school are likely to have spillover benefits for boys as well, especially those from poor communities, remote rural areas, eth- nic minorities and disadvantaged castes. Several progress reports note concerns about the quality and relevance of education, particularly in rural areas and among disadvantaged groups. Sri Lanka reports that the worst-equipped schools are near plantation estates and in conflict-af- fected areas, while Cambodia and Viet Nam note teacher shortages and other problems, particu- larly in ethnic minority areas. The PRC reports that migrant children in urban areas have little or no access to education, and the Philippines notes the particular challenge of reaching street children. Despite exemptions from school fees, several progress reports also confirm that infor- mal fees and indirect costs\u2014for example, for appropriate clothing, food, transport and school supplies\u2014are still a major barrier especially for the poorest children.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a50676b-539b-48b3-b9f4-7df3b616f0e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a50676b-539b-48b3-b9f4-7df3b616f0e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b7de5fd747a430e115c5805e2384531f95a713702485d8481af05366a01d5e2"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b534eb2-aabb-418c-92f8-50ecc62c310c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a2582cf05df1d4577a907c2e757ebcc0dec05d0c0845af033605698ea89cbfe"}}, "hash": "fd95038309a70bc02c5907913fb587d3e043be41ac5de0483298ed5ed244cbda", "text": "Various strategies are there- fore being used to extend education to hard-to- reach children, including the establishment of more community schools in remote areas; board- ing schools for children from remote areas; sti- pends, scholarships and school feeding programs; recruitment and training of more ethnic minor- ity teachers; and incentives for teachers posted to rural areas.

However, gender-specific strat- egies\u2014such as ensuring safe transport to school, providing separate toilet facilities for girls in school, and recruiting female teachers\u2014are also needed to encourage girls to remain in school. In their strategies to increase girls\u2019 enroll- ments under Goal 3, many countries in the re- gion have recognized the need to counter gender stereotypes in textbooks and teachers\u2019 attitudes in order to ensure a positive learning environ- ment for girls. What has received less attention is the importance for boys of promoting positive gender roles through the school curriculum and teachers\u2019 behavior. As discussed elsewhere in this Gender Dimensions of Progress on Other Goals Strategies to increase girls\u2019 enrollment and participation in primary school are likely to have spillover benefits for boys as well, espe- cially those in poor and re- mote rural areas and from ethnic minorities and disadvantaged castes. 34 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific paper, patriarchal attitudes about gender roles, women\u2019s and men\u2019s capabilities, and acceptable behavior between men and women continue to be among the greatest obstacles to gender equal- ity and women\u2019s empowerment. These norms originate and are perpetuated within families and in communities. However, primary and second- ary schools also play a critical role in shaping the attitudes of the next generation. With the appro- priate curriculum and sensitivity of teachers, schools have the potential to positively influence boys\u2019 as well as girls\u2019 attitudes about gender roles in the household, women\u2019s and men\u2019s rights and capabilities, safe and responsible sexual behav- ior, interpersonal conflicts and violence. Goal 4\u2013Reduce Child Mortality Success in achieving Goal 4 is strongly linked to both of the gender-specific MDGs. As immuni- zation programs and other interventions reduce the number of child deaths due to traditional diseases, neonatal factors have emerged as one of the main causes of death in young children. It is estimated that over one in five deaths of chil- dren under 5 years occurs in the first week of life, and is due to the mother\u2019s malnutrition, poor antenatal care, or lack of sanitary conditions and skilled assistance at birth.67 The factors contrib- uting to neonatal deaths are therefore some of the same factors contributing to maternal deaths. Strategies under Goal 5 to improve women's basic health and nutrition levels, and to improve preg- nant women\u2019s access to sanitary and well- equipped health facilities with skilled personnel, should therefore contribute to reducing neona- tal deaths as well. In their MDG progress reports, most counties in the region recognize this link. Papua New Guinea, for example, notes that poorly equipped and staffed maternity wards in health facilities and the large number of \u201cin vil- lage\u201d births have contributed to its slow progress in reducing infant deaths. After birth, many of the most effective steps to ensure infants\u2019 and children\u2019s health can be taken within the household\u2014including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months; complemen- tary feeding with energy-rich and nutritious food after 6 months; frequent hand-washing and sani- tation; use of treated bednets in malaria-prone areas; and ensuring that children receive timely immunizations.68 Because of the traditional gen- der division of labor within most households, women are generally responsible for these tasks. Women\u2019s awareness of good childcare practices and their capacity to implement them are criti- cal to children\u2019s health. Not surprisingly, studies have found a strong correlation between women\u2019s literacy and education levels and child survival. Several countries in the region (including Mongolia, Pakistan and Viet Nam) make this link in their progress reports on Goal 4. Women\u2019s income and savings also can provide the resources to pay for more nutritious food, bednets, and other health- enhancing expenses. Therefore, strategies under Goal 3 to strengthen women\u2019s capabilities and ex- pand their economic opportunities have indirect benefits for their children under Goal 4. Another critical gender dimension of Goal 4 is the issue of girls\u2019 survival and health.

A recent study in India found that girls were 1.5 times less likely to be hospitalized for a child- hood illness.71 The high reported child mortality ratios for Bhutan, Maldives, and Vanuatu are more difficult to explain, because these countries do not generally exhibit strong patterns of gen- der discrimination. In general, it is clear that the ratio of girls\u2019 to boys\u2019 child mortality rates should be regularly monitored under Goal 4, and that specific strategies should be pursued to address the social factors contributing to the unaccept- ably high death rates of girls in several countries in the region. Reducing neona- tal deaths (MDG 4) and maternal mortality (MDG 5) are closely interlinked. Girl's survival and health under MDG 4 also requires attention to gender discrimi- nation, espe- cially in Asian countries where the death rates of girls are unusually high. 35 Goal 6\u2013Combat HIV/AIDS, Malaria, and Other Diseases Gender factors also influence the incidence and impact of communicable diseases in Asia and the Pacific, such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. Poor women are generally vulnerable to communicable diseases because of their poor nutrition and health, and their tendency to post- pone medical care because of social or economic constraints.72 These diseases not only diminish women\u2019s capabilities and opportunities (key as- pects of women\u2019s empowerment under Goal 3), but also increase the risk of complications in preg- nancy and childbirth (undermining maternal health under Goal 5). Moreover, the disabling impact of such diseases as HIV/AIDS, tuberculo- sis, and malaria on women also impairs their ability to care for their children and other house- hold members. Disability of other family mem- bers by one of these diseases places a particular burden on women as the primary caretakers in most households. HIV/AIDS. The Asia and Pacific region is increasingly threatened by rising HIV infection rates not only in high-risk groups such as intra- venous drug users, mobile workers, and sex work- ers, but also in the general population\u2014with the proxy indicator being the prevalence rate in preg- nant women who attend antenatal clinics. As of 2004, over 8 million in the region were living with HIV and at least 540,000 had died. Prevalence rates reported in 2003 exceed 1% in at least four countries (Cambodia, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand), and are also high in India, Nepal, Malaysia, and Viet Nam, and increasing sharply in Indonesia. Also troubling, MDG progress reports cite much higher preva- lence rates among some groups. In Nepal, for example, 17% of sex workers in Kathmandu are infected with HIV. To date, the majority of people infected with HIV in the region are men, but the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) reports that the percentage of infected women is increasing steadily, and infections have jumped from high- risk groups to the general population in several countries. In Cambodia, India, and Thailand, for example, husbands are now the main source of HIV infections in women.73 This is echoed in re- ports for other countries: in Papua New Guinea, up to 3% of pregnant women attending antena- tal clinics are infected with HIV; 2% of women receiving antenatal care in Nepal are infected; and in 2004 more women than men were reported to be infected in the Fiji Islands.74 The increasing numbers of HIV infections in pregnant women also significantly raise the risk of mother- to-child transmission, especially because only a small percentage of pregnant women in the region have access to HIV testing and services to reduce the transmission risk. Women, and adolescent girls in particular, are more vulnerable than men to HIV infection because of their physiological characteristics and limited power to negotiate safe sex and resist vio- lence.75 UNAIDS notes that sex workers who have been trafficked across borders\u2014and who there- fore have no power to insist that clients use condoms\u2014are the most likely to become infected during their first 6 months in a brothel.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55b3924c-3ec1-4e3d-90f6-512d7bdbb5bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "55b3924c-3ec1-4e3d-90f6-512d7bdbb5bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77a1ef2ad11d7067b5890aa465303d1a153ddd81acf4c54b20fed29ea301f786"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8b82b97-731b-42a0-b159-b05438f488dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4295962d1d03cdd32399c0665fb09e9a9cfc55ae24d0f331cf515d753c11f9d0"}}, "hash": "c40488620e14c4fb2f69436c38d86939a33fffe47d3956e31cc24b65e742dfcb", "text": "UNAIDS estimates that the proportion of young women in Southeast Asia who work in brothels and other \u201chigh-risk\u201d environments\u2014such as bars and clubs\u2014ranges from about 40% in Indonesia to over 70% in the Lao PDR.

In their progress reports, Cambodia, Nepal, and Papua New Guinea acknowledge that gender inequalities and women\u2019s lack of empowerment are major obstacles to progress in arresting the spread of HIV under Goal 6. Malaysia also recognizes the intergenerational impact of HIV infections. The increasing numbers of young people, including young women, becoming infected has created a serious burden of care for parents, and particu- larly for mothers. Based on the emerging profile of HIV infec- tions in the region, it is clear that effective pre- vention and treatment strategies need to reach not only high-risk groups, such as intravenous drug users and sex workers, but also the general population, including men, women, and adoles- cents. Any successful HIV prevention strategy must include effective outreach activities to pro- Gender Dimensions of Progress on Other Goals Gender factors influence the incidence and impact of com- municable diseases in Asia and the Pacific, such as HIV/ AIDS, tuberculo- sis and malaria. 36 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific mote safe-sex practices among men, especially those who travel and who frequent sex workers. To reach the general population of women, the UN Millennium Project and others have strongly recommended that HIV awareness raising, test- ing, and treatment be integrated into the basic reproductive health programs implemented through the primary health care system.77 Because of the widespread misinformation and stigma surrounding HIV in most countries, women are unlikely to seek out information, test- ing or treatment from an HIV-specific program or health facility. Through basic reproductive health programs, women are also more likely to be treated for STIs that increase their suscepti- bility to HIV infection. To reach adolescents, and particularly adolescent girls, sex education pro- grams in schools are an important entry point. Reproductive health services for adolescents are also urgently needed, but the coverage level in most countries in the region is still low. Creative strategies are also needed to extend reproduc- tive health services to hard-to-reach groups such as migrant workers. Tuberculosis. Almost half of the high- burden countries in the world for tuberculosis (TB) are in Asia and the Pacific, and together these countries represent about 80% of the glo- bal burden of the disease.78 Some countries have historically had high prevalence rates, while oth- ers have recently experienced resurgence in in- fections, including several Central Asian countries. The resurgence of TB in Thailand is linked to HIV, which increases susceptibility to TB infections, and this co-infection risk is an emerging issue in several other countries. Both HIV and TB increase the risk of complications in pregnancy and childbirth. Afghanistan reports that 70% of its TB infections are in women, while Indonesia reports that TB is a major cause of fe- male deaths. Malaria. The heaviest burden of malaria infections in the world\u2014outside Africa\u2014is in the GMS, other parts of Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent.79 However, malaria is also endemic in parts of Central Asia and in the Pacific. Despite successful interventions, such as the dis- tribution of treated bednets and anti-malarial medications, countries\u2019 efforts to control the dis- ease are being thwarted by increasing migration within countries and across borders, and by the emergence of more drug-resistant strains of the disease. Pregnant women and unborn children are particularly at risk from malaria, which causes anemia and contributes to low birth weight and perinatal mortality.80 The Lao PDR reports that malaria is one of the top three causes of maternal mortality. Other diseases. Countries in the region in- creasingly face new communicable disease threats, such as avian flu and severe acute respi- ratory syndrome, and with expanding regional trade and migration, these diseases can spread rapidly across borders. At the same time, non- communicable conditions, such as obesity, dia- betes, heart disease, and cancer are becoming increasingly common, due in large part to changes in diet, tobacco use, and physical activ- ity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45c12fb9-1ee6-4d61-a53f-7468bfedc1a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "45c12fb9-1ee6-4d61-a53f-7468bfedc1a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d7fae83489d80a1471e2dc2a23bbd14070f6fd8347260c92f1523f9e391adc1"}, "2": {"node_id": "d52922b6-d2c2-4353-8ae1-a4a0938f775a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ca66d7d2fd6d820ea3f68e0cc4569d3520a471047c0c983c50cdf0657b6cf29"}}, "hash": "b7bdeb245feba686ba4b71c4b28c26d5e658839682137a24676432a2268b4fa4", "text": "It is therefore important for countries to iden- tify, monitor, and report on these serious challenges to both women\u2019s and men\u2019s health.

Alcohol and drug abuse, which is also primarily a male phenom- enon, diverts scarce household resources to sup- port the abuser\u2019s habit and frequently contributes to domestic violence. Goal 7\u2013Ensure Environmental Sustainability The targets under Goal 7\u2014related to promoting sustainable development and reversing the loss of environmental resources, improving access to safe water and basic sanitation, and improving the quality of life of slum dwellers\u2014are closely related to the poverty and health MDGs (includ- ing Goal 5). The links with Goal 3 are indirect but no less important. Women\u2019s important roles in environmental protection and sustainable development are well recognized, notably in the outcome documents from the UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the World Summit on Sustainable 37 Development in Johannesburg in 2002. In most rural societies, women play distinct roles related to the raising of plants and animals; collection of water, fuel, fodder, and forest products for house- hold use and economic activities; and general management of land and water resources. Their contributions to the environment are particularly noticeable in the areas of biodiversity, water resource management, and combating deserti- fication. At the same time, the depletion of envi- ronmental resources and degradation of rural and urban environments strain women\u2019s efforts to ensure food security for their households, and diminish the health of women and their families. Women\u2019s organizations and networks in the re- gion have introduced a number of innovative environmental programs at the local level, but they are not well represented in environmental policy making and planning.81 MDG progress re- ports from the region include very few explicit ref- erences to gender issues related to Goal 7, although the environmental issues raised in the reports have clear gender dimensions. In general, MDG report- ing on Goal 7 would benefit from greater use of alternative data sources such as reports on urban and environmental conditions prepared by UN agencies, NGOs, and citizens\u2019 groups.82 Sustainable development and environ- mental protection. Deforestation and contami- nation of water sources are serious problems in many countries in the region, as confirmed in their MDG progress reports. Illegal logging and clearing of forest areas for agricultural land and other uses deprive poor households of important sources of fuel and nontimber forest products on which they depend for food and medicine. De- forestation particularly affects women and girls in rural areas, because they are generally respon- sible for gathering fuel wood and other forest products, and must walk longer distances to find these products. Contamination of water sources from natural arsenic, fertilizers, pesticides, min- ing, industrial waste, and other pollutants takes a similar toll on women and girls in rural areas, who are mainly responsible for collecting water for household use. As discussed below, most rural households in the region only have access to un- treated water from natural sources. As those sources are depleted or contaminated, women and girls must walk longer distances to collect water, or make do with the inferior water that is nearby and suffer the health consequences. In many countries in the region, over 50% of house- holds use solid fuels (including wood and char- coal) for cooking and heating, and the percentage is likely to be much higher in rural areas.83 Cam- bodia and Nepal, for example, report that over 90% of households use traditional fuels. The indoor air pollution caused by the use of these fuels without good ventilation has been linked to high levels of illness and death, particularly in women and children.84 Safe water and basic sanitation. UNESCAP estimates that over 90% of urban dwellers in the region now have access to safe water, and over 70% have access to improved sanitation. Although urban/rural gaps are nar- rowing, coverage levels are still much lower in rural areas, especially in remote and disadvan- taged communities. Nepal, for example, reports that Dalit communities have poor access to safe water, and a recent country gender assessment for Sri Lanka notes that only 25% of workers on plantation estates have access to safe water, with similarly low coverage levels in conflict-affected areas. Even where piped water systems are in place, there can be substantial problems with water quality, particularly in Central Asian coun- tries where water systems have fallen into disre- pair.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66a76b45-a814-42ce-940c-2276da96370f": {"__data__": {"id_": "66a76b45-a814-42ce-940c-2276da96370f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f839b6985a6bf06447f9b7f07b7e18ffdb389413512b518b072390673458f80"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d7a2cce-f488-41e1-b4b3-33b199a0d949", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5fc8d8ad7a6c32d0076addd16bd43a3aba59cdce2ae3718817331916945810c1"}}, "hash": "a7a9d49275e1543f1578aec2298ac9526a850579ef38453f2103ae2e87198792", "text": "Tajikistan, for example, reports that over 50% of its water systems have completely dete- riorated, and Kazakhstan reports that its poor- est oblasts cannot afford", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0877ab44-10f5-4cbc-928d-3272de2a4aad": {"__data__": {"id_": "0877ab44-10f5-4cbc-928d-3272de2a4aad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7d01f959a0109716c6663037e4d2a9f5eafcbec2700bb3a2e3e42793e709a6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "6af51548-c03c-43f9-a841-b94b812e6710", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b9c8ac28b5b881c4866ddf30f7eb2017fd51158af6281c9b0ed22131f1b665f"}}, "hash": "5af84979cce4e6cae1b591ebc7c335e2b548920072870f86ed15ee1268472ecb", "text": "to maintain their systems. Arsenic contamination of groundwater in several countries in South Asia has also ren- dered many tube wells unsafe. Access to basic sanitation facilities in most rural areas is still ex- tremely low, even in Central Asian countries such as Tajikistan (only 23% coverage) and Kyrgyz Republic (only 33% coverage). Statistics on ur- ban coverage rates for clean water and basic sani- tation also mask much lower coverage levels in slum areas.85 Improvements in access to safe water and improved sanitation under Goal 7 carry a num- ber of gender-related benefits. Measures to pro- vide safe water sources close to rural communities will free up women\u2019s and girls\u2019 time for other activities, including income-generating activities and school attendance. Access to safe water and basic sanitation also significantly reduces the risk of contracting waterborne and other diseases, Gender Dimensions of Progress on Other Goals Environmental poverty has clear gender dimensions. The participation of women can significantly improve the outcomes of water, sanita- tion and slum improvement programs as well as enhance the sustainable use of natural resources and clean energy. 38 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific which are major health risks especially for preg- nant women, infants, and children. In both urban and rural areas, constructing sanitation facilities closer to settlements lowers the security risks for women and girls, especially at night. Providing safe water and appropriate toilet facilities in pri- mary and secondary schools also encourages school attendance, especially by girls. A gender-sensitive approach to the water and sanitation targets under Goal 7 also can ensure more effective and sustainable outcomes. Women\u2019s input in the design and location of water and sanitation facilities ensures that the facilities will be appropriate and convenient to their pri- mary users. Women\u2019s participation in commu- nity awareness raising about good hygiene practices\u2014a key element of most water and sani- tation projects\u2014is also essential to their success and impact. In areas of South Asia where arsenic contamination of groundwater is a problem, it is particularly important to involve women and women\u2019s organizations in raising awareness and encouraging households to shift from contami- nated tube wells to safer\u2014but often less conve- nient\u2014water sources. Slums. In many Asian cities, slum areas have grown rapidly as more people migrate from rural areas and neighboring countries in search of work. Bangladesh, for example, reports that about 50% of its urban population now live in informal settlements. As noted above, slums tend to have much poorer water and sanitation facili- ties than formal settlements. Housing is substan- dard, tenure is insecure, and settlements are overcrowded and often unsafe, especially at night. Schools and health centers are often nonexist- ent, except for those run by NGOs. In this crowded and unsanitary environment, pregnant women and children are particularly susceptible to communicable diseases, and women and girls are at risk of harassment and violence. At the same time, the participation of women and women\u2019s organizations can significantly improve the outcome of slum improvement programs. As primary users of basic services, women are often better informed about the basic needs of slum residents. Slum dwellers\u2019 organizations, in which women are leaders and active participants, have successfully worked with municipal governments in several countries in the region to build im- proved housing and public toilets in slum areas, resettle squatters, and develop innovative ten- ure arrangements for slum dwellers.86 Goal 8\u2013Develop a Global Partnership for Development Goal 8 is perhaps the broadest MDG, encom- passing targets related to trade and finance, sov- ereign debt, youth employment, access to affordable essential drugs and information and communication technologies (ICTs), and the spe- cial needs of least-developed countries, land- locked developing countries and small island developing states. While Goal 8 and its targets call for action mainly by developed countries, many countries in Asia and the Pacific have re- ported from their perspectives on one or more of the Goal 8 areas. Although not well reflected in the progress reports, several of the Goal 8 areas also have gender implications. A few of these ar- eas are discussed below. Development assistance.

Only Kazakhstan reports specifically on ODA for gender-related activities, noting that it represents only 1% of technical assistance re- ceived. Under Goal 5, the Philippines also notes the need to secure new funding for its reproduc- tive health programs because of a phasing out of USAID support for contraceptives. Worldwide, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) esti- mates that about 18% of total bilateral assistance has gender equality as either a principal or sec- ondary objective. Within this area, ODA support is heavily concentrated in health (19%) followed by education (16%), governance and civil soci- ety (15%) and multisector activities, including traditional \u201cwomen in development\u201d projects (15%). Gender equality objectives are also in- 39 cluded in assistance for agriculture, water, and finance, perhaps reflecting donors\u2019 recognition of women\u2019s important roles in the agriculture and water sectors and women\u2019s high level of partici- pation in microfinance projects. However, gen- der concerns are not visible in ODA for energy, transport and communications, which together account for close to a third of all bilateral assis- tance. In Asia, only about half of all bilateral assistance for basic health and education has a gender focus (although the proportion is much higher\u2014close to 80%\u2014for population and reproductive health assistance). In contrast to other regions, the gender focus in assistance to the water sector in Asia is particularly low (10%), which is especially troubling because Asia receives far more support to this sector than either Africa or Latin America.87 Multilateral assistance to Asia and Pacific countries is provided by the UN system, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank (ADB). A recent internal ADB review found that 12% of ADB loans approved during 1998\u20132004 had a gender theme, and an additional 17% of loans mainstreamed gender concerns, for example, through a gender action plan linked to the loan\u2019s objectives. ADB\u2019s highest level of attention to gen- der concerns has been in its assistance to the health sector, followed by education and agri- culture. As in bilateral ODA, the lowest level of attention to gender has been in the energy, trans- port, and communication sectors. In recent years, about a third of ADB\u2019s loans for water supply and sanitation projects have had a gender theme or mainstreamed gender concerns.88 Although incomplete, these snapshots of external assistance to the region suggest that there is substantial attention to gender issues in donor support for the education and health MDGs (par- ticularly Goal 5). However, about half of the bilateral aid to the region for basic health, 40% of aid for basic education, and 90% of aid for water supply and sanitation do not have a gen- der focus. Based on data for all developing regions, as much as 80% of all ODA to Asian and Pacific countries may not have a gender focus. This is problematic from the broader perspec- tive of Goal 3. Without consistent support for gender equality across all sectors, it is unlikely that developing countries in the region\u2014espe- cially least-developed countries\u2014will make sig- nificant progress in narrowing gender gaps and empowering women. Trade. Virtually all countries in the region are in the process of liberalizing their trade rules either as members of the WTO, through regional trading blocs or under bilateral trade agreements. Increased trade and cross-border investment are expected to contribute not only to economic growth, but also to poverty reduction.89 It is becoming clear, however, that trade liberaliza- tion through the WTO and other trade regimes can have different impacts on women and men, depending on gender-related patterns of employ- ment, ownership of businesses and assets, and other factors in domestic economies.90 For ex- ample, the rapid expansion of export manufac- turing in several countries has created job opportunities for large numbers of women, par- ticularly from rural areas. However, there is sub- stantial gender segregation in the export manufacturing sector, with women largely work- ing in lower-skilled, lower-paying jobs, often under strenuous working conditions. These lower-level factory jobs provide little security, and tend to be the first eliminated or subcontracted as industries restructure to become more inter- nationally competitive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "224751f5-3387-43cc-856a-e559a78c3c58": {"__data__": {"id_": "224751f5-3387-43cc-856a-e559a78c3c58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "621b90a9f22e4fdc5b821ccb56bc6edbfefb4c84145df21d5c428b40a1ccfb22"}, "2": {"node_id": "a28909a7-8b72-4348-9866-ef267a556f23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0225262f5fb788deb0546c1a364e1e389edcff33478fa1a88d7d7ace106a4c3e"}}, "hash": "f4f99437c0aa380209d1026fca0cf1cfa6c44f628c25612b2dfbe854da225732", "text": "Many of these jobs are in garment factories, which are facing intensive competition and uncertainty following the re- moval of long-standing import quotas under the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.

Workers in export processing zones receive little protection from national labor laws, since these zones are typically exempt from those laws or subject to more relaxed labor standards. Liberalization of trade is expected to pro- vide additional markets for domestically pro- duced goods, and a wider array of products and services for consumers. However, small farmers and producers are less likely to benefit from increased trade because of their limited access to capital, new technology, and market informa- tion, and the risk that cheaper imports may Gender Dimensions of Progress on Other Goals MDG 8 has strong gender implications, for example, in the areas of devel- opment assis- tance, trade, access to afford- able drugs, knowledge transfer and youth employ- ment. 40 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific undercut them in local markets. In particular, women farmers and entrepreneurs tend to oper- ate on a smaller scale due to their limited access to land, credit, and other resources, and the need to juggle business and household responsibilities. A recent country gender assessment for the Fiji Islands, for example, notes that women who pro- duce Fijian handicrafts are being undersold by cheaper, factory-made imports. Under WTO and regional trading arrange- ments, most countries in the region have sub- stantially reduced import tariffs, particularly on manufactured goods. While this has benefited domestic consumers of those goods, it has also significantly reduced government revenues.91 The Philippines, for example, reports that reduced tariff revenues have not been offset by increased revenues from other sources, placing a consider- able strain on the government budget. Without alternative revenue sources, large budget short- falls due to lost tariff revenues may prevent gov- ernments in the region from making the substantial investments needed to achieve the MDGs, particularly in the areas of education, health, water, and sanitation. Access to affordable drugs. The Goal 8 target of providing access to affordable essential drugs is both a health issue and a trade issue. Access to essential drugs is fundamental to all the health MDGs, including Goal 5. In Asia and the Pacific, progress in this area has been attributed to India\u2019s manufacture and export of generic drugs, as well as collaboration among govern- ments, donors, public-private partnerships, NGOs, and others.92 By 2016, least-developed members of the WTO will be required to patent pharmaceuticals, and will be restricted in their ability to manufacture and import generic ver- sions of patented drugs under the WTO Agree- ment on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The WHO reports that the patents on 600 or more life-saving drugs will expire between 2005 and 2010.93 However, there are still concerns about developing countries\u2019 future access to affordable drugs, particularly newer drugs and drug combinations to treat HIV and AIDS.94 Bangladesh, for example, reports that 80% of its population previously had access to affordable essential drugs, achieved through the manufacture of drugs by a state-owned phar- maceutical firm and drug price controls. The government is now under increasing pressure from pharmaceutical firms to lift these controls, and the future of the state pharmaceutical firm after 2016 is unclear. India has already amended its intellectual property laws to conform to the TRIPS Agreement. Access to affordable drugs has a number of gender dimensions. Women in most societies in the region are the primary caretakers of sick children and other family members, and tend to spend more of their income on essential household expenses, such as medicine. For poor households, the cost of drugs can be prohibitive, and can lead to rationing in which women avoid or postpone medical care for themselves. Youth employment. This Goal 8 target is linked to both Goals 2 and 3. Several countries in the region report high levels youth unemploy- ment, especially in urban areas, and underem- ployment in rural areas. Unemployed youth represent 49% of all unemployed workers in the region, and unemployment rates are higher among young women in both South Asia and Southeast Asia.95 Countries\u2019 ability to provide quality jobs for the large numbers of young men and women entering the workforce each year depends in part on the quality of basic educa- tion and technical training they receive. As dis- cussed in connection with Goal 3, young women in the region who pursue postsecondary educa- tion tend toward traditional fields, such as health and education, which are also the least well paid.

The region\u2019s uneven performance under the other MDGs also affects the prospects for improving women\u2019s capabilities, access to resources and opportuni- ties, and security. This mixed report card is con- sistent with the region\u2019s recent assessment of progress in implementing the Beijing Platform for Action, which is reflected in the Bangkok Communiqu\u00e9 adopted by members of UNESCAP in September 2004 (see Appendix 1). The Communiqu\u00e9 notes that gains have been made in several key areas of the Beijing Plat- form, but that there are still gaps and challenges that need to be addressed. At the recent World Summit, governments from the region reaffirmed the broad develop- ment goals outlined in the Millennium Declara- tion. In particular, they confirmed the importance of implementing the Beijing Platform for Action in order to achieve the MDGs, and they endorsed a comprehensive agenda to achieve gender equality and empower women (see Appendix 2). These World Summit commitments provide a sound framework for governments and other stakeholders in the region to intensify their efforts to narrow gender gaps and empower women and girls. This section summarizes some of the com- mon challenges to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in the region, and then provides examples of promising interventions and sup- portive institutions to guide future actions. Regional Challenges Traditional gender norms, stereotypes, and practices. MDG progress reports from across the region confirm that the persistence of traditional norms and assumptions related to gender roles and women\u2019s capabilities significantly hampers efforts to narrow gender gaps and empower women. Patterns of gender discrimination are seen most starkly in sex-selective abortions, forced marriages and various forms of violence against women and girls, but are also reflected in girls\u2019 lower participation rates in school, women\u2019s high rates of anemia, high levels of maternal death and disability, gender segrega- tion and gender wage gaps in employment, women\u2019 low rates of landownership, and women\u2019s limited participation in decision-making bodies at all levels of government. These patterns of dis- crimination and exclusion are compounded for women in marginalized groups, including ethnic minorities, disadvantaged castes, refugees and internally displaced persons, migrants and the disabled. The entrenched attitudes and behav- iors related to gender roles and women\u2019s status point to the continuing need to sensitize and win the support of male decision makers and opin- ion-leaders\u2014including government and politi- cal party officials, community and religious leaders, business leaders, teachers, and health professionals\u2014for measures to promote gender Future Directions 44 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific equality and empower women and girls. There is also a need for greater investment in gender sensitization and behavior change strategies tar- geting men as partners, parents and co-work- ers. In specific programs and projects, this means that more attention needs to be given to \u201csoft- ware\u201d activities, such as gender sensitization of government staff and community leaders, com- munity awareness-raising on gender issues, so- cial mobilization of women and supportive men, and other measures to ensure that women and men can participate equally. Migration and displacement. The in- creasing mobility of women as well as men, both within countries and across borders, is another regional trend with major implications for gen- der equality and women\u2019s empowerment. Mi- gration for work has become a major safety valve for poor households and has opened up oppor- tunities for many young women to escape the restrictions of rural life and live and work on their own. However, migration can cut short adoles- cent girls\u2019 education and migrant workers often do not have the legal status to access health and other basic services in their destination city or area. Migration also entails special risks for women and girls, including risks of harassment and violence en route to their destination, and harsh and abusive treatment by their employ- ers. At worst, those who rely on agents to help them find work may instead be trafficked into forced sex work or other exploitative conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc9cedb2-7ada-4040-8139-e5bd2c0a5780": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc9cedb2-7ada-4040-8139-e5bd2c0a5780", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa8998b2d54b521bec2ab843cf0d5b9ac2ae23f0472f204bf949e0e3f71d4b05"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e90000b-f8fa-40cb-9962-2815d755e7b7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e70f116cda37893f970b8330e34b39b7ad5be0608eb8058e6ad90f1dd28d3a1"}}, "hash": "48bb9f844ffccb6d9270b01a7c5be664a0c4d970e49d83b743b6278da06fde99", "text": "Some countries, such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka, have developed programs to support their overseas workers, especially women, and other countries, including Bangladesh and Nepal, are following suit.

However, there is much more that countries can do to improve the status, living conditions, and security of migrants within their borders\u2014both internal migrants and those from neighboring countries. Conflicts and natural disasters also force large numbers of people to migrate to urban centers, other regions, and across borders. Refu- gees and internally displaced persons typically find themselves in even more precarious living conditions than voluntary migrants, with lim- ited access to basic services, few income-gener- ating opportunities, and exposure to harassment and violence. Displaced women\u2014especially wid- ows and other single women with small children \u2014are especially vulnerable in these circum- stances, but they rarely have a voice in relief and reconstruction efforts. Countries in the region can do much more to include women\u2019s organizations and affected women in relief and reconstruction planning and programs, and to address the par- ticular needs and constraints of displaced women following conflicts and disasters. Globalization and regional integration. Asia is \u201cthe most \u2018globally integrated\u2019 region in the world,\u201d96 and several of its outwardly-ori- ented countries have achieved remarkable rates of growth. The lowering of trade barriers, pro- motion of export industries, and increasing interconnectivity through television and the Internet have had dramatic impacts on regional economies and societies. The lowering of trade barriers has also created large export opportuni- ties for the region\u2019s farmers and manufacturers. However, small farms and micro and small busi- nesses\u2014which women are more likely to man- age\u2014are at a disadvantage in the global and regional marketplace due to their smaller scale; more limited access to credit, technology and market information; exclusion from trade asso- ciations; and lack of awareness of trade rules and practices. They may also be undercut in local markets by cheaper imports of agricultural prod- ucts and manufactured goods. Young women in particular have benefited from the rapid expan- sion of export manufacturing jobs in several countries. However, the experience of such coun- tries as Republic of Korea, Philippines, and Thai- land shows that the low-skilled manufacturing jobs predominantly occupied by women are also among the first to be eliminated or subcontracted as industries restructure to become more com- petitive. Export processing zones also can be exempted from local labor laws and regulations, which increase the risk of worker exploitation and abuse. To ensure that poor women and men ben- efit from the expansion of trade and regional integration, it will be extremely important for governments and regional bodies to analyze the gender-related impacts of these trends, to sup- port small farmers and businesses, and to help displaced workers upgrade their skills or find alternative livelihoods. Governments and export manufacturers should also be encouraged to take 45 the \u201chigh road\u201d by adhering to core labor stan- dards and promoting decent work. Decentralization. Most countries in the region are also in the process of decentralizing the delivery of basic services and other govern- ment functions to subnational levels, including planning and revenue-raising activities. Several MDG progress reports note that this trend pre- sents both opportunities and risks for achieve- ment of the MDGs. In principle, decentralization brings government service providers closer to citi- zens and should encourage them to provide higher-quality and more locally appropriate ser- vices. However, Indonesia and the Philippines report that decentralization has disrupted the delivery of basic services, especially in the health sector. Moreover, Kazakhstan and the PRC report that decentralization has left poorer regions chronically underfunded and unable to maintain basic health, water supply, and sanitation ser- vices. These service disruptions and deficiencies fall hardest on the poorest households, and especially poor women. The decentralization of political decision making also presents both risks and opportunities for women. There is a tendency for local elites, who are usually male-dominated, to control locally elected bodies. In conservative rural areas, male-dominated local bodies may establish local rules or condone traditional prac- tices that discriminate against women and girls. However, the legislation of quotas and reserved seats in several countries has opened up space for women to participate in local decision mak- ing, with positive results for women and for com- munities as a whole. Nevertheless, locally elected women, particularly in conservative rural areas, need political support to overcome resistance from male leaders and capacity building to func- tion effectively.

Some countries have also enacted\u2014or are consider- ing\u2014laws prohibiting domestic violence, other forms of violence against women, and traffick- ing. However, the Bangkok Communiqu\u00e9 con- firms that countries in the region share several problems in implementing these laws and poli- cies: \u2022 The national institutions charged with co- ordinating government efforts to promote gender equality are chronically under- staffed and under-resourced; they are often excluded from key planning and budget exercises; and they have only tenuous links with key central ministries (such as finance and planning) and with sector ministries. \u2022 Finance, planning, and sector ministries have little technical capacity to identify and address gender issues in their own opera- tions. This seriously undermines countries\u2019 policy commitments to \u201cmainstream\u201d gen- der concerns in all key sectors. Line minis- tries in the \u201chard\u201d sectors are particularly ill-equipped to carry out \u201csoftware\u201d activi- ties, such as gender and social analysis, con- sultations with women and other excluded groups, community awareness-raising, and social mobilization. \u2022 Women, especially from poor and marginalized communities, have limited awareness of their rights and limited resources and power to assert these rights and protect themselves from violations. Law enforcement officials are frequently insensi- tive or biased, particularly toward poor women and women from disadvantaged castes and minority groups, and laws pro- tecting women\u2019s interests are not well enforced. Formal judicial processes are gen- erally inaccessible to poor women, and tra- ditional dispute resolution mechanisms tend to enforce patriarchal norms. Regional diversity. Given the diversity of cultures, physical environments, economic sys- tems and governance structures across the region, and wide differences within countries, it is extremely important for gender equality strate- gies to be based on thorough analysis of local con- ditions and constraints; consultations with women and men from different social and eco- nomic groups in both urban and rural areas; and locally appropriate and tested approaches. While the diversity within the region cautions against \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d solutions, it also presents a tre- mendous opportunity for cross-learning. Many Future Directions The strategic priority areas for achieving gen- der equality and empowerment as identified in the Millennium Project are also relevant for scaling up in the Asia and Pacific region. They include post- primary educa- tion, sexual and reproductive health and rights, time- saving infra- structure, prop- erty rights, employment, gender-based violence, and representation in national and local govern- ment. 46 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific of the world\u2019s great success stories in narrowing gender gaps and empowering women have oc- curred in Asia and the Pacific. In this sense, the region is a rich laboratory for testing innovative approaches to gender equality, and countries have much to share and learn from each other. Innovative NGOs and their affiliates, such as BRAC (formerly the Bangladesh Rural Advance- ment Committee) and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Self-Employed Women\u2019s Association (SEWA) in India, and Indian and Thai affiliates of Slum/Shack Dwellers International, have al- ready inspired similar NGO initiatives elsewhere in the region and in other parts of the world. At a government level, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand are sharing their success and expertise in gender mainstreaming and gender budgeting with other developing countries through their south-south cooperation programs. Regional in- stitutions, such as ADB and UNESCAP and other international partners, have also facilitated shar- ing of gender-related expertise among countries in the region. To ensure that all countries in the region make steady progress in narrowing gen- der gaps and empowering women, more regional exchanges of expertise and experience will be extremely valuable and should be strongly sup- ported by the UN system, the development banks, bilateral donors, and foundations. Promising Initiatives Based on a comprehensive survey of worldwide trends, initiatives and research results, the UN Millennium Project has recommended seven stra- tegic priority areas for achieving gender equality and empowering women, almost all of which were endorsed by governments at the recent World Summit (see Box 5 and Appendix 2).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8f778d0-d6b8-4515-bafa-50e671207912": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8f778d0-d6b8-4515-bafa-50e671207912", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a38d1986160aad8db0884d438370d7b68d1e3c5c9b58971d980b61daddece6cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "80851242-e6e1-432b-a32e-f2752be13aa4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ffbb26f61aeb958cc109735615ff25e41bf4afcf0cf2b6640bd675f878901a9"}}, "hash": "108034ec2356fd98e64e3896e9f25286f04231328d573efcc5480bff7755c828", "text": "These strategic priorities are already re- flected in the national gender action plans of most countries in the region, as well as in specific ini- tiatives supported by governments, development agencies and banks, NGOs, and community- based organizations (CBOs).

The strong tendency for young women to select ter- tiary courses in \u201ctraditional\u201d fields, such as teach- ing and nursing, has been addressed in the Philippines, for example, through scholarships in science and technology and technology-based training specifically for women, as well as an af- firmative action policy to encourage women to enroll in industrial courses. Cambodia is intro- ducing night school programs in urban areas to encourage young working women to continue their education. A major challenge for countries is to provide nonformal education to women who have been bypassed by the formal education system, espe- cially in rural and ethnic minority areas. The Viet Nam government, collaborating with the Viet- nam Women\u2019s Union, recently launched a com- munity-based literacy and postliteracy program targeting ethnic minority women. The Philip- pines also has established an alternative educa- tion system for indigenous women and girls, which includes child-minding centers so that women and older girls can attend classes while still minding their young children and siblings. India\u2019s Mahila Samakhya Programme (Educa- tion for Women\u2019s Empowerment), launched in 1987, is an innovative government-sponsored program promoting literacy, practical learning, and confidence-building through the formation and support of self-help groups, especially among landless and socially excluded women. The pro- gram now operates in 46 districts in nine states, and has inspired a number of spin-off initiatives, including a new project to develop video and audio material learning resources for self-help groups.98 Guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health and rights. As the UN Millennium Project and others have argued, sexual and reproduc- tive health and rights are essential to women's empowerment and have a number of spillover benefits for women, their families, and commu- nities. Investments in sexual and reproductive health services, such as family planning, are also extremely cost effective.

Simi- lar strategies are being pursued in many other countries in the region, often through the Safe Motherhood Initiative. However, most of the progress made in these countries has been in urban areas. Maternal mortality rates in rural areas remain stubbornly high, due in large part to insufficient investment in rural health facili- ties, inadequate skill-upgrading and incentives for rural health personnel, formal and informal fees and costs that discourage rural women from seeking health care, and insufficient attention to the traditional attitudes that discourage or pre- vent women from accessing health services, especially in conservative rural areas of South Asia. Nevertheless, innovative partnerships, such as the Averting Maternal Death and Disability (AMDD) program, have demonstrated that Malaysia\u2019s success can be replicated even in remote and conservative rural areas (see Box 8).

This commitment to education is reflected in public expenditures for education, which rose from 6% of total development expendi- tures in 1970 to 26% in 2003. Several less-developed countries in the region are pursuing similar strategies. Bangladesh moved from a large gender gap in 1990 to a reverse gender gap by 2001. Bangladesh's Female Secondary School Assistance Program has received much attention, in particular its stipend program for rural girls, which is intended to cover all direct school costs as well as uniforms and transport. A recent gender assessment of an Asian Development Bank-financed project support- ing this program confirmed the success of the stipend program in raising adolescent girls' enrollments. However, the assessment also found that less progress was being made in other areas, such as the recruitment of female teachers to match the higher enrollment of girls, and that this was undermining the project's success. In one nongovernment school, for example, only two female teachers were available to search 400 girls before an exam under new procedures to prevent cheating. The assessment concluded that a more comprehensive gender plan, address- ing all of the constraints to adolescent girls' school achievements, would ensure more positive and sustainable results.

Countries in the region are addressing this through universal health insurance schemes or more targeted pro- grams for poor and vulnerable groups, including fee exemptions, free health cards, and reimburse- ment of health costs from health equity funds.103 However, practices of charging informal fees within public health facilities can be entrenched and difficult to undo, and fall hardest on the poor- est women and their families.

In Bangladesh, for example, an AMDD-supported project substantially increased the number of functioning comprehensive EmOC facilities throughout the country. Between 2000 and 2002, the number of women with obstetric complications who were treated in project-supported facilities increased by 70%, while the fatality rate from these complications was cut from 3.5% to 2%. The AMDD program focuses not only on improvements in health facilities and staff skills, but also on the social and economic barriers that prevent women from accessing health services. In Pakistan, for example, the AMDD partner Save the Children has been working with the Ministry of Health and provincial and district governments to address serious staffing shortages in rural health facilities in Sindh Province, and working at the district and community level to increase awareness of women's right to access health services.102 These activities have supplemented an ADB-funded women's health project in which a recent gender assessment found that insufficient effort was being made to recruit and retain female health staff and to carry out behavior change and social mobilization activities.

In an urban environmental improvement project in Viet Nam, for example, the Vietnam Women\u2019s Union is in charge of the household sanitation component of the project, which is expected to mobilize more women to participate in sanitation awareness and other activities.106 In Mumbai and Pune, India, an organization of poor urban women, Mahila Milan, has worked with NGO partners and gov- ernment agencies to construct improved hous- ing and public toilets in slum areas, based on Mahila Milan\u2019s designs, which address the pri- vacy, security, and other needs of poor women and girls.107 Property rights. Property rights, particu- larly related to land, significantly enhance women\u2019s economic opportunities and provide security in the event of the death of a spouse, divorce or separation, or land disputes involving other relatives, neighbors, government agencies, or land developers. However, women\u2019s entitle- ment to own land and other assets (such as fam- ily businesses) can be limited by customary norms and practices; biased or inconsistent stat- utes and regulations governing land, marriage, inheritance, contracts, and other matters; biased land reform, registration, and titling programs; lack of awareness or bias among officials involved in land administration and dispute settlement; and lack of awareness among women and men of their property rights. A common flaw in land laws and regulations, and in the procedures for registering and titling land, is the recognition of the \u201chead of household\u201d\u2014generally assumed to be the husband or male elder\u2014as the sole legal owner of family land.108 MDG progress reports and recent gender assessments confirm the per- sistence of traditional biases against women\u2019s ownership of land, particularly in parts of South Asia, among patrilocal and patrilineal ethnic groups in the GMS and Southeast Asia, and in Pacific countries with strong patrilineal traditions, such as the Fiji Islands. Gender blindness in the implementation of recent land reform programs in several transition economies, especially in Cen- tral Asia, has also resulted in significant gender inequalities in rural landownership. Neverthe- less, there are promising examples in the region of law and policy reforms, community mobili- zation and government-nongovernment partner- ships to correct these inequities. In India, an alliance of human rights and women\u2019s organizations advocated successfully for amendments in 2005 to the 1956 Hindu Suc- cession Act, which will remove gender inequali- ties in state laws governing the inheritance of agricultural land by Hindu citizens. Daughters, including married daughters, will now have an equal share in joint family property.109 The Phil- ippines also amended a 1936 regulation on the sale of public lands, which had prohibited a married woman from applying to purchase or lease public land without her husband\u2019s consent. Landownership certificates under the agrarian reform program must now be issued in the name of both husband and wife. In several transition economies in the region, actions have been (or are being) taken to ensure that recent land allo- cation schemes operate fairly from a gender per- spective (see Box 9). Gender issues related to land tenure arise in a number of other settings, including slum upgrading, resettlement of households in connec- tion with development projects, sale or lease of government-controlled land for private use, and the restoration or relocation of communities after natural disasters or resolution of civil conflicts. It is extremely important to build gender aware- ness among the government officials adminis- tering these programs, and to develop strategies to ensure gender equality in any related land allocations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de071288-69dc-43ad-a83f-3c6e444e208a": {"__data__": {"id_": "de071288-69dc-43ad-a83f-3c6e444e208a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56c4872b225ab812c1f1b68aed47f96d7ad00207149ac2e67d300666e7a5e859"}, "2": {"node_id": "c467cdb4-503e-41ae-9344-905a1face89b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ac0db6a20cd36c04a8989df94e6363bf7b34d4fa69a2750e39179486c4807b66"}}, "hash": "8e650765a18ebaf29fb0e2071b823544644aa8c14e21abcd9ddcc1943cf7ff3a", "text": "NGOs and CBOs can also play vital roles in mobilizing both women and men in affected communities.

Paid employment enhances women\u2019s autonomy and security and also fi- nances essential household expenditures on food, education, and health care. However, the returns on women\u2019s employment are limited by \u201cgender typing\u201d in postsecondary education and by hori- zontal and vertical segregation in labor markets, which channel women primarily into lower- skilled, lower-paid jobs with limited chances for promotion. In agriculture and in the informal nonagriculture sector, where most women in the region work, working conditions are strenuous and there is little if any social protection.112 Bo Bo Bo Bo Box 9: Ensuring Gender Eq x 9: Ensuring Gender Eq x 9: Ensuring Gender Eq x 9: Ensuring Gender Eq x 9: Ensuring Gender Equity in Land Priv uity in Land Priv uity in Land Priv uity in Land Priv uity in Land Privatization in T atization in T atization in T atization in T atization in Transition Economies ransition Economies ransition Economies ransition Economies ransition Economies In the Lao PDR, the Lao Women's Union lobbied effectively to ensure that the new Land Law would protect the traditional rights of ethnic Lao women to inherit family land. As a result, the Land Law expressly provides for the names of both husband and wife to be recorded in the register of family-owned land, and considerable attention has been paid to women's land rights in two land titling projects supported by the World Bank and the Australian Agency for International Development. Data from the first of those projects show success in raising the awareness of government staff and participating communities, with close to 40% of land titles issued to women and about 30% in joint ownership. However, the land titling projects have been limited mainly to urban areas. There has been less attention to gender issues in the allocation of agricultural land, which is governed by different procedures and managed by different government authorities. This gap will be addressed under the new National Strategy for the Advancement of Women (2006\u2013 2010). In other transition countries, efforts are under way to address the bias in earlier land reform programs, which resulted in privatized land being allocated mainly to men, with female- headed households obtaining smaller and inferior land parcels. Tajikistan's land code was amended in 2004, and amendments to the Kyrgyz Republic's land code have been drafted and are under consideration. In Viet Nam, the land law is silent as to which family names should be listed on land-use certificates, but the new law on family and marriage stipulates that land-use certificates must list the names of both husband and wife. However, Viet Nam reports that women's names still appear on only about 2% of existing land-use certificates, and there is no formal program for reissuing the certificates, which would require resources and specific instructions to local officials. In its national MDGs, Viet Nam has included a target to issue land- use certificates to both husbands and wives, which indicates high-level political commitment to continue to address the issue.

Especially since the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the line between formal and informal employ- ment for women has blurred, as more manufac- turers have downsized and replaced full-time factory jobs with part-time or contract work paid on a piece-rate basis. Even in a factory setting, female workers can have limited rights and pro- tection if they are subcontractors hired by an outside agency, they are migrants without legal status, or the factory is exempted from local la- bor laws under policies to promote foreign in- vestment and export manufacturing.113 Lack of public or community-based childcare services also limits women\u2019s employment options and forces poor women with small children to rely on subsistence farming or home-based work to supplement family incomes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b72d8903-f844-4181-8623-b00f1eeb1d6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b72d8903-f844-4181-8623-b00f1eeb1d6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff600c4cbad9927b00bd392a58c0dfe45e656861c3fae0d5df425dca5e9fb531"}, "2": {"node_id": "aabdfb0c-ede9-4970-a697-132a675fa683", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c51c1549c4fe809098060fedaa5d0cccf6b33600d2ea80ce892328011866864"}}, "hash": "ce5750ba344e4d375d0c18f78e2b2bed660b80622784f7073d0f2b9dfc21f74b", "text": "Nevertheless, there are a number of initiatives under way in the re- gion to improve work opportunities and condi- tions, especially for poor women.

These laws and regulations are not well enforced and generally do not apply to work in agriculture or the informal sector. In export processing zones, more limited labor stan- dards may also apply. However, some countries are pursuing law and policy reforms to address gaps in their labor law frameworks (see Box 10). Public employment schemes, and paid work on publicly-funded development projects, are important sources of income for poor women, especially in rural areas. In India, 30% of job opportunities under certain wage employment schemes are reserved for women. Studies from Bangladesh and India report high levels of women\u2019s participation in employment schemes, although they may be allocated fewer days of work and paid a lower wage than men.114 In ba- sic infrastructure projects, poor women often work on construction crews, but they are typi- cally paid less than men, have only rudimentary toilet facilities and accommodation, and may be subject to harassment or violence. The external agencies that finance infrastructure projects can play an important role in working with their gov- ernment counterparts to address these problems. For example, in infrastructure projects supported by ADB, civil works contractors are generally required to pay equal wages to women and men, and several recent projects include targets for women\u2019s employment and provisions on safe working conditions and facilities for workers. A recent gender assessment of an ADB-supported infrastructure project in Bangladesh found that progress had been made in raising women\u2019s con- struction wages and increasing women\u2019s access to more highly skilled work. However, the as- sessment cautioned that strong commitment and close monitoring by the executing agency would be needed to maintain and improve performance in this area.115 Workers\u2019 associations in several countries in the region are playing critical roles in advocat- ing for the rights of their members and also pro- viding a range of support services. The most famous is SEWA in India, which was the first union of informal workers\u2014including both ur- ban and rural\u2014in the world. In addition to ad- vocating law and policy changes, such as India\u2019s new national policy on street vendors, SEWA has established a number of affiliates, including a co- operative bank, village-based savings and credit groups, producer cooperatives, and providers of various services to its members (including health Bo Bo Bo Bo Box 1 x 1 x 1 x 1 x 10: R 0: R 0: R 0: R 0: Regional R egional R egional R egional R egional Ref ef ef ef eforms t orms t orms t orms t orms to Strengthen Labor La o Strengthen Labor La o Strengthen Labor La o Strengthen Labor La o Strengthen Labor Law F w F w F w F w Frame rame rame rame ramewwwwwor or or or orks ks ks ks ks In 2004, India adopted a national policy on street vendors, who are mainly women. The policy includes provisions on vendors' legal status, designation of vending zones, promotion of vendor associations, access to credit and social security benefits for vendors, and integration of street vendors in urban zoning and development. In Singapore, the business federation, employers' federation, and national trade union congress recently issued a Code of Responsible Employment Practices, including nondiscrimination in employment on the basis of sex, age, disability, and other factors. The Philippine Economic Zone Authority has established a committee to investigate complaints from workers in economic zones and has set up women's desks in some of these zones. The Philippine Government has also issued guidelines for informal cooperatives and associations to make contributions to the national social security program on behalf of their members. In the People's Republic of China, the law on the protection and rights of women was recently amended to make sexual harassment unlawful. (Recent opinion polls indicate that this is a major workplace problem, especially for women in service industries.) In Viet Nam, a gender equality law is being drafted that is expected to address employment issues related to women. The Mongolian Government plans to introduce new legislation on workplace discrimination.

The Phil- ippines, for example, has established a one-stop shop for training and employment services, including scholarships, access to credit, and job referrals. Cambodia plans to upgrade its \u201cwomen in development\u201d centers to more full-service women\u2019s empowerment centers, which will offer women training in market research, business development, and access to credit so that they can build micro and small enterprises. Malaysia is piloting two new Internet portals for women\u2014 one as a general resource link and the other to assist handicraft producers and other small entrepreneurs to market their products and ser- vices. In Bangladesh, the national women entre- preneurs\u2019 association is involved in developing the Government\u2019s new policy on small- and medium-sized enterprises, which will support targeted training, credit, and business develop- ment services for women entrepreneurs. Migrant workers\u2014both internal and cross- border\u2014are particularly vulnerable to exploita- tion and abuse, and have limited access to basic services and virtually no legal protection because of their irregular status. Sending countries, such as the Philippines and Sri Lanka, have estab- lished comprehensive support programs for over- seas workers, including regulation of employment agencies, pre-departure orientation, and out- reach services in their embassies in major desti- nation countries. Bangladesh and Nepal are beginning to introduce similar measures. The Lao PDR and Thailand recently signed a memoran- dum of understanding to regularize the work sta- tus of some Laotian migrants. Hong Kong, China, a major destination in the region, requires employers of foreign domestic workers to use a standard employment contract, including pro- visions on minimum wage and time off, and rec- ognizes migrant workers\u2019 unions.118 There is still much more that regional countries can do to regularize the status of migrant workers\u2014includ- ing their own citizens who migrate from rural to urban areas\u2014and to ensure that they have ac- cess to health care and other basic services, as well as legal protection from exploitation and abuse. Violence against women and girls. Gen- der-based violence\u2014including domestic vio- lence, sexual assault and sexual harassment outside the home, and trafficking in women and girls\u2014is a major cause of female death and dis- ability in the region, and a major contributor to women\u2019s economic and social disempowerment. It inflicts substantial direct and indirect costs on women, their families and communities, includ- ing health-related costs, lost workdays and re- duced productivity, and negative impacts on children. Because of its pervasiveness and com- plexity, multiple strategies have been developed to address the problem, including school and community awareness programs, law enforce- ment measures, health and other support ser- vices for victims, and improvements in public facilities to increase women\u2019s safety.119 In Asia and the Pacific, violence against women in its various forms has received increased attention over the past 10 years, due in large part to the documentation and advocacy of women\u2019s organizations. A recent survey by the UN Devel- opment Fund for Women (UNIFEM) found that, as of 2003, most countries in the region had criminal penalties for rape and sexual assault; 7 countries had legislation on domestic violence, with 13 others in the drafting process; and 9 countries had legislation on sexual harassment.120 Some countries have also legislated against spe- cific forms of violence, such as dowry deaths in India and acid attacks in Bangladesh. Some countries have recently introduced legislation against human trafficking, especially of women and children, and regional frameworks to com- bat trafficking are now in place in the GMS, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

UNIFEM, for example, reports that the women\u2019s police desks in Indone- sia, Philippines, and Thailand are at risk of being shut down because of understaffing, and the Philippines\u2019 plan to open crisis centers through- out the country has not been carried through.122 In addition to advocating legislation and other government action against gender-based violence, women\u2019s organizations in virtually every country in the region are engaged in community awareness-raising and providing vital support services to victims of violence. Their activities include creative use of media (including posters, pamphlets, theater, videos, and radio spots) to raise public awareness about the problem; sen- sitizing police, border officials, prosecutors and judges to take gender-based violence seriously and to deal sensitively with victims; training teachers to identify children who are victims of abuse; working with local officials and traditional dispute settlement bodies to deal more sensitively with violence cases; running crisis centers and hotlines for victims and potential victims of vio- lence; and providing legal services to victims.123 Many of these initiatives have been very effec- tive on a small scale, but need to be expanded with strong support from national and provin- cial governments. There are also opportunities to reduce the risk of violence through appropriate planning and construction of public facilities, such as markets, train stations, bus terminals and bus stops, pub- lic restrooms, and street lighting. The involve- ment of women\u2019s organizations and women in local government can ensure that women\u2019s safety concerns are incorporated in these designs. The CPTED124 methodology, which has been used successfully by urban planners in other regions, could also be useful, especially in urban devel- opment projects.125 Women\u2019s representation in political bodies. The representation of women in public decision making, especially through elected bod- ies, is an important aspect of women\u2019s empow- erment and democratic governance. It ensures that women\u2019s concerns are taken into account in decision making, and can improve the transpar- ency and responsiveness of government officials, especially at the local level.126 However, tradi- tional biases against women\u2019s involvement in public life, entrenched interests of community and political party leaders (who are mainly men), and women\u2019s own lack of confidence and expe- rience in the public arena prevent many women from running or being elected to public office. In Asia and the Pacific, several countries have ad- dressed this inequality by legislating reserved seats for women in the national parliament and/ or locally elected bodies. These include Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan in South Asia, the PRC and Taipei,China in East Asia, and Indonesia and the Philippines in Southeast Asia.127 In others, legislated or voluntary quotas on party lists have been used to increase women\u2019s repre- sentation. The Lao PDR and Viet Nam, for ex- ample, have achieved relatively high levels of women\u2019s representation in their national parlia- ments through quotas based on statutes and gov- ernment directives. Timor-Leste\u2019s success in electing a relatively large percentage of women in its first elections was due in large part to the advocacy of women\u2019s groups, which persuaded political parties to include more female candi- dates on their lists. In general, systems of pro- portionate representation, in which there are statutory or voluntary quotas for women on party lists and every other slot is assigned to a woman, are the most successful in increasing women\u2019s representation.128 In national parliaments, a relatively small number of female legislators can have limited influence to lobby for legislative action on behalf 55 of women, or to comment on other proposed leg- islation or the national budget from a gender perspective. They are also more likely to be appointed to committees on education, health, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s affairs, with little or no voice in committees on taxation and expen- ditures, agriculture, commerce, and security.

These actions contribute directly and sub- stantially to the achievement of virtually all the MDGs at the local level. Men\u2019s traditional involvement in community decision making, the dominance of local elites (primarily male), and women\u2019s limited literacy and lack of experience in public office can inhibit women from stand- ing for election or being elected, and can under- mine their credibility and effectiveness once in office. However, experience from several South Asian countries demonstrates that elected women can work effectively even in conservative rural areas, especially when they receive capacity building and other support from local NGOs and work together with local women\u2019s groups, and when local male leaders also receive sensitivity training (see Box 11). There are many other local bodies in which gender balance is vital to ensure that both women\u2019s and men\u2019s interests are represented, and to achieve better development outcomes includ- ing progress toward the MDGs. These include municipal authorities, village development com- mittees, dispute settlement committees, local health committees, school committees, water user groups, sanitation committees, and groups for managing community land and other resources. Although there are variations between and within countries, women\u2019s representation in these local bodies is often low, for many of the same reasons that limit their participation in legislative bod- ies. Unfortunately, the gender-balance require- ments for these institutions, if any, tend to be ad hoc, and therefore women\u2019s interests and per- spectives are not consistently reflected in local decision making. It is worth noting that virtually all countries in the region have endorsed the Beijing Platform for Action, which calls for a mini- mum of 30% women in decision-making posi- tions. To implement this commitment, several countries in the region including Malaysia, Nepal, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Viet Nam\u2014have set general targets for increasing women\u2019s partici- pation in public decision making at all levels. To implement the Beijing Platform and also con- tribute to progress toward the MDGs, it would be desirable for all countries in the region to set general targets of at least 30% for women\u2019s par- ticipation in decision-making bodies at all lev- els, including local institutions. In rural areas where women\u2019s mobility and public interactions are restricted by conservative social norms, women\u2019s self-help groups and other women-only groups could be given more formal voice in local decision making. External agencies and NGOs involved in local development projects have important roles to play in supporting the par- ticipation of women in the local institutions with which they work, and providing training and other support so that these women can gain con- fidence and function more effectively. Supportive Institutions Strategic initiatives to reduce gender gaps and empower women and girls are more effective Future Directions 56 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific when they are supported by equitable and responsive institutions. These include law and policy frameworks, government planning and budget processes, accountability and enforce- ment mechanisms, and partnerships with women\u2019s organizations and other key actors. Regional partnerships can also play a key role, especially on gender issues that have cross-border implications. This subsection considers some of the gender-responsive institutions already in place in Asia and the Pacific. The discussion draws heavily on countries\u2019 recent progress reports on their implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action. Law and policy frameworks. Virtually all countries in the region provide constitutional or statutory guarantees of gender equality, nondis- crimination and protection of women\u2019s rights. However, there are still gaps in these frameworks and weaknesses in enforcement. Several coun- tries are still in the process of drafting new laws on gender equality, domestic violence. and other matters. Other countries are revisiting and strengthening laws already in place.

In one capacity-building project supported by the Asian Development Bank, the female participants received training on union parishad procedures; the union budget and allocation process; their role as union members; skills such as running meetings, negotiation, and mediation; available government and NGO services; family and property laws; and the procedures in local arbitration courts (shalish). Following the training, the female councilors became much more active in identifying vulnerable community members for government safety net programs, accessing development resources for rural infrastructure projects, and arranging training, microcredit, and work opportunities for poor women in the community. About 60% also participated in shalish, which encouraged more women and poor people to come forward with their grievances. The project also facilitated the setting up of local development forums, in which elected women and their constituents could meet with local representatives of line ministries and NGOs to discuss ways to match local needs with available programs. These forums provided key opportunities for the elected women to present their constituents' concerns directly to govern- ment officials, and enhanced their authority and credibility within their communities. In addition, the project recommended changes in the local government ordinance and related procedures to clarify the functions of elected women and men, their participation in local government commit- tees, and other matters. Other mechanisms for increasing women's voice in local government, which have been used successfully in some states in India, include women's quorum requirements for village assemblies and earmarking of local development budgets for women's development activities (selected and managed by women's groups). In Cambodia, the planning and budget committees for commune councils must include a woman and man from each village.

The land reform cases also illustrate the importance of considering the traditional norms and practices that may conflict with or undermine a particular law reform, and address- ing these through awareness-raising activities in- volving both men and women. The land-titling projects in the Lao PDR, for example, have included gender-awareness activities for the gov- ernment staff involved, as well as for women and men in the project areas. Virtually all countries in the region have also introduced policy frameworks to promote gen- der equality and empower women, based on the Beijing Platform for Action. The framework fre- quently includes a strategy or policy, as well as a detailed plan of action. In India, several states have established their own policies on women\u2019s empowerment. Pakistan is also pursuing inno- vative gender policy reforms at both the federal and provincial levels (see Box 12). Countries have established various mecha- nisms to implement their gender policies and action plans. Common structures include a gov- ernment-wide committee or commission to pro- vide high-level support; a ministry or department to coordinate implementation of the policy at the national level and with local gov- ernments; a network of gender focal points in other key ministries to ensure that the policy is mainstreamed in their activities; and a gender working group or network to coordinate with donors and NGOs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d7f63e31-753d-435c-84c1-0d5228fe23d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "d7f63e31-753d-435c-84c1-0d5228fe23d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b07934f5606fe2c641d2096d733195809f3c040ffd0c7ddcaf9c23cd1925e84"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2f17012-4a1a-45d3-abe0-c0a2ddc273a7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "efa04fd513cead0e37b6939eb3186b37f490e7e1755dcc4b1c9af5624f1d5de7"}}, "hash": "17537799534efb44fdebacefb78a5c323a9309536285da81308d914bda607f6a", "text": "While these mechanisms look promising on paper, most countries report weak- nesses in their operation, due to inadequate staff- ing and funding of the focal ministry or department, its insufficient policy leverage with other key ministries, and limited commitment and capacity in the other ministries to address gender concerns.

In Cambodia, for example, the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has developed a gender education policy and gen- der mainstreaming strategy, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is now devel- oping a gender strategy through an agriculture sector development program supported by ADB. In India and the Philippines, the earmarking of a fixed percentage of appropriations for gender- related activities has also improved the incen- tives for sector ministries and local governments to implement the national gender policy (dis- cussed further below). National planning and budget pro- cesses. As a cross-sectoral issue, gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment should be fully addressed in national development plans, pov- erty reduction strategies, expenditure frame- works and budgets. Until recently, national gender policies and action plans have been given relatively little attention in these important pro- cesses, or gender has been treated as a separate \u201csector\u201d with little spillover to other sectors and areas. For example, the national poverty reduc- tion strategies recently developed by countries in the region typically discuss the relationship between poverty and gender, and identify gen- der issues in such traditional sectors as educa- tion and health, but they rarely analyze gender issues in other key sectors, such as agriculture Future Directions 58 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific Bo Bo Bo Bo Box 12: P x 12: P x 12: P x 12: P x 12: Pakistan Gender R akistan Gender R akistan Gender R akistan Gender R akistan Gender Ref ef ef ef eform A orm A orm A orm A orm Action Plans and Gender Suppor ction Plans and Gender Suppor ction Plans and Gender Suppor ction Plans and Gender Suppor ction Plans and Gender Support Pr t Pr t Pr t Pr t Programme ogramme ogramme ogramme ogramme To address the structural barriers to gender equality in Pakistan in a more comprehensive manner, the Ministry of Women Development and provincial women's departments have prepared federal and provincial gender reform action plans (GRAPs) in consultation with other ministries, provincial governments, parliamentarians, nongovernment organizations and develop- ment agencies. The GRAPs include measures to improve women's representation in political and administrative structures, and to change planning and budgetary processes in order to narrow gender gaps in public expenditure and the delivery of basic services. Thus far, the federal cabinet and the provincial cabinets of Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh have approved their respective GRAPs. The implementation of the GRAPs is being supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) through its larger devolution support program, and by the Canadian International Develop- ment Agency and other development partners. A recent gender assessment found that the inclusion of the GRAPs in larger governance reform programs gave greater prominence to gender issues at the policy level, but that the GRAPs still faced many challenges in implementation, especially in conservative regions such as the Northwest Frontier Province.

The GSP builds on the achieve- ments of UNDP's previous Gender Equality Umbrella Project, which included the training of over 27,000 women councilors elected to local government in 2001, drafting of legislation mandating gender review and analysis of proposed government projects, initiation of gender-sensitive budget processes within the Ministry of Finance, and a comprehensive social audit on abuse against women.

They typically include a \u201cgender\u201d section, based on the national gen- der policy and action plan, but do not include a cost estimate of the activities proposed in the \u201cgender\u201d section. The UN Millennium Project has recommended that countries revise or update their national poverty reduction strategies (or na- tional development plans) to align these strate- gies better with the MDGs, and fully cost the interventions needed to achieve the MDGs (or more ambitious national goals). If countries fol- low this recommendation, it will provide an opportunity to integrate gender concerns better in all key sectors supported by the strategy, to identify gender-related targets and indicators, and to cost the gender-related activities outlined in the strategy.131 To succeed, however, it will be extremely important to involve the national gen- der ministry or department in key phases of the process, and to ensure that women\u2019s organiza- tions and other civil society groups supporting gender equality have meaningful opportunities to participate. The costing of interventions needed to achieve the MDGs\u2014including the gender-spe- cific goals\u2014also provides an opportunity to cor- rect the serious underfunding of national gender policies and action plans. Several countries in the region already have some experience in apply- ing gender analysis to public revenues and expenditures. The Philippines, and more recently India, have gone further and mandated the ear- 59 marking of expenditures for gender-related activities. Since 1995, all departments and agen- cies in the Philippine Government have been required to allocate at least 5% of their appro- priations to projects designed to address gender issues. In its Ninth Plan, India introduced a Women\u2019s Component Plan, which earmarks 30% of funds under various development and welfare schemes for women beneficiaries. A detailed cost- ing of the major interventions needed to achieve gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment under Goal 3 would complement these gender budget provisions by identifying activities that are not yet adequately funded, especially in non- traditional sectors and on such issues as political representation and violence against women. Accountability and enforcement. Many laws that promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment\u2014including labor laws, property and inheritance laws, laws establishing a mini- mum age of marriage, and laws against gender- based violence and trafficking\u2014are not fully implemented or enforced. This can be due to a lack of staff and other resources in the enforce- ment agencies (such as labor ministries and land administration offices), lack of gender awareness and sensitivity on the part of law enforcement officials and court officers, women\u2019s lack of awareness of their rights or their lack or power and resources to seek legal protection, and ten- sion between the formal laws and traditional norms and practices. There is increasing recog- nition in the region of these barriers to justice, especially for poor and socially excluded women. Where new laws or regulations are being intro- duced\u2014for example, the new land law in Cam- bodia\u2014it is now much more common to see training for government officials and community- awareness activities included in the law reform program. Many NGOs in several countries have also been providing legal literacy and legal aid services, especially to poor and marginalized women. Special courts and other tribunals have also been set up, for example in Bangladesh, to provide faster and more accessible relief to poor women, especially in cases of violence.

As noted above, some countries, such as Viet Nam, have built an accountability mechanism into their policy framework by providing for annual audits of the performance of ministries and agencies, and reporting of the results to high-level officials. Women\u2019s organizations and other civil society groups can also make government officials more accountable through monitoring and audit ac- tivities. As noted in Section V.B, the Public Af- fairs Center in Bangalore, India, has used patient surveys and \u201creport cards\u201d to publicize the per- sistent demand for informal payments in mater- nity hospitals, and to generally measure the quality, availability and affordability of other basic services. In Kerala, India, women\u2019s groups have audited the implementation and impact of anti-poverty programs implemented by local government.132 In the Philippines, 400 local councils of women are monitoring local govern- ment unit policies and programs. As noted in the earlier discussion of Goal 8, donor support for gender equality initiatives in the region is uneven, and tends to be concen- trated in the education and health sectors to the neglect of other sectors. More consistent track- ing of donors\u2019 gender-related programs is needed to ensure that donors follow through on their own policy commitments to gender mainstreaming, and that they are providing appropriate and ef- fective support to the gender equality goals of their developing country partners. Civil society organizations can play important roles in ensur- ing that donors are accountable for the gender- related results of their assistance programs, for example, through independent gender audits and assessments of donor-supported programs. Partnerships. Some of the main challenges to achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls across the region reside in deep- seated assumptions about women\u2019s and men\u2019s capabilities and roles, entrenched practices (such as early marriage), and community tolerance of Future Directions 60 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific domestic violence and other forms of abuse. Tra- ditional norms also influence the drafting and implementation of laws, regulations and policies, and shape the attitudes of government officials and private sector employers. Especially in rural areas, women are often unaware of their rights and entitlements under government programs intended to benefit them, or do not have the mobility and resources to claim these benefits and protection. In these circumstances, community awareness raising, social mobilization, and behavior change activities involving both men and women are essential to any interventions intended to improve women\u2019s access to basic ser- vices, income-generating opportunities, or par- ticipation in local decision making. Most government ministries have limited skills and in- centives to implement these \u201csoftware\u201d activi- ties at the local level. However, women\u2019s organizations and other NGOs and CBOs have a comparative advantage in precisely these areas. In virtually every developing country in the region, these organizations have piloted innova- tive approaches to the delivery of health services, informal education, formation of self-help groups, legal empowerment, inclusion of women in community decision making and development projects, and campaigns to promote \u201csocial goods,\u201d such as girls\u2019 education, family planning, safe sex and safe migration, and to discourage \u201csocial bads,\u201d such as domestic violence and traf- ficking. Sector ministries and local governments in many countries have sought out these organi- zations as partners to improve their own outreach and services, especially in poor and remote com- munities. Community-level partnerships between government and civil society groups experienced in working with poor women and men should be a key feature of any future inter- ventions to improve women\u2019s capabilities, oppor- tunities, security, and rights. In their recent reports on progress in imple- menting the Beijing Platform for Action, several countries in the region also confirm the impor- tance of strategic alliances between the government\u2019s focal ministry or department for gender and women\u2019s organizations. These part- nerships are particularly useful for proposing law reforms and policy changes, and improving the responsiveness of government programs and gov- ernment officials to the needs of poor and so- cially excluded women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9df1c27-33c6-4def-9c13-8ae215bb0069": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9df1c27-33c6-4def-9c13-8ae215bb0069", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "901210a97c96e1c28b8e3ec193e6d051d53b242d91cb6a05b692d1ae3e964d0f"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac5d3f27-71ae-4c90-81c5-b5a88222f3de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3770ccebc077a7f7ff39ebfe620a47314193760cfb741a7847bbda0f775d2d26"}}, "hash": "ff5c81c3561a07ff42475bb1bc3b24d51687409cd4079d9dd432bf7450013d59", "text": "For example, in the Republic of Korea, a campaign by women\u2019s or- ganizations to abolish the discriminatory family registry system persuaded the Ministry of Gen- der Equality to establish a task force, whose rec- ommendations led to the introduction of a bill in the National Assembly to abolish the system.

The UN system (par- ticularly UNDP and UNIFEM), the development banks, and bilateral development agencies have also been key partners with the national focal institutions for gender, providing both financial and technical support. Going forward, it will be important for these external agencies to help the focal institutions build their technical capacity to participate in national processes, such as the development of an MDG-based national pov- erty reduction strategy (or development plan) and medium-term expenditure frameworks. The recent success of the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs in Cambodia in influencing the national poverty reduction strategy and the Cambodian MDGs, and its involvement in the piloting of medium- term expenditure frameworks with other key ministries, demonstrate the potential of these focal institutions to have an impact at the na- tional policy level, despite their limited resources and political capital. Regional initiatives. Virtually all the inter- governmental bodies in Asia and the Pacific sup- port the regional and national goals of gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment through their existing programs. UNESCAP convened the recent review of regional progress in implement- ing the Beijing Platform for Action, and its Gen- der and Development Section provides research, technical, and networking support to member countries to assist them in implementing the Beijing Platform and CEDAW. About 40% of ADB loans to its developing member countries have 61 specific gender goals or seek to mainstream gen- der concerns; it also provides gender-related technical assistance.133 Other regional focal points on gender are the Asia-Pacific Economic Coop- eration (APEC) Gender Focal Point Network and Women Leaders\u2019 Network, the ASEAN Commit- tee on Women, the Pacific Women\u2019s Bureau, and the South Asian Association for Regional Coop- eration (SAARC) Autonomous Advocacy Group of Prominent Women Personalities. The APEC Gender Focal Point Network and the Pacific Women\u2019s Bureau, in particular, have supported projects to disseminate good practices in gender integration. The SAARC Autonomous Advocacy Group is advocating greater attention to improv- ing women\u2019s educational and economic oppor- tunities and ending violence against women in South Asia. In recent years, the main regional bodies have expanded their activities related to various social development issues, including human resource development, HIV/AIDS and other com- municable diseases, food security, employment, migration, and trafficking. All these areas are rel- evant to the achievement of the MDGs and all have clear gender dimensions. The main gender focus to date has been in the area of trafficking, including the SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Chil- dren for Prostitution and the ASEAN Declara- tion Against Trafficking in Persons Particularly Women and Children. (Six countries also recently signed a memorandum of understanding on Cooperation against Trafficking in Persons in the GMS.) Attention to gender concerns has been less consistent in other areas. To maximize the social impact of regional cooperation, regional organi- zations should include gender analysis and en- sure gender balance in all of their cooperative activities (including scholarship, training, and exchange programs). These principles of gender integration would also increase the social benefits Future Directions 62 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific of other initiatives, such as the regional economic cooperation programs supported by ADB in Cen- tral Asia, the GMS, and South Asia. As noted earlier, the Asia and Pacific region houses a wealth of successful experiences in clos- ing gender gaps and empowering women and girls. Bilateral cooperation and exchanges facili- tate the sharing of these diverse experiences within the region. Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand have been particularly active in shar- ing their expertise in gender integration through their south-south technical cooperation pro- grams, and the Philippines has proposed a regional training institution to expand and insti- tutionalize these programs.

In recent years, governments, the UN sys- tem, regional bodies and NGOs have begun to coordinate much more effectively to address human trafficking as an urgent regional prob- lem with clear gender impacts, for example, through the UN interagency project to combat trafficking in the GMS. A similar coordinated approach would also be beneficial to address other regional issues with gender implications, such as regional harmonization of skills training and accreditation, the regularization and sup- port of migrant workers, and control of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. 63 ENDNOTES 96 Jayati Ghosh. 2004.

Conclusions and Recommendations Countries in Asia and the Pacific are making progress toward achieving Millennium Develop- ment Goal 3\u2014promoting gender equality and empowering women\u2014mainly by narrowing gen- der gaps in primary and secondary education and raising literacy rates. However, progress in improving women\u2019s economic and political par- ticipation under Goal 3 has been more mixed, and most countries are not reducing the number of maternal deaths fast enough under Goal 5. Most countries in the region have put in place sound laws and policies to promote gender equal- ity and protect women\u2019s rights, but implemen- tation and enforcement mechanisms are weak and traditional gender norms and practices per- sist. The region as a whole faces a number of challenges to the achievement of gender equal- ity, but it is also home to some of the world\u2019s most innovative and successful strategies for nar- rowing gender gaps and empowering women. These success stories provide possible models for other countries to adapt and follow. The recent World Summit confirmed the importance of pursuing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment as a fundamental development goal in its own right, as well as an essential part of any strategy to reduce poverty and hunger, improve access to basic services, prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, and promote sustainable development. Building on the com- mitments in the Millennium Declaration, the World Summit Outcome endorses a clear set of actions to promote gender equality over the next 10 years and beyond. These World Summit com- mitments reflect a more expansive and multisectoral view of gender equality than the original targets and indicators for Goals 3 and 5, and support the broader view of these Goals that many countries in the region have already taken through their own national development goals, targets and indicators. The World Summit com- mitments to gender equality provide a sound framework for governments, civil society groups and development agencies to pursue more gen- der-equitable development outcomes in the region. Specific actions that each of these key stakeholder groups can take are outlined below. However, meaningful progress toward gender equality will not be made without strong politi- cal commitment at all levels and changes in pre- vailing social norms and attitudes. Government actions. To implement their commitments to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in both the Millennium Declara- tion and World Summit Outcome, governments in the region should \u2022 ensure that their national poverty reduction strategies (or national development plans) support the gender equality framework endorsed by the World Summit\u2014including time-bound actions to (1) eliminate gender inequalities at all educational levels; (2) guarantee women\u2019s rights to own and in- herit property; (3) ensure equal access to reproductive health services; (4) promote equal access to decent employment; (5) en- sure equal access to productive assets and resources including land, credit and tech- nology; (6) eliminate all forms of discrimi- nation and violence against women and Conclusions and Recommendations The 2005 World Summit commit- ments to gender equality provide a sound frame- work for govern- ments, civil society groups and develop- ment agencies to pursue more gender-equi- table outcomes in the region.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35312758-0a72-47bd-9933-9e3069765f7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "35312758-0a72-47bd-9933-9e3069765f7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pursuing Gender Equality through the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59654333729fd4ec34e8b651d0382f1afc999d39482680f9af41774483ede595"}, "2": {"node_id": "b867a583-b0a7-44b5-b138-e3f20e72ce03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pursuing-gender-equality-through-millennium-development-goals-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bfdbf732a75ae7412bcf2609574470f59d29f8aa73cf166625b044fbcb39ce49"}}, "hash": "1bb7338c46e7e81e2758e62872e4126a7b228313301ec8d684163d3ccc3e8d78", "text": "However, mean- ingful progress toward gender equality will not be made with- out strong political commit- ment at all levels and changes in prevailing social norms and attitudes. 66 Pursuing Gender Equality Through the MDG in Asia and the Pacific girls;

We recognize the importance of gender mainstreaming as a tool for achieving gender equality. To that end, we undertake to actively promote the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all political, eco- nomic and social spheres, and further undertake to strengthen the capabilities of the United Nations system in the area of gender.

A key to abbreviations of country names is provided in Appendix 4. Where more than one country is included in a cell, this indicates that the countries have the same ranking. Countries highlighted in bold are among the 10 worst performers under five or more indicators. 2 All other countries for which statistics are available have female/male enrollment ratios of 95% or higher. 3 Modern contraceptive use by married women is an international indicator under MDG 6/Target 7 (to halt and reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS). However, it is also an indicator of access to reproductive health services. As discussed in Section III.C of the paper, the UN Millennium Project has recommended adding universal access to reproductive health services as a target under MDG 5 (to improve maternal health), and several countries in the region have already established a separate goal or target on access to reproductive health services. At the 2005 World Summit, governments also included equal access to reproductive health in their commitments to gender equality and women's empowerment (see Appendix 2).

At a time when the South-East Asian countries are increasingly integrating into the global economy, this Report serves to refocus attention on the very tangible gains for human development that can be achieved through deeper economic integration and broader cooperation. An important issue addressed is the bridging of inequalities between countries of South-East Asia, focusing especially on the most disadvantaged among them. The countries covered in the Report are Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. The overarching message is that by jointly taking action on issues that transcend national boundaries, countries can maximise their development prospects and increase their capacities to alleviate poverty, promote regional peace and security, and achieve sustainable development. Cooperation that further integrates the region expands opportunities of participating countries, particularly those with less developed economies, to realise faster and more equitable economic growth and higher achievements of human development for South-East Asia. This project took shape at the initiative of the UNDP Country Office in the Philippines. UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report Unit (HDRU), based at the Regional Centre in Colombo (RCC), led in the completion of the work, which was managed in a three-way partnership among APRI, the UNDP-ASEAN Partnership Facility (APF), Jakarta, and the Philippines Country Office. We hope that the process of research, consultations and writing of the Report, involving numerous stakeholders from the subregion, has stimulated interest in the human development potential of regional economic integration and cooperation in South-East Asia. In so doing, the Report is expected to contribute to increased impetus in working toward a more closely intertwined South-East Asian community and a higher standard of human development for all in this highly diverse region of great potential.

There are a number of reasons why economic integration and broader regional cooperation merit serious attention by stakeholders in this subregion to further the well being of people in South-East Asia. \uf06c There is shared interest among the states to cooperate for regional peace and prosperity. The ASEAN Vision 2020 adopted by the ASEAN Heads of State and Government in Kuala Lumpur in 1997 envisions \u201ca socially cohesive and caring ASEAN where all will enjoy the opportunities for total human development and higher quality of life.\u201d \uf06c There is a shared goal of eliminating poverty and unemployment, and promoting human capital development. \uf06c Many countries share common boundaries, and developments in one country can have significant and immediate spill- over effects\u2014both positive and negative\u2014in others. \uf06c There are agreements such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the ASEAN Investment Area, and the joint Mekong River Development Programme which bind the countries towards a more integrated subregional economy. \uf06c There is common interest to establish the region as a prime destination for foreign direct investment. \uf06c There is knowledge to be shared among the countries in such areas as governance, human resource development, design of social development programmes and safety nets, and technology. \uf06c There are common challenges and threats facing the countries, such as transmission of HIV/AIDS, transnational crime including drug trafficking, human trafficking, piracy, labor migration, political instabilities including ethnic conflicts, financial market volatility, unanticipated impacts of globalization and transboundary pollution. \uf06c There is an active movement of people\u2019s organizations and civil society wishing to engage in more active dialogue with governments in the context of regional development challenges. The members of ASEAN believe it is important to reduce cross-country inequalities so that the whole of South-East Asia can compete on even footing with the rest of the world.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e06ec14e-e148-4afa-9544-e738823f3f12": {"__data__": {"id_": "e06ec14e-e148-4afa-9544-e738823f3f12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31aa582df3f76a15ddfcbf473ecc1b41497f938725a238a0399d87ef51118ad3"}, "2": {"node_id": "38a6f3e2-55de-4130-b2d8-08c00f5b29d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4396d65405e3b0eb70f80cd7647dd272ff8800f9aa63ddf02a5b992c4c1e1ff1"}}, "hash": "029b555f5eece30fb12204ec0b88fd43168d966f9ee4ec23248bbe64e48e4ff9", "text": "Any lag or bottleneck in one part of the region could drag the rest, and special attention, assistance, and cooperation from the others would be needed if the region\u2019s progress is to move at steady pace.

This expansion takes place through their improved capabilities, which enable them to use their full potential to lead lives that are of value to them. As the first global Human Development Report published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) put it, the real wealth of a nation is its people and the purpose of development is to create an enabling environment for people to enjoy long, healthy, productive and creative lives (UNDP, 1990). Viewed in this light, economic growth is essential but is not the goal in itself; instead, it is a means for achieving human development. Regional economic integration and regional cooperation can play an important role in promoting economic growth as well as human development. This Report explores how they can contribute towards deepening and broadening benefits for human development among people of South-East Asia. Regional economic integration is a process by which a group of nations brings down tariff and non-tariff barriers for the free flow of goods, services and factors of production among each other in an effort to increase efficiency and productivity, thus raising output and lowering costs. The resulting increase in economic activity, it is hoped, will lead to far-reaching benefits, lifting standards of living in the region. Regional cooperation provides a means for countries to address problems that transcend national boundaries together, to learn from each other, to help each other and to promote their collective well-being. A striking characteristic of South-East Asian countries is the wide disparities among them. The region contains one of the most populous countries in the world (Indonesia, population: 225.3 million) as well as one of the least (Brunei, population: 374,000). Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita averaged US$ 1,266 in South-East Asia but ranged between US$ 179 in Myanmar and US$ 20,987 in Singapore in 2003. Wide differences also exist on a number of development indicators between the countries with comparatively high levels of per capita income (Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand) and those at the lower end of the income scale (Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Viet Nam, referred to as CLMV, and Timor-Leste). Indeed, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar are among the Least Developed Countries1 (LDCs) of the world. The political systems in the subregion also differ greatly from one country to another, as do sociocultural characteristics. 1.1 EVOLUTION OF ASEAN AND SOUTH-EAST ASIA In spite of this diversity, however, there is a shared interest among South-East Asian countries in cooperating for peace and prosperity. The Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN) was formed at Bangkok on 8 August 1967 to bind members in friendship and cooperation and take up joint efforts for development and peace. The founding members were Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, known as the ASEAN-5. They were joined later by Brunei Darussalam (1984), Viet Nam (1995), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar (1997) and Cambodia (1999).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1265e9e9-ac6e-489b-aaeb-05c02545508c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1265e9e9-ac6e-489b-aaeb-05c02545508c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b8c6ca633aa7426fffc71aefba02ab666c2544219aa94cd1721661b883b2dce"}, "2": {"node_id": "74fac0a0-4576-4b16-81b3-ab6c9c0049d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e7493c9f088b5924fa99618e13fa5499113c518854ba88273e3a39982a617ee"}}, "hash": "30ae485a0385f5ab57c20d49eb750743835f4ce4552b5b2e44f546018b4a2322", "text": "The document that affirms the establishment of the grouping is the ASEAN Declaration of 1967, which states that the aims and purposes of the Association are: \uf06c To accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region through joint endeavours in the spirit of equality and partnership in order to strengthen the foundation for a prosperous and peaceful community of South-East Asian nations. \uf06c To promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries in the region and the adherence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "69031c22-999e-480a-b555-050a496f3093": {"__data__": {"id_": "69031c22-999e-480a-b555-050a496f3093", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c291e665aea89a26e19622dd131a7598e78ead9832367b5c5764a7965a351cb4"}, "3": {"node_id": "e41dddb9-cd20-403b-bcf3-cd7254befebc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b721284fccdac71f2dd5604b53a8a697f8cc54a77a952f4c22a9e2cbe5171cf"}}, "hash": "7d4c7c0fda3bf0994c99f67ffcc827e2a90481563e3a5d41f8d5b27d47cd45d0", "text": "to the principles of the United Nations Charter. 1. INTRODUCTION 1 In the triennial review conducted in 2003 to determine countries to be added to or graduated from the list of LDCs, the Committee for Development Policy (CDP) based its identification of these countries on the three dimensions of a country\u2019s state of development, namely, (i) its income level; (ii) its stock of human assets; and (iii) economic vulnerability. GNI per-capita was used as an indicator of income, the Human Assets Index (HAI) as an indicator of the stock of human assets and the Economic Vulnerability Index (EVI) as an indicator of economic susceptibility. Thresholds for inclusion in the list of LDCs are population less than 75 million; per-capita GNI less than US$ 750; HAI less than 55; and EVI greater than 37. A country must meet all the criteria. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 9 \uf06c To promote active collaboration and mutual assistance on matters of common interest in the economic, social, cultural, technical, scientific and administrative fields. \uf06c To provide assistance to each other in the form of training and research facilities in the educational, professional, technical and administrative spheres. \uf06c To collaborate more effectively for the greater utilization of their agriculture and industries, the expansion of their trade, including the study of the problems of international commodity trade, the improvement of their transportation and communication facilities and the raising of the living standards of their people. \uf06c To promote South-East Asian studies. \uf06c To maintain close and beneficial cooperation with existing international and regional organizations with similar aims and purposes, and explore all avenues for even closer cooperation among themselves (ASEAN, 1967). ASEAN has made a significant contribution to the development of the region following principles of consensus decision- making, non-interference in the domestic affairs of member countries and paying attention to the specific needs of member countries. For the first 10 years of its existence, it remained principally a political organization, focusing on resolving conflicts in the region. Economic and social cooperation was initially not a priority and trade among members was insignificant. Between 1967 and the early 1970s, the share of intra-ASEAN trade in the total trade of member countries was between 12 and 15 per cent. Some of the earliest economic cooperation schemes of ASEAN were aimed at addressing this situation and a number of industrial cooperation initiatives enabled members to increase capacity and specialize in some products. After the Bali Summit of 1976, ASEAN\u2019s focus widened to include economic and social cooperation. The Preferential Trading Arrangement of 1977 accorded tariff preferences for trade among ASEAN nations and this was deepened 10 years later. In 1992, a Framework Agreement on Enhancing Economic Cooperation was adopted, which included a scheme for the creation of an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) aimed at increasing the region\u2019s competitive advantage as a single production unit. The ASEAN region has a population of about 500 million, with a combined GDP of US$ 737 billion and total trade of US$ 720 billion in 2002. AFTA came into effect in 2002 and intra-ASEAN trade, which has been rising steadily since 1993, now accounts for nearly 30 per cent of the region\u2019s total trade. In accordance with their desire to build a community of caring societies, in 1995 ASEAN leaders resolved to deepen functional cooperation in order to bring shared prosperity to all members. The Framework for Elevating Functional Cooperation to a Higher Plane was adopted in 1996 with a focus on human development, technological competitiveness, and social cohesiveness.

Four areas have been singled out for priority attention, namely infrastructure including energy, human resources development, information and communications technology (ICT), and capacity-building for regional economic integration. Starting in January 2002, preferential tariffs are also offered to newer members by older members on a voluntary and bilateral basis. In addition to trade and investment liberalization, economic cooperation is being pursued in the region through the development of a trans-ASEAN transport network. Member countries are also building energy networks, consisting of the ASEAN power grid and the trans-ASEAN gas pipeline. ASEAN is promoting the interoperability and interconnectivity of national telecommunications equipment and services and cooperating in ICT through the e-ASEAN Initiative (1999), the e-ASEAN Framework Agreement (2000) and the Manila Declaration (2002). 1.2 OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE OF THE REPORT The principal objective of the Report is to explore the role regional economic integration and regional cooperation can play in enhancing human development and spreading its benefits more widely among the people of the region. Despite their diversity, common interests and the will to be together bind the countries of South-East Asia. The region\u2019s strong identity is expressed through ASEAN and this Report can provide baselines and benchmarks for assessing progress on ASEAN Vision 2020 and related actions and plans. Following the introduction, the status and trends of human development in South-East Asia, along with an assessment of progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the region, are set out and major issues and concerns identified. A conceptual framework explaining the factors that determine the status of human development in a country and illustrating the role regional economic integration and regional cooperation can play in enhancing the benefits of human development follows. Empirical evidence of the impact of regional economic integration on human development is presented in the fourth section and the major issues involved are identified, while the fifth section discusses empirical evidence of regional cooperation in South-East Asia and assesses its impact in terms of human development. A concluding section also presents recommendations for leveraging the gains from regional integration and cooperation into far-reaching human development benefits for the citizens of the region, particularly the relatively less well off. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 11 2.1 MEASURING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The UNDP has developed several indices to measure the level of human development in a country. The most popularly used is the human development index (HDI), which is a composite index measuring average achievements in a country in three basic dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, as measured by life expectancy at birth; knowledge, as measured by the adult literacy rate and the combined gross enrolment ratio for primary, secondary and tertiary schools; and a decent standard of living, as measured by GDP per capita in purchasing power parity (PPP) United States dollars. Each component is scored on a scale of 0 to 1 and the HDI is a simple average of the individual component scores. In 2003, the values of the HDI ranged from 0.281 for Niger to 0.963 for Norway (UNDP, 2005). Other indices of human development are the gender-related development index (GDI) and the human poverty index for developing countries (HPI-1). The GDI is similar to the HDI but, in addition, introduces a \u2018penalty\u2019 for male-female gaps, taking into account gender inequalities in life expectancy, educational attainment and standard of living. HPI-1, in contrast to the HDI, focuses on deprivations in the three basic dimensions of human development: vulnerability to death at a relatively early age, as indicated by the probability at birth of not surviving to the age of 40; exclusion from the world of learning, as indicated by the adult illiteracy rate; and lack of access to economic provisioning, as indicated by the percentage of the population without sustainable access to an improved water source, as well as the percentage of children underweight for age2. 2.2 PRESENT STATUS OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA South-East Asia stands out for the disparities observed between countries in the region in human development achievements.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0558f12-b679-4ad7-98e5-8bdd710aa6ee": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0558f12-b679-4ad7-98e5-8bdd710aa6ee", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc7d36dd727199a90e5805d0ddec1e9bc57daa2397453be5af106a66941d83d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "097abef6-5f66-4ddc-b1c8-bf53abfb8352", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f6281badab3d45b4bf17be64b62cf3ec27158fde18db1c94b84f3a1b03de6df9"}}, "hash": "90365292858133794a3f5e0cf7ab5cb87e65700e01e209970914e7735c51b49d", "text": "The HDI in 2003 ranged from 0.907 in Singapore, which ranked 25th out of 177 countries, to 0.513 in Timor-Leste, which ranked 140th (Tables 1 and 2).

Life expectancy, educational achievement and standards of living in those countries were close to levels in Japan and Republic of Korea, in East Asia, as well as to some developed countries in the European Union (EU). All the other countries were in the \u201cmedium human development\u201d category. It is noteworthy that no country is in the \u2018Low human development\u2019 category. At the top end of the category, Malaysia, Philippines and Thailand, with an average HDI of 0.777, were relatively close to each other in terms of life expectancy and educational attainment but with greater variation in terms of standards of living. Indonesia and Viet Nam, whose HDI index averaged 0.700, were in the middle, with values for the components of the index somewhat below the former group but comparable to each other. Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and Timor-Leste, in contrast, were in the lower end of the category and were clearly lagging in terms of human development. The average HDI in this group was only 0.551, with Timor-Leste falling furthest behind. Standards of living were also particularly low in Myanmar and Timor-Leste. Table 2.

Although strictly comparisons of HDI rankings over time may not be the best way to capture trends (as the number of countries change from year to year, methods and sources also vary to an extent), one can make some broad observations regarding the relative positions of the different countries based on the HDI rankings.

Source: Human Development Report, 1991-2004. A comparison of economic growth and human development achievements in South-East Asia with those in other regions such as East Asia and Europe shows that South-East Asia has much lower average per capita income and more disparate human development achievements than the others. Thus, the problem for the region is not only the low average level of human development but also the wide disparities across countries, which have not been narrowed during the last decade. The challenge before South-East Asia therefore is to raise the level of human development, particularly in lagging countries, thereby reversing the lack of convergence in the region. To what extend can regional economic integration as well as regional cooperation be expected to help? The Report explores this issue. 14 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation 2.4 ASSESSING HUMAN DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS In September 2000 at the Millennium Summit, the Member States of the United Nations issued the Millennium Declaration, committing themselves to a series of targets, most of which were to be achieved by 2015. Known as the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), they represent a framework for monitoring important globally-agreed development goals. There are eight MDGs (Table 3), each with specific targets to be measured by various indicators. The goals include targets for poverty reduction, gender equality, environmental sustainability, educational attainment, as well as health improvements (UNDP, 2003b). In the context of South-East Asia, the MDGs and ASEAN Vision 2020 can be thought of as complementary. The MDGs are geared towards the reduction of human poverty by 2015. ASEAN Vision 2020 is more focused on econo\u00acmic cooperation as means to attain sustainable development in the region but progress on the goals implies progress in attaining the Vision. Table 4. The Millennium Development Goals Goal 1 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Goal 2 Achieve universal primary education Goal 3 Promote gender equality and empower women Goal 4 Reduce child mortality Goal 5 Improve maternal health Goal 6 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases Goal 7 Ensure environmental sustainability Goal 8 Develop a global partnership for development Goal 1 \u2013 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Using the international poverty line definition of US$1 a day, the first target under Goal 1 is to halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people whose income is less than US$1 a day. Indicators used to assess progress in meeting this target are the proportion of the population below US$1 per day at 1993 PPP; the poverty gap ratio; and the share of the poorest quintile in national consumption. As noted earlier, South-East Asia is a region with wide disparities in the incidence of poverty. While poverty is negligible in Singapore, it is substantial in Timor-Leste, where the percentage of the population living in poverty was over 40 per cent in 2001.

The situation is only somewhat better in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar, where 29 per cent and 22.9 per cent of the population respectively falls below the poverty line. Poverty incidence in Indonesia also continues to be in double-digits at 18.2 per cent in 2002. The incidence of poverty has been declining in most South-East Asian countries over the course of the last several years. Malaysia has been one of the developing countries in Asia that has undertaken an impressive and successful poverty reduction programme. The country\u2019s incidence of poverty has declined drastically since 1970, when 49.3 per cent of the population was officially poor, to 20.7 per cent in 1985. By 1995, the figure had fallen to 8.7 per cent and further to 5.1 per cent by 2002. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, the Philippines, Cambodia, and Viet Nam are some of the other developing countries in South-East Asia to demonstrate a declining trend in poverty incidence in the last decade. During the Asian financial crisis many countries suffered a setback to their poverty reduction efforts. For example, in Indonesia, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line rose from 15.1 per cent in 1990 to 23.4 in 1999 before beginning to fall. However, Thailand has shown remarkable progress by achieving the poverty reduction target of halving the incidence of poverty early, as the percentage has fallen from 27.2 per cent in 1990 to 9.8 per cent in 2002. Unfortunately, poverty incidence has risen in Timor- Leste from 37 per cent of the population in 1993 to 41 per cent in 2001. Within individual countries in the region, rural-urban disparities in poverty incidence continue to be wide. For example, farmers in rural areas with low levels of education and limited access to resources constitute about 90 per cent of the poor in Viet Nam. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 15 In Indonesia, disparities between regions, provinces, districts, and cities in the incidence of poverty are striking. The situation in the Philippines is similar, with the highest incidence of poverty occurring in Mindanao, where 66 per cent of the population falls below the poverty line, and the lowest in Metro Manila, where 8.7 per cent of the population is poor. The rate of poverty reduction also tends to be faster in urban as compared with rural areas. This was true in Cambodia, for example, and in Viet Nam, where poverty incidence decreased by two thirds between 1993 and 1998 in urban areas but by less than one third in rural areas. The second target under Goal 1 is to halve, between 1990 and 2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. One of the indicators for this target relates to the percentage of underweight children under five years of age. Malnutrition among children below the age of five is still very high in most countries of South-East Asia, with the exception of Singapore and Brunei Darussalam, despite declining in recent years. In addition, there are large intraregional and intracountry differences in the incidence of child malnutrition. In Cambodia, 45 per cent of children below the age of five was underweight in 2000 and 44.6 per cent had stunted growth. Thailand is the only country in the region to have attained the target the percentage of underweight children having fallen from 18.6 per cent in 1990 to 8.6 per cent in 2002, better than the 9.3 per cent target to be attained by 2015. Goal 2 \u2013 Achieve universal primary education The target under Goal 2 is to ensure that by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and the principal indicator for assessing progress in meeting the target is the net enrolment ratio in primary education. South-East Asian countries have made basic education more accessible during the last decade. Although the HDI ranks of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam are very low, those countries have nevertheless made remarkable progress in increasing access to basic education. For example, the net primary school enrolment ratio in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic increased from 61.4 per cent in 1990 to 81.4 per cent in 2001, while in Viet Nam, it rose from 90.5 to 94 per cent in the same period. The net primary school enrolment ratio was 86.2 per cent in 2001 in Cambodia.

In the case of Indonesia and the Philippines, the net enrolment ratio has declined in recent years, owing mainly to the Asian financial crisis. In both countries, the ratio had fallen from 97.5 per cent in 1990 to 92.1 per cent in Indonesia and 93 per cent in the Philippines by 2001. The situation in Myanmar is particularly disturbing as the net primary school enrolment ratio actually declined from 99.5 per cent in 1990, indicating almost universal access, to a dismal 74.2 per cent in 2001. Again, intra-country disparities stand out in South-East Asia, where rural-urban differences in access to primary education are compounded by gender-based differences. There are also problems of access to education for vulnerable groups, such as children of seafarers, homeless children, migrant and stateless children, and children with HIV/AIDS. Goal 3 \u2013 Promote gender equality and empower women The target under Goal 3 is to eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and at all levels of education no later than 2015. The principal indicator used for assessing progress in meeting the goal is the ratio of girls to boys at each level of education. South-East Asian countries made significant progress in narrowing the gender gap in the access to education over the last decade. Progress has been particularly noticeable in CLMV countries, where the ratio of girls to boys in primary, secondary and tertiary education increased significantly between 1990 and 2001. Thailand is the only country in South-East Asia where the ratio of girls to boys in primary and secondary education decreased from 0.98 in 1990 to 0.95 in 2001. In tertiary education, the ratio declined from 1.18 in 1990 to 0.82 in 2000. In Viet Nam, there is no gender difference in primary education enrolment but it shows up in the secondary age group. In the Philippines, however, the gender difference in enrolment ratios favours girls at the secondary and tertiary levels of education while at the primary level the relative enrolment ratio was 0.99 in 2001. 16 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation Other indicators for assessing progress on goal 3 relate to female versus male literacy rates, as well as to the share of women in wage employment in the non-agricultural sector and to the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. On the participation of women in the labour force, there are still more men than women engaged in wage labour in the region. The MDG reports broadly indicate trends for the period between the late 1990s and early years of the first decade of the 21st century. These reports indicate that the share of women in the non-agricultural labour force has increased in almost all countries even though the share dropped in the immediate aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in some countries. In terms of political participation, there have been improvements in some countries of the region and setbacks in others. Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, where 25 per cent of the delegates in the National Assembly are female, have all made progress. In contrast, the share of seats held by women in national parliaments decreased in Indonesia and Thailand. Bureaucracies in public administration in the Philippines and Thailand are primarily staffed by women, but more men than women are appointed to managerial and executive positions. Goal 4 \u2013 Reduce child mortality The target under Goal 4 is to reduce by two thirds, between 1990 and 2015, the under-five mortality rate. The indicators for assessing progress in attaining the goal are the under-five mortality rate, the infant mortality rate and the proportion of 1-year- old children immunized against measles. Cambodia, Myanmar, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Timor-Leste are lagging far behind in achieving Goal 4. In 2001, the mortality rate for infants under one year of age was 95 per 1,000 live births in Cambodia, 90 in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 85 in Timor-Leste and 48 in Myanmar, while the under-five mortality rate was 135, 105, 144 and 110 in those countries respectively. In contrast, the infant mortality rate was less than 10 in Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia, and between 20 and 35 in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. Both the infant mortality rate and under-five mortality rate declined in most countries in the 1990s but progress is still not satisfactory. In Cambodia, the infant mortality rate actually increased in the 1990s.

The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel is another indicator used to assess the state of maternal health. Very high rates of maternal mortality in many of the poorer countries of South-East Asia testify to generally deficient conditions for maternal health. Those conditions are even worse in rural areas, so that overall maternal mortality rates disguise rural-urban differences in many countries. In Cambodia, the average maternal mortality rate was 437 per 100,000 live births in 1994-2000, while in Myanmar, according to the 2005 MDG report, it was 178 per 100,000 live births in urban areas and 281 per 100,000 live births in rural areas in the year 1999. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic has made some progress in this area as the maternal mortality rate declined from 750 in 1990 to 650 in 2001 and the percentage of births attended by skilled health workers increased from 14 per cent in 1990 to 19.4 per cent in 2001. The maternal mortality rate was lower in Indonesia and the Philippines, at 307 during 1998 to 2002 in Indonesia (MDG Report, Indonesia, 2004) and at 172 in the Philippines in 1998 (MDG Report, Philippines 2004). Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have very low maternal mortality rates below 100. Wide intra-regional differences in maternal health in South-East Asia are evident in this comparison. Goal 6 \u2013 Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases There are two targets under Goal 6, first, to have halted by 2015 and begun to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS and, second, by the same date, to have halted and begun to reverse the incidence of malaria and other diseases. Indicators under the first target relate to HIV prevalence rates among young people, condom use and the number of children orphaned by the disease. South-East Asian countries can be divided into groups according to their experience with HIV/AIDS. Cambodia, Myanmar and Thailand are countries where the epidemic hit early. Indonesia and Viet Nam are now starting to experience the epidemic and need to mount swift, effective responses. In contrast, the Philippines, Timor-Leste and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic still have extremely low levels of HIV prevalence, even among high-risk groups. In Indonesia, and Viet Nam, the recent rise in HIV infection among drug-injectors appears to have spurred a subsequent rise among non-injectors with sexually risky behaviour. A recent survey conducted in three cities in Indonesia found that 88 per cent of drug-injectors had used non-sterile needles or South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 17 syringes in the preceding week, yet fewer than one third said they felt at high risk of HIV infection (Pisani et al., 2003). When injecting drug users were tested for HIV, very high rates of infection were found. One in two injecting drug users in Indonesia\u2019s capital, Jakarta, now tests positive for HIV, while in far-flung cities such as Pontianak (in West Kalimantan province on the island of Borneo) more than 70 per cent of drug-injectors who request HIV tests have discovered that they are HIV-positive (MAP, 2004). Injecting drug use by sex workers makes Viet Nam\u2019s epidemic particularly explosive. There is a steep rise in HIV prevalence detected in some Vietnamese cities, where the virus now appears to be spreading freely among at-risk groups. In some parts of Myanmar, HIV has acquired a strong foothold among people who have been exposed to a high risk of infection for several years. The situation varies across the country, but HIV has already become entrenched in lower-risk populations in several parts of Myanmar. Cambodia and Thailand have introduced large-scale prevention programmes to address the sexual transmission of HIV and have seen significant reductions in risky behaviour. New cases of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections have been on a declining trend. Thailand has also shown that a pragmatic response that is well funded and politically supported can change the course of the epidemic. National adult HIV prevalence continues to edge lower, with the latest estimates putting it at around 1.5 per cent at the end of 2003. Recharged commitment and revised strategies are now needed, however, to confront an epidemic that has entered a new phase. Timor-Leste could be poised for an HIV outbreak as nearly 6 out of 10 sex workers in the country had never heard of AIDS, 4 out of 10 did not recognize a condom when shown one and none consistently used a condom with clients (Pisani and Dili STI survey team, 2004).

South-East Asian countries are rich in biodiversity but all are producers of timber, with the exception of Singapore. The timber export boom, which began in the 1960s, has resulted in an alarming rate of deforestation in those countries. Commercial logging, as well as illegal logging, slash-and-burn agriculture and collection of wood for fuel are all responsible for deforestation. Though the MDG has resulted in some positive changes, forest cover has declined in most countries. In Malaysia and Indonesia, the percentage area under forest declined from about 65 per cent in 1990 to 58 per cent in 2000, while in Cambodia it declined from 56.1 per cent in 1990 to 52.9 per cent in 2001. Other countries have also experienced significant declines in forest area and forest quality has deteriorated in most countries in the last decade. In recent years, however, some progress has been made in forest areas under protection. For example, in Indonesia the ratio of protected areas to the total forest area has increased from 0.1 per cent in 1990 to 18.5 per cent in 2000. Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Myanmar also show some positive changes. Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Timor-Leste are the only three countries in South-East Asia that are far behind in achieving the target of providing sustainable access to safe drinking water to their populations. The percentage of the population with access to safe drinking water in the year 2000 was 54 and 26 per cent in urban and rural areas respectively in Cambodia; 61 and 21 per cent in urban and rural area respectively in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and 18.6 per cent in Timor-Leste. In contrast, Indonesia, Viet Nam and Myanmar have achieved significant progress in providing safe drinking water to a majority of their populations. The proportion of the population with access to safe drinking water increased from 56 per cent in 1990 to 78 per cent in 2001 in Indonesia, while, in the same period, the increase in Viet Nam was from 55 to 77 per cent and in Myanmar from 32 to 72 per cent. Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic also lag other countries in providing sustainable access to basic sanitation. Around 17 per cent of the population in Cambodia and 30 per cent in Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic have access to improved sanitation, while the comparable figure in Singapore is 100 per cent and in Thailand it is 96 per cent. In Philippines, 83 per cent of the population has access to improved sanitation but the figure is only 55 per cent in Indonesia. 18 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation The overall status of the countries of South-East Asia with respect to the MDGs is summarized in Table 5. The table indicates that many countries have made good progress on the second and third MDGs, relating to universal primary education and gender equality and empowerment. Those MDGs have either been achieved or the countries are on track to do so. The first MDG, on eradicating poverty, has not been met in the Philippines and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, while the fourth MDG on reducing child mortality is still distant for the CLMV countries; in fact, Cambodia is slipping behind on child mortality. The seventh MDG, on environmental sustainability, also poses a problem for CLMV countries, as well as the Philippines. In summary, there are some major areas of concern with respect to human development in South-East Asia. First, achievements are low in many countries and, in some cases, long-term trends are also negative. Wide disparities exist between countries in levels of human development, with little or no convergence between countries in the long run. In order to promote human development in the region, there is a clear need to address those concerns. Table 5.

South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 19 People want many things in life other than income, such as better health, education, a better environment and more freedom. The goal of development is to provide those choices to human beings. Human development has five aspects, namely empowerment, cooperation, equity, sustainability and security. Empowerment implies the acquisition of capabilities that make free choice possible, as well as participation in decision-making and allows people to become active agents in their own development. Cooperation is a sense of belonging, which is an important source of well-being. Human development is concerned not just with people as individuals but also with how they interact and cooperate in communities. Equity in human development means seeking equity in basic capabilities and opportunities; each individual should have an equal access to development opportunities in life. Sustainability implies not only environmental sustainability, but also sustainability of people\u2019s opportunities to freely exercise their basic capabilities. Security implies economic security, food security, health security, personal security, political security and cultural security. As can be seen, human development is a holistic concept that ensures the overall development of human beings and society. It has emerged not only as a measure or goal of development but has also evolved to become a model or a human-centered development paradigm. 3.1 WHAT DETERMINES HUMAN DEVELOPMENT? Conceptually speaking, the level of human development in any society is determined by three sets of factors: the macroeconomic environment; social policy, particularly in sectors related to human development, such as education, health and nutrition; and the microenvironment that governs the empowerment of people and community participation. An enabling macroeconomic environment There is no comprehensive theory of human development available in the literature at present. However, considerable work has been done to understand the two-way relationship between a favourable macroeconomic environment and human development. There is basic agreement that if human development is the goal, economic growth is a means to achieve it, as it would be difficult to promote human development without promoting economic growth. However, economic growth, while necessary, is not a sufficient condition for human development. The links between economic growth and human development need to be identified and forged through appropriate interventions, so that one leads to the other. Failure to do this means that economic growth is likely to be jobless, in not generating enough employment; voiceless, in the sense of being regressive and non-participatory; ruthless, in widening disparities between people and regions; rootless, in demolishing local sociocultural diversity; or futureless, in being non-sustainable (UNDP, 1996). In order for economic growth to promote human development, it should have certain basic characteristics. Economic growth should provide productive and well-paid work to those who seek it and it should improve people\u2019s access to productive assets, such as land, as well as physical infrastructure and financial credit so as to increase economic opportunities. Growth should be equitable in providing economic opportunities to all, men and women alike, including in different regions as well as from different socio-economic groups. Finally, it should be environmentally friendly and sustainable. It should be noted that human development also promotes economic growth. It promotes worker productivity and skills, while making economic growth participatory and labour-intensive. It tends to make economic growth broad-based and sustainable and it enables countries to access global opportunities to increase economic growth. In short, economic growth and human development are complementary and promoting one without the other is likely to lead to non-sustainable development. People can access better opportunities in life only in an environment where economic growth facilitates improvements in human development and a policy framework that builds close linkages between the two is called for.

While institutional weaknesses were not necessarily the cause of the financial crisis, the lack of Government accountability and transparency, corruption, highly-centralized control and poor policy coordination exacerbated the crisis. Governance is basically defined as the exercise of economic, political, and administrative powers in managing the state\u2019s resource endowment. This is done through institutionalized processes and mechanisms in which civil society groups and individuals articulate their interests, exercise their rights, perform their obligations and mediate their differences (UNDP, 1998 and Shah, 1994). Good governance has five components: transparency, which refers to the guaranteed free flow of information, and where institutions and processes are directly accessible to those concerned with them; accountability, which refers to the responsibility of decision-makers in Government, the private sector and civil society to the public and to institutional stakeholders; the rule of law, which refers to the fair and impartial enforcement of rules and legal frameworks; efficient and effective governance, which refers to the ability of institutions and processes to produce outcomes that meet society\u2019s needs while making the best use of resources; and a participatory process, which refers to mediating differences and reaching a broad consensus on political, economic and social priorities (UNDP, 1998). Good governance and regional integration and cooperation are mutually reinforcing. Good governance is important for narrowing the gap between countries and in promoting human development in the region. Good governance, particularly in the areas of transparency and accountability, serves as an important indicator of a state\u2019s commitment to international and regional agreements, norms, and standards. Good governance is also a requisite for successful regional cooperation and integration, as economic growth is dependent on competent institutions that accompany free trade and secure the efficient functioning of societies as a whole (Langenhove, 2003). Those institutions establish strong property rights and political stability, which are necessary conditions for encouraging private investment and fostering economic growth (Haggard, 2004b). Ineffective governance at home could militate against regional cooperation and integration3. Social policy in human development sectors The second important factor that determines the level of human development is social policy, including policies in sectors such as health and nutrition, literacy and education, labour protection and welfare, and the well-being of people in general. Social policy has two major components. The first consists of insurance against major risks that are present during one\u2019s lifetime, such as unemployment, sickness and disability, and old age. Social security or social protection against major risks is important under globalization, which tends to increase uncertainties in the competitive market environment. The second aspect of social policy is the provision of social services, which constitute investments in basic human capital, such as the provision of primary and secondary education and basic health care. The public sector is an important part of any strategy for achieving higher levels of human development. The proportion of a country\u2019s public expenditure going to social sectors indicates their importance to the State and the State\u2019s commitment to those sectors, a commitment that is very important when countries are spending an increasing proportion of their incomes on debt servicing and defence. To help in planning and monitoring public spending on human development, four expenditure ratios have been suggested (UNDP, 1991). These ratios are the public expenditure ratio (PER), which is the percentage of national income going in to public expenditure, the social allocation ratio (SAR), which is the percentage of public expenditure earmarked for social services, the social priority ratio (SPR), which is the percentage of social expenditure devoted to human priority concerns, such as elementary education, preventive health care and nutrition, and the human expenditure ratio (HER), which is the percentage of national income devoted to human priority concerns and is the product of the previous three. Based on cross-sectional empirical evidence, norms have been suggested for those ratios. For a country to do well on human 3 As Ninawolo (2003) observed, several factors have constrained regional integration in Africa. They include a lack of political will to establish effective and dynamic trans-national institutions and to implement agreed upon treaties and protocols; the lack of sanctions against non-performance; a heavy reliance on tariffs for fiscal revenues; inadequate mechanisms for equitable sharing of costs and benefits of integration; non-observance of the rule of law and good governance code; poor private sector and civil society participation; and overlapping memberships where members are unable to manage effectively nor fund adequately the many regional integration arrangements to which they belong.

That percentage could be achieved if PER is around 25 per cent, SAR around 40 per cent and SPR over 50 per cent (UNDP, 1991). It is important to ensure that all ASEAN countries adhere to those norms so that the funding and efforts directed towards human development are adequate. Finally, it should be pointed out that apart from the Government, there are two other major stakeholders in the social sector. They are the machinery of administration that implements social sector policies and programmes and the beneficiaries of social services. A social policy that aims at improving the performance of all stakeholders could reap benefits for social sector interventions. The right kind of social policy ensures that the Government is committed to social development as indicated, for example, by the expenditure ratios outlined above, the administrative machinery is adequate, motivated and trained, and beneficiaries are involved with the planning and implementation of social sector programmes (World Bank, 2004). A favourable microenvironment People and the communities in which they live are the ultimate beneficiaries of human development. A favourable microenvironment fosters a higher level of human development as it calls for the decentralization of decision-making in administration and the setting-up of enabling institutions, on the one hand, and the empowerment of communities and their active participation in the planning and implementation of human development policies and programmes, on the other. Decentralized decision-making and decentralized administrative structures create a space for communities and civil society organizations to manage social services. That space also enables them to organize and empower people around human development activities, ensuring effective delivery of services so that local needs are satisfied. Civil society organizations play multiple roles in improving human development. They develop new, innovative approaches and models for effective service delivery and organize communities to empower them to demand the right kind of services. They can make Government machinery accountable to people. Civil society organizations can also network with each other and lead campaigns and movements on critical human development issues such as drugs, violence, disasters and diseases. Lastly, civil society organizations can protect the interests of people against any negative impacts of regional integration policies, should they occur, such as deteriorating labour standards, environmental degradation and loss of livelihood. 3.2 REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Regional economic integration and regional cooperation can contribute significantly towards strengthening the three factors discussed earlier that promote human development. Regional economic integration is both a process and a state of affairs. The former implies a dynamic sequence of events, the outcome of which cannot be fully captured by static models, while the latter can be viewed as a means of developing deep and stable relations of labour specialization and division among national economies. Regional economic integration generally proceeds in a hierarchical fashion. The most basic form is a free trade area, such as AFTA, which involves the elimination of tariffs and quotas on most goods. This is followed by a customs union, in which members of a free trade area also adopt a common external tariff. A common market is the next step and involves creating a single market, with common policies on product regulation and the free movement of goods, services and factors of production. The adoption of a common currency by members of a common market creates an economic union, of which the EU is the only example. Harmonization of all economic policies, accompanied by the creation of a supranational state, leads to the last step of full economic and political union. In order to benefit from regional integration, several conditions have to be satisfied. Those conditions are political commitment of all countries, including rich countries, to higher forms of integration; mutual economic dependence; narrow economic gaps or disparities between countries of the region; similarities at the policy level, particularly in social and human development policies; and, finally, good governance and institutions in order to maximize the benefits of economic integration. Regional economic integration generally leads to trade liberalization, greater foreign direct investment (FDI), financial and capital account liberalization, and migration of labour. Each can have positive, as well as negative, impacts on human development, depending on how policies are designed and implemented. Whether appropriate action is taken to mitigate the negative 22 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation impacts is also an important consideration. Regional economic integration brings many of the benefits of multilateralism but on a smaller scale. It provides access to larger markets for producers, leading to specialization based on the comparative advantage of countries.

However, regional integration can have some drawbacks. If preferential treatment diverts more trade than it creates, it may lead to a decrease in welfare. To trace the transmission mechanism from regional integration to human development, a top-down approach can be applied. The impact of regional economic integration can be measured either from the perspective of a single country (Fukase and Martin, 2001) or using a multi-country framework (Imada et al., 1991). Whatever the perspective adopted, impact studies of regional economic integration can be classified into two categories: studies that deal with the impact of regional economic integration on specific sectors; and studies that adopt a general equilibrium approach. Sectoral effects can be transmitted via trade channels or financial and investment channels and studies of this type abound in the literature (for example, Austria, 1994 and De Dios, 1994). Some studies have more direct implications for human development especially if part of the analysis addresses effects on employment (Orbeta, 2002) or else the study analyzes the impact on a social issue, such as gender (Fontana and Wood, 2000). Whatever the level of analysis, the dimension of human development can be incorporated by adopting an appropriate framework or model. A framework that appears to be quite useful in this context is contained in the World Bank\u2019s Poverty Reduction Source Book (Hoekman et al., 2000), which traces the linkages between trade reform and the level of poverty. Another set of studies has been conducted under the Microeconomic Impact of Macroeconomic Adjustment Policies (MIMAP) programme supported by the International Development Research Centre in Canada. In this approach, vulnerable groups or sectors that are likely to be adversely affected by trade reforms, or the \u201closers\u201d, as well as groups likely to benefit, or the \u201cwinners\u201d, can readily be identified. This is an important consideration when designing safety nets and other measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of regional integration. The second major category of studies looks at the impact of regional economic integration in a general equilibrium framework (Bourguignon et al., 1991). As in the sectoral studies, the effects work their way through both trade and financial and investment channels. Attention is usually given to the impact of regional economic integration on output growth and resource allocation. This is quite relevant for human development since economic growth is acknowledged to be a necessary condition for poverty alleviation (Hoekman et al. 2000). General equilibrium studies can also be used to pinpoint vulnerable groups, the nature and detail of which depends on the specifications of households in the particular model used. As in the partial equilibrium studies, the dimension of human development can be incorporated in the analysis by using an appropriate framework or model such as MIMAP. 3.3 REGIONAL COOPERATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Regional cooperation is essentially a means for countries to address common problems. Regional cooperation furthers human development by facilitating regional economic integration, by helping countries reap maximum benefits from it, and by promoting policies and outcomes that further progress towards the MDGs and human development through cooperation directed specifically to that end. Regional cooperation aids the process of regional integration in three general ways. First, there are forms of regional cooperation that are intrinsic to the process of regional integration, such as agreements to bring down barriers to trade and the free flow of factors of production. Those forms will not be discussed separately in this Report. Second, regional cooperation on social issues has a direct impact on human development and can hasten the convergence process by helping countries attain the critical threshold of development necessary for regional integration to succeed. That form of regional cooperation will be discussed in the next chapter. Finally, regional cooperation, mainly in the monetary and financial spheres, can provide an enabling environment to help mitigate the potentially adverse impacts of regional integration at the macroeconomic level. The justification for that type of regional cooperation can be sought in phenomena that were highlighted during the 1997 crisis (Montiel, 2003). Spillovers from exchange rate policies present a case for exchange rate coordination, while inadequate supplies of international liquidity and common structural weaknesses in the financial sector and in corporate governance can South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 23 be addressed more effectively by cross-country cooperation in the reform process. Information coordination and surveillance, resource coordination or reserve pooling, and exchange rate coordination are forms of regional cooperation that fall in this category.

Regional functional cooperation can help directly in the promotion of human development. It can address common problems that cut across national boundaries, such as drug trafficking, migration, trafficking of women and children, the spread of trans-boundary diseases of people and animals and so on. It can also promote human development interventions that impact several countries, for example, the promotion of higher education through the creation of an ASEAN University Network or the creation of a tsunami early-warning system. It can also help domestic policy-making by promoting best practices and information sharing. Regional cooperation among civil society organizations including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can play an important role in initiating campaigns and movements for social causes and human development in the region. Regional cooperation and integration could help countries promote good governance at home. Theoretically, any initiative for regional integration must prove its worth by taking into account several issues. It should provide an enabling environment for private sector development and strengthen trade integration. It should develop infrastructure programmes in support of economic growth and strengthen the region\u2019s interaction with the world. It should build regional environmental programmes and contribute to peace and security. It should reduce social exclusion and foster an inclusive civil society and so help to develop strong public sector institutions and good governance (Langenhove, 2003). States should view those issues as challenges, rather than constraints, in building and enhancing their governance capabilities, particularly if they are committed to greater regional cooperation and integration. Economic convergence among countries of a region depends to some extent on political convergence and harmonization of standards for effective governance. The present form of ASEAN economic integration is, however, still in the initial stages, as it is limited to a free trade area, AFTA, which was created in order to counter the perceived diversion of foreign investment to other sites, particularly to China, a key concern in ASEAN since the 1990s. The primary aim of proponents of ASEAN economic cooperation so far has been to further the integration of member economies into regional and global investment and production networks, which are regarded as the principal means for enhancing human development. 24 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation This chapter presents empirical analysis on the impact of regional economic integration on human development in South- East Asia. Following an examination of the configuration of integration in the region, the conclusion is drawn that regional integration in South-East Asia at present is merely an adjunct to the process of global integration. The empirical analysis proceeds to examine the macroeconomic effects of both greater unilateral and intraregional trade liberalization, as well as inflows of FDI, including a review of the impact of greater financial integration and a more open capital account on human development focusing on the Asian financial crisis of 1997. This is followed by a discussion of intraregional migration. The chapter also identifies major problems and concerns relating to human development that have emerged as a consequence of economic integration and shows how regional cooperation can help in their resolution. 4.1 REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA Since the mid-1980s, East Asia has experienced \u201cregionalization\u201d or market-driven integration. The process was spurred by unilateral reforms in individual economies, as well as FDI within the region, principally from Japan, that followed the logic of the \u201cflying geese\u201d pattern of relocating production processes to lower-cost countries as domestic costs rose (Pangestu and Gooptu, 2003). The East Asia experience can be contrasted to what is termed \u201cregionalism\u201d, which refers to formal economic cooperation and economic arrangements. The EU is the foremost example of successful regionalism, although here, too, further integration is facing an uphill battle. The more prosperous countries of South-East Asia \u2013 Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand referred to as the ASEAN-6 \u2013 have moved forward in integrating with the global economy. The admission of the CLMV countries to ASEAN makes the latter a potential force in the global arena but it poses new challenges because those countries are new to international trading arrangements and are economically behind the six other members. The emergence of Timor- Leste adds another dimension to integration and cooperation efforts in South-East Asia. Even before AFTA came into effect, intraregional trade among ASEAN member countries expanded steadily and was over 29 per cent of total exports in 2002.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "926a8284-3dfe-4d64-8371-d3ed0635f16a": {"__data__": {"id_": "926a8284-3dfe-4d64-8371-d3ed0635f16a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "286f658fb304f046540456e7b8292468be7039a9d3eb623f0b492ee325781a19"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa210956-4fcf-4f86-a40d-d17f6fd8c676", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb4b02ef5c41b46171d802fc8bddb21b3909c6daf43a36bf3eace482d9167690"}}, "hash": "c3032e537d353059bbba2af2688292fb171700afc2b983c1ccda3ef93dd077ca", "text": "However, the shares of Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Myanmar increased considerably during the period, while the shares of Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic declined.

It has been observed that AFTA member countries have reduced most-favoured-nation tariff rates along with the preferential AFTA rates and the differences between the two are now quite small. There has been little progress in the harmonization of product standards and in trade facilitation. Combined with the high cost of compliance with rules of origin, this has resulted in a small share of intra-ASEAN trade conducted at the preferential AFTA rates (Soesastro, 2001). In addition, other factors made ASEAN member countries initially reluctant to embark on closer economic integration (Chia, 2000). First, wide differences in levels of economic development, industrial competence and commitment to free trade made it difficult to forge a consensus on economic integration. Second, complementarities among the economies are limited, except perhaps between Brunei Darussalam and Singapore, on the one hand, and the rest of the countries, on the other. A modest degree of complementarity also exists between middle-income South-East Asian economies and the CMLV countries. However, Brunei Darussalam and Singapore have small populations and cannot play the role that Germany and France did in the EU. Finally, South-East Asia remains too small to be economically crucial for individual member countries and economic relations with countries outside the region are likely to continue to be dominant in the foreseeable future. Trade among ASEAN plus China, Japan and Republic of Korea stood at 36.4 per cent in 2002 and has grown rapidly, indicating that this bloc could form a more viable regional trading arrangement. 4. REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 25 In this context, the role of formal regional arrangements in South-East Asia appears to be more to facilitate and support unilateral reforms and contribute to multilateral liberalization than to advance regional integration and intraregional trade and investment (Pangestu and Gooptu, 2003). Therefore, in assessing the impact of closer regional integration in South-East Asia, studies that look at the impact of greater global integration should be considered equally relevant. 4.2 THE IMPACT OF GREATER REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE Trade liberalization Early studies on the integration process among ASEAN member countries pointed to its beneficial impact at the macroeconomic level in terms of higher trade volumes and faster economic growth (Nakamura and Yap, 1990 and Imada et al., 1991). More recent studies have affirmed the benefits of closer regional economic integration and even extended the analysis to cover more countries. A recent World Bank study reported similar results (Krumm and Kharas, 2003). The evidence suggests that ASEAN member countries would stand to gain more if the coverage of their regional trade arrangement is expanded. Moreover, benefits would be generally lower if agriculture was excluded from the arrangement. A study on Viet Nam applied a multi-regional, computable general equilibrium model to determine the impact of several possible trade arrangements, such as accession to AFTA under different scenarios (Fukase and Martin, 2001). The simulation results showed that the static economy-wide effects of AFTA liberalization were relatively small and that there could be substantial losses in terms of trade from the export expansion associated with AFTA liberalization. The results suggest that Viet Nam would gain from extending its AFTA concessions on an MFN basis through unilateral liberalization. Another study on Indonesia, which applied a global, computable general equilibrium model from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP)4, shows that full implementation of agreements under the Uruguay Round and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will yield substantial benefits for the Indonesian economy (Feridhanusetyawan and Pangestu, 2003). The gains, which are derived mainly from a more efficient allocation of resources, would be magnified if Indonesia were to liberalize unilaterally.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "990a19b0-0556-42bf-8a1f-c22c31937b00": {"__data__": {"id_": "990a19b0-0556-42bf-8a1f-c22c31937b00", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da4e8bfd55d8e868ab944146a592dcaad56f33d7a5c32f97d52a06e42287fcba"}, "2": {"node_id": "2bcc94b8-28dc-4a01-bb80-8fea446048f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/south-east-asia-regional-economic-integration-and-cooperation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03fd415c622d78aee83769e898084cf107a7978b6b6d97b21e00beeff30395ca"}}, "hash": "3d2454baf118306193e443d1f25a9481045326650423d6d14a074060b1d376bf", "text": "Singapore was shown to benefit the most from trade liberalization under different scenarios.

One important conclusion of the study was that AFTA is expected to contribute very little to welfare gains to the five South-East Asian countries considered in the study but that inclusion of agriculture in the various trade arrangements would be generally beneficial to those countries. Foreign direct investment Undoubtedly, one of the key factors driving economic growth in the larger economies of South-East Asia in the last two decades has been FDI. Between 1989 and 2003, Singapore received the most FDI, followed by Viet Nam, Malaysia and Thailand but FDI received by CLMV countries has been relatively low. FDI inflows in Brunei Darussalam are largely affected by its oil and gas sector. While FDI has shown a positive trend in Singapore, Brunei Darussalam and Viet Nam in recent years, this has not been the case in other countries. Indonesia, in particular, suffered net outflows of FDI and inflows have been erratic in Malaysia. Intraregional investment among the ten ASEAN member countries peaked at 13.3 per cent of total investment prior to the 1997 financial crisis (ASEAN, 2004a).5 After the onset of the crisis, the figure fell to 4.2 per cent in 1999 before recovering to 9 per cent in 2001. 4 Hosted by the Center for Global Trade Analysis, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University (http://www.gtap.agecon.purdue.edu/). 5 This pales in comparison to intraregional FDI in the EU, which reached 60 per cent of total FDI received in 2000 (EuroStat News Release, 2001). 26 | South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation Table 6.

The impact of FDI on economic performance has been extensively analyzed and its influence on economic growth measured quantitatively (see, for example, UNCTAD, 1999 and Jalilan and Weiss, 2001). The consensus is that FDI has had a net beneficial impact on economic performance. The channels by which FDI affects growth and development in host countries range from direct effects on employment and training, through multiplier effects from increased expenditure in the local economy, to spillover effects as knowledge and technology are transferred to indigenous firms (Mirza and Giroud, 2004). The latter is often the foremost reason for encouraging FDI. The surge in FDI in South-East Asia in the late-1980s and 1990s can be attributed primarily to economic restructuring in Japan, following the sharp appreciation of the yen vis-\u00e0-vis the United States dollar in 1985.

It remains to be seen whether the market effect will become more significant in future as integration proceeds in the region. Financial and capital account liberalization and the 1997 financial crisis It has been widely accepted that excessively rapid financial and capital market liberalization was probably the single most important cause of the 1997 financial crisis (Stiglitz, 2003). As an integral part of the so-called \u201cWashington Consensus\u201d, financial and capital market liberalization was encouraged and controls on the movement of capital were viewed as impediments to greater economic efficiency. Moreover, greater financial integration was expected to lead to increased diversification of sources of funding, enhancing economic stability.

As a result of capital account liberalization, many countries in South-East Asia experienced a surge in portfolio or \u201chot money\u201d inflows.6 This resulted in an appreciation of real effective exchange rates, which hurt manufacturing and benefited non-tradable sectors, especially real estate. A consumption boom, driven by faster credit growth, together with the greater availability of foreign exchange stimulated increased imports. Current 6 FDI inflows also increased but, as mentioned earlier, the rise in FDI had occurred mainly owing to economic restructuring in Japan, which preceded the liberalization of the capital account in 1991. South-East Asia Regional Economic Integration and Cooperation | 27 account deficits worsened and external debt, particularly short-term, private sector obligations, increased. Capital account liberalization also heightened vulnerabilities emanating from other areas of the economy. In particular, the soft exchange rate peg in most of the crisis countries encouraged foreign borrowing since most central banks implicitly guaranteed a fixed exchange rate in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, financial systems in most countries were not mature enough in terms of the quality of supervision and regulation. Combined with some unscrupulous practices by some banks and firms, the result were loans of dubious quality. As is well known, the crisis started with the Thai baht and then spread to other countries in East Asia. The 1997 financial crisis epitomizes the risks involved in greater global and regional economic integration if it is carried out too hastily and with insufficient preparation. As mentioned earlier, the impact on human development in the region was substantial. Labour migration Asia is one of the most significant regions of the world not only in terms of the cross-border movement of goods and capital but also in terms of the movement of people (Ghosh, 2004). This is particularly true of South-East Asia. The stock of intraregional temporary labour migrants in South-East Asia grew from 300,000-500,000 persons in the early-1970s to a peak of 3-3.5 million persons prior to the onset of the 1997 crisis. Temporary labour migrant flows to major host countries, namely Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, represent about 7 per cent of their combined labour force. Latest available estimates put the stock of temporary migrants at 3.25 million, about 95 per cent of whom are thought to be unskilled (Manning and Bhatnagar 2004). Migration is intrinsically related to the level of development, as disparities in living standards together with gaps in labour supply and demand in South-East Asian nations create the conditions for intraregional migration (Yeoh, 2004). Migration has varied effects on home and host countries. In the home country, the most direct benefits come from the remittances and repatriated savings of migrants. However, over-dependence on such inflows is undesirable in the same way that dependence upon a single major export commodity can also be problematic. This is especially the case when business cycles, as well as political and other phenomena, in host countries affect migration and remittances. Temporary migration permits poor households to diversify income sources and reduces the vulnerability of poor communities in general to domestic economic crises. Host countries of migrants also benefit from the supply of low cost labour that is in short supply for them. One key issue is how the beneficial impacts of greater labour mobility in the region can be maximized and costs reduced. This can be achieved through appropriate labour and social policies that are included in the recommendations outlined below. 4.3 THE IMPACT OF GREATER REGIONAL ECONOMIC INTEGRATION ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The experience with the 1997 crisis confirms that greater global and regional integration need not necessarily have beneficial impacts. In the case of trade liberalization and inflows of FDI, evidence at the aggregate level favours more economic openness but the impact on ordinary people, particularly in terms of human development, may not always be encouraging. In this section, quantitative evidence is examined to determine whether some of those concerns are valid. A useful framework to adopt is that of MIMAP, which permits measures that enhance global and regional economic integration to be treated as macroeconomic adjustment policies. In this framework (Appendix I), aggregate supply and demand of goods and services determine equilibrium output, the overall price level, employment, the aggregate balance of trade in goods and services and international financial flows with the rest of the world. The interface between macroeconomic and household outcomes determines relative output and price levels, which affect sectoral factor demand and supply, factor quantities employed, factor returns and the functional distribution of income. The ownership of, and access to, various productive resources determine the size distribution of income.
