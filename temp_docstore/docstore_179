Road-Test Edition 46 47 Or you may want to consult with key academics or other experts in the country on other information about land and resource tenure, cultural norms, and social conflicts over resource use within the assessment area. The key strategic question at this stage is how best to combine the expertise of local and national experts (\u201cbest knowledge\u201d) with existing datasets, maps and literature (\u201cbest science\u201d). A combination of technical expertise, stakeholder engagement and other data sources tends to give the optimal result. Planning for stakeholder engagement The next task for the team is to identify the main stakeholder groups relating to FLR in the assessment area. Stakeholder groups can be categorized in different ways, and for the purposes of the handbook three types of stakeholder are identified (as shown in Figure 9): \u2022 Primary (or direct) stakeholders who have a direct interest in the resource, either because they depend on it for their livelihoods or because they are directly involved in its utilization. Primary stakeholders may include farmers, pastoralists, harvesters of forest products and private enterprises operating within the assessment area. None of these is necessarily a homogeneous group; for example you may need to distinguish different groups of farmers according to wealth, size of landholding, or numbers of livestock. Such groups have different resources, different degrees of commercial orientation, and would normally favour different land-use options in any future FLR programme. Gender differences in particular need to be considered. If the assessment area includes community lands, elected community representatives need to be involved. \u2022 Secondary (or indirect) stakeholders who have a more indirect interest, such as those involved in institutions or agencies concerned with managing the resource or those who depend at least partially on income or business opportunities generated by the resource. Secondary stakeholders could include local, regional and national government agencies with a strong influence over forest and land management in the assessment area. \u2022 Interest groups who are those individuals or organizations that are not affected by, and have no direct influence over the FLR process, but who have significant interest in the outcome of FLR. These might include, for example, international and national NGOs interested in environmental protection, biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction. Planning the work Identifying data and capacity needs Data requirements At this stage, you can start thinking about what kinds of data you will need. While most of the data will probably need to be spatial in nature \u2013 that is, either in mapped form or easily mappable \u2013 other data will be in the form of contextual reports and studies, particularly those related to policies, strategies and programmes as well as various kinds of socio-economic data. If you are already aware of specific gaps in the data you will require, you will need to decide whether these gaps can be addressed and, if so, how. While it may be possible to commission new information-gathering exercises such as field surveys, interviews with key stakeholders or professional interpretation of new satellite imagery, this should only be done if absolutely necessary; ROAM is explicitly designed to work with existing data, even when these are limited. In general, opt to use simpler or readily available data sets; don\u2019t make provision to commission major pieces of analysis if there is any doubt on whether they will be delivered in time. This is particularly important for new geospatial and economic data, as reliance on data that are not produced within the required timeframe could derail the whole assessment. In general, avoid an over- reliance on geospatial data alone. A more pragmatic approach to address data gaps is the use of Delphi-type surveys. A Delphi survey involves collecting opinions from relevant experts over several", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0aa15cd5-5a3d-4b02-b83f-9589cc64b7ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "0aa15cd5-5a3d-4b02-b83f-9589cc64b7ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fbb5560bb74bcad46ecdeed69fe6bc35e0cb3b1f78925f04d89622c5e7455c9"}}, "hash": "1fbb5560bb74bcad46ecdeed69fe6bc35e0cb3b1f78925f04d89622c5e7455c9", "text": "iterative rounds with the results of each round given as feedback to the survey participants, allowing them to comment on and refine the collective knowledge of their peers. It is also acceptable to use values generated for other areas with similar characteristics to the assessment area, as long as it is made clear that the analysis is based, in part, on secondary source data. For example, in the Ghana assessment, economic cost and benefit data were scarce, so the assessment process built in a Delphi-type expert assessment to produce credible estimates that could be used in the absence of formal, peer-reviewed economic surveys. The earlier you undertake these types of work- around solutions the better, since these kinds of exercises, while not requiring a large amount of man hours to do, require a few weeks to collect responses. You may also need to look for proxy indicators for some of the criteria you have selected, if directly related data are not available. For example, variations in the local market price of unprocessed fuelwood can act as a reasonable proxy indicator of firewood scarcity or abundance. Capacity needs Once you have some idea of the kinds of information you will need and how much data is readily available, you can see whether the capacities of the assessment team will need to be supplemented by identifying and calling on additional in-country expertise. For example, you might need to secure the help of national experts to prepare and analyse GIS maps using different series of spatial data (e.g. land cover, land use, etc.) Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 48 49 The choice of the institutional home of the assessment will influence the engagement of stakeholders, as each institution has its own sectoral stakeholder relationships. It is important to compensate for any bias that this may lead to, for example by actively engaging stakeholders in the agricultural sector if the institutional home is in the forest sector. The assessment team also needs to be strategic and proactive in keeping key stakeholders well informed about the process and emerging results, in order to ensure knowledge uptake among the individuals and agencies that will be critical in any follow-up activities (e.g. those involved in the country\u2019s Forest Investment Programme). This might entail, for example, targeted written communications, individual meetings and invitations to the inception, analytical and/or validation workshops. Depending on the timeframe and context of FLR interest within the country, the team may wish to issue occasional updates on the process to a more general interested public. Once the assessment is complete, the results can then be published and reported on nationally and internationally. The final section of this handbook offers guidance on entry points for encouraging uptake of the national assessment findings and any recommendations that emerge from it. Table 7 lists some typical examples of stakeholders in these three categories, their likely interests and their potential roles in relation to an FLR assessment. Discussions among the assessment team and with other people familiar with the assessment area will help identify the key stakeholder groups of relevance to the assessment. The team will then need to plan how and when they will select and engage representatives of these stakeholder groups during the assessment process. A clear distinction needs to be made between those stake holders participating on their own behalf and those with a legitimate mandate to represent a wider stakeholder group. Balanced stakeholder involvement is a critical aspect of a successful assessment to ensure that the analysis is properly informed by their knowledge and experience, and takes into account their views on the potential impacts of FLR on their livelihoods and interests. Ideally, the team will reach out to stakeholders as early as possible in the assessment process, to allow their knowledge and perspectives to be brought into the discussions and analysis alongside other inputs including scientific data. However in some cases there will not be sufficient information available at the early stage to be specific about land management in degraded areas, so it may be necessary to periodically reconsider and reassess which additional stakeholders need to be included in the assessment process as it develops.

They will be the most involved in any effort to restore degraded land, and will also be the ones to benefit the most. There may be many differ- ent types of land users (cultivators, herders, women, youth, rich / poor farmers, large / small farmers etc.). These are likely to be customary leaders or local authorities. They have a stake in ensuring that their land is better managed in the future. Their role in the process is to represent the customary or statutory owners of the land and make sure that they understand the implications of FLR for them as landowners. Note that in some countries ownership may not be clearly defined. Communities and businesses living downstream from a water catchment will have particular interest in how land is managed in an area from which their water flows, since land management may affect the quantity and quality of water available to them downstream.

Potential involvement in FLR assessment Representatives should be identified and invited to the relevant workshops and consulted and involved regularly as the assessment proceeds. It may be necessary to commission specific pieces of work to ensure their opinions are adequately reflected. Efforts should be made to check if there are clearly identifiable public and/or private land owners in the degraded areas and if so, invite them to participate at the relevant workshops. As with land users, efforts need to be made to commu- nicate to, and involve, this group throughout the assessment process. Representatives may be invited to the relevant workshops and/or community-level presentations of the assessment results. Key agencies should be closely in- volved, and may actually be repre- sented in the assessment team. These stakeholders will need to be consulted at major decision-making points, and/ or invited to review results. Other agencies can be invited to send repre- sentatives to the relevant workshops. These experts should be identified and involved, particularly to help fill data gaps. Representatives can be invited to the inception and/or validation workshop, and kept informed of the assessment results. Representatives can be invited to the inception and/or validation workshop, and kept informed of the assessment results. Organizing the inception workshop The assessment team should if at all possible organize an inception workshop to inform key stakeholders of the potential for FLR and engage their interest and involvement in the ROAM process right from the start. This is essential in order to obtain political and professional ownership of the assessment process and commitment to its results. Depending on the scale of the assessment, the workshop will be at a national or sub- national level. Invitees should include decision-makers and experts from government ministries, departments and agencies, as well as technical experts from NGOs, research institutes and the private sector. Other stakeholders important to the assessment process and/ or any follow-up actions should also be invited, including for example representatives of communities and field staff working in the degraded areas to be covered by the assessment. Typical objectives of an inception workshop would include some or all of the following: \u2022 Assess the opportunities for FLR in the country/area; \u2022 Share information on existing FLR activities in the country/area; \u2022 Share an overview of the strategy, parameters and plan as developed by the assessment team; \u2022 Invite feedback on these ideas and plans; \u2022 Discuss options for institutionalizing FLR in the country; and \u2022 Explore how the potential for FLR could be integrated into national REDD+ strategies.

Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 54 55 Phase 2: Data collection and analysis This chapter covers the core phase of ROAM, involving the collection and analysis of data. The data collection activities are described first (although in practice the sourcing of information and data will continue throughout the analysis stage of the work), followed by brief guidance on five discrete analytical components, as outlined in Table 9. The handbook\u2019s descriptions of these five analytical components (or \u2018tools\u2019) are primarily intended to help readers consider and plan these pieces of work. Additional publications will be produced in 2014 and 2015 to provide more detailed guidance on how to conduct these analyses. This is the phase of the work which will vary most from one national application to the next, in terms of the techniques used and the process undertaken. Nevertheless in most situations it should be possible to deliver the following analytical products: \u2022 A refined list of priority restoration interventions, based on a review of the initial interventions identified; \u2022 A spatial analysis of restoration potential, including a series of national opportunity maps; \u2022 An economic analysis of the costs and benefits associated with the identified restoration interventions; \u2022 An analysis of the carbon sequestration potential and the associated co-benefits; \u2022 A diagnosis of the presence of key success factors for restoration, that examines the opportunities and challenges presented by the prevailing legal, institutional, policy, market, social and ecological conditions, as well as the implementation capacity and resources and the level of motivation among key actors; and \u2022 An analysis of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8eb58414-15bd-4316-83e2-e3fe89e90b94": {"__data__": {"id_": "8eb58414-15bd-4316-83e2-e3fe89e90b94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b101d433cd2d753e6d681a2ec3a934dbf63cfefdf1d564170b7eec0a7dd8f42d"}}, "hash": "b101d433cd2d753e6d681a2ec3a934dbf63cfefdf1d564170b7eec0a7dd8f42d", "text": "the financing and resourcing for the implementation of the identified FLR opportunities. However, while ROAM is capable of delivering all of the above, the choice of which products are actually required is a decision that is based on national priorities and available resources.

Page Table 9. Summary of the analytical components of ROAM 58 68 83 90 94 98 In developing these products, the most important things to bear in mind are to: \u2022 Try to maintain an adequate balance of expertise and perspectives among those involved in the analysis, including agriculture, land, forests, water, economic development, energy, gender, etc.; \u2022 Bear in mind the needs of the key end-users when considering the most appropriate outputs to aim for in this phase. Periodically assess whether the emerging insights talk directly to national priorities; \u2022 Ensure that everyone involved in the analysis understands the process and is clear about the kinds of outputs being sought; \u2022 Make sure that the analytical process is as intellectually robust and scientifically defensible as possible; and \u2022 Be transparent, when sharing results, about the analytical techniques used and any subjective decisions taken (e.g. weighting of criteria, setting of threshold levels). It is also important for the assessment team to revisit: (1) the assessment criteria (see pages 42); and (2) the preliminary set of restoration options (see pages 38) during the data collection and analytical phase. The reason for this is that the insights gained during data collection and from spatial and economic analysis will invariably challenge some of the initial assumptions the team worked with during the preparatory phase. For example, spatial analysis may indicate that an identified restoration option is simply not feasible because it directly competes with agricultural land, or soil erodibility may prove not to be a useful assessment criterion because data exist for only a very limited area of the entire national territory.

Road-Test Edition 58 59 Stakeholder prioritization of restoration interventions Data collection and analysis may sound as if it is a rather straightforward and technically driven process. However in this case it requires proactive stakeholder engagement in the analysis and a regular revisiting of the underlying assumptions that were used during the preparation and planning phase. This is necessary because it is quite common to encounter significant information gaps or outdated and inaccurate narratives about land degradation, land-use dynamics and ongoing restoration policies. One example illustrates this point. In the West African state of Guinea, it was a widely held belief among government officials and conservationists that islands of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47830905-6b1f-4715-a76b-e26fe7754a33": {"__data__": {"id_": "47830905-6b1f-4715-a76b-e26fe7754a33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10bfa095366eaf68d38930d990275b865d3ba2c1753fa28ab8ae4458693fd465"}}, "hash": "10bfa095366eaf68d38930d990275b865d3ba2c1753fa28ab8ae4458693fd465", "text": "dense forest in savannah landscapes were the last relics of previously extensive forest cover that had been lost during the early and mid-20th Century, due to poor land- use practice. Indeed, if one was thinking of landscape restoration in this area in the 1980s, one conclusion would have been to enforce protection in these areas from local use and to build outwards from these so-called \u2018relic\u2019 areas. That would have been a mistake as Fairhead and Leach illustrated in their excellent book \u2018Misreading the African Landscape\u2019 (Fairhead and Leach, 1996). What were officially regarded as relic old growth forests were in fact relatively recently created forest islands by local communities. Indeed, these areas of forest were evidence of a type of landscape restoration and rather than restricting communities\u2019 activities, forest policy would have been better directed at encouraging and building on this type of activity. The analytical phase of ROAM therefore offers a quick and unique opportunity to take a fresh look at established understanding of land-use change. Spatial analysis offers a good snap-shot of the mosaic of land uses across the landscape at one point in time but in order to place that understanding in a broader context of forest landscape restoration opportunities local stakeholders and different government agencies will need to be brought into the analytical process. As the ideal situation is to get these different perspectives into the same room to give their collective opinion on preliminary data analysis, a series of analytical workshops \u2013 either by sub-national region or theme \u2013 is an essential part of this phase. These analytical workshops should be designed to seek the input of a wide range of stakeholders and to have them respond to the interim results from spatial analysis and mapping. They also provide the opportunity to garner further refinements to the list of restoration options and analysis of their potential implications. Any questions raised can then be followed up with specialist analyses, such as detailed valuations of costs and benefits and calculations of carbon sequestration for the different restoration options identified. The desired number and mix of participants will inevitably vary, depending on the objectives of the workshops. However it is very important to get a good mix of technical expertise and stakeholder perspectives (and particularly to avoid an over- representation of professional foresters), as well as a good gender balance. Among those you may want to invite are: \u2022 Forest agency staff (decision-makers and technical staff) \u2022 Land agency representatives \u2022 Agricultural agency representatives \u2022 Local government officials \u2022 Local chiefs and/or leaders \u2022 Farmers \u2022 Forest companies (commercial and community-based) \u2022 Landowners and those with customary rights over land or natural resources \u2022 Forest users (charcoal producers, non-timber product harvesters, firewood sellers, etc.) \u2022 Non-governmental organization representatives \u2022 Researchers \u2022 Indigenous peoples (if present in the area) The assessment team may find it helpful to engage stakeholders with a reliable, up-to- date base map of FLR-relevant features for the assessment area. In a data-rich country, a pre-existing map is likely to be available and the team simply needs to procure and reproduce this map in an appropriate format (a large poster format is best). In a country where no such map exists, the team may need to commission one. The base map produced for the FLR assessment in Ghana is shown in Figure 10. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 61 The characteristics of a good base map will depend on the assessment area. Here are some points to consider: \u2022 The scale should be such that, when the map is printed as a table-top size poster, it shows the area of assessment with appropriate resolution; \u2022 The map must have a scale bar on it so that working groups can determine the size of any block of land during the assessment; \u2022 The theme of the map should support the assessment. A map that shows populated points and infrastructure against a background of land cover types, density of tree cover, and watercourses is generally appropriate. Other topographic features, such as mountains, should also be included if significant; \u2022 The map needs to be sufficiently accurate and up-to-date to allow the participants to arrive at informed interpretations about the landscape. Box 5. Refining the assessment criteria: example from Rwanda In the Rwanda assessment, several criteria were initially identified, related to the protective function of forests \u2013 this included upper catchment protection, gullies and gully formation, riparian strips, wetlands, siltation and water quality.

The team also ran into some practical challenges of accessing sufficiently reliable data on the expected costs and anticipated benefits of each situation. During the refinement process these challenges were resolved by re-examining the issues and simplifying the approach. Common to each situation (riparian strips, gullies, hill tops and ridges) was the fact that: (1) the main benefit was protection of soil and water; (2) any intervention on any site would be limited to very discrete areas that were not under intense competition from another land use; and (3) the protective functions would be optimized by establishing mixed stands of native species rather than monoculture stands of exotics. The team then simplified the criteria to one of protective forest function and redefined the criteria (for GIS analysis) to very specific and discrete parameters \u2013 e.g. steep slopes greater than 55%, 20-meter buffers by major water courses, etc. At the same stage, five broad types of land use/potential intervention were grouped and reclassified to a single type \u2013 protective forests. 0 100 km Figure 10. Base map produced for the ROAM application in Ghana This pre-existing map, showing Ghana\u2019s current forest cover, was used as the starting point for the country\u2019s national assessment. Participants at the analytical workshop worked in small groups, each focused on a different region of the country, to identify and map areas of restoration opportunity directly on poster-sized versions of this \u2018base\u2019 map. The rigor of the analytical phase is contingent on having a well-defined set of criteria that enables a credible assessment of the need for restoration, the availability and scope of land for restoration, the types and potential of appropriate restoration interventions, the costs and benefits of these restoration options and the presence of key success factors. The assessment team will have already worked on this task (see pages 38 to 45), so stakeholder engagement should include, as appropriate, a review of these criteria and a discussion on any necessary additions and changes. Refining the criteria and indicators for the assessment tends to run concurrently with the refinement of restoration options (see below). A worked example is provided in Box 5. Using the preliminary list of locally-appropriate restoration interventions drawn up earlier (see page 38) the assessment team can now work with other stakeholders and experts to refine the specific restoration options identified during the preparatory phase. Road-Test Edition 62 Table 10. Revised listing of most appropriate FLR options, from the Rwanda assessment Agroforestry Improved woodlot and timber planta- tion management Natural forests Protective forests Agroforestry on flat lands Agroforestry on sloping lands Agroforestry on pasture lands: farmer-managed natural regeneration Improved management of existing small woodlots for fuel- wood or structural wood Improved management of existing industrial timber plan- tations (pine) Restoration of natural forests in or around protected areas Restoration or establishment of protective forests on steep lands (55%) Restoration or establishment of protective forests on very steep lands (20%-55%) As an example of the iterative, refining process of this stage of analysis, the number of candidate FLR interventions in Rwanda was eventually reduced from 21 (as shown in Table 3) to eight (see Table 10), based on the feedback from stakeholders as they reviewed the results of spatial and economic analysis. For example, as evident from Table 3, the single most relevant intervention around woodlots was improved management of small woodlots. Subsequent GIS analysis confirmed that this was where the largest single gain could be achieved and given current land-use pressure there was, with a few exceptions, very little land for new woodlots or plantations. Therefore, improved woodlot management eventually emerged as the most credible intervention among the eight initially listed under the headings \u2018Woodlots for biomass\u2019 and \u2018Industrial timber plantations\u2019. This does not mean that other specific interventions in this category are irrelevant, simply that the local conditions are such that it is difficult to envision any of them being able to deliver FLR at scale. Type of intervention /land-use Top candidate FLR option Table 11 shows the results of this refinement step from a different ROAM application \u2013 the Ghana assessment. It should be noted that in this case the list of specific interventions was considered too extensive to enable a rigorous analysis of each intervention. This experience subsequently led to the recommendation to limit the number of specific interventions to between 5 and 15.

Remember, when looking for spatial data, focus on what is available at a scale appro- priate for the assessment. Stakeholder surveys Surveys can be a powerful tool for collecting basic data. In the Ghana national FLR assessment, surveys were used with good results to collect information about the establishment and operating costs of restoration projects. The assessment team sent out approximately 30 surveys to land owners and land managers who had recently restored all or part of their land. The surveys collected information on a detailed break- down of operations and their unit costs per hectare for each restoration intervention and provided a means for collecting more detailed information than would be possible in a workshop setting. Existing maps Existing maps, if up-to-date and reliable, are a valuable source of data for assess- ments. In Mexico the assessment team held several technical meetings with national institutions such as the Forestry Commission and the Commission on Protected Areas, to request digital thematic maps of variables relevant to the assessment criteria. The officials of these institutions provided digital copies of the maps as well as background documentation and metadata. The officials also provided valuable explanations and recommendations on how to process the information. The team was able to obtain a good number of relevant maps and data sets on a wide range of variables including, for example, forest zoning, economic pressures on forests, soil conditions for plant growth, fire resilience, and potential land use. Most of these maps were available at a scale of 1:250,000 which is quite sufficient for a national-level assessment. Scientific literature Literature can be particularly useful to find data on growth rates of different tree species and restoration interventions, particularly if local growth and yield tables are not available. The FAO\u2019s Global Planted Forests Thematic study (FAO, 2006) contains several tables that give Mean Annual Increment values for dozens of common tree species across a variety of climate zones. Issues Potentially relevant data Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 66 67 Specially commissioned maps Where existing maps are not sufficient, new ones may be commissioned for the assessment. In Ghana, the existing land cover map was considered outdated as many land-use changes were known to have occurred since it was produced in 2000. A university was therefore contracted to produce a new land-cover base map using imagery from Landsat 7. Three mosaics of Landsat images were created at 60 metre ground resolution, representing the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. The new base map was used to produce a series of \u2018table top-size\u2019 regional maps ranging in scale from 1:200,000 to 1:600,000 depending on the size of the region. The regional maps were subsequently used in the analytical workshop. Data to inform a critical look at restoration options During the preparatory phase, the team will have drawn up a preliminary list of appropriate types of FLR interventions. While this may appear a relatively straightforward exercise, it is one of the critical steps on which the success of the assessment depends. The risk is that the interventions are assumed to be the most appropriate ones based on no other reason than \u201cthis is the way we have always done things\u201d. It is critical that this step is approached with an open mind and that long- standing assumptions are challenged as new data and analysis emerge. One benefit of using ROAM is that it opens the door to take a fresh look at why past or existing interventions failed or only partially succeeded. For example, if national tree planting days, despite decades of effort, have produced very little tangible results on the ground, the assessment should be able to shed some light as to why this is the case. Above all, the final set of FLR interventions needs to withstand basic scrutiny as to why these would constitute the \u201cbest bet\u201d for a national or sub-national restoration strategy. Bearing this in mind, the aim of this particular exercise is to gather as much data as possible on local FLR options and interventions \u2013 even if these are of a preliminary nature or based on rough estimates \u2013 before the analytical workshop(s). The work- shop participants can then help refine or supplement these data and use them for the analysis, while also considering the relative successes of ongoing or previous restoration efforts. Ultimately, the assessment should aim to produce a limited list of FLR interventions that have been rigorously evaluated to be nationally appropriate and that are underpinned with sufficient technical detail and quantified analysis", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8613394a-1fa4-45c0-a428-1d870da6231f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8613394a-1fa4-45c0-a428-1d870da6231f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5272c442c3626f2b5e99cd9e65dcd6c2f1518240823f24e8dccb49b3a039b50"}}, "hash": "e5272c442c3626f2b5e99cd9e65dcd6c2f1518240823f24e8dccb49b3a039b50", "text": "to permit reliable and realistic evaluation of the extent of area that could benefit from these interventions and the costs and benefits associated with them. As a rule of thumb, the final assessment should have approximately 5-15 technically and/or geographically distinct interventions. Any less and the analysis becomes too generic, any more and it is unlikely that the associated parameters of the interventions can be reliably assessed without excessively inflating the costs of assessment. See page 61 for more details on finalizing the listing of FLR options. Data on the costs and benefits of restoration Central to a national assessment of FLR potential is an analysis of the costs and benefits of each specific FLR intervention (see pages 83 to 89). This will require data to be collected on relevant values, such as the prices of inputs (e.g. seedlings, land, labour, transport and equipment) and outputs (e.g. crops, timber and fuelwood, as well as specific services provided by the restored ecosystems). Timber growth rate data, such as mean- annual- increment, would also be helpful in order to estimate the potential of timber production and carbon sequestration. Wherever possible, data should also be gathered on the economic benefits of restoration, based on the long-term objectives for FLR that were set out at the beginning of the assessment process. For example, if one of the objectives is related to watershed restoration the team should try to obtain information or estimates on how restoration might be expected to modify the water flow into streams and tributaries as well as information on how the water would eventually be used and who would be the primary beneficiaries. There is no hard-and-fast rule on which cost-benefit data to gather, but generally the following estimates will be useful: \u2022 The amount per hectare of woody biomass that would grow over the agreed time period. Where possible, estimates should be corroborated with data from literature and questionnaires. Estimates would also need to be adjusted based on expected levels of harvest over the agreed time period. \u2022 The amount of carbon sequestered through growth of woody biomass, using applicable IPCC conversion factors. \u2022 The value per hectare of non-timber forest products produced over the agreed time period. Use local estimates if available, otherwise general estimates. \u2022 The crop yield increase and fertilizer cost reduction from agroforestry over the agreed time period. In the Ghana assessment, for example, the expected gain in crop productivity was modelled as a function of the avoided losses in yield due to improved soil erosion control. \u2022 The effect of shifts in intercropping schemes over the agreed time period, such as a transition from open-grown cultivation of cocoa to shade-grown cocoa. Local estimates are likely to be available where such a transition is an important consideration. \u2022 The effect of mangrove restoration, over the agreed time period, including for example the combined effect of an increased fish catch and increased supply of building materials. Local estimates are likely available where mangroves are important. If possible at this stage, it is desirable to separate out whether costs/inputs are derived from public or private sources and equally whether benefits accrue primarily to society at large or individuals. The reason for this is that such distinctions can be useful later on in helping to define feasible investment packages \u2013 for example, making sure to avoid suggesting schemes or interventions where benefits accrue centrally but where the majority of inputs (finance, labour) are made locally or at the individual level. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 68 69 Restoration opportunities mapping This is a key element of the whole assessment process, involving the analysis of spatial data and any other restoration-relevant information that the team has been able to acquire (statistical data, technical reports, etc.) and that can be easily mapped. The most appropriate approach to take will depend on the quantity and types of data available. If large amounts of GIS data are readily available and permission to use these data sets has been obtained, the assessment team will be able to conduct a large part of the spatial analysis using a \u2018digital mapping\u2019 approach. On the other hand, if only a limited amount of GIS data is available for use, the team will need to use more of a \u2018knowledge mapping\u2019 approach. Digital mapping is the classic GIS approach that builds up a spatial picture by combining layers of digital information and developing algorithms to test and visualize specific options, such as \u201ctarget contour planting with agroforestry species on slopes greater than 5% on existing agricultural land\u201d.

Once stakeholders agree that this represents their best collective knowledge it can be digitized and used for further analysis. Both approaches have their strengths and weaknesses \u2013 digital mapping can be too precise and risks ignoring local realities if the biophysical data indicate that a restoration option is possible, while knowledge mapping captures a richness of undocumented local and technical insights but is not very specific when it comes to landscape-level biophysical constraints. For this reason, assessment teams may prefer to use a combination of these two approaches. This point is illustrated in Figure 11. The three national assessments undertaken in Mexico, Ghana and Rwanda took somewhat different approaches to spatial analysis in response to the availability of data: \u2022 In Ghana, a strong knowledge mapping approach was used as only a limited amount of spatial data was available and the identification of FLR potential relied heavily on the expertise and judgement of the assessment team and the input of expert participants from local communities, local government and technical agencies in the analytical workshop; \u2022 In Mexico, a strong digital mapping approach was used, as good availability of GIS maps and data meant that the identification and prioritization of FLR potential could be based largely on pre-existing data sets; \u2022 In Rwanda, a combined approach was pursued because, although Rwanda also had good GIS maps and data, the requirements of the analysis meant that different scenarios needed to be tested against expert opinion and judgement formed as to which appeared most viable in the national context. The knowledge and digital mapping approaches are presented in separate sections, below. However, as highlighted above, they tend to work best in combination and an Data exist for all assessment criteria and indicators Some data exist for some criteria and indicators Limited or no data for criteria and indicators Use digital mapping approach for \ufb01rst-level analysis Use mixture of digital and knowledge mapping approaches Use knowledge mapping approach High Medium Low Level of GIS data availability Figure 11. Analysis approach as determined by data availability No matter what amount of GIS data is available, stakeholder engagement and national expertise will always be important for a rigorous analysis \u2014 and for a credible, successful assessment. assessment would very rarely be entirely knowledge or digital based. Even in situations of good availability of GIS information, gaps and weaknesses in the existing data will always call for input from experts and stakeholders. Knowledge mapping approach to spatial analysis A knowledge mapping approach to spatial analysis involves one or more analytical workshops during which the assessment team and other participants manually construct an assessment map, usually at a sub-national level. In practice, this workshop also serves as the opportunity to consider, test and review the other, non-spatial analyses such as the valuation of costs and benefits of the different types of restoration interventions identified.

Land that is suitable for mosaic-type resto- ration Criteria for polygons At least 75% of the area must be unsuita- ble or unavailable None \u2013 i.e. even small areas can be restored Minimum size 1,000 hectares Minimum size 40,000 hectares Rules for assigning interventions No interventions. Only restoration and rehabilitation of mangroves. Only interventions consistent with the wide-scale restoration strategy. Generally only one intervention per polygon. All interventions are available here includ- ing no intervention. Opportunities are assigned as proportions of the total area of the polygon. The locations of individual interventions within the polygon are not indicated. These guidelines were provided to the analytical workshop participants to ensure consistency across the different working groups in identifying areas and types of restoration opportunity. Knowledge mapping analysis is based on six simple steps: 1. Sub-dividing the area of analysis into polygons that are characterized by similar types of land use and land-use challenges; 2. Agreeing on the specific nature of restoration opportunities that would be both suitable and feasible in the geographic area under consideration; 3. Estimating individual portfolios of restoration interventions by polygon; 4. Gauging the feasibility of implementing these portfolios; 5. Reviewing and revising the restoration options; and 6. Digitizing the results.

This could be a map specially prepared for the assessment, showing for example areas of degradation, or it could be images captured from Google Earth; \u2022 A scaled quadrant for estimating areas on a map; \u2022 A list of criteria to use in the designation of polygons to different categories of intervention (see discussion below and Table 13); \u2022 A set of polygon description forms (see example in Table 14 on page 75); and \u2022 Any supplementary information (e.g. thematic maps, statistics, reports, etc.). An analytical sub-national workshop that is built around a knowledge mapping approach will probably take between one and two days; a day and a half should be ample time for the analysis tasks. Dividing the area into polygons The aim of this step is to get the participants in the working groups to draw on their collective knowledge to identify particular landscapes or areas where restoration opportunities might exist. Ideally the working groups should contain representatives from different sectors (agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, energy, infrastructure). They will work on table-top-sized base maps, each group covering a different sub-national area (e.g. province or region), dividing it into polygons in such a way that each is coherent in terms of restoration opportunities. The groups will then describe possible restoration interventions for each polygon. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 72 The groups start by dividing the base maps into polygons that are suitable for different general categories of restoration. The facilitator should encourage the groups to think about what polygons make practical sense, in terms of being suitable for one or another category of restoration. The working groups should follow the sequence below: \u2022 First delineate lands that do not require or are unsuitable or unavailable for restoration, e.g. intact natural areas, urban areas, road corridors, intensively farmed areas, etc.; \u2022 Second, delineate lands with opportunities for restoration for protective functions, particularly those for which legal requirements already exist. These could include steeply sloping lands, lands in the vicinity of water bodies or coasts and restoration aimed at watershed protection, mangrove restoration and erosion control; \u2022 Third, delineate lands with opportunities for wide-scale restoration, i.e. rehabilitation or restoration of land back to larger contiguous blocks of forest. These are generally identifiable as forest lands; and \u2022 Fourth, delineate lands with opportunities for mosaic-type restoration. This is generally restoration that interfaces with other land uses, notably agriculture. The facilitator should encourage participants to avoid filling the entire base map with polygons. Indeed as the aim of this exercise is to tap into local knowledge and expertise, polygons should only be delineated if there is broad consensus on the current land use and the restoration need. Unassigned areas will be assumed not to require restoration or to be otherwise unavailable for restoration activities. Each polygon should be clearly delineated on the base map, given its own unique identifier and marked as belonging to one of the three categories described above (i.e. wide-scale, mosaic or protective). Figure 12 shows an example of a map of one part of an assessment area, with hand-drawn polygons indicating opportunities for different kinds of restoration intervention. Figure 12. Example of a hand-drawn polygon map of part of an assessment area This is what an initial output of a knowledge mapping approach might look like \u2014 a first attempt at identifying and mapping restoration opportunities in one part of a country. Working in small groups, the analytical workshop participants identify and roughly locate key restoration opportunities, and give each a unique code. Once the entire assessment area has been assessed in this way, the maps are then digitized (i.e. these opportunity areas are put into a GIS map) for further review and verification. Road-Test Edition 74 75 Identifying restoration options The facilitator will then guide the working groups to fill in a description form for each polygon that they have identified as containing opportunities for one or another type of restoration. The forms are used to gather information on the approximate size of each polygon (which can be estimated from the map) as well as the proportion of the polygon that could be restored with different types of interventions. Again not every hectare of land within a polygon has to be assigned a restoration intervention \u2013 it is quite reasonable that a polygon might only have limited percentage of its area under FLR treatment (e.g. 3% protective restoration, 5% new plantings, 10% improved silviculture, 22% agroforestry and 60%", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0686cb65-e544-41e9-b4bd-6a7c930a9ac5": {"__data__": {"id_": "0686cb65-e544-41e9-b4bd-6a7c930a9ac5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "134484564c6b71b121b7295caf0c5017c1863d75eec18dc9ea9d0c38f884ef80"}, "3": {"node_id": "bb7b9513-acc5-48ec-be9e-5ba733fe3964", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c4cda124c3a230141ec333b6edcbfb2d803b954d2b02a1b7cc2ab7e590afbec"}}, "hash": "7a91815e229243a6274d7c3a6d82056eb24fcb4cb9cd36578cc1dbcdfe9e687c", "text": "no treatment). The groups need to assign a unique code number for each polygon they identify, and place this code on both the polygon form and the relevant polygon on the map, so that the form and polygon can be linked. The left side of the polygon form is filled in during the initial part of the exercise, while the right side is reserved to record any alterations made later in the process. An example of a completed polygon form following the initial part of the process is shown in Table 14. Reviewing and revising the results After the working groups complete the exercise of assigning restoration interventions, the polygon maps should be photographed and the information from the polygon forms entered into a specially programmed Excel spreadsheet model which calculates basic summary results, including the total area as well as the benefits and costs of the suggested interventions. If this exercise is taking place during a two-day analytical workshop, this task can easily be completed in the evening of the first day. The assessment team then presents these preliminary results and their consequences to the participants. Following a discussion in the plenary, participants go back to their groups to revise, if necessary, the designation of polygons (as suitable for wide- scale, mosaic or protective restoration, or unsuitable/unavailable for restoration) and the suggested mix of restoration interventions within those polygons designated as suitable for mosaic restoration. This could involve changes to the polygon map (e.g. transferring some polygons from the \u2018wide-scale\u2019 category to the \u2018mosaic\u2019 category) and the polygon form (to shift the balance between the different intervention types). The revised outputs from the working groups are collected by the assessment team and entered in the spreadsheet as a final record of the knowledge mapping exercise. Refining and digitizing the results Immediately after the knowledge mapping exercise, the assessment team should finalize the results and capture the polygon maps in GIS software to produce a digital version of the polygon map across the entire assessment area. First the team copies the polygon shapes into the GIS map, adjusting them in the process so that they reflect the intent of the groups and the characteristics of the landscape. This involves following the contours of the landscape more precisely than the groups may have done. The team also eliminates from the polygons lands that are: Table 14. Example of a completed polygon form Region: Polygon code: Estimated total area of polygon (ha): Day 1: Proposed mix of interventions Total FLR intervention category UNSUITABLE/UNAVAILABLE FOR RESTORATION (e.g. towns, villages, rocky outcrops, strict wildlife reserves, undegraded forest areas, etc.) Name Proportion of area (%) Proportion of area (%) Day 2: Revised mix of interventions South-West 4 5 Agroforestry Improved fallow 30% 30% 40% 100% 50% 20% 30% 100% 375,000 SW16 MS2 A polygon form is completed for each area marked in the polygon map (Figure 12), to detail the restoration options initially proposed and any changes made after further discussion and feedback. \u2022 unavailable for restoration for land use reasons, such as villages and road corridors, applying a buffer zone around and along these objects; or \u2022 unavailable for restoration for topographical reasons, i.e. steep slopes (if good data on slopes exist). The team can make other adjustments of a similar nature, if there are sufficient data to allow for further refinements. Then the team measures the area of each polygon, using the GIS, and adds any available attribute data for each polygon (e.g. on specific intervention opportunities) into the GIS. The final results will include a map of the entire assessment area and a series of charts (such as the one shown in Figure 13). Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 76 77 Digital mapping approach to spatial analysis The digital mapping approach uses digital (GIS) datasets to identify priority sites for restoration using a spatial analysis approach. The selection of GIS data (essentially GIS maps and associated metadata) is based on the desired output of the assessment and the criteria and indicators identified earlier on in the process. In a digital mapping process, the priority lands for restoration are identified and mapped in six steps, as outlined in Table 15. In the Mexico assessment, for example, the team used seven main digital datasets, as well as stakeholder input, to develop the prioritization system (see Box 6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb7b9513-acc5-48ec-be9e-5ba733fe3964": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb7b9513-acc5-48ec-be9e-5ba733fe3964", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "134484564c6b71b121b7295caf0c5017c1863d75eec18dc9ea9d0c38f884ef80"}, "2": {"node_id": "0686cb65-e544-41e9-b4bd-6a7c930a9ac5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a91815e229243a6274d7c3a6d82056eb24fcb4cb9cd36578cc1dbcdfe9e687c"}}, "hash": "4c4cda124c3a230141ec333b6edcbfb2d803b954d2b02a1b7cc2ab7e590afbec", "text": "Table 16 shows an extract of the reclassification and weighting systems applied in the Mexico assessment, while Figure 14 illustrates how a few of the different datasets in the Mexico assessment provided layers of information for the final prioritization.

In addition to a map of restoration opportunities, other outputs can be produced to show the results of a digital mapping analysis in the form of pie charts, bar charts, data tables, etc. Figure 13.

Apply algorithms for identifying specific restoration opportu- nities by intervention type Set the scope for the collection and analysis of spatial data. Select which data sets are relevant, given the restoration options being considered. Obtain datasets corresponding to the agreed assessment criteria. Create a classification system to eliminate lands of lowest priority for restoration and classify remaining lands as high, medium and low priority. Arrive at a final map based on all the differ- ent layers of data. Assess the potential scope and area of different restoration interventions An iterative process of identifying and refining a set of potential restoration options. A list of the required data sets is drawn up and the availability of these data is verified. GIS maps and associated metadata are sourced. Each dataset is reclassified to reflect priority for resto- ration. Data are assigned to high, medium and low priority categories (ac- cording to the assessment criteria) and a points sys- tem applied. A weighting system can also be applied to give more importance to particular criteria. The assessment scores from each dataset are combined for each point on the map. A system will need to be developed to assign these scores to the final priority categories. Additional data layers can be added to the map by extracting information from other documents and databases. In the Mexico case, these additional lay- ers included the location of all Protected Areas in the country, the location of zones of high biodiversity, and dominant patterns of land tenure. The assessment involves devising algorithms or rules about where in the landscape certain interven- tions would be the most appropriate and then using the existing combined spa- tial data sets to produce area estimates and identify key geographic locations. See pages 33 to 41 and 61 to 63 for guidance on identifying and refin- ing potential restora- tion options. See Table 6 for the digital data sets se- lected for the Mexico assessment. See page 65 for more guidance on sourcing relevant data and maps. See Table 16 for examples of how two datasets were reclassified and a weighting system applied in the Mexico assessment. Figure 14 illustrates how three of the datasets in the Mexico assessment helped provide prioritization information for the final map. Figure 22 illustrates this for one area of Rwanda.

A national-level digital mapping: example from Mexico The Mexico assessment essentially consisted of applying and combining an agreed set of environmental, economic and social criteria (each weighted according to their importance) to construct a geographic model capable of identifying priority areas for forest restoration. There is a wealth of data available in Mexico and the following thematic data layers were used in the assessment: \u2022 Forestry zoning (scale 1:250,000): lands suitable for forestry but currently under different land use or undergoing degradation (from fire, pests, etc.); erosion risk also indicated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abb7e1e0-8606-4345-9a80-d636fe919ce5": {"__data__": {"id_": "abb7e1e0-8606-4345-9a80-d636fe919ce5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8940a9976e04716e3473ca1211526213f08916179e740052ea46f4ecb2f105f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "52dde53b-8372-4875-aed3-e0e97174bdde", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f01718aaf18a23586f4b3a1439559a2072e43e3db2dda36e5f484d6b051b24cb"}}, "hash": "eff32f9d94775ad95d40a17639f623781dbeba1355aec273d2231419c72a6b6e", "text": "); erosion risk also indicated. \u2022 Economic pressure index (scale 1:250,000): risk of deforestation, based on socio- economic data. \u2022 Potential land use (scale 1:100,000): economic potential of lands suitable for forestry. \u2022 Edaphology (scale 1:250,000): morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of soils, including any limiting factors for land use. \u2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ddaa419-e0e8-459a-a2a8-a5fed4d6da1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ddaa419-e0e8-459a-a2a8-a5fed4d6da1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec1a7d993c4734ee6d313d41e5f1bb0305b533acd1f2e6bd54366d0dcc092316"}, "3": {"node_id": "0a7dd68e-df9d-4c6a-9bee-3e6224f21426", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1130a50d6179711ea950e2a2ad647504c68c149ba3c20a20866ecdb49daa0d4"}}, "hash": "e72cde2c36b89aa071e9a41a6e94707bd9f58adf514b6b08f02a98afac56ed75", "text": "State of vegetation conservation (scale 1:250,000): classification of vegetation according to level of conservation or transformation. \u2022 Resilience to fire (scale 1:250,000): combination of fire risk and capacity of vegetation to recover from fire. \u2022 Threats and opportunities for the conservation and sustainable management of mesophyll mountain forest: areas that present threats for the conservation of, or opportunities for the management of, mountain mesophyll forest. Alongside this digital mapping approach, the assessment was a participatory one throughout. A multi-stakeholder workshop was held prior to the analysis to identify the agreed set of criteria and their weighting. The 48 participants at this workshop represented 13 different organizations, including government agencies, academic institutions and civil society groups. A follow-up workshop was held to present the findings, review the criteria used and start planning for a national FLR strategy for Mexico. The assessment results indicated that Mexico has an estimated potential area of over 300,000 km2 suitable for forest landscape restoration. The assessment model also indicated that, of this surface, almost nine per cent could be considered high priority, 17 per cent medium priority and 74 per cent low priority. In total, this represents about 13 per cent of Mexico\u2019s entire land area. The assessment has not only provided outputs that have been used directly for high-level decision-making in the forest sector, but has also played an important role in bringing together the different national institutions working on forestry and restoration, creating a promising inter-institutional platform for the planning and implementation of joint restoration strategies.

Computing the marginal value of restoration interventions Crop Production $1000 Direct cost to farmers $500 Indirect cost to society $700 Underlying concepts The ROAM approach to analysing costs and benefits aims to identify how much additional benefit would be expected from a restoration intervention and how much additional cost would be incurred by putting this intervention in place. This type of approach, known as marginal analysis, avoids the need to try to account for all the values in a landscape and all the investments made to sustain those values. Figure 16 illustrates how a marginal analysis can be used in the restoration decision- making process. The baseline land use in this example (degraded agriculture) generates US$ 1000 a year in value from crop yields at a cost to the farmer of US$ 500 (for seeds, fertilizer, etc.) and an additional cost to society of US$ 700, which is the lost value resulting from soil erosion, or habitat made unsuitable for biodiversity, and other external effects. So under baseline land use of \u201cdegraded agriculture\u201d the total value is -US$ 200. Restoring the degraded agricultural land with agroforestry, meanwhile, would prevent US$ 100 of erosion damages while producing US$ 500 worth of sequestered carbon and marketable timber and US$ 900 in crop yields (slightly less than before) at a cost to the farmer of US$ 500. In total then, agroforestry would produce US$ 1000 in benefits (net of costs). This constitutes a US$ 1200 dollar change in the value of services when we restore to agroforestry lands from a degraded agricultural state. Alternatively, degraded agricultural land could be transformed into secondary forest, which would prevent US $200 of erosion damages, sequester US$ 500 worth of carbon, and produce US$ 700 of non-forest timber products (NFTPs) for a cost of US$ 700. The analysis results from this type of framework can be used to identify landscapes that meet strategic local and national priorities. Even when ecological goals are prioritized over economic ones, the framework will still be able to identify landscapes that produce the desired ecological outcomes for the least cost.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35cee1e4-fecd-41c5-bfa1-cf2683d9b1e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "35cee1e4-fecd-41c5-bfa1-cf2683d9b1e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55ec323015344641b1fbbc56bf69b53bb1ccb11e1de1f2ffc5f36ac5124aadd6"}, "2": {"node_id": "df996e01-1a6b-4fc5-aa2e-995a3f0fd007", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5175b5707bb075b939cdf071c30040eca43a212f1428e8d809dc0aeb16431c9"}}, "hash": "4c0f47114fb76d9bcd4fa9668ec0b136504486d36961f9df4b26950c26b4b455", "text": "It is clear that the benefits considered in this analysis should not be limited to financial benefits, but include other factors such as carbon sequestration benefits, biodiversity benefits, and benefits to farmers or landowners, such as improved food production and availability and improved water supply.

On the basis of this it is often possible to complete the reference table (as illustrated in Table 17).

See how sensitive the cost-benefit results are to changes in key variables such as prices, interest rates, and biological assumptions. The revenue streams and non-monetary benefits of restoration depend on inherently random ecological parameters, including precipitation and tree growth rates. However, the uncertainty over which values these parameters will take introduces an element of risk into the analysis. In order to take account of this uncertainty a repeated random sampling technique, known as Monte Carlo simulations, can be used. A Monte Carlo simulation creates data by drawing values from the distribution of a given variable instead of assuming a single average value that does not take into account the range that might be observed in the field. Since ecological outcomes such as tree growth determine the profitability of each restoration transition the Monte Carlo method can be used to generate data representing a range of outcomes one might expect on different land uses. Crop yields Timber revenue Other development Site selection Compensation Management Planning Land purchase Infrastructure Monotoring On-going management Compensation Maintenance Transaction Costs Opportunity Costs Implementation Costs Figure 17. Costs of landscape restoration While restoration decisions can be based on a wide variety of criteria, including ecological priorities and restoration costs, an integrated approach that accounts for both the costs and benefits of restoration provides decision-makers with more actionable information. Assessing the costs and benefits is useful for prioritizing investments in restoration across a variety of criteria including net present value (NPV), return on investment (ROI) and multi-criteria decision-making. This information is useful for policy-makers, restoration professionals and natural resource managers who are interested in understanding more about the economic opportunities and trade-offs of restoring deforested and degraded landscapes. Given the amount of degraded land across the world, the ability to identify the most beneficial landscapes to restore is an important objective. The results of this economic analysis component will be important inputs for the evaluation of feasible restoration options and will inform any strategic planning processes that follow from the assessment. In addition, they will enable further analyses such as the cost-benefit-carbon modelling (described below) and complement the information provided by the analysis of finance options, as outlined later in this chapter. Naturally, the economic analysis results will need to be considered alongside the findings of these other analyses as the success of the potential restoration interventions will depend not only on the range and size of the benefits they offer, but also on for example the legal, institutional and policy arrangements in place (such as land-use policies, land tenure, forest-product markets, etc.). Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 90 91 Restoration cost-benefit-carbon modelling While the valuation of restoration costs and benefits may have included some consideration of carbon benefits, it is useful to conduct a more thorough analysis of the potential carbon benefits to be achieved through different restoration interventions. The following guidance describes the techniques available and illustrates the kinds of outputs which an analysis can provide. The assessment team will need to select which element(s) are most appropriate, given the specific focus of the assessment and the kinds of data available. Estimation methods Carbon sequestration values can be calculated for each FLR intervention using the recommended methods of the IPCC Good Practice Guidelines (IPCC, 2003). The IPCC offers three types of methods for calculating carbon sequestration. The basic method (known as a \u2018Tier 1\u2019 method) tracks changes in carbon stored in biomass, based on default values. This method is quite straightforward and requires relatively little information. The more sophisticated methods (Tier 2 and Tier 3) are more complicated but produce more accurate results; they are appropriate when the scale of analysis is smaller or when more accurate figures are needed. For most national-level analysis of the carbon sequestration potential of restoration, the Tier 1 method will be sufficient. Guidance on using the Tier 1 method is provided in Appendix 1. Using and reporting the estimates of carbon benefits Once the carbon sequestration values have been calculated for different types of FLR interventions, the assessment team can use these values in their analyses and reporting. For example, Figure 18 shows how much carbon could be sequestered in Ghana with each type of restoration intervention. The values were calculated by first estimating how much carbon would be captured by each restoration intervention at the hectare level and then multiplying that value by the land area that could be restored by each intervention, as derived from the spatial analysis.

Conducting cost-benefit-carbon modelling The greenhouse gas abatement cost curve was first published by McKinsey (2007) with a view to helping decision-makers understand, at a glance, how different climate mitigation actions ranked against each other in terms of mitigation potential (i.e. how much carbon emissions could be avoided) and what the average cost per ton of CO2 stored or sequestered might be. In doing so, the abatement curve acts as a quantitative basis for discussions about what bundle of actions would be most effective in delivering the required emissions reduction to avoid dangerous climate change. The McKinsey analysis provided quantitative confirmation that land-use activities (forestry and agriculture) constituted actions that, in theory at least, represented large gains for relatively modest investments. The presentation of the analysis from the Ghana ROAM application borrowed the McKinsey idea of an abatement curve and adapted it to rank the proposed restoration interventions against their mitigation potential at the national level and the net value of anticipated additional benefits per ton of CO2 sequestered. In other words, rather than looking at costs, the analysis aimed to tease out the so-called co-benefits that FLR actions should deliver. We call this analysis cost-benefit-carbon modelling. It is important to highlight that, like McKinsey\u2019s abatement curve, the cost-benefit- carbon modelling needs to be used with caution. It does not, for example, address the fact that with each additional hectare treated under a particular restoration intervention there may be a diminishing marginal return as the cost of moving to the next degraded hectare becomes marginally more expensive and the benefits received become marginally less profitable. It should also not be interpreted as identifying the single best option. As McKinsey note for their abatement curve, it only serves as the basis of discussions about the right mix of interventions.

Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 94 95 Restoration diagnostic of presence of key success factors This component involves a preliminary assessment of the extent to which key success factors are in place in the country to facilitate restoration at scale. These factors include: (1) the motivations of key actors; (2) the enabling conditions in the country; and (3) the capacity and resources for implementation. In particular the analysis examines how a country\u2019s policy, legal, market and institutional arrangements can help or hinder the development and implementation of restoration activities. The analysis can also look at the extent to which the ecological and social conditions in the assessment area are conducive to scaling up restoration efforts. Again, this can be as simple or sophisticated an analysis as the situation warrants and resources permit. It is however a critical and often overlooked aspect of laying the groundwork for improvements in sustainable land management (including restoration) generally. The results of this analytical component can then feed into more detailed consideration of these issues with a wider set of stakeholders, once all the assessment results have been compiled (see page 109). A tool for looking at a wide range of \u2018key success factors\u2019 issues is currently being developed. This diagnostic tool helps identify which key success factors for forest landscape restoration are already in place and which are missing within a country or landscape being considered for restoration. Those that are missing are the most likely relevant barriers to successful restoration. When applied prior to launching a restoration effort, the tool can help decision-makers and restoration stakeholders focus their efforts on getting the missing key success factors in place \u2013 before large amounts of human, financial, or political capital have been invested. When applied periodically over time as a landscape is being restored, the tool can help decision-makers and implementers sustain restoration progress through adaptive management. The tool, which is based on lessons learnt from over twenty forest landscape restoration \u2018case examples\u2019 around the world, classifies the key success factors into three themes: 1. A clear motivation. Decision-makers, landowners, and/or citizens need to be aware of the need for forest landscape restoration and inspired or motivated to support it. This means that the case for restoration must be presented in their terms and speak to their priorities. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebe59941-fb06-4b2f-a597-b7e7313272c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebe59941-fb06-4b2f-a597-b7e7313272c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56d7d8fab6ca33e007278bd116d2355d714aad1409fe273c587472743ff18824"}, "2": {"node_id": "00e75597-435d-4ee7-8d8a-9664c708507f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0025bcba14d7167988bcae96d66e7033aeb79d7c491e35079f55056c9b2342c9"}}, "hash": "99f8220993268073256db030af57bbb9232a76662d491f461638fcbee0b74b2a", "text": "2.

Diagnosing the key success factors Step 1 involves defining the boundaries of the diagnosis, to avoid unnecessary research and produce actionable results. This step might include, for example, defining the geographic scope of the landscape to which the diagnostic tool will be applied (i.e. the \u2018candidate landscape\u2019) and considering the potential timeframe and goals of the restoration of this landscape. The core of the tool, Step 2, involves an evaluation of each key success factor, guided by a series of questions relating to these factors, in order to determine whether these factors are fully in place, only partly in place, or missing. For example, the policy- related enabling conditions are explored by examining issues such as: Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 96 In place Partly in place Not in place \u2022 Whether land managers and land users have clear and secure (formal or customary) rights to the benefits that would accrue from restoration (e.g. land tenure, natural resource rights). \u2022 Whether clear and enforceable regulations on land-use change (including clearing remaining natural forests) exist. Note, this is a particularly challenging factor. If land- use change regulations are too lax, restoration may become a zero sum game \u2013 in as much as gains made one year can be easily cancelled out the next, or high- quality multifunctional forest can be replaced by single-species stands. However, if land-use change regulations are too rigid or draconian, this can also act as a major obstacle to encouraging land owners to invest in restoration activities. For example in several Latin American countries where conversion of forest land to non-forest uses is prohibited, farmers continue to treat low-grade, unproductive pasture land with arboricides in order to prevent the establishment of secondary forest. \u2022 Whether regulations that require forest restoration or that clearly regulate the conversion of natural forest are adequately enforced. Table 21 shows the results of Step 2 of the tool applied in the Rwanda assessment. The third step of the tool is to identify strategies that address the missing key success factors \u2013 those deemed \u201cnot in place\u201d or only \u201cpartly in place\u201d \u2013 and that ensure that those that are already in place remain so. During this step, users brainstorm, propose, and record a portfolio of policies, incentives, practices, techniques, and/or other interventions. The purpose is to identify strategies that maximize the likelihood that forest landscape restoration at scale will be successful. See pages 111 and 115 for example outputs of this step, from the Rwanda assessment.

One output of the diagnostic of key success factors in the Rwanda assessment Theme Enabling condition Key success factor Current status Road-Test Edition 98 99 Restoration finance and resourcing analysis This component involves the identification and analysis of the types of finance and resourcing options available to support national FLR strategies or programmes and, more precisely, which types of funding options would be most suitable and feasible for the different types of restoration interventions emerging from the assessment. The main categories of finance mechanisms for FLR include: \u2022 Private for-profit: restoration that produces marketable goods and services can attract private sector financing; \u2022 Private not-for-profit: including local communities, international foundations and NGOs; \u2022 Financial incentives paid for the delivery of ecosystem services: this could include market-based Payment for Environmental Services (PES) though up to now these types of financial transfers have more typically relied on public sector resourcing; \u2022 Public sector expenditure: increasing expenditures on forestry activities, removing harmful subsidies and discouraging degrading land-use practices; \u2022 Multilateral and bilateral donor funds: FLR is becoming increasingly popular amongst policy-makers and heads of international development agencies; and \u2022 Transfer of FLR support services from public to private sector: for example, nursery production. In general, the more a restoration intervention will benefit individuals, the more opportunities there will be for attracting private finance, and the more an intervention provides broader societal benefits, the better the chances are for attracting public sector finance mechanisms (as illustrated in Figure 20). When considering how to fund landscape restoration, it is important to distinguish between: (1) the source of the money; (2) the mechanism of the funding and the terms by which the money is allocated to those involved in implementing the restoration strategy (e.g. land managers); (3) the channels through which the money physically reaches those implementing the restoration strategy; and (4) the benefits that the restored landscape generates or the markets it serves (see Figure 21). A single source might be able to provide money through one or more mechanism and channel. It is often the case that the market viability, or lack thereof, will determine the most appropriate financing mechanism. For instance, non-marketable services are typically not well-suited for loans since the service does not generate a tangible revenue stream that can pay back the loan. Figure 20. Public/private financing options for FLR Value of farmer benefits Benefits to society LOW HIGH HIGH Public resource mobilization Private resource mobilization When identifying finance options for different types of restoration intervention, consider who the likely beneficiaries would be and what capacity they have of contributing either financially or in kind (e.g. providing labour or growing seedlings).

Channels Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 100 101 Evaluation of potential for private investments in restoration It is worth looking in some more detail at how to evaluate the potential for private investments in restoration, since these investments represent a new and growing pool of funds for supporting developing countries\u2019 goals of restoring landscapes and improving livelihoods. The assessment team can evaluate the potential for private investments in FLR in the assessment country on a number of different levels. At its most basic, the evaluation could consist of brainstorming sessions among the assessment team and key informants from the private sector while more in-depth evaluations could take the form of discussion sessions during the analytical workshop(s), secondary research on the investment climate in the assessment country and consultations with financial experts. A comprehensive evaluation could examine: 1. the role and entry point for additional private sector investment; 2. the extent to which barriers to private investment exist in the country and how they might be addressed in order to promote such investment opportunities; 3. the investment potential of the restoration interventions emerging from the assessment so far; and 4. sources of funds and risk mitigation instruments available for restoration in the country. Guidance on the first two elements is provided below (more details on this evaluation process can be found in Durschinger et al, in press). The outcomes of such an evaluation can then be further discussed during the validation workshop(s) (see pages 111 to 113) with a view to drawing up a roadmap for constructing investment packages to address the barriers identified and recommendations for mobilizing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe9b25d4-6c61-4ac1-b49e-787d0d783450": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe9b25d4-6c61-4ac1-b49e-787d0d783450", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48c04ce24026d10d6414cee26ebca83aa42e113ee870eb58631c104ff983359f"}}, "hash": "48c04ce24026d10d6414cee26ebca83aa42e113ee870eb58631c104ff983359f", "text": "investment capital. Evaluating the scope for new private sector investment Private sector financing is usually thought of in terms of either direct investment in landscape restoration (e.g. acquiring land to plant trees or contracting farmers to grow trees) or in the creation of specific supply chains that stimulate the incentive for certain products (e.g. a milk processing plant that stimulates local dairy markets that require the production of woody legumes through agroforestry). Using the spatial, economic and carbon analyses, and building on advice from key informants, it should be possible to identify potential opportunities (backed up by facts and figures) that would be worth investigating further. For example, Ghana has large tracts of very degraded, publicly- managed forest land that will be difficult to recover using improved silviculture and natural regeneration. The Ghanaian government is actively exploring the possibility for some of this land to be used to attract private sector investments in commercial plantations. On the other hand, Rwanda has many small farms on relatively steep slopes; the country also has a progressive scheme to ensure that poor families have at least one cow per household and livestock managed under these circumstances needs a supply of on-farm woody legumes. There may be a possibility that centralized milk processing units could incentivize milk production on these small farms which in turn would see the growth of on-farm fodder trees and the establishment of fodder banks across the landscape. In addition to looking at direct investments and stimulating supply chains, this scoping step should also consider whether there are functions which support FLR that are now fulfilled by government support but which might be more efficiently and effectively delivered by private sector interests. For example, seedling production in several countries tends to be managed by government-run nurseries. These nurseries are often under-resourced and produce a very limited selection of planting stock. Attracting the private sector to take on such a function could result in more capital investment in this sector and production prices driven down. New technologies and production techniques could expand the range of species on offer and government savings could then be directed at acquiring high-quality seedlings for national planting programmes, communities and small farmers. Evaluating barriers to private investment in restoration Successfully attracting private investment in FLR will require overcoming a number of barriers that are inherent in funding these activities, including the fact that some restoration activities may never be commercially viable. These activities should be identified and either funded with public money or where possible be integrated into other investment-worthy opportunities even at the risk of diluting returns. Investors cite a number of barriers to investing in developing country agricultural, agroforestry and forestry. Table 22 presents a non-exhaustive list of these barriers, all of which are potentially relevant to FLR. The challenges represented by these barriers are further compounded by the fact that candidate landscapes for restoration are generally managed primarily by small-holders. Being aware of these barriers and designing strategies to overcome them is imperative because most investors will not have the time or patience to wait until investment opportunities can meet standard requirements of commercial viability. They may however be willing to make smaller-than-typical investments, when there is a clear path to scalability. While some of these barriers can be overcome by applying technical financial expertise and involving local commercially-oriented restoration initiatives, other barriers are harder to address and could take significant time and investment on the part of governments to overcome. Table 23 summarizes the results of an evaluation of Rwanda\u2019s investment barriers, relative to other countries in the region that would compete for investment capital. Evaluating private investment potential of restoration options The assessment team can look at the list of top priority restoration options identified so far and consider the investment potential of each, using the following set of questions: \u2022 Is there established demand and a competitive advantage for the revenue- generating activities (cash crops, value-added, domestic growth crop)? Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 102 103 \u2022 Can the activity expand the trees on the landscape? \u2022 Does the downstream value chain support growth? \u2022 Is there evidence of commercial viability somewhere in the value chain and does it provide a return profile? \u2022 Are activities biophysically appropriate for the landscape/ecosystem? \u2022 Are there positive social implications (improved livelihoods, food security)? The more these questions can be answered positively, the more likely it is that the restoration intervention will be able to attract private investment for restoration.

Table 23. Results of an evaluation of Rwanda\u2019s barriers to private investment in restoration Investment opportunities Supply chain connectivity1 Infrastructure Land rights Adoption effectiveness2 Regulatory and political risk Macro economics Capital markets \u2022 Rwanda is a small country and setting up local operations/ partners and gaining local knowledge may not yield a large enough investment opportunity given the size of the country. \u2022 Landholdings are very small, making gaining scale for a given investment and the need for aggregation a challenge. \u2022 Limited information shows that Rwanda has comparatively fewer supply chain challenges for staple crops. \u2022 While landlocked, Rwanda\u2019s transport times and costs compare favourably with many of its neighbours. \u2022 Between Mombasa-Kigali is the second-shortest import/export time in the region. \u2022 Within Rwanda there are a few key highways running primarily north-south in the centre of the country and these are primarily paved. \u2022 Only 9.4% of the population has access to electricity, which is the 3rd lowest of it 6 neighbouring countries. \u2022 Land rights are clear and major investments are in place for a cadastral system with millions of land holders recorded. \u2022 Adoption of marketable high-value fruits, medicine and timber has been found in Rwanda highlands. \u2022 Contract farming is having some success, which supports aggregation, providing rural finance for certain high value and export crops. \u2022 Rwanda\u2019s \u201cDoing Business Rank\u201d for 2014 was 32, up from 54 last year and well ahead of the average for Sub-Saharan Africa of 142. \u2022 Based on the Worldwide Governance Indicator, Rwanda has the best ranking over the past 5 years across all 6 indicators when compared to its neighbouring countries. \u2022 Perception of civil unrest risk, may prevail with investors from prior historical events. \u2022 Rwanda is listed as one of the World\u2019s top 10 fastest growing economies in 2013. \u2022 Rwanda is active in capital markets, with Eurobond issuance and an OTC market that was launched in 2008. \u2022 The size of the OTC market relative small at 2.2% of GDP. Barrier Rationale Assessment score Table 22. Some potential barriers to private investment in restoration in developing countries Investment opportunities Supply chain connectivity Infrastructure Land rights Adoption effectiveness Regulatory and political risk Macro economics Capital markets A lack of sufficient profitable opportunities in which to invest (returns, breakeven years, scale of a specific investment and scale across the country as a whole). Disconnected supply chains (which may be an opportunity or a cost inefficiency). Insufficient \u2018hard\u2019 infrastructure (such as roads and other transportation networks, power, and irrigation systems) and \u2018soft\u2019 infrastructure (such as customs procedures or govern- ment cooperation). Undefined land and water rights that are needed to incentiv- ize land owners to promote investments in enhancing land productivity. Low adoption due to inadequate human capital. Heavy regulation and excessive red tape undermine invest- ment by increasing costs and delays for investors and result in higher corruption levels among public officials, as shown by the World Bank\u2019s \u2018Doing Business\u2019 reports. A lack of supportive macro-economic environment, in which inflation is contained and exchange rates are stable. Underdeveloped capital markets, limiting investors\u2019 exit op- tions for equity-type investments. Barrier Description 104 105 By this stage, the ROAM process has gone through several iterations of data collection and spatial and non-spatial analyses and has generated an overall picture of the opportunities for forest landscape restoration at the national (or sub-national) level. The results obtained are based on the best data the assessment team could access and the best local insights and expertise they could draw on. Nonetheless, the outputs are still of a preliminary nature and remain largely untested. Furthermore, for the assessment to be more than just an academic exercise, i.e. if it is to generate realistic recommendations and lead to concrete follow-up actions, it needs to be presented and discussed with a wider set of stakeholders and experts than have been involved in the work thus far. This final phase of ROAM therefore plays a critical part in ensuring its credibility and impact. The specific aims for this phase of the assessment are to: \u2022 Test the validity and relevance of the assessment results; \u2022 Analyse further the policy and institutional implications of the results; \u2022 Build support for the assessment results among decision-makers; and \u2022 Draft policy and institutional recommendations and plan for next steps. While key decision-makers should have been kept abreast of developments from the outset, it is now particularly important that they are involved in this phase in order to strengthen their ownership of the assessment results and help set the stage for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13f53fd2-3d08-496b-8282-d4b9ac34e191": {"__data__": {"id_": "13f53fd2-3d08-496b-8282-d4b9ac34e191", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "099cfa79cd2a68c089334fe3c37c734f150ed8c7b47d660fbaa303b8e818d36a"}}, "hash": "099cfa79cd2a68c089334fe3c37c734f150ed8c7b47d660fbaa303b8e818d36a", "text": "policy uptake of the recommendations that emerge. In Ghana, for example, the assessment team needed to be very proactive in ensuring that the key people in government were kept apprised of the process at all times and engaged in validating the outcomes; this proved instrumental in achieving the high level of follow-up and interest in the assessment results and recommendations (as outlined in Box 2 on page 28). This final phase needs to be targeted and managed towards tangible inclusion of the assessment results in the implementation of national policy priorities. The ultimate indicator of a successful assessment will be that the key actors move forward with preparing policies, programmes or strategies on FLR that complement and help deliver national priorities on economic development, natural resource use, food, water and energy security, climate change mitigation, etc. Phase 3: Results to recommendations Road-Test Edition 106 107 Organizing the validation workshop In practical terms, this phase will require that senior-level departmental staff, leading national experts and other important stakeholders (e.g. local farmers\u2019 union, chamber of commerce, indigenous peoples\u2019 or community-based federations) are brought together to critically assess the key conclusions and recommendations. This tends to be most efficiently done through one validation workshop in the capital city. This validation workshop is of a rather different nature to the preceding district or thematic analytical workshops. A lot less time should be spent on methodological and process issues and much more focus should be given to assessing whether the overarching conclusions and recommendations make technical, political and institutional sense \u2013 in other words to validate whether these proposed ways forward are feasible in the prevailing national circumstances. The workshop outcomes should either allow the assessment team to move forward with final documentation and reporting or highlight specific elements of the spatial and non-spatial analyses that need to be repeated using either redefined assumptions or additional data. The validation workshop will most likely need to cover the following elements: \u2022 A brief description of the key assessment parameters, specifically the final assessment criteria, the main restoration interventions, the main data sources and the main underlying assumptions; \u2022 Presentation of assessment process so far; \u2022 Reporting and validation of the main conclusions from the spatial analyses and the economic and cost-benefit-carbon modelling; \u2022 Discussion on policy implications and policy and institutional \u2018readiness\u2019 for a national FLR strategy/programme; \u2022 Identification of gaps in the \u2018restoration readiness\u2019 and recommendations to address these; \u2022 Stock-take of whether the assessment recommendations adequately address national priorities and commitments; and \u2022 Discussion on next steps. Prior to holding the validation workshop, it will be important for the assessment team to prepare the results in a clear and compelling way \u2013 and in formats appropriate for facilitating discussions with the participants. This is important because it helps to build understanding and also because some stakeholders may request to use the results right away. The team should be careful not to overload the workshop discussions with too many detailed findings, but rather present the headline results, the top priority restoration interventions identified and the major implications of these interventions. The process should also allow workshop participants to challenge the assumptions of the assessment. The assessment team might consider producing alternative sets of results under different assumptions and then collecting feedback on the most appropriate scenario, during the validation workshop. This feedback process improves the output of the assessment and should reduce the number of areas open to criticism. In selecting participants to invite to the workshop, the team should aim to include: \u2022 Senior technical and policy staff from key land-use ministries; \u2022 Similar level staff from finance and economic planning ministries; \u2022 Potentially staff from the head of government\u2019s office; \u2022 Representatives of associations of key primary stakeholders, such as: o Chambers of commerce; o Farmers\u2019 associations; and o Indigenous peoples\u2019 associations; \u2022 Civil society organizations; \u2022 NGOs: o Key private sector representatives; and o Bilateral donor representatives. Table 24 shows some of the main discussion points that should be addressed in the validation workshop. In addition to raising these specific questions, the assessment team should encourage the participants to: \u2022 Raise any concerns about confusing, contradictory or unclear results \u2013 and request clarification; \u2022 Identify any other pieces of work that may be relevant to the assessment; and \u2022 Request tangible refinements to existing analyses.

Elements of assessment Questions/topics to discuss Before finalizing recommendations (see pages 113 to 117) there are two additional pieces of work that the team may wish to pursue. These may not be considered absolutely necessary at this stage but if time and resources permit they can contribute additional insights that can further strengthen the final recommendations. These are: \u2022 Testing the perceived relevance of strategic institutional and policy options with local-level government; and \u2022 Identifying finance options for implementing the restoration opportunities. Both of these analyses could be run concurrently with other analytical work during Phase 2 but as the scope and content of these two pieces of work depend strongly on the other analyses as well as the conclusions from the validation process, it is advisable to schedule these two concluding analyses just before the final recommendations are prepared. Testing the perceived relevance of strategic institutional and policy options with local-level government While some district-level staff will have attended the validation workshop, it is unlikely that many will have had the opportunity to participate due to logistical constraints. Indeed, it may be more likely that district-level staff have been engaged more systematically through analytical workshops \u2013 particularly if these have been organized on a sub-national basis. This presents a dilemma, for district officials do not only have technical insights to share but they also operate at the point where centralized government programmes and policies have to be turned into on-the- ground implementation action. This means that local government staff tend to have a particularly pragmatic understanding of what types of policy and institutional interventions are more likely to work under current circumstances. Unfortunately this professional cadre is rarely given the opportunity to share their opinions and insights before final policy recommendations are formulated. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 110 111 Drawing on the validated diagnosis of key success factors present in the country, it is quite easy to come up with a brief survey of local government officials: take the key conclusions for improved policy and institutional measures that have emerged from the diagnostic, insert these in a table format and ask district officials to rank these in order of: \u2022 Priority (with 1 being the most essential measure they feel needs to be in place, 2 the second-most important measure, and so on); and \u2022 Ease of implementation (with 1 being the easiest to implement from a local- government perspective). Space can be provided in the survey form for local government staff to give further comments, although the real value of this exercise is the cumulative ranking of what local government officials consider to be the most important and feasible policy and institutional measures. While individuals do not need to identify themselves by name, it is useful to ask respondents to identify their region or district and the department in which they work. This allows for further analysis (if necessary) by geographic location and sector. The survey should be sent out electronically if possible. If district offices are not connected to the internet, the survey can be done during sub-national analytical workshops although the results will be less precise as the individual policy measures being assessed will not", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e73f0e16-89e8-46d1-87d9-6caa6af0707e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e73f0e16-89e8-46d1-87d9-6caa6af0707e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3e9a0fc4b6eb1d65232f4528556e54e7a8ff818172eec49955a14ac20a5c7ea"}}, "hash": "b3e9a0fc4b6eb1d65232f4528556e54e7a8ff818172eec49955a14ac20a5c7ea", "text": "have been subject to validation. Once the results come in, they can be collated on a simple spreadsheet. A cumulative ranking can be calculated by taking an average score and then ranking these 1, 2, 3, 4,\u2026n from the lowest value to the largest. However averaging non-parametric values has its risks so it is also advised to identify the most popular responses. Simply count how many times a policy or institutional measure has been ranked as one of the top five priorities by individual respondents and then rank the measures 1, 2, 3, 4,\u2026n with 1 corresponding to the most popular response. Armed with these two simple sets of analyses it should now be possible to ascertain what policy and institutional measures the district officials consider most important and which ones they see as the easiest to achieve. As this is not an exact science, there is no need to be precise. The assessment team may want to simplify the presentation further by converting the overall cumulative rank into a simple colour code as illustrated in Table 25, which shows the summary of survey results collected from over 75 district officials in Rwanda. This Table illustrates the value of this exercise particularly when comparing \u2018policy priorities\u2019 and \u2018ease of implementation\u2019. It highlights that not all priorities are necessarily difficult to achieve. In this case, three out of the five policy priorities were also judged to be relatively easy to deliver. In other words, these are potentially low-hanging \u2018policy and institutional\u2019 fruits \u2013 at least from a local-government perspective. Table 25.

However the assessment team may wish to test the validated results with local finance specialists, ideally from both the public and private sectors. A general set of strategies for attracting private investment in restoration is outlined in Table 26; the assessment team may wish to refer to this Table when compiling a list of recommended finance options to pursue. The preliminary set of recommended finance options drawn up in the Rwanda assessment is shown in Table 27. Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 112 113 Table 26. General recommendations for attracting private investment for restoration Recommendation 1. Identify investment-worthy practices and partners 2. Provide support for commercialization and making the business case 3. Identify and secure private investment 4. Maintaining investment worthiness and promoting scale Find the specific value chain (set of business) activities in a geographic region that are already being implemented at some scale and can deliver priority restoration activities and improve livelihoods but that have the potential to attract new sources of private investment. Provide support to potential investment opportunities to address some of the main barriers to attracting private investment which include: setting up of aggregation entities, execution of operational agreements between partners, development of financial projections for investment returns, developing operational and financing management expertise. For attracting investments from private equity funds, development finance institutions, regional/ international banks and institutional investors, it is necessary to use qualified financial specialists who can represent the investment opportunity, target the appropriate investors and structure/execute the transaction.

Could be financed through tourism revenues, carbon sales, carbon tax, or hydropower tax depending on situation. These options were proposed as potential finance sources for three of the priority FLR interventions in Rwanda. From recommendations to implementation Again, this is an area where experience is still emerging, so the guidance provided here is relatively brief. As ROAM applications increase and extend into implementation follow-up, further guidance will be developed and made available. By this stage of the process, the assessment team should have sufficient analysis, insights and opinions to pull together a coherent set of strategic recommendations. These inputs for the recommendations should include: \u2022 The potential area of land that could benefit from an FLR programme of work; \u2022 A shortlist of 5\u201312 key interventions most suited for implementing a national FLR programme, and the potential contribution each intervention could make in terms of area; \u2022 A national map showing the extent and approximate geographic location of specific potential FLR opportunities; \u2022 A robust cost and benefit analysis of each intervention type and a general idea of who the main beneficiaries are and how the costs would be distributed; \u2022 An estimation of the potential carbon sequestration value of implementing these interventions, an idea of how much carbon could be sequestered nationally by intervention type and an estimation of the value of so-called co-benefits that should accrue per ton of CO\u00b2 sequestered; and Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 114 115 Table 28. Strategic recommendations generated in the Rwanda assessment \u2022 Utilize the Joint Sector Working Group to coordinate government agencies and help them prioritize and promote implementation of landscape restoration activities. \u2022 Relevant authorities share and communicate those aspects in their Master Plans that are relevant to Forest Landscape Restoration with a particular emphasis on identifying immediate synergies. \u2022 Responsibility and mandate to promote, coordinate and provide technical guidance on agroforestry be assigned to one (existing) authority. \u2022 Build capacity of the Tree Seed Center to meet increasing demand for quantity, quality and diversity of seeds, especially for native species. \u2022 Stabilize and strengthen network of tree nurseries, in particular encourage increased investment by creating conditions that enable them to plan and operate on multiple - year time horizons. \u2022 Introduce target of at least 20% planting of native species, primarily with respect to protective forests and restoration of degraded areas of natural forests. \u2022 Improve existing district and sector level extension services by aligning performance targets of agriculture and forest staff with restoration goals. \u2022 Improve understanding among ministerial and district staff of how small-scale land- owners manage their woodlots with a view to identifying acceptable measures for improving production. \u2022 Launch a public awareness campaign to highlight the benefits of a diverse range of trees, especially native species. \u2022 A relatively comprehensive assessment of the country\u2019s restoration readiness (from the diagnostic of key success factors), with particular insights on how existing policy and institutional arrangements, legal processes and research and technical capacity can help or hinder successful landscape restoration. If there is time it should also be possible to analyse how these options are viewed and what priority they are given from the local government structures that will often be in charge of implementation.

If deemed desirable it should also be possible to illustrate how these various pieces of analysis come together in one landscape. Figure 22 illustrates how the Rwandan analysis was brought together to illustrate how a comprehensive restoration strategy might be applied in one landscape \u2013 Gishwati \u2013 which underwent severe deforestation and degradation, with forest cover declining from about 25,000 ha in the 1970s to only 600 ha in 2005, and is a key focus of the Rwandan government\u2019s plans for countrywide restoration (forest cover has already increased to about 1,500 ha). It is critical to point out that the only function of this type of map is to illustrate what might be possible. It should under no circumstances be used to assign actual project interventions on the ground. For that to happen, consultation, dialogue, information-exchange with, and ultimately consent from, local farmers and communities would be essential. Theme #1: Improve coordination among government agencies. Ensure that ministries work together, provide guidance to one another in their respective areas of expertise and identify ways to collaborate with the private sector and civil society. This includes district level engagement.. Theme #3: Stimulate demand for trees. Increase the use of trees, especially native species, on agricultural landscapes by supporting species that are most likely to benefit farmers. Theme #2: Stimulate supply of trees. Enhance the capacity of existing seed and nursery assets by increasing funding and creating positive incentives for long-term capital investment, particularly from the private sector. These recommendations produced from the Rwanda assessment address the most urgent \u2018gaps\u2019 in the enabling conditions (shown in Table 21). Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition 116 117 A ROAM process does not finish with the development of strategic recommendations. It is critical that the assessment report and results are not only disseminated to all those who participated at various stages of the work and any other key stakeholders in the country, but are also translated into briefings and presentations for senior-level decision-makers. Now that the validation workshops have put restoration opportunities on to the national agenda, the team needs to work closely with \u2018restoration champions\u2019 \u2013 i.e. influential stakeholders who have shown a high level of support for the assessment and who can help move forward the policy, legal and institutional changes recommended. These champions can also play a key role in feeding the assessment results into other national-level initiatives and processes. Indeed, having helped produce the analysis and recommendations, the assessment team \u2013 or the institution or agency within which the assessment team sits \u2013 needs to proactively push the restoration opportunities with other partner institutions. This should not be difficult if the assessment has been planned and properly located with existing national priorities (as discussed on page 31). It may even be that the next step is to take this type of analysis down to the next level and apply it as part of a consultative process to support the landscape-level design of national FLR pilots. To sum up then, this last phase will ideally conclude with the assessment team identifying entry points and strategic partners (individuals or organizations) to take forward the assessment results and recommendations. If at all possible, the team members should stay up-to-date with developments and keep in regular contact with the key actors, to support efforts to set in motion the next steps \u2013 whether these are on a policy, programme or project level.

Moving forward Undertaking a national assessment of restoration potential involves a significant step forward in providing solutions to national challenges through forest landscape restoration. Those taking part in such assessments will have contributed, not only to the identification of restoration opportunities, but also to the opening up of longer-term opportunities, such as new national options for meeting international commitments under the global conventions of CBD, UNFCCC and UNCCD. They may also have helped define or refine a national commitment to the Bonn Challenge goal to restore 150 million hectares globally by 2020. With continued momentum, these new opportunities can translate into restored productive and multifunctional landscapes across the country. For those contemplating or planning a national assessment, it is very useful to see how others have undertaken this task. So please consider sharing your experience and results with the global FLR community. The easiest way to do this is to join the Learning Network facilitated by the GPFLR, which connects partners and collaborators from around the world and allows new ideas and solutions to be freely exchanged. The Learning Network (at www.forestlandscaperestoration.ning.com) now has over 500 members and provides not only information and guidance but also a discussion platform for members to debate specific issues. Online learning modules \u2013 organized by IUCN and other GPFLR members \u2013 are also available. Membership of the Network is open to anyone interested in following or participating in FLR-related happenings. Finally, if you would like to obtain specific advice or information \u2013 such as documenta- tion on FLR templates and examples from ROAM applications (e.g. workshop agendas, spreadsheets, etc.), or news on upcoming global events where FLR will be presented and discussed \u2013 please visit www.iucn.org/forest or www.forestlandscaperestoration.org, or email gpflr@iucn.org.

Once the standing volume of biomass has been converted, the weight of carbon is estimated by assuming biomass is 49% carbon by dry weight. The total carbon sequestered per hectare is found by: C (tonnes)=(AGB+RBDM)*0.49 [3] Where 0.49 is the conversation factor for tons of dry matter to carbon (IPCC, 2003). The estimate could be converted to units of CO2e by multiplying it by 3.67, which is the ratio of the atomic mass of CO2e and C, respectively.

But today, we are depleting Earth\u2019s resources at rates that are not sustainable, endangering economies and people\u2019s lives. People depend on clean water, fertile land, healthy forests, and a stable climate. Livable cities and clean energy are essential for a sustainable planet. We must address these urgent, global challenges this decade. Our Vision We envision an equitable and prosperous planet driven by the wise management of natural resources. We aspire to create a world where the actions of government, business, and communities combine to eliminate poverty and sustain the natural environment for all people. Our Approach Count It We start with data. We conduct independent research and draw on the latest technology to develop new insights and recommendations. Our rigorous analysis identifies risks, unveils opportunities, and informs smart strategies. We focus our efforts on influential and emerging economies where the future of sustainability will be determined. Change It We use our research to influence government policies, business strategies, and civil society action. We test projects with communities, companies, and government agencies to build a strong evidence base. Then, we work with partners to deliver change on the ground that alleviates poverty and strengthens society. We hold ourselves accountable to ensure our outcomes will be bold and enduring. Scale It We don\u2019t think small. Once tested, we work with partners to adopt and expand our efforts regionally and globally. We engage with decision-makers to carry out our ideas and elevate our impact. We measure success through government and business actions that improve people\u2019s lives and sustain a healthy environment. www.wri.org", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fbd523f-7533-429f-86bb-1af2578f4b86": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fbd523f-7533-429f-86bb-1af2578f4b86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A guide to the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM)", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/guide-restoration-opportunities-assessment-methodology-roam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12d624a8dbbb9e9a7454c31b6aef874fe278c3a01df9622f654f3fba2470ec15"}}, "hash": "12d624a8dbbb9e9a7454c31b6aef874fe278c3a01df9622f654f3fba2470ec15", "text": "About the GPFLR The Global Partnership on Forest Landscape Restoration (GPFLR) is a worldwide network that unites restoration practitioners, policy-makers and supporters from government, international and non-governmental organizations, businesses and individuals with a common cause. The Partnership works from the grassroots level upward to increase awareness of the many benefits of restoration and share knowledge on best practices for restoration success. The GPFLR mobilizes expert support and increased capacity to implement forest landscape restoration. With the IUCN as its Secretariat, the GPFLR also builds support for restoration with decision-makers at both the local and international level, and influences legal, political and institutional frameworks to support forest landscape restoration. www.forestlandscaperestoration.org About the Bonn Challenge The Bonn Challenge is a global aspiration to restore 150 million hectares of the world\u2019s deforested and degraded lands by 2020. It was launched at a ministerial roundtable in Bonn, Germany, in September 2011. Numerous countries and organizations have made pledges to the Bonn Challenge or are in the process of preparing pledges \u2013 to date 20 million hectares of degraded lands have been pledged for restoration, with another 30 million being considered for additional pledges. The Bonn Challenge is not a new global commitment but rather a practical means of realizing existing international commitments, including the CBD Aichi Target 15, the UNFCCC REDD+ goal, and the Rio+20 land degradation neutral goal. www.bonnchallenge.org Road-Test Edition Road-Test Edition Are you working on land-use or conservation policies? Or landscape-level programmes? Perhaps you are involved in the forest, agriculture or energy sector? Are you interested in exploring the potential for restoration and carbon sequestration in your country? Maybe you have been asked to take part in an FLR assessment? Or maybe you are simply curious to learn more about what this is all about. This handbook presents the Restoration Opportunities Assessment Methodology (ROAM) and offers practical advice and options to bear in mind when considering or conducting an FLR assessment using ROAM, as well as real-life examples of the kinds of outputs you can expect. It will enable you to commission or design a tailor-made process to meet your specific needs \u2013 from a quick scoping exercise or a preliminary assessment using what scarce information is available to a full-blown assessment based on large quantities of spatial data. A ROAM application can help you answer questions such as \u201cwhat is the total extent of restoration opportunities in my country/ region?\u201d, \u201cwhere is restoration socially, economically and ecologically feasible?\u201d and \u201cwhat is the value of the benefits, including carbon, from the feasible restoration strategies?\u201d The results of such an assessment \u2013 maps and analyses, and a shared understanding among decision-makers, technicians and other key groups \u2013 can help build a strong foundation for the development of national restoration strategies and policies. The ultimate goal is to foster multi-stakeholder, cross-sector support for restoration and a common vision of how degraded and de- forested landscapes can be transformed into healthy and productive systems able to contribute to national development priorities.

Thus, this is an appropriate moment to examine lessons learned. This document was developed through a review of existing project learning and other documents. Some of these documents (i.e. in Sri Lanka) in- corporated learning and reflection by IUCN and partners. Unfortunately, there was not enough time or resources to engage in more in-depth re- flection with IUCN staff and partners on lessons, although this would have been extremely useful. This document is divided into three sections. The first examines learning on various aspects of natural resources governance. This is followed by a section focusing more specifically on project implementa- tion, planning and management lessons. Finally, we conclude with some suggestions on possible future niches for IUCN in the natural resources (NR) governance arena. We expect this document can contribute to strengthening the natural resource governance work of IUCN and partners and pro- vide valuable learning for DFID, GTF grantees and other institutions involved in governance. 1.1. A Governance Framework Based on Learning As part of this project, we reviewed the existing IUCN governance principles and literature on the topic. We also took into account reflections and learning from various sub projects. For example, the Bolivia/Peru project brought to the forefront the importance of cultural practices, reciprocity and spirituality in natural resource governance. With all these inputs we developed new framework of governance principles, which we view as a work in progress and guidance for those interested in natu- ral resource governance. A summarized version of this framework is presented in the table below. 2 Principle Elements of the Principle 1. Inclusion Participation and voice of all stakeholders. Respect and Trust between all stakeholders. 2. Legitimacy Integrity and commitment of all stakeholders. Authority and Representativity: The governing body and its members have legitimate, democratically mandated authority. Legitimacy: The governing body and/or its members have a long-standing cultural attachment to the area. The governing body follows its mandate. 3. Direction Strategic vision: Broad and long-term perspectives on good governance. Coherence and Contextualization: Integration into local contexts and compatibility with plans and policies of other levels and sectors. 4. Performance Responsiveness: Needs of all stakeholders are taken into account. Effectiveness and efficiency: Needs are met while making best use of resources available. Capacities: all stakeholders have capacities to engage in governance. Financial sustainability of processes and results. Subsidiarity: Power and decisions rest at the lowest level. Resilience: The governing body can be flexible, learn and adapt. 5. Accountability Accountability of all decision makers to the public. Transparency: Processes, institutions and information are clear and directly accessible. 6. Fairness Equity: Costs and benefits are equitably shared. Rule of law: Legal frameworks are fair and enforced impartially. Human rights and cultural practices are respected. Do no harm: Local livelihoods are not adversely affected. Effective and appropriate conflict resolution: There is recourse to impartial judgment in the case of conflict. Access to justice: Legal assistance is available to all stakeholders.

Lessons on Natural Resource Governance In general, we found that there tends to be confu- sion and misunderstanding with respect to mean- ings of governance and how to implement it in natural resource use contexts. Sub projects which invested in clarifying this and developing a com- mon approach (Asia region) tended to be more successful. This, in turn, contributed to having a more effective project design and implementation. Consequently, development of a common under- standing and definition of governance is a key step for implementation of natural resource governance projects to be more successful. In the following sub-sections we explore les- sons that have emerged in specific thematic ar- eas. At the end of this section, we have also included a sub section of best practices and suc- cess factors that have emerged from our project. 2.1.

It is important that MSPs involve real and effective participation that goes beyond limited processes of consultation and includes different stakeholders in decision-making. Participatory, gender and poverty tools can sup- port empowerment. Almost all sub projects had success utilizing various types of participatory meth- ods to empower local people, increase their voice and ensure that natural resource governance more effectively reflected their needs. In some cases, we have found that gender and poverty sensitive tools can be very effective for breaking down barriers. 2.2. Social and Gender Equity in Natural Resource Governance Sustainable natural resource use requires more democratic and equitable governance process- es. This is especially true in areas of high poverty such as those where our project was implemented. Without tangible livelihood benefits, governance can be abstract for local communities. Conse- quently, people lose interest in governance and it is hard to build trust. Greater democratization, including respect for human right, participation, and accountability, is another prerequisite for sus- tainable natural resource that benefits local people. In some cases, we have seen that women can be empowered through MSPs. In Bangladesh, 40% of MSP participants are women who are increasingly active participants. Before this project women had little representation in their communities and didn\u2019t leave their homes. Other sub projects were much less successful in empowering women. For example, in Lebanon participation targets for women in MSP pro- cesses and empowerment related activities were large- ly missed or only marginally met (Garstecki 2011). Natural resource governance can improve the lives of women. In Bangladesh, Bulu Rani Bi- shash a 40 year old woman, as a result of proj- ect support, now owns her own fish sanctuary and nursery, a high-tech water pump and wants to start a fruit orchard. In fact she is doing so well she has a substantial savings account and can now sustain both her and her son\u2019s family. Natural resource governance can be a mecha- nism to address sensitive political and social issues. In various countries, governance has proven to be a useful means to address sensitive 4 issues in contexts of socio-political conservatism and conflict. For example, it has been possible to address gender and ethnic equality in tradition- ally conservative societies (Syria, Bangladesh, and Lebanon). It has also provided an opportunity to bring together different actors who had historical- ly been entrenched in violent conflict (Sri Lanka). Governance processes can produce im- provements in livelihood and natural re- source use. In Bangladesh, fishing communi- ties have been able to utilize increased voice to bring about policy changes including increased access to and control over natural resources as well as increased income from government. 2.3. Rights and Culture in Natural Resource Governance Our project worked extensively with the Conserva- tion Initiative on Human Rights (CIHR) is made up of the 8 largest environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and is a unique platform in which these organizations explore ways to inte- grate and promote good of natural resources and protected areas (PAs) as well as rights based ap- proaches (RBAs). This initiative has the potential to be a powerful mechanism to scale up governance and rights based work in the field of conservation and sustainable management. Through reflection and learning, in its scoping paper on key issues at the intersection of conservation and human rights (Springer et al. 2011) CIHR has identified a step wise approach for rights based conservation, which can be a valuable tool for guiding action through- out the world. The key steps to this approach are: 1. Undertake a situation analysis 1.1. Identify actions, stakeholders and roles 1.2. Identify applicable legal rights, claims, and duties 1.3. Identify potential impacts of the proposed activity or project 1.4. Identify potential conflict resolution mecha- nisms 2. Provide information 2.1. Compile, publish and otherwise disseminate information in an understandable and easily accessible way 2.2. Disseminate general information regarding the action 2.3. Disseminate specific information regarding legal rights, claims and duties of potentially affected persons 3. Ensure participation 3.1. Undertake consultations 3.2. Seek and promote free, prior and informed consent 3.3. Provide and use conflict resolution mechanisms to secure rights 4. Take reasoned decisions 5.

Revival of traditional resource use systems may not always be effective. In Lebanon and Syria, IUCN and project partners sought to support the revival of himas.1 However, in Syria, a \u201cHima reviv- al\u201d was precluded by the overall political, legal and institutional framework. In Lebanon, our partner SPNL has had a limited number of positive expe- riences with Hima in recent years, but it is unclear whether such actions constitute a viable means for promoting community natural resource governance and use in the current context (Garstecki 2011). 2.4. Legal Frameworks and Institutional Structures for Better Governance To implement natural resource governance actions it is necessary to fully understand how rights, land tenure and resource use are defined in legisla- tion and policy. Across the countries where our project was implemented there are differences in 1 In the Arabian Peninsula, himas have existed for more than 1400 years. They are traditional resource use systems that in the past were widespread. In Arabic, the term means \u201cprotected place or area\u201d (see Kilani et al. 2007). 5 the way these principles and policy approaches are translated into legislation, particularly with respect to community rights. Among developing countries, Latin America tends to have the highest level of recognition of community land and political rights. Legal frameworks for land use and conserva- tion need to be respectfully designed to en- able governance. Many countries lack appropri- ate legal recognition for diverse forms of land use. Most legal frameworks do not adequately take into account different forms of protected area (PA) governance. Such measures are needed to ensure support for, rather than undermine, community in- stitutions and NR governance (Madzwamuse 2010). A combination of statutory and customary law can be an effective means of enabling natural resource governance. The Kenya sub project has worked to combine statutory mechanisms and tradi- tional pastoralist norms in rangeland planning and governance. To date this has proven to be an effec- tive means for ensuring equitable natural resources governance, because it enables participation in deci- sion making without marginalizing cultural practices. 2.5. Building Capacity for Better Natural Resource Governance All stakeholders involved in natural resource governance require some form of capacity build- ing and training, but the needs vary. Building civil society\u2019s capacity to effectively engage in and contribute to governance processes is fundamen- tally important. Community based and civil society organizations need to be able to develop alliances, participate in decision making and influence policy. However, these are capacities that they often lack or are weak. Capacity building needs to be both techni- cal and political. It is important to pay attention to political capacity because is many rural contexts the state is absent or unable to effectively fulfill its roles. Capacity building can be more effective when fo- cused on socially and economically marginalized groups, such as women and indigenous peoples who tend to have the greatest need for greater capacity. Awareness raising, outreach and information dissemination are vital. In some countries, proj- ect awareness raising and sensitization efforts have produced a substantial change in the attitude about natural resource governance among communities and government officers. For example, in Sri Lanka, community leaders state that they now understand governance issues and are better able to engage. Capacity building can create opportunities for implementing and promoting natural resource governance. The training of trainers approach to capacity building implemented in Sri Lanka targeted government officials and has positively changed the overall thinking about governance. Senior government officers are now more recep- tive to the subject, although before the project, it was a very sensitive subject and viewed negatively (Miththapala 2011). It has also created inter- est within the government to continue capacity building and to further promote NR governance. Governance projects need to include more time for building the capacities of NGOs and partners. This is particularly the case in developing coun- tries where NGOs may lack the necessary in-house capacity on governance. They often also need to acquire new capacities such as participatory ap- proaches, which are of particular importance for empowerment. 2.6. Policy Influencing to Enable Better Governance There is a need for an enabling environ- ment for governance. Community based natu- ral resources governance, especially innova- tive approaches such as Himas, need a strong political support at all levels and an enabling policy, legislative and institutional framework. MSPs can enable poor and excluded sectors to influence policy.

In Periyakalapu lagoon, Sri Lanka, as a result of the influence of the MSP two bridges were built instead of causeways. This has mini- mized damage to the lagoon because unlike cause- ways bridges allow water flows (Miththapala 2011). 6 It is hard to achieve policy impacts but impor- tant to remain engaged in policy processes. Our global project supported development of standards and tools linked to rights and governance in interna- tional policy for a such as the Convention on Bio- logical Diversity, climate change and biofuels. These actions have not yet produced a concrete impact but the potential impact on NR governance across the globe is enormous. In Nepal, as a results of project actions the current draft of the National Constitu- tion now contains positive changes related to access and benefit sharing, community and environmental rights, natural resources governance, and watershed management. Once the new Constitution is ap- proved these changes could have major impacts on NR governance in the country. Had there not been an effort to engage in this policy influencing these positive changes may not have happened. Technical support for government institu- tions can be a vehicle for enabling policy influencing. Our global sub-project was able to influence the Southern African Development Com- munity\u2019s (SADC) protected area governance work, by providing technical support with our regional of- fice for Eastern and Southern Africa. First, we sup- ported the implementation of a workshop on PA and transboundary governance. Subsequently, we provided technical and financial support for devel- opment a concept note and position paper on gov- ernance and natural resource use. This has led to SADC countries being more interested in working on PA governance as well as in having IUCN en- gaged as a partner in this process. 2.7. Communications and Learning in Natural Resource Governance Develop a communications and advocacy strat- egy early on. Most sub projects included a policy influencing outcome but did not develop a clear communications and advocacy strategy. This led to policy influencing processes being either weak or unsuccessful, which could have been avoided had this been addressed early on. Development of com- munications strategies for each sub project would have provided a clear framework for knowledge dis- semination and helped identify specific messages for different audiences. The media can be a valuable partner but not always. In Nepal, after project completion, the media still aired programs on issues of environ- mental rights and good governance that we had developed. In other cases, however, there was no clear evidence that the media can enable the local people to push for their rights, greater transparency and better governance. Emphasize on communications and outreach on NR governance. Some sub projects did engage in awareness raising but overall there was little to no allocation of investment in public communications and outreach. This weakened capacity to articulate project results, influence policy and fund raise. Need for better documentation and dissemina- tion of lessons, methods and tools. NR gover- nance processes need to be documented in order to allow for learning and replication. Government personnel, partners and communities have limited access to information of relevance for NR gov- ernance such as tools, monitoring systems and frameworks for equitable benefit sharing, commu- nity engagement and auditing livelihood impacts. Guidelines for the use and application of rights based approaches are also scarce (Madzwamuse 2010). While the project addressed this is some ways, for various reasons, we were unable to do more. 2.8. Steps for Enhancing IUCN\u2019s Own Implementation of Governance Principles From the perspective of the Social Policy unit, this project has produced important lessons on steps that are needed to enhance IUCN\u2019s own imple- mentation of governance principles, in order to be better placed to promote natural governance across the globe. IUCN must be able to demonstrate that internally it upholds the governance principles that it promotes in natural resource projects and policy actions in countries around the world. In particular, IUCN needs to make a greater effort to enhance its own accountability and transpar- ency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af2c41fa-3959-4184-942f-eb7415b2590e": {"__data__": {"id_": "af2c41fa-3959-4184-942f-eb7415b2590e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural resource governance, empowerment and poverty reduction : learning from practice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a154a5bb828f065d19bb2a4ec6517872d38f953a7e28cb645441e5de00278c39"}, "2": {"node_id": "16159a2f-ec55-418d-aa89-7c6009a556ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3e6b11579c15147f1c75af7a07b23017237fe0594467f8ef0de26ed4e635b6e"}}, "hash": "83be1057647a54c2b2027b9cd997281ed2c65f0f1ded58576a75a7a9dd0a09ca", "text": "For one, it does not have a rigorous monitor- ing and evaluation mechanisms in place, including a 7 tool for follow up on the extent to which governance principles are applied and respected throughout the union.

Reporting standards at all levels could also be significantly improved. Project design should be more transparent and participatory. Members and partners need to be more involved in project design and implementa- tion, to ensure they have full access to relevant information and can contribute to improving the process. An effort needs to be made to im- prove IUCN\u2019s capacity to implement project with and through member organizations and partners. While there is a growing focus globally and with- in IUCN on governance and rights based ap- proaches, many, especially field staff, lack an adequate understanding of what governance principles are and how to apply them in prac- tice. Across the union there is no common ap- proach to NR governance. Consequently, IUCN needs engage its staff in training on governance issues, principles and practices as well as RBAs. 2.9. Success Factors and Best Practi- ces in Natural Resource Gover- nance To date project implementation in has produced valuable insights in terms of best practices in NR governance and factors that can ensure greater suc- cess. These are: Political will is a critical factor for NR gover- nance. Poor communities are major constituents in the policy making process, making it difficult for them to influence policies. Government authorities tend to resist change. As such, unless there is great- er political will improvements in natural resource governance are unlikely or very difficult to achieve. Communities need to participate and feel in- volved. Change in NR governance is more likely to occur when local communities are able to identify the interventions they need through their existing governance structures. Communities need to feel that the process of governance is theirs and not imposed from outside. Active involvement of all stakeholders in decision making is also fundamen- tally important. It is critical to understand and respect community and indigenous governance structures and identify their weak links. It is vital to have a clear idea of how competing re- source users interact with each other in the con- text of management of common property re- sources, especially in the case of pastoral groups. Build bridges between legal and traditional frameworks. In Kenya, a strategy that combines statutory law and regulations with an effort to recover and document customary use practices and a culture of collaboration has shown to be an effective means for ensuring equitable natural resources governance. Work with the media to scale up impacts. In Ne- pal, radio programs proved to be an especially good vehicle for informing poor rural communities and illiterate groups on NR governance and rights. In this country, training of journalists on natural re- source governance has enabled them to integrate this new knowledge in their reports or articles, increasing the potential scale of project impact. Capacity building and awareness raising are vi- tal for natural resource governance. Communi- ties, government personnel and NGOs often lack the capacities needed to implement and engage in NR governance. Communities often do not know their rights and under such circumstances are ill placed to engage in governance. Similarly, government ac- tors themselves are often unaware of local rights. When communities gain knowledge of what their rights are, they are better able to defend them and hold government accountable (Springer et al. 2010). Awareness raising has proven to be a best practice for making local government representatives are more cooperative, responsive and accountable. Political elites have to be continually sensitized in order to induce the will for change and enable effective par- ticipatory decision-making and knowledge-sharing. Political standing and credibility of IUCN and partners can help open doors. IUCN\u2019s involve- 8 ment as a trusted international organization was instrumental in opening possibilities for NR gover- nance work in Syria. In a number of countries our partners had high degree of national and local re- spect, which enhanced their ability to promote gov- ernance. This illustrates that political standing and credibility can be of great importance. MSPs have been a best practice for providing voice and influencing policy. For one, they can provide poor people, women and ethnic minorities with a voice to influence decision making processes, in particular at the local and regional level. As a re- sult of MSPs, poor people have even been able to influence policy, at least in Asian countries such as Bangladesh. They can produce improvements in co- ordination between government actors, responsive- ness and accountability. Involvement of government actors at all levels is vitally important for NR governance.

The most successful projects were those that built on previous experience and included project partners with a strong presence and experi- ence in these areas. This helps build trust, owner- ship and buy-in of local communities and partners. This in turn lowers risk and produces better results. Often no one partner has the capacities needed for project implementation and working with multiple partners with complementary skills can be a useful means to overcome this challenge. 2.10. Innovations to Improve Natural Resource Governance Application of the Hima concept to new types of natural resource use is an innovative area of work that builds on traditional resource use systems. It is a bit early to tell, but if our part- ner in Lebanon continues to increase the focus on governance processes that can lead to replacement of unsustainable natural resource use patterns by more sustainable ones, then this approach could be more successfully replicated throughout the region (Garstecki 2011). IUCN-SUR and its partners have developed an in- novative method for design of cultural indi- cators of human well being, which was applied in peasant and indigenous communities in the high- lands of Bolivia and Peru. This methodology in- corporates qualitative and ethnographic techniques, to capture local voices through their perceptions, conceptions and criteria of well being. It could be adapted and utilized to broaden the understanding of human well being and its links to natural resource governance in other countries. In Kenya, IUCN and the local community organi- zation are implementing an innovative approach that builds on indigenous knowledge and insti- tutions of resource management. This approach is in stark contrast to the traditional paradigm of resource management in Kenya which has excluded communities and overlooked local knowledge sys- tems. This bottom-up approach, if successful, could be a model to be replicated in other parts of Kenya and Eastern Africa. A unique approach to payment for ecosystem ser- vices (PES). In Sardu Watershed in Nepal, our proj- ect has set up a PES like scheme conservation fund which is both participatory and could be financially self-sustainable (see IUCN 2011 for a more in depth description). The poorest families in upland forest areas receive funds to engage in alternative econom- ic activities such as ginger production instead of un- sustainable extraction of forest resources. The idea is that the fund could be replenished and sustained with funding from local water company in Dharan municipality, which has an approximate population of 150,000 who will benefit from better watershed management upstream. The process is highly par- ticipatory as the watershed scale MSP is responsible for making decision related to the PES mechanism. This scheme is still in nascent stages, but it appears to be viable and offers some innovative ideas for Nepal and other countries and regions. 9 3. Lessons on Project Design, Planning and Management We now turn our attention to specific project relat- ed lessons on design and planning, management, risk, sustainability and monitoring and evaluation. 3.1. Project Design and Planning A \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach does not work. Different social, political and cultural context require differentiated approaches to NR gover- nance. This was particularly true in multi country sub projects such as in Drylands (Kenya, Tunisia, Mali, and Burkina Faso), Bolivia/Peru, and Leba- non and Syria which had a common log frame but, due to big differences in political and oper- ating environments, should have had approaches tailored for each country. In other cases, there were substantial differences in environmental and socio-economic settings that would have required nationally and locally adapted interven- tions. Project implementation should be fo- cused and streamlined to ensure greater impact. In retrospect, it is clear that the proj- ect would have been more effective and sus- tainable had there been fewer countries and sub-projects. Under such circumstances it would have been possible to have higher lev- els of investment in each project, making them more likely to meet their goals and targets. Greater attention should be paid to liveli- hood improvements. While governance is a vital issue for local livelihoods, communities tend to be more interested in livelihood issues. This is why the projects that had greater im- pact were those that produced some improve- ment in local livelihoods (Sri Lanka, Bangla- desh and Kenya). Other sub projects were not able to address livelihood", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa1e5063-9249-4940-99b2-758a220e5a0f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa1e5063-9249-4940-99b2-758a220e5a0f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural resource governance, empowerment and poverty reduction : learning from practice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "064c381f2f21659d94d88e583989fa9216d24b4302542d0034d8a8c2fc37c6e1"}}, "hash": "064c381f2f21659d94d88e583989fa9216d24b4302542d0034d8a8c2fc37c6e1", "text": "issues either because of poor planning or the failure to include spe- cific actions of this type (Garstecki 2011). Collaboration with government should take into account their needs and is vital for gover- nance and policy influencing. Those projects where there was a stronger coordination with government (Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka) at various levels were generally most successful in delivering policy impacts. Such collaboration is more likely to be successful when project de- sign takes into account the needs of government institutions, and they are involved in some way in the implementation process (Swennenhuis 2011). Partners need to be actively involved in trans- parent project design process. In Sri Lanka all stakeholders felt that the project design was not transparent. This was also the case in some other sub projects such as Mozambique/South Africa. Had project design been more transparent and partners more involved in the process, sub proj- ects might have had greater impact and success. Discussion and reflection on planning dur- ing the early stages is essential for project success. It is clear that all parties involved in implementation did not have the same expec- tations about what the project was trying to achieve, what was need to achieve these objec- tives, purpose and outputs, and who was respon- sible for what. More discussion and reflection during the early stages of the project would have made it possible to largely overcome these issues. The theory of change and assumptions should be clearly developed at the beginning. Since this was not done early on, a clear thread or threads that connected all subprojects was not articulated, which in turn had negatively af- fected IUCN\u2019s ability to communicate the overall project logic, results and impacts to the donor. Develop thorough baseline studies and problem analysis. Sub project baseline stud- ies were weak in terms of analysis of the situ- ation of beneficiaries and natural resources governance challenges at the local and national level. A failure of some sub projects to ad- dress livelihood needs can be partly linked to these deficiencies in baseline studies (Garstecki 2011). Weak baselines also led to interven- tions that did not necessarily address the on the ground needs and challenges of governance. 10 3.2. Project Management IUCN needs to strengthen its coordinat- ing role in this type of project, to ensure qual- ity control, promote joint learning, and en- sure that lessons from field influence natural resource use policies at the national, regional and international levels (Swennenhuis 2011). The project implementation structure should be simple and sustainable. The project had an excessively complicated implementing structure, which involved multiple layers from DFID to KPMG (the fund manager) to IUCN headquarters (HQ) to regional offices and local partners. Within IUCN there were multiple layers, due in part to our organizational structure and politics. Due to the large number of sub projects, management in HQ was at times remote and unable to have a stronger on the ground presence (Johnson and van Dam 2011). Intra project communications are needed to ensure effective learning and imple- mentation. Within the project information flows bottom-upwards and top-downwards were flawed. This slowed and acted as a barri- er to learning as well as project implementation. Greater attention needs to be paid to the identification of appropriate partners for NR governance work in each country and region. In many sub projects, for distinct rea- sons, it was evident that partnerships were weak. In other cases the implementing arrange- ments, including partners selected, were not the most appropriate for a NR governance project. 3.3. Risk Management Carry out an exhaustive risk analysis, including identification of mitigation measures. As was stated in the project midterm review, overall the analysis and management of risk was quite weak (Johnson and van Damm 2011). Sub project failed to identify some critical risks or did not adequately qualify the level of risk or identify effective miti- gation measures. More time should have been de- voted at the beginning of the project to working on these issues with regional offices and partners. It is important to understand the risks as- sociated with rights based work. While many sub projects, to some extent, addressed rights issues, this work did not always re- flect a detailed and nuanced understanding of the risks involved and their potential impact on project implementation (Garstecki 2011). Assess the risks associated with political di- vides, power struggles and territoriality at the community level. These risks are hard to assess a priori and become apparent over the course of project implementation. In several sites in Sri Lanka, such community tensions cre- ated barriers for representation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76b1ba23-4751-4be4-99a2-a54427fa542a": {"__data__": {"id_": "76b1ba23-4751-4be4-99a2-a54427fa542a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Natural resource governance, empowerment and poverty reduction : learning from practice", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8be2ad6395612c1a93549c84d2f89c7fc32a0dea3f07fec20cabbeaef24734b"}, "3": {"node_id": "28528c76-fad1-4540-abc3-170dfc7fce77", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/natural-resource-governance-empowerment-and-poverty-reduction-learning", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f839fe6d73bd08e98c7c4931ed9df0c632a814c3fe1a8bb5d8066229b8254f4"}}, "hash": "fc604756134569cbdfd84257d4bf1061e3b934296c989d62791fbd3b3a5f356d", "text": "on community fora and MSPs, which in turn negatively im- pacted on project results (Miththapala 2011). Projects should be designed to be viable on their own. Some sub projects were de- signed to be implemented together with com- plementary projects, which unfortunately nev- er materialized. This resulted in difficulties delivering on the project results and impacts. 3.4. Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework The logframe needs to be clearly defined and SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-Bound). The initial project logframe contained overly optimistic outcomes, particularly with respect to capacity to deliver policy changes at the national and global levels. This reduced its effectiveness as a tool for com- munication within the implementing team, as well as for detailed activity planning, monitoring and reporting. The main lesson here is that a logframe should be as SMART as possible and serves as an effective planning/M&E tool (Garstecki 2011). Good baselines that are indicator specific are vital for enabling effective reporting and M&E. As the project logframe was adjusted and improved over time, it became clear that informa- tion collected initially was not presented concisely enough to make it possible to demonstrate prog- ress. In other cases, the baselines developed did not sufficiently address actions of particular rele- vance for each sub project and expected outcomes. 11 3.5. Project and Impact Sustainability Sustainability requires greater realism. In most cases, sub projects had an ambitious work plan that resulted in spreading resources too thin. The planned activities may have been insufficient to reach the desired impacts or changes and there- fore ensure greater sustainability. Sustainability and fundraising need to begin early on. Fundraising is particularly important for these types of projects because the achieve- ment of NR governance impacts is a medium to long term process. Only the Kenya sub proj- ect had some success in raising additional and complementary funding for project activities. A number of steps could have been taken much earlier on in the project to address this need. A communications strategy would have helped by identifying products and messages for donors as well as other actors. A fund raising strategy, in- cluding identification of funding needs and po- tential donors would have been equally useful. Local ownership is important for sustainabil- ity. The commitment of partners to the project and building of ownership among local stake- holders is an important basis for sustainability. Capacity building can contribute to sustain- ability. The training for trainers approach imple- mented in Sri Lanka trained government personnel and these individuals were able to promote great- er interest in NR governance in their institutions. This has created opportunities to continue to work on NR governance beyond the life of the project. 12 Globally: The Social Policy Unit, based at IUCN Headquarters in Switzerland, carries out work on cross-cutting issues related to governance such as protected area management and rights- based approaches to conservation.

They have also tended to distance themselves from addressing rights based issues that are vitally im- portant for rural populations whose livelihoods de- pend on natural resources. Our project\u2019s work with CIHR has demonstrated that conservation organi- zations are able to take steps to address both is- sues of accountability and rights. Project results to date have also demonstrated that NR governance improvements can lead to positive impacts for livelihoods and conservation of biodiversity. Natural resource governance and the promotion of rights based approaches are central component on the IUCN program for 2013 to 2016. As such this is an area in which it will increasingly be engaged. IUCN is particularly well placed to take a leading role in some specific areas of governance such as: Policy Influencing based on lessons from the field. Implementation and improvement of natural resource governance requires an en- abling policy environment at all levels. Policy influencing is an area of particular strength for IUCN. These processes should take into ac- count its ability to capture learning from the field and utilize this to inform policy making. Promote RBAs as part of natural resource gov- ernance. As one the only global organization that views human rights as a principle of governance and an important member of CIHR, IUCN is well placed to be leader in continuing to promote the in- clusion of RBA within governance processes. Bet- ter NR governance is not possible without respect for the rights of local communities and stakeholders. Develop knowledge products for NR gover- nance. IUCN should also take a leading role in tool development for NR governance, including assessment tools, RBA frameworks and others. Support for implementation of MSPs to pro- vide voice. MSPs have proven to be a powerful mechanism for improving governance. Since it is often viewed as a neutral actor and its membership includes governments, NGOs and community or- ganizations, IUCN is well placed to continue to play a role in promoting MSPs processes at all levels. Emphasize the importance of natural resource governance. Most governance work is not par- ticularly focused on natural resources, although governance issues are of particular importance for natural resource management and conser- vation. As such and given its institutional mis- sion, IUCN should act to promote greater focus on natural resource governance, particularly for poverty reduction and sustainable development. Strengthen IUCN\u2019s accountability and gov- ernance capacities. In order to be positioned to be an active promoter of natural resource gover- nance processes, IUCN needs to build capacity to understand, implement and measure governance within its three strands (secretariat, members and commissions). This should include, among other things, steps to increase both internal and external financial and technical accountability. 15 5.

Coupled with this was fragmented regulation and con\ufb02icting responsibilities among institutions, a lack of coordination for hydro-agricultural developments, inequitable access to water resources and growing tensions and risk of con\ufb02icts among water users. As a response to this situation, WANI and partners initiated a process of coordination and participation of all stakeholders in dialogue to reverse the trends in natural resources degradation in the basin through integrated management. Stakeholder collaboration has resulted in a Catchment Management Plan, a Water Charter, new institutions and the empowerment of stakeholders to participate in planning and management of water resources to provide the necessary capacity to respond to stresses and shocks. The reform of water governance is enabling the transparent coordination of water resources development, including remediation of degraded ecosystems and, eventually, restoration of the river \ufb02ow patterns. Dialogue has reduced the number of cases of con\ufb02ict and governments have pledged millions of dollars in new investment for basin restoration through the Hadejia-Jama\u2019are-Komadugu-Yobe Basin Trust Fund. With the changes underway in the basin, governments and communities are acquiring capacities to both learn and cope with uncertain future events. Highlights m A Water Charter adopted spelling out the agreed principles for sustainable development of the basin and the roles and responsibilities of governments and stakeholders. Borno State is the \ufb01rst to sign. m The Catchment Management Plan (CMP) created to restore ecosystem services and sustain livelihoods and enterprise development needed to reduce poverty. m Comprehensive Water Audit completed which provided essential knowledge of the basin for the conception of the CMP. m Establishment of the Hadejia-Jama\u2019are-Komadugu-Yobe Basin Trust Fund to \ufb01nance implementation of the CMP and basin restoration. m Establishment of new institutions for implementing IWRM basin-wide and nation-wide: State Integrated Water Resources Management Coalitions (SIWRMCs) for the Komadugu Yobe Basin states and the Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC). m Pilot interventions to improve the \ufb02ow of the river by removing weeds and silt blockages, resolve con\ufb02ict and strengthen livelihoods. 2 WANI Case Study \u2013 Komadugu Yobe Basin A complex network of river systems The Komadugu Yobe Basin (KYB) covers a total area of 148,000 km2 divided between north-east Nigeria and south-east Niger with 95% of the basin\u2019s water in Nigeria. The basin is drained by two main river sub-systems: the Komadugu Yobe and the Komadugu Gana, with the Yobe River flowing into Lake Chad. KYB is a sub-catchment of the larger Lake Chad Basin, representing approximately 35% of the Lake Chad Basin, shared by six Nigerian states (see Figure 1) and four other countries (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad and Niger). KYB is of strategic national and international importance. KYB, Lake Chad and the Sahel region Lake Chad is a large fresh water lake and is important economically, providing a vital source of water to wildlife, livestock and the people living on the edge of the Sahara Desert. At the heart of the Sahel region, the KYB has a semi-arid climate, rainfall variability is high and severe drought is a frequent hazard, leaving communities less able to cope with change. Poverty characterizes the basin, where the population has doubled in three decades to more than 23 million and keeps growing at 2.5% a year.

This type of management \u201cpromotes coordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems\u201d.1 Ecosystem degradation and livelihood vulnerability Inappropriate land and water management practices in the basin have changed the seasonal \ufb02ow to a perennial \ufb02ow regime. This has resulted in the invasion of reeds and weeds such as Typha in some of the river reaches, which block streams and \ufb02ooding of channels causing changes in the wetland ecosystems that communities have historically relied upon to deliver regular water services. With the exception of the year 2001, natural \ufb02ooding of the Yobe River \ufb02oodplains has been very limited in recent years and irregular and low \ufb02ows in the Yobe River have affected the small and large scale irrigation schemes along the rivers with many of them now abandoned. Fishing, farming and herding livelihoods have been adversely affected and the scarcity of water has led to con\ufb02ict over the available resources. 1 GWP (2009) Lessons from Integrated Water Resources Management in Practice, Global Water Partnership, Policy brie\ufb01ng 9 MAJOR WATER ISSUES IN THE BASIN Institutional inertia Communities already under social and economic crisis found themselves confronted with ever- increasing water stress. In addition to widespread environmental degradation, slow responses from water authorities to the problems further compounded the problems. The basin suffered from fragmented regulation and con\ufb02icting responsibilities among institutions, a lack of coordination for hydro- agricultural developments, inequitable access to water resources, non-optimal utilization of multi- purpose dams, and growing tensions and risk of con\ufb02icts among water users. In other words, the river basin seemed locked in a state of institutional paralysis from which a coordinated response to the issues could not be mounted. Competition for dwindling water resources was leading to major con\ufb02icts among water users and sectors. WORKING TOWARDS SOLUTIONS WANI and partners supported the building of a knowledge base so that water management decisions could be made on the basis of up-to-date information. The next step was to establish a legal and policy enabling environment through which basin-wide coordination mechanisms could be implemented. This led to development and adoption of a basin-wide Water Charter. In conjunction with these measures, \ufb01eld interventions to pilot-test improved water management that would have positive impacts on local livelihoods were implemented. The aim was to demonstrate ef\ufb01cient and sustainable water utilization techniques and approaches. These would support the development of a catchment management plan that would form the structure and mechanism to implement an integrated and basin-wide water resources management initiative. 4 WANI Case Study \u2013 Komadugu Yobe Basin Box 1. Building trust with local communities in the Basin To help local communities activities focused on improving the \ufb02ow of the river by removing weeds and silt blockages which had reduced the \ufb02ow downstream and caused \ufb02ooding upstream during times of heavy rain. For example: m 5 km of channel clearance and 500 m of bank stabilization of the Miga/Kafin Hausa River m 12 km of channel clearance along the main river course of the Old Hadejia River 1.5 km of channel clearance and 2.3 km of embankment along main river course at Rantan Crucially, this was carried out by the local communities who actively participated in the clearing of the weeds and de-silting process. These immediate, tangible results built up trust in the communities, as they could see the dramatic, local improvements to the river, with increased \ufb02ow downstream and a reduction in \ufb02ooding upstream. The photos below illustrate the change in \ufb02ow as a result of these activities. It is important to note that while the majority of the costs were covered by donor funding, the community contributed their labour and some investment. These localized actions helped to increase yields as \ufb02ooding was reduced and river banks were once again cultivable as erosion was prevented. The communities literally gained ground and were able to see the bene\ufb01ts of longer term, less tangible developments such as the catchment planning and governance mechanisms including the water charter.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfc98f3f-c4c9-421d-b651-a457190e91b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfc98f3f-c4c9-421d-b651-a457190e91b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/komadugu-yobe-basin-upstream-lake-chad-nigeria-wani-case-study", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Komadugu Yobe Basin, upstream of Lake Chad, Nigeria : WANI case study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/komadugu-yobe-basin-upstream-lake-chad-nigeria-wani-case-study", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1bf989d25406fdf197b52647021c17d046e27aa28159159489e7e9d9282b9a9"}, "2": {"node_id": "beec84ff-446a-41b5-a5a7-30073c43c515", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/komadugu-yobe-basin-upstream-lake-chad-nigeria-wani-case-study", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fd4fe4d52148c639659727824595b28230a2f259c2de22956963e85f9ea04c1"}}, "hash": "2b2c361bd71096095db87bd442fa532b986d5aaf0df96064e0551b6e35c1b0d1", "text": "Outlets of Tiga Dam at Rantan before (left) and after (right) channel clearance The Water Charter: a framework for managing water resources across the basin Regular consultation and transboundary exchange of information on activities is crucial for successful sustainable ecosystem management at basin-level in the KYB, which \ufb02ows through six Nigerian states.

The objective of the Catchment Management Plan is to resolve identi\ufb01ed water problems and challenges, in the light of climate change, as well as developing integrated water management planning in the region. This is the \ufb01rst step to platform in 2007 where representatives attended from all the six riparian States in Nigeria, the Federal Government Ministries, as well as NGOs and many others. To date, only Borno State has of\ufb01cially signed the Water Charter as rati\ufb01cation by the states has proved to be a slow and involved process due to political changes. Catchment Management Plan: an integrated approach to water management The socio-economic and environmental studies and a comprehensive Water Audit collated existing data and provided essential information which did not previously exist and which needed to be collected. This information informed the draft Catchment WANI Case Study \u2013 Komadugu Yobe Basin 5 achieving equity of allocation, ef\ufb01ciency of use and overall sustainable development in the basin. It seeks to provide a means of harnessing relevant water resources management mechanisms and fostering their incorporation into Millennium Development Goals and National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy policies, programmes and plans, while interacting with other natural resources management models. The CMP has two components and a total of nine strategies, each with several activities yielding different outputs. The strategic actions were identi\ufb01ed by such stakeholders as the Federal, State and Local governments, private institutions, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Community-Based Organisations (CBOs) and resource users. The goal of these actions is to strengthen strategically important institutions and prepare them to effectively manage water resources in the basin in an integrated and sustainable manner. The plan foresees a number of reforms.

Institutional development and leadership Evidence of the achievements in the KYB can be found in the policy direction of the country. The interventions by WANI and partners directly in\ufb02uenced the creation of the Nigeria Integrated Water Resources Management Commission (NIWRMC) and have also strongly supported the 7- point agenda of the President of the Federation (2007-2011). The NIWRMC is a Federal Organization under the Federal Ministry of Water Resources with a national mandate for promoting IWRM. The 2009-2011 strategic plan for the NIWRMC clearly states that the Commission will roll- out water audit studies and develop management plans for the other seven basins in the country using the KYB model and then crown these plans with Water Charters for these basins similar to what is happening in the KYB. The development of the national commission is crucial as this is the vehicle that will drive national implementation of the catchment planning and with the state coalition to take forward the Water Charters. The State Integrated Water Resources Management Committees (SIWRMCs), with \u2018Committees\u2019 changed to \u2018Coalitions\u2019, are initiatives that have been established throughout the six riparian States of the KYB within Nigeria and are recognized by the various State Governments and their organs. They served as the main anchor during the development of the Water Charter as the members of these committees are the key actors who will drive the water governance process forward at the state level. The membership comprises the stakeholders concern with land and water management matters in the respective states. The Trust Fund: to pay for implementation Through the Federal Ministry of Water Resources, the Hadejia-Jama\u2019are-Komadugu-Yobe Basin Trust Fund, with a \ufb01nancing target of US $ 125million, was created as an outcome of the Damaturu Summit in 2006. The Trust Fund is an innovative platform for a joint intervention by the riparian states, with the support of the Federal Government of Nigeria for augmenting line agencies in addressing the KYB land and water resources issues. To help establish the Fund, the State Governors contributed an equivalent of USD 6.5 million as a take-off amount towards the establishment of the Trust Fund. The Federal Government of Nigeria then matched the funds equally to bring the total amount to USD 13 million. WANI Case Study \u2013 Komadugu Yobe Basin 7 Carrying out the water audit Box 2. Political will and restoring trust Suspicion and mistrust about rival\u2019s intensions was prevalent among the basin peoples and parties. It required political will to break barriers and transparent dealings to restore trust and mutual con\ufb01dence among the basin\u2019s stakeholders. I.K. Musa, former Federal Director of Irrigation and Drainage, showed this political will by help stopping the construction of another dam scheduled to be built along the river. It was a huge risk. But to lock in trust among hostile competing interests, Musa \u201cfelt that we must be the \ufb01rst to make sacri\ufb01ces; not \ufb01sheries or cities downstream. So our sacri\ufb01ce took away a sense of bias, and now each other sector is making a contribution.\u201d By trading \u2018hard\u2019 for \u2018soft infrastructure\u2019 Musa lowered tensions, generated more water, and set in place a Catchment Management Plan. That plan is being replicated nationwide, and scaled up to the international Lake Chad Basin Commission. WHAT HAS CHANGED? W ith further climate change looming, the adaptive capacity of ecosystems and communities of the Komadugu Yobe had become brittle, just when resilience is most needed. KYB: Knowledge, planning, dialogue, institutions, political will and restoring trust Riparian states had been unable to coordinate development of water resources in the basin.

The Global Ocean Biodiversity Initiative is an international partnership advancing the scientific basis for conserving biological diversity in the deep seas and open oceans. It aims to help countries, as well as regional and global organizations, to use and develop data, tools, and methodologies to identify ecologically significant areas with an initial focus on the high seas and deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction. This initiative began in late 2008 as a collaboration between the German Federal Agency for Nature Conservation (BfN), IUCN, UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre, Marine Conservation Biology Institute, Census of Marine Life, Ocean Biogeographic Information System and the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab of Duke University. The initiative continues to seek additional collaborators to help bring the best science and data to bear on the identification of ecologically significant areas beyond national jurisdiction. GOBI is facilitated by IUCN with core support from BfN. The work under this initiative ultimately aims to help countries meet the goals adopted under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. These global goals relate to reducing the rate of biodiversity loss, applying ecosystem approaches, and establishing representative marine protected area networks by 2012. Objectives \u2022 Establish and support international scientific collaboration to assist States and relevant regional and global organizations to identify ecologically significant areas using the best available scientific data, tools, and methods. \u2022 Provide guidance on how the CBD\u2019s scientific criteria can be interpreted and applied towards management, including representative networks of marine protected areas. \u2022 Assist in developing regional analyses with relevant organizations and stakeholders. Global Ocean Biodiversity Initiative Working towards high seas conservation AZORES SCIENTIFIC CRITERIA AND GUIDANCE for identifying ecologically or biologically signi\ufb01 cant marine areas and designing representative networks of marine protected areas in open ocean waters and deep sea habitats In 2008 in Bonn, Germany, the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted a set of seven scientific criteria to identify ecologically and biologically significant areas (EBSAs) in the global marine realm. The criteria were compiled at a CBD expert workshop in the Azores. Area-based management approaches and tools can address a multitude of threats. These tools include marine protected areas and networks, prior environmental impact assessments, improved regulation of sectoral activities, and broader ecosystem-based marine spatial planning. Using the CBD EBSA criteria to identify specific ocean areas that require enhanced protection can thus help to achieve a variety of conservation and management objectives. Identifying ecologically and biologically significant areas in the deep and open oceans The deep and open oceans are home to a major part of the world\u2019s biodiversity. They support an enormous wealth of productive ecosystems, specialized habitats and individual species, which collectively provide humankind with services, such as the production of oxygen, food, freshwater and the regulation of the Earth\u2019s climate. Mounting pressures from intensifying human uses, climate change and ocean acidification threaten to undermine these ecosystems\u2019 balance and resilience.

The first product from GOBI was the report: Defining ecologically or biologically significant areas in the open oceans and deep seas: Analysis, tools, resources and illustrations. It was presented at a CBD Scientific Expert Workshop on ecological criteria in October 2009 in Ottawa, Canada. The report provides an overview of scientific tools, technologies and data that can assist in the application of the CBD scientific criteria, as well as current and emerging techniques and methodologies. The work also highlights key issues concerning the strengths, challenges and limitations of data availability and scientific understanding that ocean management faces at this time, and some strategies to address these challenges. Practical illustrations relating to species, habitats and oceanographic features are described for each of the seven CBD scientific criteria as examples of various scientific methods and techniques relevant to each criterion. Some of these illustrations are summarized on the following pages.

The Sargassum weed is also crucial to the survival of hatchling and post-hatchling sea turtles, which spend the first year or more of their lives drifting with the floating mats of Sargassum, where they receive food and protection from predation. Additionally, the Sargasso Sea is an important migratory route for many species, including tuna, sea turtles and humpback whales, and is the spawning site of the critically endangered European eel and endangered American eel. A considerable wealth of information about the Sargasso Sea exists, dating back to the times of Columbus and documented in scientific publications since at least 1854. Its biological, ecological and oceanographic characteristics were examined and compared to the four other similar regions of the ocean found within subtropical gyres based on peer-reviewed literature, technical reports and available data sets. Criterion 1: Uniqueness or rarity Areas contain either (i) unique (\u201cthe only one of its kind\u201d), rare (occurs only in few locations) or endemic species, populations or communities, and/or (ii) unique, rare or distinct, habitats or ecosystems; and/or (iii) unique or unusual geomorphological or oceanographic features. There are many unique or rare species and habitats in areas of the deep and open oceans. Some, like the two examples below, can be initially identified through a review of scientific literature and expert opinion, and verified through field measurements or remote sensing data. 6 Satellite image of sea surface temperature (SST) within the North West Atlantic.

Source: ASCLME 2008 The Saya de Malha Banks Female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris, male pictured above) haul out on North American west coast beaches twice yearly: once to breed, give birth and nourish young, and once to molt. Following each terrestrial visit, the seals return to the sea to feed. They thus undertake a double foraging migration each year-a \u201cshort migration\u201d following breeding and a 6 to 8 month \u201clong migration\u201d following molt. Recent discoveries show that during the long migration, female northern elephant seals travel half way across the Pacific, feeding almost entirely in habitats beyond national jurisdictions. These migrations are extremely important to the survival of elephant seals as they need to build a reserve for subsequent months spent fasting on land while giving birth, nourishing their pup, and breeding. Data collected from satellite tags deployed as part of the Tagging of Pacific Predators project (www.topp.org), along with modeled habitat utilization distributions, were used to identify an area of high female northern elephant seal density during their annual long migration. 180o W 160o W 140o W 120o W 30o N 40o N 50o N 60o N Low use High use Criterion 2: Special importance for life-history stages of species 8 Areas that are required for a population to survive and thrive.

These albatrosses travel long distances over the open ocean to forage. Their range includes areas from the Tasman Sea and the South Pacific to as far away as Chile. Declines in adult survival, productivity and recruitment are thought to be due to their mortality as bycatch in longline tuna fisheries, resulting in the Antipodean Albatross currently being listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Satellite tracking data collected over multiple years and during the different life- history stages of the albatross were analyzed to identify areas that are used most regularly during different seasons and each life-history stage. This methodology allows for the identification of core areas of activity that would require a higher degree of protection to ensure the survival of the Antipodean Albatross.

Leatherbacks in the Eastern Pacific Ocean have been impacted by poaching, egg collecting on nesting beaches, and losses as bycatch in fisheries, resulting in severe population declines. After leaving nesting beaches, turtles travel south, with most following the same migration corridor across the Equator and into the South Pacific.

Species with low reproduction rates or habitats with slow potential recovery from perturbation have an inherently higher level of risk to impacts than other species or habitats. Many of these habitats are essential for maintaining fundamental ecosystem functions. In some cases, as demonstrated in the illustration below, the location of these species and/or features is not known, and predictive models are important in locating potential areas of interest. Criterion 4: Vulnerability, fragility, sensitivity, or slow recovery 12 Reef-forming cold water corals are very sensitive to anthropogenic activities, particularly bottom fishing, due to their fragile bush-like structures and slow growth rates, which are only a tenth of the growth rate of warm-water tropical corals. Thus they recover very slowly from physical damage. They are also expected to be heavily affected by ocean acidification. The full extent of cold water coral distribution globally is not known, making their protection more challenging. The areas where reef-forming cold-water stony corals are likely to occur can be predicted through the investigation of environmental conditions surrounding known coral locations. The existing locations of the six reef-forming cold water coral species, amassed from research and cruise data bases were used to predict areas of suitable coral habitat throughout the world based on 26 environmental conditions. The fine spatial resolution of these predictions provides a suitable scale for application of conservation measures. 13 Global habitat suitability for reef-forming cold water corals Predicted coral habitat and locations of bottom trawl closures in the NE Atlantic Ocean.

Phytoplankton (see Pacific Equatorial Upwelling illustration) can be detected at the ocean surface by satellites that measure specific wavelengths of reflected sunlight. As distinct water masses flow past each other, they aggregate drifting organisms like phytoplankton along their boundaries, known as fronts. These frontal aggregations of drifters attract mobile predators such as fish, turtles, birds, and marine mammals. The presence of fauna was inferred by identifying fronts visible in images of sea surface temperature (SST). Specifically, an algorithm was applied to SST data to estimate the frequency of sea surface temperature fronts in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean near Central America. Two zones of high frontal frequency, one south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec and one east of the Gulf of Papagayo, were identified. 15 Mean frequency of sea surface temperature (SST) fronts off the Pacific coast of Central America, with fronts extending beyond national jurisdiction. Area contains comparatively higher diversity of ecosystems, habitats, communities, or species, or has higher genetic diversity. Identifying areas of high relative taxonomic or habitat diversity can be challenging in the data-poor deep and open oceans. Where consistent global or regional data are lacking, relative species diversity can be predicted using a variety of indices and models, such as species distribution models. Using some species, e.g. oceanic top predators, as indicators of wider biological diversity could also be applicable. Sites where species at the top of the trophic chain occur in large numbers are invariably associated with biologically diverse areas. Criterion 6: Biological diversity Overlap between hotspots of marine mammal biodiversity and global seamount distributions Although point observations can be used to create a number of biodiversity indices, they often under- represent the full range of a species. Physical environment variables (e.g. sea surface temperature) often determine the limits of a single species\u2019 distribution. Thus environmental envelopes can be created to map a species\u2019 theoretical range based on oceanographic variables. The overlap of such \u201crange maps\u201d can be used as a predictor of species richness. AquaMaps (www.aquamaps.org) is a species distribution model available as an online web service that has been used to generate standardized range maps for more than 9000 marine species. Range maps from AquaMaps for 115 marine mammal species were used to produce a global map of marine mammal biodiversity patterns. 16 (a) Global map of predicted marine mammal species richness and seamount density and (b) the highly significant relationship between the two, spearman\u2019s rho = 0.76, p < 0.0001) Source: Both graphs modified from Kaschner, 2007 (a) (b) Species richness category Mean seamount density Global patterns of species diversity One of the most intuitive criteria on which conservation efforts are based is \u2018Species Diversity\u2019 \u2013 but measuring diversity is not straightforward. Measures of diversity generally consider one or more of the following factors: 1) number of different elements (species, communities, etc., also referred to as \u201crichness\u201d); 2) the relative abundance of the elements (\u201cevenness\u201d and other related measures); and 3) how different or varied the elements are when considered as a whole (e.g. taxonomic distinctness). Several indices measuring species diversity have been proposed, giving more or less weight to these factors.

Seamounts are underwater mountains, usually formed by tectonic or volcanic activity. They rise above the surrounding deep seafloor, and can influence the flow of oceanographic currents over and around them, which can increase the productivity of the water column above. Areas of shallow habitat relative to the surrounding abyssal plain, often have highly diverse, and abundant, faunal communities. Remote seamounts can develop special ecosystems, with many endemic species. Fish aggregations often occur in association with seamounts, and seamount fisheries have seen major expansions since the 1960s. Fishing is the single largest human activity that impacts seamount ecosystems. However, many seamounts are believed to be unfished, and in deep-sea, offshore areas represent \u201cnatural\u201d habitats unaffected by human activities. Global datasets of the predicted location of large seamounts have been created from ocean bathymetry and satellite altimetry. These data can be combined with historical catch data from seamount fisheries and other anthropogenic marine impacts to identify areas of low impact, where seamounts are still in a relatively natural state. Although this assessment is limited by poor knowledge of exactly where fishing has occurred, a number of seamounts have been identified as meeting the naturalness criterion. Examples include the seamounts of the Discovery Tablemount group in the South East Atlantic. 18 Fishing effort and seamount locations (< 2000m deep) in the South East Atlantic.

It has been classified as endangered since 1981 and listed as such in both the IUCN (IUCN 1996) and the South African Red Data books (Smithers 1986). The entire distribution range of the Riverine Rabbit is restricted to the semi-arid Central Karoo region of South Africa. Being a habitat specialist, Bunolagus is associated with the dense, discontinuous and highly diverse vegetation fringing the seasonal rivers of the Central Karoo. As the only indigenous burrowing rabbit in Africa, Bunolagus is adapted to and dependent on soft and deep alluvial soils along the river courses for constructing stable breeding stops. Riverine Rabbit numbers have decreased considerably with the disappearance of this habitat type over large parts of its former range (Robinson 1981; Duthie and Robinson 1990). Ten years ago it was suggested that the remaining suitable habitat might, theoretically, support 1435 rabbits. However, Bunolagus densities may vary widely among river systems, and the Ongers river which alone supports approximately 21% of the remaining habitat, shows no evidence of the rabbit. Thus the population size may be very much lower (Duthie et al. 1989). The massive decline of two-thirds of its original habitat and, correspondingly, of the Bunolagus population, can be attributed to the loss of suitable habitat as a result of agricultural activities on the seasonal river flood plains (Robinson 1981; Duthie et al. 1989; Duthie and Robinson 1990). Today the Riverine Rabbit only occurs on private farmland and this riverine habitat is equally attractive to landowners for both cultivation of crops and extensive livestock grazing. In addition, anthropogenic fragmentation of riverine vegetation through impoundments in river channels, weirs, historic and current cultivated lands also represents a significant threat to the remaining riverine habitat. At present, none of the Riverine Rabbit habitat is protected within a provincial nature reserve or national park in the Karoo region. During 1987 and 1988 nine Riverine Rabbits were captured on private farmland in the Karoo and brought to the De Wildt Cheetah Research Center near Pretoria to start the first captive breeding programme (Duthie and Robinson 1990).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1aa91d1b-a0f3-44c0-a9ad-959c962d8490": {"__data__": {"id_": "1aa91d1b-a0f3-44c0-a9ad-959c962d8490", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

The longevity of Bunolagus in the wild is unknown, however, in captivity longevity was found to be up to 5 years or possibly more (E. Smidt pers. comm.). Of the 20 animals born in the park, 87.5% (n = 14) died under the age of three years. Besides the lack of essential habitat resources, periods of high ambient temperatures as well as inbreeding appeared to be responsible for most of this high mortality rate in the park. At present four Riverine Rabbits are left in the breeding enclosures at the Karoo National Park, and the sex of three of these animals is unknown. Because of the small number of the breeding population, and because these rabbits are all closely related, the captive breeding programme is almost at its end. No data have been collected from the breeding colony in the park. Current Activities Since January 1999 the ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY FOR THE CONSERVATION OF SPECIES AND POPULATIONS (ZSCSP) has been conducting a comprehensive habitat evaluation and mapping exercise in riverine areas combined with the confirmation of Bunolagus in surveyed areas by observation. These field surveys are partly undertaken in cooperation with Cape Nature Conservation and are designed to estimate the current population size of the Riverine Rabbit. During investigations conducted in 1999 in the Western and Northern Cape Provinces, optimal riverine habitat has been identified for the most part in the form of isolated pockets or narrow areas respectively within very poor up to sub-optimal areas. Nevertheless, on nine investigated farms Riverine Rabbit specimens were found for the first time. Altogether 43 farms were surveyed in 1999, and a total number of 22 rabbits has been observed on 11 farms. The Workshop The PHVA Workshop for the endangered Riverine Rabbit was organized to identify and bring together all groups responsible for the conservation and management of the Riverine Rabbit and its habitat. A carefully selected and diverse group of participants (private landowners, national and provincial conservation authorities, lagomorph experts, and members of the IUCN/SSC/Lagomorph Specialist Group clarified aims and objectives and established actions needed for the long-term conservation of the Riverine Rabbit and its habitat in the Central Karoo region of South Africa. The workshop also recommended that expertise should be brought together to coordinate work on conservation and management and to establish a database on the species and its habitat. The workshop was conducted at the Ellerman Resource Center, University of Stellenbosch from Thursday through to Saturday 27th to 29th July 2000. It was opened by 11 Prof. Terry Robinson and Dr. Victoria Ahlmann. Presentations were made during the course of the workshop by Robinson, Ahlmann, Muller, Collins, Milton, Kleynhans, and Bell. Initially four working groups were formed: Habitat, Management, Threats, and Population Modelling with the Threats group later merging with the Management Group. These groups worked together throughout the workshop. Discussions in the plenary sessions provided guidance for the next steps for the working groups. The workshop was closed at 13h00 on Saturday 29th July with comments from Seal and Ahlmann. . Group Summaries and Recommendations Habitat and Land Use Group Habitat destruction and alteration of Riverine Rabbit habitat peaked in the 1960\u2019s with sporadic clearance, increase in extent and intensity of grazing practices which took place subsequent to that. Ecological events (e.g. climatic changes, flooding), political changes, as well as an uninformed understanding of the Riverine Rabbit and riverine systems by landowners can also be considered problematic factors in overall decline. The priorities to overcome the present and inherited problems related to the above- mentioned activities are as follows: 1. Habitat Conservation with the emphasis on ensuring that enough optimal habitat will be conserved, formally or otherwise, the means to properly identify and survey these areas and manage them. 2. Sustainable land use is fundamental for long-term survival of the Riverine Rabbit. This includes both economic and ecological sustainability. Actions to ensure this is identifying land use impacts and the relevant extension work to encourage an upward shift in proportion of land in suitability categories. 3. Climate change can be monitored by means of scenario modelling to make estimated predictions relevant to the Riverine Rabbit and its habitat management. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9685afd3-a3db-461a-9475-9a2dddcc18f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "9685afd3-a3db-461a-9475-9a2dddcc18f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

The use, management and development of corridors are being considered to achieve these aims. 12 Management and Strategies Group The need for environmental awareness through a coordinated environmental education initiative is essential. The lack of formal habitat protection requires the expansion of the existing conservancy system to cover a wider range of the Riverine Rabbits distribution, with the ultimate goal being to develop a biosphere reserve system of core and buffer areas. The lack of a coordinated management strategy requires the expansion of the National Riverine Rabbit Coordinating Committee, and it taking formal responsibility for the implementation of the goals and objectives identified by the Riverine Rabbit PHVA Workshop. Information collection, processing and distribution was identified as essential for the informed and coordinated implementation of conservation strategies. This process would also identify gaps in knowledge that would serve to identify future research priorities. Threats Threats (not addressed by other working groups) : 1) The control of dog predation was identified as a major priority to be implemented through the NRRCC, with the cooperation of the existing and future conservancies. 2) Potential catastrophic events that were identified included; flooding, climate change, fire, and disease. Elements that can be controlled to some extent through careful land management included flooding and fire. This would require the NRRCC to promote the use of judicious management techniques that favour the survival of the Riverine Rabbit. The National Riverine Rabbit Coordinating Committee shall include the provincial agencies, South African National Parks, Department of Agriculture, Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, landowners, NGOs, academic institutions, and other interested parties. This group shall take the lead role in promoting and facilitating the conservation of the Riverine Rabbit through a cooperative, inclusive process. Census Further research is urgently required for the development of a standardized sencussing protocol that is both reliable and replicable. Problems associated with sencussing are the nocturnal activity and dense, low visibility of the habitat of this species, as well as its high susceptibility to stress upon capture and handling. Current experience favours a 13 technique using a combination of transect sweep from horseback and on foot through the habitat, counting any individuals flushed from cover. Research Priorities: \u2022 Standardized and repeatable census techniques for assessing the population numbers of Riverine Rabbits within particular patches of habitat. \u2022 Standardized and quantitative methods of identification of the vegetation and soil characteristics of suitable riverine habitat. Execution of the above two research topics requires close collaboration between property owners, conservation institutions and research scientists at academic institutions. Captive Population It was decided, given the lack of knowledge and resources to initiate a captive breeding programme, the negative factors by far outweigh the benefits and that it would be unwise to initiate a captive breeding programme until more knowledge is obtained. Concerning the four captive rabbits currently in enclosures in the Karoo National Park, it was unanimously decided that the best solution is to return the rabbits to the original farms where the founders for the initial breeding programme were captured. The rabbits would have to be kept in enclosures on the farms and cannot be released until a genetic analysis is completed in order to establish that no significant genetic difference exists between the captive rabbits and the wild rabbits. If there is no such difference, and if the rabbits have no demonstrable signs of disease, then they can be released into the wild. Feelings with regards to the issues of reintroductions, supplementations and translocations of rabbits were that, due to a serious lack of knowledge and data, these management actions should be postponed until such a time as more precise data are available. Such management actions could, however, play a very important role in the future. Modelling and Life History Parameters Summary: The probability of extinction of Riverine Rabbit populations with K=20 is high under all conditions explored in these simulations. Inbreeding depression, if it occurs, greatly increases this risk and remains a problem at higher population sizes. Increase of the K to 50 provided substantial benefits in reducing the risk of extinction under ideal conditions. The greatest improvements in growth rates or extinction risks occurred with a reduction of juvenile mortality rates. 14 Recommendations: Measurement of first year mortality and its causes and efforts to reduce that rate to 50% or less in combination with a minimal expansion of the carrying capacity of individual population fragments to 50 animals appear to offer the most effective management strategies to improve the prospects for survival of the Riverine Rabbit.

Clearly defined problems and range of realistic management applications. 6) A synthesis of available data and more concrete direction to move forward. 7) Long term conservation strategy plan and to start a serious funding / public awareness programme. 8) To get more information about the rabbit to help to save the rabbit on our farm and in my area. 9) Long term management plan \u2013 research / conservation \u2013 priorities to species and habitat. 10) Gain more knowledge of the Riverine Rabbit and how effectively to establish a conservancy for the benefit of the rabbit and myself. 11) To at least synthesise all current information on the rabbit and use this to ensure the conservation and effective management of the rabbit and especially its habitat, encompassing all the other associated biota in this environment. 12) To help the Riverine Rabbit to survive, a lot of people and organisations have to give their support. Support must be co-ordinate. 13) Viable breeding programme. 14) Meaningful strategy for the implementation of a conservation programme for the Riverine Rabbit. 15) A workable management plan for the overall conservation of the Riverine Rabbit. 16) Development of a co-ordinated strategy that engages all stakeholders in meeting the priority need of the Riverine Rabbit. 18 Question 2: The major problem, according to the participants, in terms of the long term survival of the Riverine Rabbit. 1) Habitat degradation (on going) \u2013 through modification \u2013 with little prospect of rehabilitation. 2) Lack of capacity of the responsible organizations, provincial, national, research, etc. 3) The low fecundity rate that appears to be due to inbreeding, some subpopulations may still have high fecundity \u2013 mix genes. 4) Inappropriate land use in Karoo. 5) Lack of information regarding population numbers and historical connectivity. Dearth of life history / ecological / genetic data to work with in making realistic management plans. 6) Habitat degradation. 7) Traditional hunting by farm workers with hunting dogs and other predators like the black backed jackal, foxes and lynx. 8) Money, staff for investigation, monitoring and habitat rehabilitation. 9) Habitat fragmentation and population genetic diversity. 10) Habitat degradation, ignorance and natural evolution. 11) Not enough knowledge of this small animal and its needs. Because we do not know, we yet cannot help. People easily jump to theoretical conclusions, but over a time of 20 years the contrary was shown to me on the farm. I walk a lot, during rain and dry seasons, and I experience the realities. We saw many enthusiasts come and go, but we and our remaining rabbits stay, and they, the rabbits, look into our eyes. 12) More trust and openness between all concerned. 13) Knowledge of how individuals uses their home range and how / if they distribute into vacant areas, also a lack of national conservation strategy / consensus. 14) Lack of cooperation and coordination between all parties concerned and funding for conservation efforts. 15) Preservation and restoration of suitable habitat. 16) The continuing loss of its natural habitat resulting in fragmentation of habitats and populations with genetic implications and the ignorance concerning the animal.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "de91e3b9-c55f-4fc0-9741-33e7d17e69d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "de91e3b9-c55f-4fc0-9741-33e7d17e69d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

The lack of a coordinated management strategy requires the expansion of the National Riverine Rabbit Coordinating Committee, and it taking formal responsibility for the implementation of the goals and objectives identified by the Riverine Rabbit PHVA Workshop. Information collection, processing and distribution were identified as essential for the informed and coordinated implementation of conservation strategies. This process would also identify gaps in knowledge that would serve to identify future research priorities. 37 RIVERINE RABBIT (Bunolagus monticularis) Population and Habitat Viability Assessment Workshop 27 \u2013 29 July 2000 Final Report Photo by: Kai Collins Threats 39 Threats and Impacts . 1. Habitat degradation and loss-this was covered by the habitat group - Fragmentation \u2013 Habitat / Genetic - Bush encroachment - Alien plant invaders 2. Predators - Natural - Jackal - Lynx - Black & Marshall Eagle - African wildcat - Introduced -Dogs - Cats 3. Capacity-this was covered by the Management & Strategies Group - Institutional - Research - Landowner collaboration 4. Lack of environmental awareness-this was covered by the Management & Strategies Group -Lack of co-operation and knowledge between farmers -Inappropriate land use. 5.Catastrophic events -floods -climate change -fire -disease 40 Goals 1. Increase area of suitable habitat 2. Predators: eradicate predation by dogs Conservancies should be established covering the entire range of the Riverine Rabbit. These conservancies must have as one of the mutually decided and occupied rules that no hunting with the use of dogs in the veld be tolerated. 3. Increase capacity and collaboration Create a body that consists of all relevant role-players that can co-ordinate the effects and facilitate collaborations. Institutional capacity: dedicated staff need to be appointed that can facilitate the establishment of conservancies and collaboration. Research funding should be sought for specific projects from local and international funding agencies. 4. Increase environmental awareness. Responsibility of Cape Nature Conservation (Western Cape province) and Northern Cape Nature Conservation Services. 5. Minimise the effect of catastrophic events Flooding: Promote the stabilization of water courses using Phragmites and naturally occurring grasses such as Cynodon. Water courses should also be protected from excessive grazing through the judicious use of fencing and low weirs. Tasks Remaining to be Completed after the Workshop: 1) Fully integrate the Threats Working Group materials into a consolidated report. 2) Clarify any elements that may not be understandable to others who did not attend the workshop. 3) Set responsibilities and time frames for the remainder of the tasks. 4) Identify resources required to complete all tasks. Working group members agree to complete these tasks following the workshop (see Appendix). 41 Executive Summary: Threats (not addressed by other working groups) : 3) The control of dog predation was identified as a major priority to be implemented through the NRRCC, with the cooperation of the existing and future conservancies. 4) Potential catastrophic events that were identified included; flooding, climate change, fire, and disease. Elements that can be controlled to some extent through careful land management included flooding and fire. It will be the NRRCC to promote the use of judicious management techniques that favour the survival of the Riverine Rabbit. The National Riverine Rabbit Coordinating Committee shall include the provincial agencies, South African National Parks, Department of Agriculture, Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, landowners, NGOs, academic institutions, and other interested parties. This group shall take the lead role in promoting and facilitating the conservation of the Riverine Rabbit through a cooperative, inclusive process. 43 RIVERINE RABBIT (Bunolagus monticularis) Population and Habitat Viability Assessment Workshop 27 \u2013 29 July 2000 Final Report Photo by: Kai Collins Census Needs 45 Census Needs Census techniques \u2013 Review A range of possible techniques which may be of value in the censussing of Riverine Rabbit populations were listed as worthy of future examination by the group.

Use of auto-trap cameras These would be set up in potential habitat areas and activated by any animal passing in front of the camera. This is an expensive approach to the problem and has the additional disadvantage that distinguishing individual animals may be impossible. 3. Transect counts of animals from horseback or vehicle. These techniques are already in use within these areas so there has been a certain refinement of these particular methods. MORE DETAILS REQUIRED FROM EXPERTS HERE Comments: 1) & 2) above may be useful in determining a rank index of animals in an area but would require further research if these methods were to be used to try to ascertain NUMBERS of animals in areas. Horseback counts involve some disturbance of animals/habitat as areas of assessed. 46 4. Genetic techniques The possibility of sencussing through genetic identification may be possible. This would require collection of hair/faeces or other products for DNA extraction and might permit identification of numbers of individuals within areas. This could be an expensive process requiring expertise in appropriate genetic technology. B. Invasive techniques IT IS EMPHASIZED AT THE OUTSET THAT RABBITS/HARES ARE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO CAPTURE STRESS AND THAT TRAINING OF OPERATORS IS ESSENTIAL AND PROTOCOL DURATION MINIMISED TO DECREASE RISKS TO CAPTURED ANIMALS. Capture of animals in long-nets and/or cage-traps. Long-nets are hung from short sticks and a line of people walk through habitat towards the net. People stationed at the net quickly remove animals captured into holding bag/box for marking/collection of biological data. The description of a successful technique using this approach is given in the thesis of Duthie (1989). Dual entrance cage-traps would be positioned along rabbit tracks (probably in areas of dense habitat) and would be set (and checked after suitable time intervals) after the rabbits had become habituated to passing through these. Again any rabbits caught would be removed by a trained operator into bag/box for subsequent tagging/data collection. Once captured the animals can be marked with coloured/numbered ear tags, radio-collars or satellite tags for individual recognition/tracking. This marking would assist the sencussing process in that the fate of individuals may be tracked over time and space. Conclusions Further research is urgently required into the development of a standardised sencussing protocol which can be repeated by successive researchers across the species range. The particular problems associated with sencussing this species include its nocturnal activity within dense, low visibility habitat and its high susceptibility to stress on capture. Research should focus on identifying a technique yielding reliable replicability in results with minimal negative impact on the target species. Current experience favours a technique using a combination transect sweep from horseback and on foot through the habitat counting any individuals displaced en route. 47 Recommendations: Research Priorities: \u2022 Standardised and repeatable census techniques for assessing the population numbers of Riverine Rabbits within particular patches of habitat. \u2022 Standardised and quantitative identifiability of the vegetation and soil characteristics of suitable riverine habitat. Execution of the above two research topics needs require close collaboration between property owners, conservation institutions and research scientists at academic institutions. \u2022 The distances of migration and dispersal of Riverine Rabbits and the degree of between-population movements. \u2022 The degree of genetic differentiation between different populations of Riverine Rabbits. \u2022 The population dynamics (including reproductive rates and mortality) of natural populations of Riverine Rabbits. The execution of the above three projects require collaboration between research institutions and property owners. 49 RIVERINE RABBIT (Bunolagus monticularis) Population and Habitat Viability Assessment Workshop 27 \u2013 29 July 2000 Final Report Photo by: Chrizette Kleynhans Captive Population 51 Captive Population Captive breeding as a tool in the conservation of the Riverine Rabbit Captive breeding would have several benefits for the conservation of Riverine Rabbits.

Reintroductions could compromise geographic genetic structuring in this species. \u2022 Captive-bred rabbits could introduce infectious diseases into wild populations. \u2022 Captive-bred rabbits would not necessarily have the behavioural attributes in feeding and predator avoidance, as well as digestive microfauna found in wild rabbits. \u2022 The costly infrastructure required for captive breeding (husbandry experience in combination with suitable holding facilities) is not available at present. \u2022 Experience with Riverine Rabbits in captivity has shown that it is technically very difficult to implement a planned captive breeding programme for these animals. \u2022 There is no compelling evidence that sufficiently large populations exist in the wild so that a sample of 16-32 rabbits could be captured to initiate a captive breeding programme. Recommendation 1 It was decided that, given the lack of knowledge and resources to initiate a captive breeding programme, the negative factors (disadvantages of using wild stock; putting source populations at risk; potentially inbreeding perhaps) by far outweigh the benefits and that it would be unwise to initiate a captive breeding programme. 52 The captive rabbits currently in the Karoo National Park: The reintroduction of Riverine Rabbits into the Karoo National Park (KNP) started with tentative explorations by the park manager, Harold Braack in the mid-80's. This coincided with ecological and genetic studies and the initiation of a captive breeding programme at De Wildt near Pretoria. Investigation showed that Riverine Rabbits did occur historically at Lombardskraal near the KNP. This was deemed sufficient to infer that the animals did occur within the park. Possible sites were investigated. After vegetation surveys and discussion with experts the Sand River section in the park was considered most suitable. This was in line with the policy of S. A. National Parks to reintroduce species that historically occurred in the park. During 1994 six animals (3 male, 3 female) were donated to the KNP. For several reasons, including sex ratios, inbreeding and the recognition that the Sand River section comprises suboptimal habitat, it was decided during 1998 that captive breeding of rabbits in the KNP should be terminated. The question thus arose about the fate of the animals in the KNP. Six possible release sites were considered: \u2022 Return of animals to the farms where the founder individuals were captured, i.e. Sandgat (Victoria West district) and Lapfontein (Beaufort West district). \u2022 Release into available habitat in the KNP. \u2022 Release into suitable, vacant habitat elsewhere. \u2022 Donation of animals to a zoological garden. \u2022 Keeping the rabbits in the present enclosures at the KNP. Four criteria were used to determine a ranking of these possibilities: \u2022 Possibility of introduction of diseases to natural populations. \u2022 Possibility of genetic incompatibilities between captive and wild rabbits. \u2022 Availability of suitable habitat. \u2022 The longstanding relationship between property owners and biologists. Recommendation 2 By far the largest benefit would obtained if rabbits were returned to the original farms where the founder rabbits were captured. These farms have suitable habitat and the goodwill between biologists and property owners would be significantly increased by this action. The farmers will decide among themselves about the allocation of the four rabbits. The physical capture of the four rabbits will be done using capture nets under the supervision of a veterinarian with interest in lagomorphs. Tissue and hair samples of each animal will be collected and forwarded to Prof. Robinson at Stellenbosch University who will sex the animals by karyotype. The handling of animals needs to be minimised and suitable tranquilisers will be used during the handling of the rabbits. The animals will be 53 transported in separate boxes with bedding. The animals would need to be kept in quarantine facilities on the destination farms. The KNP offered to make the fencing material of the present holding facilities available to the farmers. The quarantine camp needs to be situated outside core areas that may have high densities of Riverine Rabbits in order not to disrupt the social organisation of the wild rabbits.

Given that no such differences exist, and if the rabbits have no demonstrable signs of disease, the lifting of the quarantine fencing will be performed. Reintroductions, supplementations and translocations: Recommendation 4 In principle the recommendation from this group would be not to consider any of these as possible management techniques at this point in time. These actions would be premature due to the lack of fundamental life history, demographic, ecological and genetic data. The criteria for these management actions would include information on the causes of decline, reasons for the absence of animals in areas of optimal habitat, genetic compatibility amongst populations in different areas, potential disease introduction, behavioural constraints and other well-established principles. In reference to the geographic population genetic structure we recommend the a broad- scale genetic survey be undertaken including DNA samples collected from extant populations as well as museum specimens collected approximately sixty years ago. Extant populations could be sampled either by non-invasive techniques such as anonymously-collected hairs or faecal samples, or by tissue collected from captured animals. The collection of samples from these extant population will be the limiting factor in terms of setting time frames for completion. In respect of the above principles the specific recommendations for the four captive animals (that we know were derived from two geographically distinct localities) are as follows. These animals are to be confined within enclosures pending the outcome of genetic studies. At a minimum these genetic studies would involve comparisons between the four captive animals and existing museum material including several samples from the species range. However, the optimum genetic studies would include baseline population genetic information from selected study sites throughout the species current distribution. If the genetic studies show that the species exhibits geographical genetic 54 structuring then these animals must not be introduced into areas where they are not genetically compatible. 55 RIVERINE RABBIT (Bunolagus monticularis) Population and Habitat Viability Assessment Workshop 27 \u2013 29 July 2000 Final Report Population Biology and Modelling with an Introduction to Population Modelling 57 Population Biology and Modelling Riverine Rabbit Computer Simulation Modelling Working Group ======================= Terry Robinson Emile Smidt Willem Ferguson Kai Collins Rod Randall Deryn Alpers Diana Bell Main Problems: Inadequate knowledge and data, there is a need to investigate to following parameters: A) Demographic parameters 1.

Inbreeding was not included in the BASE scenario and no catastrophes were included. The BASE scenario, Table 1 Line 1, indicates a high probability of extinction (Pe) under these conditions with a 73% probability of populations extinct in 100 years with a mean time to extinction (Te-yr) of 42 years. This is in spite of positive deterministic (r det) and stochastic growth rates (r stoc). A deterministic model would have indicated that the population is growing under these conditions. In addition the population has lost about 89% of the starting heterozygosity (Het) and is experiencing a high level of inbreeding. The generation time was estimated at 2.4 years (Table 4). With these adult mortalities, the stable age distribution indicates the proportion of adult males to females in the population is reduced to 0.69/1.00. Exploratory scenarios indicated that the outcomes, under these conditions are sensitive to the carrying capacity and to the expected maximum longevity. Increasing the carrying capacity to 50 or 100 reduced the Pe from 0.730 to 0.112 or 0.076 respectively indicating a substantial benefit (Table 1, Lines 2 & 3). There also was 3 to 5 fold increase in the retention of genetic heterozygosity. Reduction of the expected maximum longevity or maximum age of reproduction to 4 years reduced the stochastic growth rate to 0 and increased the Pe to 0.940 with a mean Te of 34 years Table 1, Lines 4-6). Addition of the two catastrophe scenarios, one for floods and the other for drought, to the BASE model (Table 1, Lines 7 & 8) although still yielding positive growth rate values resulted in near 100% risk of extinction with mean times of extinction around 25 years. As might be expected, the additional mortality or decreased reproduction imposed on the baseline conditions hastened and increased the risk of extinction. Similar results were obtained with the addition of inbreeding depression to the BASE scenario (Table 1, Line 9) with 100% probability of extinction and a mean time to extinction of 26 years. . Decreasing the average annual reproductive output from an average of 2 per adult female to 1.6 or 1.4 resulted in negative stochastic growth rates and near 100% risk of extinction. 60 Decreasing juvenile mortality (Table 1, Lines 10 & 11) or adult female mortality (Table 1, Line 12) resulting in a doubling or tripling of \u2018r\u2019 also decreased the Pe but the values still ranged from 30 to 50% in 1200 years. The sum of these simulations indicates that if the carrying capacity of the habitat of these population fragments is near 20 then there is little hope for the persistence of the species. It may be expected that individual populations will disappear with a mean time to extinction of 20-40 years and if they cannot be recolonized by either natural migration or releases then there will be a continuing decline in the total population. must be increased to reduce the risk of extinction. The situation is further complicated by the potential hazards of inbreeding depression which could significantly increase the rate of loss. Increasing the carrying capacity and by inference the potential population size to 50 animals (Table 2) reduces the risk of extinction but does not provide substantial protection against the hazards of catastrophes or inbreeding depression. Reduction in juvenile mortality by a modest amount from 60% to either 50 or 40% provided large benefits in terms of an increase in \u2018r\u2019 from 0.101 to 0.208 or 0.301 respectively and a decrease in \u2018Pe\u2019. Reduction of adult female mortality from 20% to 15% also yielded a small increase in stochastic population growth rate from 0.101 to 0.139 and reduced the Pe from 0.112 to 0.036. Neither improvement is as great as the doubling or tripling in growth rate observed with a decrease in juvenile mortality. Summary and Recommendations: Summary: The probability of extinction of Riverine Rabbit populations with K=20 is high under all conditions explored in these simulations. Inbreeding depression, if it occurs, greatly increases this risk and remains a problem at higher population sizes. Increase of the K to 50 provided substantial benefits in reducing the risk of extinction under ideal conditions. The greatest improvements in growth rates or extinction risks occurred with a reduction of juvenile mortality rates. Recommendations: Measurement of first year mortality and its causes and efforts to reduce that rate to 50% or less in combination with a minimal expansion of the carrying capacity of individual population fragments to 50 animals appear to offer the most effective management strategies to improve the prospects for survival of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cb0bbb4-9760-4c1c-834a-1ac506e65e1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cb0bbb4-9760-4c1c-834a-1ac506e65e1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

We use models in all aspects of our lives, in order to: (1) extract the important trends from complex processes, (2) permit comparison among systems, (3) facilitate analysis of causes of processes acting on the system, and (4) make predictions about the future. A complete description of a natural system, if it were possible, would often decrease our understanding relative to that provided by a good model, because there is \"noise\" in the system that is extraneous to the processes we wish to understand. For example, the typical representation of the growth of a wildlife population by an annual percent growth rate is a simplified mathematical model of the much more complex changes in population size. Representing population growth as an annual percent change assumes constant exponential growth, ignoring the irregular fluctuations as individuals are born or immigrate, and die or emigrate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a18abcfc-5c4b-4be8-a663-7e3d8e584f82": {"__data__": {"id_": "a18abcfc-5c4b-4be8-a663-7e3d8e584f82", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

A detailed description of the exact changes in numbers of individuals, while a true description of the population, would often be of much less value because the essential pattern would be obscured, and it would be difficult or impossible to make predictions about the future population size. In considerations of the vulnerability of a population to extinction, as is so often required for conservation planning and management, the simple model of population growth as a constant annual rate of change is inadequate for our needs. The fluctuations in population size that are omitted from the standard ecological models of population change can cause population extinction, and therefore are often the primary focus of concern. In order to understand and predict the vulnerability of a wildlife population to extinction, we need to use a model which incorporates the processes which cause fluctuations in the population, as well as those which control the long-term trends in population size (Shaffer 1981).

Models of population dynamics which incorporate causes of fluctuations in population size in order to predict probabilities of extinction, and to help identify the processes which contribute to a population's vulnerability, are used in \"Population Viability Analysis\" (PVA) (Lacy 1993/4). For the purpose of predicting vulnerability to extinction, any and all population processes that impact population dynamics can be important. Much analysis of conservation issues is conducted by largely intuitive assessments by biologists with experience with the system. Assessments by experts can be quite valuable, and are often contrasted with \"models\" used to evaluate population vulnerability to extinction. Such a contrast is not valid, however, as any synthesis of facts and 70 understanding of processes constitutes a model, even if it is a mental model within the mind of the expert and perhaps only vaguely specified to others (or even to the expert himself or herself). A number of properties of the problem of assessing vulnerability of a population to extinction make it difficult to rely on mental or intuitive models. Numerous processes impact population dynamics, and many of the factors interact in complex ways. For example, increased fragmentation of habitat can make it more difficult to locate mates, can lead to greater mortality as individuals disperse greater distances across unsuitable habitat, and can lead to increased inbreeding which in turn can further reduce ability to attract mates and to survive. In addition, many of the processes impacting population dynamics are intrinsically probabilistic, with a random component. Sex determination, disease, predation, mate acquisition -- indeed, almost all events in the life of an individual -- are stochastic events, occurring with certain probabilities rather than with absolute certainty at any given time. The consequences of factors influencing population dynamics are often delayed for years or even generations. With a long-lived species, a population might persist for 20 to 40 years beyond the emergence of factors that ultimately cause extinction. Humans can synthesize mentally only a few factors at a time, most people have difficulty assessing probabilities intuitively, and it is difficult to consider delayed effects. Moreover, the data needed for models of population dynamics are often very uncertain. Optimal decision-making when data are uncertain is difficult, as it involves correct assessment of probabilities that the true values fall within certain ranges, adding yet another probabilistic or chance component to the evaluation of the situation. The difficulty of incorporating multiple, interacting, probabilistic processes into a model that can utilize uncertain data has prevented (to date) development of analytical models (mathematical equations developed from theory) which encompass more than a small subset of the processes known to affect wildlife population dynamics. It is possible that the mental models of some biologists are sufficiently complex to predict accurately population vulnerabilities to extinction under a range of conditions, but it is not possible to assess objectively the precision of such intuitive assessments, and it is difficult to transfer that knowledge to others who need also to evaluate the situation. Computer simulation models have increasingly been used to assist in PVA. Although rarely as elegant as models framed in analytical equations, computer simulation models can be well suited for the complex task of evaluating risks of extinction. Simulation models can include as many factors that influence population dynamics as the modeler and the user of the model want to assess. Interactions between processes can be modeled, if the nature of those interactions can be specified. Probabilistic events can be easily simulated by computer programmes, providing output that gives both the mean expected result and the range or distribution of possible outcomes. In theory, simulation programmes can be used to build models of population dynamics that include all the knowledge of the system which is available to experts. In practice, the models will be simpler, because some factors are judged unlikely to be important, and because the persons who developed the model did not have access to the full array of expert knowledge. Although computer simulation models can be complex and confusing, they are precisely defined and all the assumptions and algorithms can be examined. Therefore, the models 71 are objective, testable, and open to challenge and improvement.

PVA models also have weaknesses and limitations. A model of the population dynamics does not define the goals for conservation planning. Goals, in terms of population growth, probability of persistence, number of extant populations, genetic diversity, or other measures of population performance must be defined by the management authorities before the results of population modelling can be used. Because the models incorporate many factors, the number of possibilities to test can seem endless, and it can be difficult to determine which of the factors that were analyzed are most important to the population dynamics. PVA models are necessarily incomplete. We can model only those factors which we understand and for which we can specify the parameters. Therefore, it is important to realize that the models probably underestimate the threats facing the population. Finally, the models are used to predict the long-term effects of the processes presently acting on the population. Many aspects of the situation could change radically within the time span that is modeled. Therefore, it is important to reassess the data and model results periodically, with changes made to the conservation programmes as needed. The VORTEX Population Viability Analysis Model For the analyses presented here, the VORTEX computer software package (Lacy 1993a, Miller and Lacy 1999) for population viability analysis was used. VORTEX models demographic stochasticity (the randomness of reproduction and deaths among individuals in a population), environmental variation in the annual birth and death rates, the impacts of sporadic catastrophes, and the effects of inbreeding in small populations. VORTEX also allows analysis of the effects of losses or gains in habitat, harvest or supplementation of populations, and movement of individuals among local populations. Density dependence in mortality is modeled by specifying a carrying capacity of the habitat. When the population size exceeds the carrying capacity, additional mortality is imposed across all age classes to bring the population back down to the carrying capacity. The carrying capacity can be specified to change linearly over time, to model losses or gains in the amount or quality of habitat. Density dependence in reproduction is modeled by specifying the proportion of adult females breeding each year as a function of the population size. VORTEX models loss of genetic variation in populations, by simulating the transmission of alleles from parents to offspring at a hypothetical genetic locus. Each animal at the start of the simulation is assigned two unique alleles at the locus. During the simulation, VORTEX monitors how many of the original alleles remain within the population, and the average heterozygosity and gene diversity (or \u201cexpected heterozygosity\u201d) relative to the starting levels. VORTEX also monitors the inbreeding coefficients of each animal, and can reduce the juvenile survival of inbred animals to model the effects of inbreeding 72 depression. VORTEX is an individual-based model. That is, VORTEX creates a representation of each animal in its memory and follows the fate of the animal through each year of its lifetime. VORTEX keeps track of the sex, age, and parentage of each animal. Demographic events (birth, sex determination, mating, dispersal, and death) are modeled by determining for each animal in each year of the simulation whether any of the events occur. (See figure below.) Events occur according to the specified age and sex-specific probabilities. Demographic stochasticity is therefore a consequence of the uncertainty regarding whether each demographic event occurs for any given animal. VORTEX requires a lot of population-specific data. For example, the user must specify the amount of annual variation in each demographic rate caused by fluctuations in the environment. In addition, the frequency of each type of catastrophe (drought, flood, epidemic disease) and the effects of the catastrophes on survival and reproduction must be specified. Rates of migration (dispersal) between each pair of local populations must be specified. Because VORTEX requires specification of many biological parameters, it is not necessarily a good model for the examination of population dynamics that would result from some generalized life history. It is most usefully applied to the analysis of a specific population in a specific environment. Further information on VORTEX is available in Lacy (1993a) and Miller and Lacy (1999). Dealing with Uncertainty It is important to recognize that uncertainty regarding the biological parameters of a population and its consequent fate occurs at several levels and for independent reasons. Uncertainty can occur because the parameters have never been measured on the population; limited field data have yielded estimates with potentially large sampling error; independent studies have generated discordant estimates; environmental conditions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25d87f62-ee95-4bc7-a37a-c3f7060200e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "25d87f62-ee95-4bc7-a37a-c3f7060200e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

If alternative plausible parameter values result in divergent predictions for the population, then it is important to try to resolve the uncertainty with better data. Sensitivity of population dynamics to certain parameters also indicates that those parameters describe factors that could be critical determinants of population viability. Such factors are therefore good candidates for efficient management actions designed to ensure the persistence of the population. The above kinds of uncertainty should be distinguished from several more sources of uncertainty about the future of the population. Even if long-term average demographic rates are known with precision, variation over time caused by fluctuating environmental conditions will cause uncertainty in the fate of the population at any given time in the future. Such environmental variation should be incorporated into the model used to assess population dynamics, and will generate a range of possible outcomes (perhaps represented as a mean and standard deviation) from the model. In addition, most biological processes are inherently stochastic, having a random component. The stochastic or probabilistic nature of survival, sex determination, transmission of genes, acquisition of mates, reproduction, and other processes preclude exact determination of the future state of a population. Such demographic stochasticity should also be incorporated into a population model, because such variability both increases our uncertainty about the future and can also change the expected or mean outcome relative to that which would result if there were no such variation. Finally, there is \u201cuncertainty\u201d which represents the alternative actions or interventions which might be pursued as a management strategy. The likely effectiveness of such management options can be explored by testing alternative scenarios in the model of population dynamics, in much the same way that sensitivity testing is used to explore the effects of uncertain biological parameters. Results Results reported for each scenario include: Deterministic r -- The deterministic population growth rate, a projection of the mean rate of growth of the population expected from the average birth and death rates. Impacts of harvest, inbreeding, and density dependence are not considered in the calculation. When r = 0, a population with no growth is expected; r < 0 indicates population decline; r > 0 indicates long-term population growth. The value of r is approximately the rate of growth or decline per year. The deterministic growth rate is the average population growth expected if the population is so large as to be unaffected by stochastic, random processes. The deterministic growth rate will correctly predict future population growth if: the population is presently at a stable age distribution; birth and death rates remain constant over time and space (i.e., not only do the probabilities remain constant, but the actual number of births and deaths each year match the expected values); there is no inbreeding depression; there is never a limitation of mates preventing some females from breeding; 74 and there is no density dependence in birth or death rates, such as a Allee effects or a habitat \u201ccarrying capacity\u201d limiting population growth. Because some or all of these assumptions are usually violated, the average population growth of real populations (and stochastically simulated ones) will usually be less than the deterministic growth rate. Stochastic r -- The mean rate of stochastic population growth or decline demonstrated by the simulated populations, averaged across years and iterations, for all those simulated populations that are not extinct. This population growth rate is calculated each year of the simulation, prior to any truncation of the population size due to the population exceeding the carrying capacity. Usually, this stochastic r will be less than the deterministic r predicted from birth and death rates. The stochastic r from the simulations will be close to the deterministic r if the population growth is steady and robust. The stochastic r will be notably less than the deterministic r if the population is subjected to large fluctuations due to environmental variation, catastrophes, or the genetic and demographic instabilities inherent in small populations.

N -- mean population size, averaged across those simulated populations which are not extinct. SD(N) -- variation across simulated populations (expressed as the standard deviation) in the size of the population at each time interval. SDs greater than about half the size of mean N often indicate highly unstable population sizes, with some simulated populations very near extinction. When SD(N) is large relative to N, and especially when SD(N) increases over the years of the simulation, then the population is vulnerable to large random fluctuations and may go extinct even if the mean population growth rate is positive. SD(N) will be small and often declining relative to N when the population is either growing steadily toward the carrying capacity or declining rapidly (and deterministically) toward extinction. SD(N) will also decline considerably when the population size approaches and is limited by the carrying capacity. H -- the gene diversity or expected heterozygosity of the extant populations, expressed as a percent of the initial gene diversity of the population. Fitness of individuals usually declines proportionately with gene diversity (Lacy 1993b), with a 10% decline in gene diversity typically causing about 15% decline in survival of captive mammals (Ralls et al. 1988). Impacts of inbreeding on wild populations are less well known, but may be more severe than those observed in captive populations (Jim\u00e9nez et al. 1994). Adaptive response to natural selection is also expected to be proportional to gene diversity. Long- term conservation programmes often set a goal of retaining 90% of initial gene diversity (Soul\u00e9 et al. 1986). Reduction to 75% of gene diversity would be equivalent to one generation of full-sibling or parent-offspring inbreeding. 75 RIVERINE RABBIT (Bunolagus monticularis) Population and Habitat Viability Assessment Workshop 27 \u2013 29 July 2000 Final Report Participants PARTICIPANT LIST Name Affiliation/ Dept and address Tel Fax e-mail Joan Human Landowner 053 6121104 Box 63, Victoria West, 7070 Ian Human Landowner 053 6121104 Box 63, Victoria West, 7070 J.F. van Wyk Landowner 0202 121802 Box 47, Loxton, 6985 L.

OPENING 1.1 T. Marshall welcomes and thanks everybody for coming 1.2 Present: T. Marshall CNC (chairman) L. Muller NCNC N. Loubscher NCNC C. Kleynhans CNC V. Ahlmann ZSCSP G. Palmer CNC P. Lloyd CNC J. Human Landowner G. Visser Landowner 1.3 Apologies: J. Coen R. Randell N. Badenhorst J. Bekkersmith M. Scholtz G. Visser (Sen) N. Jacobs J. du Toit D. Alpers T. Robinson K. Collins J. Espling 2. MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING 2.1 Corrections: 2.1.1 The breeding of rabbits in Mexico was only used as an example by V. Ahlmann, not suggested for future breeding of the Riverine Rabbit. 2.1.2 The conservation idea to be forwarded by the two chairmen will be submitted to DEAT and by informing all relevant parties. 2.1.3 Domestic dogs are still a problem in Riverine habitat. Acceptance of Minutes: Minutes accepted by N. Laubscher & C. Kleynhans 3. POINTS ARISING FROM PREVIOUS AGENDA 3.1. The captive breeding programme report, as promised by National Parks (E. Smidt) is still outstanding, with present information deficiency. A letter will go forward from the chairmen to obtain either processed (as promised) or unprocessed data from National Parks before the next NRRCC. 90 4. FIXED AGENDA POINTS 4.1. Monitoring: Projects status NCNC did RR surveys during May 2000 as well as presentations to Williston Farmers Union and another Farmers Association. The habitat looked at in the Ceres Karoo was investigated with results of relatively suitable habitat. Mr. Human also mentioned rumours of RR released historically in the Ceres Karoo. Five farms with conservancy boards were also discovered for which no records are available. Me. Kleynhans will investigate this issue further with Mr. Martin who would possibly know about this. The relevant farms are: Roodekruis / Saaifontein / Maanhaarskraal / Vastrap / Bakovenskraal. ZSCSP checked the Ongeriver/ Groenriver and Pampoenpoort and confirms Duthie\u2019s report of optimal habitat. No rabbits were found however. Kalkfontein and Klein Brakriver was also done with two people. Two newspaper articles were also placed and released. CNC gave training to National Parks educational training staff. Radio interviews were also done. Habitat evaluation of 13 farms took place as well as a survey during June 2000. Conservancy starters meeting was also held. 4.1.1 Monitoring: Projects - Future: NCNC Future projects of NCNC include a to survey of the Sakriver from Western Cape border to Williston during December. CNC Future projects include the Carnavon and Victoria-west area. ZSCSP Future projects are presently waiting for funding from WWF before any actions can be taken. 4.1.2 Monitoring: Research Presently research is being done by K. Collins and T. Robinson. These two projects, for reference sake will have to go through the application process. This application will be added as addendum in the PHVA document as an example. V. Ahlmann is to approach these institutes, and the research project proposals will to be presented to the NRRCC of the next meeting. The fact that projects must be approved by the NRRCC should be spread by all NRRCC members especially to inform the landowners of this as well. 4.2 Environmental Education The chosen EE working group will address all the needs of the PHVA as listed in the document in this regard.

NCNC also has fourteen new conservancy boards for landowners. CNC has one single landowner \u201cconservancy\u201d no existing registered conservancies, but two conservancies starting. The Kromriver conservancy has already had their initial meeting. Discussions were conflicting in ideas concerning conservancies and present management thereof. The following was concluded: NCNC gives landowners recognition by conservancy member boards to single landowners and recognizes them as provincial conservancies. Me. C.

A flyer for specifically RR conservancies will have to be compiled. C. Kleynhans will compile the draft as soon as possible. 4.4 The captive rabbits are presently in temporary cages on Mr. Human\u2019s farm. It was suggested that these rabbits may be used for environmental education purposes if the tests shows that they will not be able to be released; otherwise they will be released. If a project proposal to breed is to be presented prior to the release of the rabbits, it will be considered by the NRRCC, otherwise it presently stands on the decisions made during the PHVA. Definitions and regulations regarding captivity will be forwarded to Mr. Human by Miss Kleynhans at his request. 5. NEW POINTS 5.1. Adoption of PHVA workshop was dealt with in PHVA meeting. 5.2. Conservation Association: Mr. Human is the motivation for this Association. The principle of the association is to get all landowners together from the whole distribution area. The Association already has an account and funds raised will be used for logistics. This Association will have conservancy committee members on board. Mr. Marshall expressed the need for an independent facilitator on the Association, with reference to the already functional Conservancy Forum in Outeniqua area. His request for a seat on this Association was 92 accepted. Conservation will be invited as a body, the specific representative will be delegated within the organization itself. 5.3 NRRCC: It was decided to forward letters to all present members that are listed, but that do not attend meetings. This is to inquire who wants minutes and who will still be actively represented at the meetings. A suggestion came forward to have one chairman, it was however decided that the present situation is functional and effective as it is. It was decided that the NRRCC will have three meetings a year, instead of two. One of these will be an Annual General Meeting. 6. Next meeting will be held 02 February 2001. The schedule for meetings for the rest of 2001 is as follows: 10 July 2001 21-22 November 2001 (AGM) 7. Closing 93 ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION GROUP MEETING George / 06 October 2000 WELCOME PRESENT: V. Ahlmann N. Laubscher C. Kleynhans POINTS OF DISCUSSION: Environmental education priorities as listed in the PHVA were discussed and relevant actions delegated. 1. STANDARDIZING OF EDUCATION PROGRAM Target groups were established for environmental education. It was decided to compile one comprehensive slide presentation to serve for all the listed target groups. Only exhibitions for public (e.g. during Expo\u2019s / shows) will have different material. The target groups are: Farm labourers Farmers / farmers unions and associations Conservancies Schools General public - exhibitions One copy of the slides for this presentation will be made for each EEG member with funding from WWF. All parties must collect as many good quality slides as possible of the topics listed for the next meeting. A list of the topics for slides is attached. 1.1 The present presentation will be forwarded by C. Kleynhans for editing and comments. 1.2 It was decided to wait until the opportunity to have an exhibition presents itself before compiling the material for this. 2. EE., MEDIA MATERIALS AND, DISTRIBUTION 2.1 Brochure will be discussed with communication section of CNC during January. 2.2 Poster will be discussed with communication section of CNC during January. 2.3 Video: copies will be made for all EEG members of the two 50/50 videos. 2.4 Conservation games were also discussed for schools. A Riverine Rabbit puzzle will be discussed in the future. 2.5 Website: Mr. Muller is working on this, information from the slide presentation can be used in the webpage as well. 2.6 Newspapers/Radio: a list of NCNC to be forwarded to C.

TJ Robinson): A species for which there is significant concern both from a demographic as well as genetic perspective is the Riverine rabbit, Bunolagus monticularis. This endemic Red Data Book leporid survives in the dense discontinuous karoid vegetation in the central Karoo of South Africa, an area though to be approximately 86km\u00b2 in size which is linearly distributed along the seasonal rivers in this region. Censuses conducted in 1989 in two discrete sections of typical habitat yielded densities of 0.064 and 0.166 riverine rabbits per hectare (Duthie et al 1989).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8aab0b1-06c4-48ee-8acf-6c1a7220b45a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8aab0b1-06c4-48ee-8acf-6c1a7220b45a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

In historic times its range was known to be far larger but habitat surveys suggest that it has disappeared from large tracts of it historic range due to the impact of agricultural development in the region (Robinson 1981). In spite of sporadic attempts at captive breeding (see Dippenaar and Ferguson 1994), conservation efforts have had limited success in placing the species on a more secure footing and increasingly conservationists are looking to in situ measures to ensure its long term survival. Pivotal in this approach will be the need to determine the levels of genetic variation within and among remnant populations of the species. Moreover, it is now possible to quantify the genetic variability of historical populations (represented by museum specimens) and their living descendants and thus assess the rate at which genetic variation is being lost in fragmented populations. Consequently, when determining heterozygosity levels in endangered populations we will make use of museum specimens (~N=30) collected in the early part of the last century.

These and other data from the study will provide management guidelines for the identification of source populations in restocking programmes (once the causes for declines have been unequivocally identified), estimates of current population size, the distances of migration and dispersal of riverine rabbits, and connectivity and/or discreteness of populations along water courses. Approach: Genetic factors which affect small populations can involve the loss of overall diversity due to reduced allelic diversity and heterozygosity. Small populations can also experience inbreeding and the possibly associated inbreeding depression. In small populations random genetic drift will cause the reduction of allelic diversity and heterozygosity (immigration and mutation will tend to increase genetic variation) with allelic diversity expected to reduce faster than heterozygosity. While at the individual level, the levels of heterozygosity and the degree of inbreeding may affect fitness and survivability, at the population level, however, reduced genetic variation lowers the potential adaptability to novel selective forces (Lande and Barrowclough 1987; Sherwin and Murray 1990). We intend to using both mitochondrial and nuclear markers in this investigation since population structure within a species can vary over time (or between sexes) and different patterns may be observed when different genetic systems are examined. The phylogeny of mitochondrial haplotypes can be used to infer long-term gene flow, while nuclear DNA patterns of local differentiation can indicate more recent population subdivision (Moritz and Lavery 1996). Differences in mitochondrial and nuclear DNA patterns may also indicate gender-specific dispersal due to the maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA. We will use PCR based analysis in both instances. The intention is to amplify and sequence the 5' portion of the variable control region (d-loop) using conserved primers. Since we anticipate that the bottleneck associated with the current census numbers will have a significant impact on haplotype diversity we will initially screen PCR products using SSCP; distinct haplotypes will subsequently be sequenced. Microsatellite markers, initially developed for use in the European rabbit (Bell, University of East Anglia, unpublished) will be tested for usefulness in B. monticularis and used for estimating levels of genetic heterogeneity and gene flow between isolates as well as for assessing patterns of population structure. Since we will of necessity have to rely (at least in most instances) on hairs collected remotely in the field and museum specimens as our source of DNA, PCR-based methods are essential. Given the species' endangered status we will need to rely on non-invasive sampling techniques for assessing genetic variation in extant populations. The utility of hairs as samples for population genetic studies was investigated by Alpers (1998) in her study of the hairy nosed wombat Lasiorhinus latifrons and we will 99 follow her approach by using hair-collection tapes positioned at the mouths of Riverine rabbit breeding burrows. Alpers reported that hairs collected from hair-collection tapes would probably be more reliable than shed hairs and would not be subject to the problems of allele dropout and false allele amplification that have been observed with the limited quantity of DNA obtained from shed hairs and faeces (Taberlet et al. 1996, Gagneux et al. 1997). In the case of museum specimen we will extract DNA from teeth/skin following Hagelberg (1994), a protocol with which we have had good success in previous studies (Robinson et al. 1996; Robinson and Matthee 1999). Given the risk of contamination when working with degraded museum specimens (Austin et al 1997), we will adopt procedures routinely used in our laboratory for this type of DNA. Among others these include DNA extractions in a separate DNA-free laboratory, multiple extractions, the temporal separation of the amplification and sequencing of museum specimens from taxa represented by fresh tissue and, finally, we will check to ensure that the data make phylogenetic sense. Allele frequencies will be determined by direct counting. Observed heterozygosity and unbiased estimates of expected heterozygosity will be computed for all locus/population combinations (Nei 1987). Deviations from Hardy- Weinberg expectations and linkage disequilibrium will be tested using GENEPOP version 3 (Raymond & Rousett 1995). To condense the genetic variation revealed, principal component analysis will be used as described by Carvalli-Sforza et al (1994).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd50d4f9-8170-4094-b899-a92036f52d3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd50d4f9-8170-4094-b899-a92036f52d3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/riverine-rabbit-bunolagus-monticularis-population-and-habitat-viability", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Riverine rabbit (Bunolagus monticularis) population and habitat viability assessment workshop.

In September 1994, IUCN convened a joint workshop in Mombasa, at which the Coast Development Authority (CDA) and the Pangani Basin Water Office (PBWO) met and agreed on joint activities to manage the cross-border ecosystem of Lake Jipe. They were then were commissioned (by IUCN with GEF/UNDP support) to compile assessment reports and identify management issues affecting Lake Jipe from either side of the Kenya-Tanzania border. These reports were completed in 1996. The purpose of the Lake Jipe Cross-Border Planning Workshop on Developing Mechanisms for a Trans-Boundary Management of a Shared Ecosystem was to follow-up on the recommendations of the two assessment reports by CDA and PBWO. The three-day workshop, which was held between October 13th -16th in Moshi (Tanzania) and Taveta (Kenya) was attended by 22 stakeholders from different professional backgrounds and institutional affiliations from both Kenya and Tanzania - at national, district and local levels. The objectives of the workshop were: \uf0b7 to bring together various stakeholders to exchange views on management needs and priority actions, \uf0b7 to acquaint the participants with the conditions of the Lake Jipe ecosystem, \uf0b7 to develop a project concept and management strategy outlining the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders, \uf0b7 to develop an initial basis for a logical framework for intervention. The assessment reports by CDA and PBWO were presented and discussed on the first day of the workshop, while the second day was dedicated to a field visit to both the Tanzanian and Kenyan sides of the Lake Jipe ecosystem.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d4dd13c-102b-42bb-8243-7096891e030f": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d4dd13c-102b-42bb-8243-7096891e030f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9cf05a4069153e672992c105af102a1e231ff0db74540af64b83a1f4a3037b2c"}, "2": {"node_id": "39f8f0e2-9d16-4a5d-ac25-d96e2d6624b2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "046500fa4b154af16e5ef6ad1265beff7f68c420f958bc98dc05e591504cae75"}}, "hash": "efc46b2243d05f559670c4ee45d4b5cdb09ff5ca8beca0ce2202a4c9711f010f", "text": "On the third day, participants reviewed the information gathered and deliberated on the best way forward in formulating a joint management plan.

G.W.Howard, Report Editor Jipe Workshop Report 4 INTRODUCTION Lake Jipe straddles the border of Kenya and Tanzania and has a complex drainage basin in both countries involving Mt Kilimanjaro and the Pare Mountains. The lake and its wetlands are of international importance as a home to a diverse fauna (including many palaearctic migrant birds, intra-African migrants and large mammals) and flora as well as providing support to many people on both sides of the international border. The Jipe catchment and lake are beset with management problems that include reduced runoff, increasing siltation, decreasing water quality, a shrinking fishery and advancing wetland plants that threaten the existence of the open waters. At the same time, the lake and its surrounds are seen as areas of potential agricultural development while the waters of the drainage basin are being investigated as sources urban supply and expansion of irrigation. The lake and its wetlands are also a major source and storage for the waters of the Pangani River - the second-most important river in Tanzania for hydropower generation, water supply and irrigation. Both Tanzania and Kenya have expressed the need for watershed management in their own countries as well as a coordinated approach to wise use of the catchment, wetlands and waters of this shared resource. This proposal outlines the characteristics of the Jipe system, describes the needs for management and suggests a programme to develop a management strategy that involves both countries. Lake Jipe and its Wetlands Lake Jipe is situated south-east of Mt Kilimanjaro in the Coast Province of Kenya and in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania at about 3o35' South and 37o45' East. The open water area of the lake is approximately 10 km long and 3 km wide and is surrounded by varying widths of lake- edge swamps: from 2 or 3 m on some parts of the Kenyan shore to 1 or 2 km on the eastern (TZ) side. The northern end of the lake is now a vast area of swamp which extends up the incoming Lumi River and down the outflowing Ruvu River. The lake is just above 700 m a.m.s.l. and is shallow, with a depth of around 2 m. It is slightly sodic as some of its water runs off the ancient volcano of Mt Kilimanjaro; it currently has a conductivity of around 800 \u00b5S/cm. Lake Jipe is one of the few shallow freshwater lakes in the region and is second only to Lake Naivasha in animal and plant diversity in Kenya. The vegetation of the lake and fringing swamps is dominated by bulrush (Typha domingensis) which grows out from the lakeshore and forms floating \"islands\" as well as lining the lake edges.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce1dfee2-43e1-4fb5-896c-a2f4a46ebfde": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce1dfee2-43e1-4fb5-896c-a2f4a46ebfde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "036cfc507dc372737c948434c4a1890661cabb2eab38db3b17167f7c3f57ddc1"}, "2": {"node_id": "4534e986-fbaa-407b-aed8-c355da7bd7b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d59be717d31dd0af3a191ed4ffb8a6ec361594d01c8558cb24a060fba13cdac"}}, "hash": "93218a3fa9a57e3000799f4f6b284ade11a400a9587334410f6f8622a7df5467", "text": "This plant evidently thrives in the Jipe waters, despite their sodic content, as it grows to over 5 m high and is very dense.

Lake Jipe is well known for its waterbirds and is one of the few places in this part of Eastern Africa where the Lesser Jacana and the Purple Gallinule are common and where the Madagascar Squacco Heron, Black Heron, African Darter and African Skimmers are often seen. Many Palaearctic migrant waders visit these wetlands as do inter-African migrant waterbirds. The lake shares the endemic tilapia Oreochromis jipe with the Pangani River system and has a significant fishery based upon this species as well as a barbel fish and the sardine Rastrineobola argentea. Jipe Workshop Report 5 Hippopotamus are present in Lake Jipe and waterbuck occur on its margins. The southern half of the lake in Kenya is in Tsavo West National Park where it is both a watering and feeding resource for elephants, buffalos and other ungulates from the adjacent dry plains - such as zebra, giraffe, oryx and smaller antelopes and gazelles. Otters are known from the lake as are crocodiles and water monitors. The lake is important to the (wild and domestic) fauna of a wide area around it because it is a permanent source of water and green vegetation throughout the long dry seasons. There are around 50 species of submerged, emergent and floating plants in the lake and wetlands and an abundance of climbers that use the bulrushes and papyrus for support. The Jipe Drainage Basin Mt Kilimanjaro (5895 m) is the largest and tallest single-standing mountain in Africa with a very large volcanic cone which retains snow all year round, despite its position so near the equator (at around 3o South). There is rainfall and snow melt on the mountain in every month of the year with resultant runoff and subsurface drainage. Mt Kilimanjaro is in a generally arid area of Eastern Africa so that much of the runoff does not extend far from its slopes, especially to the north and east. Nevertheless there is surface runoff from the eastern slopes of the mountain which feeds into the Lumi River and flows to Lake Jipe in those seasons when there is sufficient local rainfall to maintain this river. The slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro are all in Tanzania while the Lumi River runs through Kenyan territory, past the town of Taveta to the lake. The Lumi is also fed by subsurface waters from Mt Kilimanjaro, some of which reach the river through springs. The quality of water from these springs is sufficiently high to provide both urban and irrigation supplies within Kenya and Tanzania and there are many irrigation canals in the area to the north of Lake Jipe. The Lumi enters Jipe through a large Typha swamp which may exceed 20 km2 in area and which blends into the swamps of the Ruvu River, the exit for the lake waters. The other main source of water for Lake Jipe is the Pare Mountains in Tanzania. These are primarily metamorphic in origin (i.e. not volcanic) and are high enough (highest point 2113 m) to have permanent streams flowing to their bases. Several such streams from the eastern side of the North Pare mountains reach Lake Jipe, either above or below ground, while others flow only during the wet seasons. Some flows probably enter the lake from the southern end of these and the South Pare Mountains, when the Kirurumo River flows to the lake through its southern swamps. There is virtually no inflow from the western side of the lake where the Serengeti Plains (not the plains of Serengeti National Park) in Kenya's Tsavo West National Park, are arid and very flat. Several small hills near the northern part of the Kenyan shore produce occasional runoff to the lake via stream beds that are dry, red, sandy channels for most of the year. The subsurface waters make a large, but unknown, contribution to the water balance of Lake Jipe. The lake maintains a fairly constant level throughout the year, despite the existence of a marked bimodal rainfall. This level is partly regulated by the outflow from the Ruvu River, which passes through a very extensive swampy area with almost no slope before becoming a true river near Kifaru. This swamp, which is dominated by papyrus, covers at least 35 km2 and is in both Kenya and Tanzania as the river \"channel\" is the international border.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ef4c23e3-abd4-487b-afc1-b5f45c7e6e1c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ef4c23e3-abd4-487b-afc1-b5f45c7e6e1c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ad7b16f2d8dc46aa65e54715a80f2157161a869cb6011908bfc6dc31ba291a1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b5977b5-25c0-4b3c-b513-d7049f38d7d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0897db492eb11a08e37231aee0e1a256660f5e825ccd700a44663ece28379934"}}, "hash": "7e7b3ed2aa0d8b25bc6e7233e53fc92817f127d9dfab0d2075ab030c0237e0bf", "text": "The Ruvu then flows westwards to Nyumba ya Mungu reservoir where it joins with waters from the southern and western sides of Mt Kilimanjaro and from Mt Meru to become the Pangani River.

The Pangani is a very important river in Tanzania, both for irrigation, water supply and hydropower generation as well as for its Jipe Workshop Report 6 contribution to the productivity of the coastal area in Tanga Region - through nutrients, sediments and water to the mangroves and other marine ecosystems. Values and Uses of the Jipe Wetlands Hydrologically, Lake Jipe acts as a water storage organ for the Ruvu River (and so for the Pangani River as well). The swamps of the lower Lumi River act as sediment traps for the floodwaters so that some suspended material is deposited before the water reaches the lake. The (mainly papyrus) swamps of the upper Ruvu River serve another function of water \"purification\" in the sense that they extract salts from the Jipe outflow so that by the time the water reaches the open channel of the Ruvu near Kifaru, its conductivity has fallen to around 200 \u00b5S/cm. This \"freshening\" of the Ruvu water is especially important as it then mixes with the sodic waters of the Kikuletwa River in Nyumba ya Mungu dam and counteracts the alkalinity of that water for the Pangani downstream. Thus the storage in Lake Jipe, its slow release throughout the year and the removal of salts in the papyrus swamps all combine to ensure a constant supply and good quality of water for the Pangani River. There are many uses made of the waters and wetlands of Lake Jipe - that are of both direct and indirect benefit to the people of the region. The main uses are: \u00a7 commercial and subsistence fisheries in the lake and swamps (there were several large fishponds on the lake edge in the past), \u00a7 transport on the lake by boat, \u00a7 tourism on the lake and the attraction of wildlife to the lake which enhances tourism and is the reason for siting several tourist facilities nearby, \u00a7 water supply to homesteads either directly or from wells fed by the lake water system, \u00a7 irrigation from the lake and from the rivers and channels leading to the lake, \u00a7 water supply for livestock (goats, sheep, cattle), \u00a7 harvesting of both papyrus and Typha reeds for thatching, roof, fence and screen building and mat and basket making; harvesting of lake and swamp-edge palm fronds for fish traps, fences and other building materials, \u00a7 honey production from wetland trees and riparian plants. Tsavo West National Park has its border within the waters of Lake Jipe. This allows access for many terrestrial wildlife species to the wetlands and waters of the lake edge while providing protection for the large mammals and crocodiles that inhabit the open waters of the lake. The lake and swamps are important refuges as well as feeding and breeding grounds for local and migrant birds while providing habitats for many species of wetland plants (phytoplankton, herbs, shrubs and trees), fish, amphibians, reptiles and invertebrate animals. The lake and wetlands probably provide refuges for the wildlife of Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania, which is 20 km Jipe Workshop Report 7 away to the south-east. In dry years and in dry seasons the wetlands provide not only water but also green grazing for both wildlife and domestic livestock from a wide area around the lake. Current Problems and Management Needs The main change in the nature of Lake Jipe and its wetlands over the last forty years has been the increase in silt loads that enter the system. This caused the lake level to rise slightly while the depth of the lake has decreased (at least at the northern end) and the edge swamps have spread into the open waters of the lake. There has probably been a slow increase in alkalinity or sodic content of the waters as evidenced by the virtual disappearance of water lilies from the lake. Lake Jipe was renowned in East Africa for being the best place to see Pygmy Geese, a species of wetland bird that favours areas with water lilies. Photos of the lake surface and swamps from the late 1970s show water lilies among the Typha swamps - but these seem to have disappeared, together with the Pygmy Geese - probably due to increasing conductivity of the Jipe waters. District and development authorities and residents on both sides of the international border are worried about these trends and attribute them to increasing erosion in the watershed of the Lake and consequent siltation of the wetlands.

The proliferation of reeds all around the lake edges may also be caused by the rise in conductivity as other wetland plants (such as water lilies) are forced out and Typha predominates. This spread of reeds into the lake is now regarded as a serious problem of weed infestation as it not only reduces the amount of open water but prevents access to the waters for fishing and transport and reduces the options for fishing. The high levels of erosion and silt transport are partly due to the steep nature of most of the drainage basin of Jipe as well as to the preponderance of heavy rain showers on the upper slopes. Deforestation is probably affecting this process on the upper parts of both Mt Kilimanjaro and the Pare Mountains. Increased grazing pressure may also contribute to this siltation, especially on the lower and sandier slopes. There is also a suggestion that road and railway construction and the harvesting of stone and soil in the catchment has affected the surface flows so that they now carry more silt. Thus while the erosion of soils in the Jipe drainage basin and the siltation and shallowing of the lake are natural processes, they are being hastened by human activity. The flow of water from the upper catchment on Mt Kilimanjaro and the Pare Mountains has also been decreased in the last decades as more and more water is diverted from the permanent streams - for homestead and village water supply and irrigation. There is therefore need to modify this human activity by integrated management of both the watershed and the wetlands of Lake Jipe. Several management options exist for reducing deforestation, grazing pressure, erosion and siltation as well as for monitoring and managing water quality and quantity. But at present the problems stretch from one side of the international boundary to the other (and back again!) and so will need cross-border coordination and joint planning. Jipe Workshop Report 8 Prospects and Progress for Cross-border Management In Kenya the Coast Development Authority (CDA) has the mandate to coordinate and plan developments in Coast Province which includes the drainage basin and waters of Lake Jipe. Together with the District of Taita Taveta, CDA held a workshop in April, 1993, to discuss the issues of Lake Jipe and the needs for management of the watershed and the wetlands. Many of the issues above were mentioned and it was resolved that CDA should work towards a comprehensive management and development plan for the watershed on the Kenyan side of the border as well as looking into ways of managing the specific problems of the lake. CDA felt that there should be cooperation with authorities with similar mandates for management of the Jipe watershed and wetlands in Tanzania. In Tanzania the Pangani Basin Water Board (PBWB) has the mandate to manage the waters of the Pangani River Basin from the uppermost parts of the watershed to the ocean. The Water Board works through its Pangani Basin Water Office (located in Hale, Tanga Region) to control and manage the waters of the basin and to regulate their uses. PBWB has recently been concerned about the watershed and water balance of Lake Jipe and its contributions to the greater Pangani system. In September, 1994, CDA and PBWB met at CDA's headquarters in Mombasa, Kenya to discuss common interests and possible ways of working together to develop a coordinated management system for the watershed, wetlands and open waters of Lake Jipe. During 1996 both CDA and PBWB finalised summary assessments of management needs for the Jipe catchment and wetlands and are preparing reports on the information needed for a future water budget. This exercise was coordinated by the IUCN Wetlands Programme in Eastern Africa and funded by the GEF project on Biodiversity Conservation in East Africa. The intention is to bring the two agencies together soon to discuss their findings and then to make plans for national and joint activities for the better management of the Jipe system. Thus the present workshop was planned to accommodate stakeholders and their views from both sides of the border. It was prepared by IUCN with assistance from the East African Wild Life Society and funded by the Netherlands Government through the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Nature management in Nairobi, Kenya and through IUCN's Wetlands Programme.

Objectives of the Workshop 1. Bring together the two countries of the Lake Jipe ecosystem. 2. Consult with major stakeholders, including farmers and fisherfolk. 3. Share experiences and develop a mutual understanding of the benefits and opportunities. 4. Underscore the importance of Lake Jipe to the surrounding human population. 5. Discuss findings of assessment reports on management needs. 6. Design a plan for national and joint management activities. Outcome of the Workshop The workshop process brought together people from both countries to participate in building mutual trust, understanding and consensus to recognise issues that are of common interest. Through workshop deliberations, an agreement was reached to develop comprehensive strategies for the management of Lake Jipe as a shared ecosystem. The workshop identified a set of activities and priorities for a trans-boundary management. WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS DAY 1: EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON MANAGEMENT NEEDS AND PRIORITY ACTIONS The first day of the workshop was for exchange of views on management needs and priority actions between the regional management authorities, district officers and relevant NGOs. Most participants who had arrived the day before at the Lutheran Hostel in Moshi, the venue of the first day of the workshop, began registration at 8:30 a.m. This process was guided by Edith Mbigi of IUCN. (see Appendix 2) Jipe Workshop Report 10 1. INTRODUCTIONS 1.1. Self-Introductions Registration was followed by self-introductions during which participants gave their name, institutional affiliation and position held in their respective institutions. 1.2. Opening Speech The Regional Administrative Secretary of Kilimanjaro Region (or his deputy) was expected to make an official opening speech on behalf of the Government of Tanzania. Since the appropriate official was not present at the start of the meeting, the workshop programme continued in the hope there would be a \u2018later official opening\u2019. Next, it was an opportunity for the NGO partners, IUCN and EAWLS, who were the workshop co-organisers, to give the background of the workshop. 1.2.1. The World Conservation Union - IUCN: Geoffrey Howard, the Wetlands Programme Coordinator for the IUCN Eastern Africa Regional Programme gave the background of the workshop. He said that it is IUCN\u2019s unique way of working across borders and bringing together various stakeholders in forums such as this that demonstrates the organisation\u2019s strength as a Conservation Union. Because of its regional spread, IUCN found itself best placed to marshal support of both Tanzania and Kenya to address the environmental challenges facing Lake Jipe. According to Dr. Howard, in 1992, IUCN recognised the value of Lake Jipe, (including its wetlands and the watershed) as an ecosystem of international importance. Lake Jipe was unique because of its geographical location, biodiversity, endemism, catchment drainage characteristics, agricultural potential, importance to livestock and wildlife, and as a reservoir of the Pangani River through the River Ruvu. In spite of this importance, the entire ecosystem had been changing and deteriorating, posing a significant threat to sustainable exploitation of its values and products. And Lake Jipe being an ecosystem straddling two countries, Kenya and Tanzania, the major challenge became: \u201cHow do we formulate a plan to manage a cross-border resource?\u201d In 1994, IUCN organised a cross-border forum for the two principal management authorities - each on either side of the border - concerned with Lake Jipe ecosystem. Coast Development Authority (CDA) and the Pangani Basin Water Office (PBWO) were statutory institutions involved with Lake Jipe and its catchment on behalf of their respective governments. Here in Mombasa in September 1994, it was agreed that each institution should carry out an assessment study of the values and functions of Lake Jipe, its watershed and wetlands. These studies were completed in 1996. In an attempt to answer the cardinal question: \u201cHow do we manage a cross-border resource?\u201d, IUCN secured part funding from the Royal Netherlands Embassy, Nairobi, to conduct a cross-border workshop in Moshi and Taveta (the remainder of the funding came from IUCN's resources).

The Society has field offices in Wundanyi (Taita Hills) covering forest conservation activities of the Eastern Arc Mountains forests, of which North Pare and South Pare mountains are the southern watersheds of Lake Jipe. Lake Jipe too falls within this area and description. The Society has interests in Lake Jipe because of its regional constituency, and the need to work on community conservation through mediation and advocacy. The Society\u2019s prime example of working with communities was its consultative process on the Tana Delta controversy in Kenya. Becha said that the Society\u2019s Tana Delta conservation education, awareness and community mobilisation programmes will be unique experiences to draw from for the Lake Jipe management planning process. Though the Society became involved in the Lake Jipe initiative because of its various programmes, it would also like to see an ecosystem management approach, which will take into account the human dimension. In order to achieve this goal, the Society would undertake to encourage consultation with identified target groups and stakeholders, initiate dialogue and promote mediation towards developing a bankable management process. It is the hope of the Society that through this workshop, the partners in the entire process will build capacities for formulating an integrated Management Plan of the Lake Jipe Ecosystem. Jipe Workshop Report 12 2. PRESENTATION OF ASSESSMENT REPORTS 2.1 Coast Development Authority by Dr. B. J. Mwandotto & Musyoki Muthuka. Lake Jipe, which is in Taveta Sub-district of Voi District is within Coast Province. It falls under the jurisdiction of Coast Development Authority. CDA compiled an assessment report on management needs of Lake Jipe, which was presented at the workshop. The Management Needs Assessment Report described the topography, drainage and catchment characteristics of the watershed, wetlands and open waters of Lake Jipe on the Kenyan side. In addition, it highlighted water balance issues which include abstraction for irrigation, water in-flow, the system\u2019s storage capacity and out-flow from the system. Other highlights in the report include socio-economic issues, land-use patterns and threats, biodiversity and water abstraction. The Report described Lake Jipe catchment basin on the Kenyan side as facing innumerable challenges from continuous development of irrigation schemes, and mining of sand and stone. Some of the factors threatening the ecological integrity of Lake Jipe, according to the Report, include establishment of new settlement schemes, upstream water abstraction for irrigation and domestic use. Already there were 21 water supply schemes, and agriculture is expanding at a very fast rate. Additional human needs had stimulated deforestation, which together with over-grazing, were causing soil erosion, eutrophication and poisoning of the Lake Jipe ecosystem. The immediate impact of these activities on the ecosystem included the depletion of a once flourishing fishing industry in the 1970s. Several management needs for Jipe catchment were described in the CDA report in response to problems and challenges identified above, which included resource use conflicts and human-wildlife conflicts. However, to address these problems, a cause-effect analysis needed to be carried out for the entire catchment basin on both sides of the international border. The Report also recognised that there would be problems resolving issues raised above where there were inter-sectoral policy conflicts, especially with regard to the land tenure system. However, it was hoped that the newly founded East African Cooperation would become facilitative and supportive on cross-border issues, such as the conservation and development of Lake Jipe.

It proposed new programmes and provided a basis for cross-border collaboration and cooperation. The report recommended the following elements for the cross-border collaboration and cooperation: establishing frameworks for cooperation; exchanging information; building a data-base for catchment conditions on hydrology, hydrogeology, water quality, meteorology, and ecology; formulating and implementing an international legal framework on management of a shared ecosystem. However, to do this, Tanzania and Kenya must first draw-up an agreement or a Memorandum of Understanding on how to manage the shared ecosystem. During the writing of its report, PBWO carried out a stakeholder analysis to complement the management needs assessment regarding development programmes in the Pangani catchment. The analysis concluded that human activities, especially agriculture, had more negative impact on the Lake Jipe\u2019s ecosystem. 2.3 Discussion on Presentations Discussions were held after each presentation, where several issues were raised, some of which were responded to by the presenters. During the discussions, cards and felt-pens were distributed to participants to write their reactions, which were then posted on the flip-chart board for classification. Issues raised on the cards included institutional arrangements and need to strengthen capacities of the local resource users. They suggested development of alternative resource uses (such as promotion of eco-tourism) and identification of alternative sources of income, building of a research base for the Lake Jipe natural resource inventory. Common problems affecting both sides of the border in terms of resource utilisation due to policy conflict were recognised. An example of such conflicting policy, which needed harmonisation across the border, was fishing regulations. Jipe Workshop Report 14 Generally, identification of conservation and management issues revealed specific management gaps which needed to be addressed if the Lake Jipe ecosystem were to maintain its desired ecological integrity. Filling these gaps would entail: \uf0b7 Evolving possible mechanisms for cross-border co-ordination and joint management; \uf0b7 Identifying management and development needs for Lake Jipe\u2019s watershed, wetlands and open water; \uf0b7 Identifying a set of acceptable activities and priorities for future actions and plans. It was emphasised that the roles and responsibilities of specific management authorities from either side of the border needed to be identified. This could be accomplished through a stakeholder consultation process initiated by IUCN and its NGO collaborating partners. After this plenary session, every effort was made to address these concerns - in Moshi, during the excursion, and on the third day in Taveta. All these concerns were explored in more detail through small group discussions and plenary sessions. In the end, the basis for a Project Proposal was firmly established as this report has shown. 2.4 Categorisation of Issues Management issues identified during the plenary session were pooled into five categories. These included: 1. Research 2. Management 3. Policy 4. Coordination 5. Socio-economics. 2.5 Presentation of Group Reports In the third session, participants were divided into syndicate groups to define and refine elements in each category of the management issues listed above. The reports were presented by group rapporteurs: 1. Research: The \u2018Research Group\u2019 made the following observations: a) that because of little, sporadic and uncoordinated research efforts on Lake Jipe, a serious information gap has emerged. As a result, different people hold different views on almost all issues, which science could easily verify; Jipe Workshop Report 15 b) that efforts of CDA and the PBWO (through IUCN\u2019s support) in compiling background information about Lake Jipe on various aspects, was the first major step towards bridging the existing information gap; c) that lack of adequate baseline data was a major constraint in any management decision- making processes. Therefore, essential research areas for baseline information were identified as hydrology and biodiversity of the Lake Jipe ecosystem.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b6d6a9d-b201-4776-bcc9-c887fd7ef03d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b6d6a9d-b201-4776-bcc9-c887fd7ef03d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33d941dc9e705a31db8cc1ba5a5b87beee2689dd94802aca0858e0905e2570f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "5eee36ab-a755-4893-8ee2-071484f518e9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94a778cb559889fa09bd91ff59e6926a17263898a41532db9fa2fe1b55c49649"}}, "hash": "d72b786821b7b182b5de73eadc87392b2eb3ff179f71f1a1ccef282c353f2e00", "text": "A. Hydrology of Lake Jipe Because of the inadequate hydrological information on Lake Jipe, the group recommended that it was necessary to: \uf0b7 initiate water-balance studies to determine the water quantity (inflows, outflows and retention) and hence build a water-use budget; \uf0b7 carry out a physico-chemical analysis of water quality to determine its suitability for domestic, livestock, wildlife, agricultural, and/or industrial use; \uf0b7 estimate rates of sedimentation in the lake and inlet rivers; \uf0b7 build up data on rainfall, evaporation and evapo-transpiration rates. B.

Management Issues The group discussing management issues suggested that: a) the initial management area for Lake Jipe and its wetlands must first be delineated and defined within physical boundaries such as perimeter roads. Ideally, delineation may start with a small manageable area around the lake itself. However, in future, and as more resources become available, delineation could be expanded to include upstream ecosystems along the inlet rivers of the watershed. b) the capacity-building efforts for the local people living within and outside the catchment area should be strengthened in order to achieve a high and quick turn-over of response within the implementation of the management plan. Such capacities could be built through: \uf0b7 formal training such as seminars and workshops for leaders; Jipe Workshop Report 16 \uf0b7 informal training forums such as public meetings, barazas and newsmedia. Functional literacy approach could be employed to enhance communication. c) target communities and stakeholders must be involved in the entire management planning process to ensure a participatory approach. d) a masterplan for an integrated natural resource and environmental management process should be developed. e) management plans of all the different stakeholders should be integrated and harmonised to ensure sustainable use of resources by the different communities. Implementation of such an integrated management plan would take into account cultural and traditional practices of host communities. f) adequate control, monitoring and regulatory mechanisms for upstream abstractions from surface springs and groundwater must be put in place to ensure a sustainable flow of water into the lake. g) alternatives to total dependence on wetland products should be considered, especially where the project\u2019s activities would affect the livelihood or income-generation capacities of community members. 3. Policy The group deliberating on policy issues said there was an urgent need to develop a Regional Policy on Shared Natural Resources. Perhaps this could be effected through the East African Co- operation agreements. Initiation of such a Regional Policy might call for formation of a co- ordination body to oversee sustainable utilisation of shared resources. A three-tier structure was proposed for such a coordination mechanism: a) The first tier, at the top of the hierarchy, would be the umbrella Regional Co-ordination Body with representation from IUCN, EAWLS, and representatives of national conservation bodies, such as Kenya Wildlife Service (in the case of Kenya). Any other members, including funding agencies, would be co-opted as observers or advisers, and such members would hold no voting rights. b) The second tier of the hierarchy would constitute individual National Co-ordination bodies, one for Kenya and the other for Tanzania, perhaps under the aegis of NES and NEMC respectively. These national co-ordination bodies would be concerned with specific individual national policies in their individual advisory and coordination capacities. However, liaison between the two national coordinating bodies would be advisable, especially if certain elements in their policies need consultation and harmonisation. Very important, though, for this particular tier, was the recommendation that each national co-ordinating body should develop and institutionalise a monitoring and evaluation mechanism, to assist in their co-ordination and advisory roles. c) The third tier would involve establishment of separate district-based implementation mechanisms for Taita-Tavetta District in Kenya, Rombo and Mwanga districts in Tanzania. These mechanisms would manage and supervise management programmes Jipe Workshop Report 17 during project implementation and, therefore, should incorporate participation of relevant government departments. It would be useful if these mechanisms incorporated NGOs implementing project activities in the catchment within individual districts. Other candidates for consideration to be incorporated into the third tier would include community-based organisations, representation through business associations and researchers. Provision should also be made for participation of co-opted members whose expertise was deemed necessary. It might also be important to ensure that NGOs represented at the regional co-ordination bodies were also represented in the district implementation mechanisms as co-opted members.

AN OVERVIEW OF VEGETATION TYPES IN LAKE JIPE For the benefit of participants who were not familiar with vegetation characteristics of shallow tropical freshwater systems, Dr. Howard presented a general overview of vegetation types and plant dynamics within such ecosystems. Shallow tropical freshwater ecosystems are often characterised by aquatic plants, some of which are floating while others are submerged and some emergent. Floating plants included Kariba Weed (Salvinia molesta), Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes), Nile cabbage or water lettuce (Pistia stratiotes), Water Lily (Nymphaea spp.) and Duck Weed (e.g. Lemna, Wolffia and Spirodela). Reeds and bulrushes are usually anchored in the soil or substrate beneath the water surface with thewir stems and leaves emergent. Papyrus reeds (Cyperus papyrus), though anchored on the shore, often extends rhizomatous roots into the open water upon which new shoots (culms) and mature inflorescence grow. In shallow edges, Water Hyacinth and Water Lily roots may anchor in the substrate, while their leaves float on the water surface. Dr. Howard recalled that Lake Jipe was once renowned for its floating water plants, especially the Water Lily (Nymphae caerulea), which has since disappeared, perhaps due to the changing water National Co-ordinating Body (Kenya) National Co-ordinating Body (Tanzania) District Implementing Mechanism (Kenya) Taveta Sub-District District Implementing Mechanism (Tanzania) Rombo and Mwanga Districts e.g. Governments, NGOs, CBOs, Commerce, Research & Co-opted Jipe Workshop Report 19 chemistry and lake ecology. The current dominant vegetation type is the Bulrush - Typha domingensis. The T. domingensis predominates on the lake edges and floating islands in the open waters, including the swamp in the upper reaches of the Ruvu River. However, as one goes downstream the Ruvu towards Kifaru bridge, domination of Typha diminishes as papyrus becomes predominant. Sampling the open water of Lake Jipe has shown conductivity at above 800 \u00b5S/cm. Conductivity downstream in the Ruvu River has been determined at 200 \u00b5S/cm towards Kifaru. This decreasing conductivity gradient downstream from the lake corresponds closely to the vegetation transition where the predominance of the Typha reeds diminishes as the papyrus takes over. It could therefore be inferred that Typha is more tolerant to high conductivity (dissolved salts), compared to papyrus and, therefore, these wetland plants are important for water purification, which reduces the conductivity of the water by taking up the dissolved sodium chloride, sodium carbonate and other dissolved salts. Research is yet to determine the exact reasons for the disappearance of the Water Lily but this is likely to be related to increasing conductivity or salinisation of the lake waters. A distinction needs to be made between \"weeds\" and \"water plants\". Weeds are those plants that have become a nuisance to man or the environment.

BRIEFING ON THE FIELD TRIP PROGRAMME FOR DAY 2 After giving the general overview of the wetland vegetation types and characteristics, Dr. Howard gave a briefing on the all-day excursion for the next day.

Summary of the Day\u2019s Deliberations The facilitator summarised the day\u2019s deliberations by first thanking the participants for their active participation and endurance in giving the joint planning process a kick-start. By mixing individual contributions through small group and plenary discussions, every participant had an opportunity in one way or the other to contribute to the workshop deliberations. Jipe Workshop Report 20 Constitution and composition of syndicate groups was deliberate to create a mix for good and balanced synergy. At least in every group there was a Kenyan, a Tanzanian, an administrator, a hydrologist, and a social scientist or generalist. Such mix created good dynamics for joint activities, which was the essence of this planning workshop process. Day One\u2019s sessions ended well after the scheduled time of 1700 hours. DAY 2: VISIT TO THE LAKE JIPE ECOSYSTEM The second day of the workshop was scheduled to acquaint the participants with the conditions of the catchment, wetlands and the lake ecosystem on either side of the border. The journey began at 8:30 a.m. in a convoy of six vehicles. The first stop was at Kifaru hydromet station, where the Moshi-Tanga road crosses the Ruvu River. Here, participants saw evidence that Ruvu River could flood and overflow the bridge (4 meters above regular flow) and noted the hydro-station and the clarity of the outflowing water - probably \"purified\" by passage through the Ruvu swamp. The second stop was at a vantage point near a quarrying activity. Participants were shown the expanse of the Ruvu River swamp, and the predominance of papyrus vegetation. Waterbirds and a mix of wetland vegetation were observed and discussions centred around wetland biodiversity and access to the waters and wetlands. The third stop was at the edge of the swamp where traditional bee-hives were hung on the Yellow Acacia, Acacia xanthophloea. Typha and papyrus vegetation dominated the swamp area at this point, and mudflats on the edges had several other plant species as well as waterbird species such as the Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax), Squacco Heron (Ardeola ralloides), Intermediate Egret (Egretta intermedia) and Black Egret (Egretta ardesiaca). Instructive at this point, though, was the obvious wetland vegetation transition: as one moved towards the open waters of Lake Jipe upstream along the swampy Ruvu River, Cyperus papyrus predominance faded into the bulrushes and other salinity-tolerant reed (sedge) species. Participants visited the lake edge covered by Typha reeds at the fourth stop near the Jipe Village on the Tanzanian side. They held useful discussions with the local community. A. Summary of Discussion with the Community at the Jipe Village An account from the village community revealed that Jipe village was famous during the 1970s for its fishery. Most fisherfolk in the village were migrants from Malawi, who came to the area before Tanzania\u2019s independence in 1961. Fish from the village were sold in places as far away as Tanga and Dar-es-Salaam. The fishery boomed during floods and the industry sustained a buoyant local economy. Today, all that success has been left for history books. A water plant, Typha domingesis, became a weed and too invasive to control. The open water surface, which up to ten years ago used to provide good fishery, became blocked or clogged by permanent weeds or drifting Typha islands. As a result, active commercial fishery (including fish Jipe Workshop Report 21 trade) died, a situation which triggered mass exodus of fisherfolk from the village to Nyumba ya Mungu Dam. Those who stayed back in the village ventured into agriculture and livestock keeping. Agricultural crops in this low potential area include maize, cotton, groundnuts, beans and peas - mainly for subsistence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "75b8769c-800e-49ea-b6cb-ad98eee31cd1": {"__data__": {"id_": "75b8769c-800e-49ea-b6cb-ad98eee31cd1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8987bd4d2dec2f3e24c45e743b2711594b4860d870a56f108be448bc81d59c28"}, "2": {"node_id": "38f74440-3cd5-496b-af73-c32674781de0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "50218ae602f98726fc4a5a5cbddb4f1e413719fb0a0e10df933883ca2cec44de"}}, "hash": "34be6d1eb813b42b3107996122f6a882e3f205755e8a8070497ab1ad1cc0d8c1", "text": "The 150 families resident in the village did not produce enough for food for sale.

Here, the Community Development Officer, Ms Veneranda Sichore, gave the background history of the organisation and plans to the year 2000 and beyond. Ms Sichore noted that although all MIFIPRO\u2019s activities were pegged to donor funding, elements of sustainability had already been built within individuals in the project areas. The project is currently being supported by the Netherlands Organisation for International Development Cooperation (NOVIB). Driving around the southern end of the lake, especially along the eastern edge of the North Pare Mountains, participants saw evidence of intensive irrigated agricultural activities. These were areas where MIFIPRO focused its advisory role. Sixth stop was at the border crossing point between Kenya and Tanzania. A landmark beacon erected almost a century ago symbolised the separation of the two countries. Participants also saw a straight border patrol road, which has since ceased being used or maintained. The group was then in Tsavo West National Park. Seventh stop was at the lake edge inside the Tsavo West National Park where one could see the extent of the open water of Lake Jipe. There was evidence of animal activity, especially elephants and buffalo which came to bathe, feed and drink. A variety of water birds was evident here and on and over the lake. Eighth stop was at the ranger\u2019s camp by the entrance into the Tsavo West National Park. Picnic lunch was served, and it was interesting to see participants mingle with one another to discuss issues affecting management options for Lake Jipe as a shared ecosystem. Elephants came close by and a range of water birds was in evidence at the camping site. The ninth stop was at Kachoro Village, Jipe Location, Taveta, where the local administration had organised the village community to meet workshop participants. Participants introduced themselves before engaging in discussions on Lake Jipe with members of the community. B. Summary of Discussions with the Community at the Kachoro Village This meeting, somehow, turned into a \u201cComplaints Forum\u201d, as the community was under the impression that the workshop group was there to listen and solve their problems concerning exploitation of Lake Jipe resources. Nevertheless, the interaction was fruitful, and in fact, the Jipe Workshop Report 22 workshop group resolved that the joint Management Plan, which is being considered, should address the issues raised by the community. Leading the community in the discussion was Mzee Samson Madagaa, who settled in the village in 1961. Highlights of the issues raised during the Kachoro Village community meeting with the workshop participants included: Typha: \uf0b7 Lake Jipe was infested with Typha sp. (called Mkuruvira in the local language) which was said to have been introduced by a local sisal farmer (Mr Grogan) before it became invasive and spread along the riverbanks, river mouths and shallow lake edges. Today, most of the areas that used to be open water of the lake is covered with weed. \uf0b7 Typha does not have economic or commercial value to the local residents, and even houses thatched using Typha were not durable. \uf0b7 Floating Typha islands were thought to be due to elephants uprooting anchored Typha beds. These floating islands were said to harbour dangerous water snakes and hide-outs for hippos and crocodiles - a menace to the fisherfolk. Fishing: \uf0b7 Though still the main source of income for most local residents, the Typha reed infestation was a major hindrance to the fisherfolk. The wind shifted floating Typha islands, and it was impossible to safely cast fishing nets. Therefore, fisherfolk could no longer engage in profitable commercial fishery, thus limiting their only source of income. \uf0b7 Other factors which were said to have have harmed the fishery since 1972 included soil erosion, siltation, sedimentation and eutrophication from agricultural activities and overgrazing. These factors were also thought to be responsible for the changing water quality which included its increasing salinity. Farming: \uf0b7 Most villagers were squatters. Though the area is marginal, in good years subsistence food crops could be harvested if not raided and destroyed by wildlife. Human-wildlife conflict was a major issue, especially against elephants and hippos which were a menace to crops and humans. Several human deaths in the area were attributed to elephants, crocodiles and hippos.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d78bb3d-a246-4b4d-b80d-8fa19cff36b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d78bb3d-a246-4b4d-b80d-8fa19cff36b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d6e51ff394123cfac51cb71ffc27ceb63b5966d2ef7be351865b1ea7b1ea3cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "beefeefe-ebdf-43af-9ba4-b4362e3e7512", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a310e0df0955207fefb97a7d22ec5da32800b73e8c15b5e375f8413fe7deb697"}}, "hash": "71a8b3594926e84c0c9e99c4b3416e48180a1d2e972a27d092150eaa79ca382a", "text": "Several human deaths in the area were attributed to elephants, crocodiles and hippos.

Jipe Workshop Report 23 The tenth stop was at the Taveta and Holili border crossing to formalise immigration requirements of exit from Tanzania and entry into Kenya. The last stop was at the Chala Lodge for accommodation. DAY 3: DEVELOPMENT OF MANAGEMENT PLAN FRAMEWORK Day Three of the workshop was dedicated to the development of an intervention strategy for the Lake Jipe ecosystem including a management plan strategy involving stakeholders, their roles and possible responsibilities. The initial basis for a logical framework for a project to manage that intervention was also developed. Recap of the Workshop Proceedings The meeting started at 9 a.m., with Geoffrey Howard giving opening remarks regarding the previous day\u2019s experience of cross-border excursion with participation from both Kenya and Tanzania. This was the first time that all concerned had seen both sides of the ecosystem and IUCN was very pleased that it was able to facilitate this overview. The facilitator, Henry Ndede, gave an overview and recap of the workshop\u2019s outcome during the first two days: on Wednesday, October 13 and Thursday October 14. He highlighted the significance of the maintenance of ecological balance of Lake Jipe. Participants were then issued with cards to identify issues of conservation and biodiversity significance resulting from the tour of the previous day. Thirteen issues were listed, and these were classified into five categories viz: a) Land degradation; b) Conservation issues; c) Impact of human activities; d) Conflict resolution; e) Ecological changes. In general, it was observed that development policies formulated at national level without considering indigenous knowledge and ecological settings had significant impact on the natural environment. Other problems could include the impact of large-scale agriculture (e.g. sisal plantations), natural disasters, such as the recent El Nino induced rains, and externalities, such as pollution of waterways upstream. a) Land Degradation Causes of land degradation were said to include: \uf0b7 Human activities (farming, overgrazing, tree harvesting, etc.), \uf0b7 Impact of wildlife on the landscape, \uf0b7 Natural phenomena, such as the El Nino-induced rains. Jipe Workshop Report 24 The effects of land degradation were said to include: \uf0b7 Increased siltation into the lake, \uf0b7 Increased pollution (eutrophication) of the lake, \uf0b7 Reduced depth due to sedimentation. It was noted that certain species have disappeared from the Lake Jipe\u2019s ecosystem, and this was attributed to siltation, spread of weeds, and change in water quality. \uf0b7 Rombo District Land degradation in Rombo District was said to result from overgrazing (by the livestock of the Maasai people), intensive agriculture (by the Chagga people), wildlife tracks, over-harvesting of wood for timber and transhumance of livestock. \uf0b7 Mwanga District Land degradation in Mwanga District was caused by agriculture, river damming, agro-chemicals (fertilisers, pesticides and insecticides), poor cultivation methods causing soil erosion, over- harvesting of firewood and timber products, intensive brick making using wetland soils, extensive wildlife grazing, forest fires and transhumance. \uf0b7 Taveta Sub-district Land degradation in Taveta Sub-district resulted from overgrazing (by Maasai livestock), impact of wildlife on vegetation, creation of unauthorised roads when official roads become impassable, irrigated agriculture, sand and stone mining, agro-chemicals (fertilisers, insecticides and other pesticides), large-scale sisal estates especially Ziwani, bush and forest fires, over-harvesting of firewood and timber products, creation of new settlement schemes along wildlife migration corridors. b) Conservation Issues One of the major gaps identified during the excursion was the lack of sensitisation on the significance of conservation and biodiversity. Communities interviewed were more or less keen to first earn a living before they could think of conservation or biodiversity issues. The group which discussed conservation issues pointed out that when the management plan process is designed, it would be important to link conservation to development. Such a link could be made gender-sensitive and be done through participatory approaches, such as Participatory Learning and Action, which will appreciate and empower traditional conservation practices.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "122be38f-2dc3-4312-9bb8-f6401bf24b1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "122be38f-2dc3-4312-9bb8-f6401bf24b1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a01a434fb3bc8cd508a36b6794d032930e07dbd7cb8becb5f45bd5f352513cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ac86d39-2f7e-49ff-a158-bd18b91a743c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "389ae8fc82ac3f4ddbc030ee13be7c4bc6bca9201102b64e89891aad5edc649d"}}, "hash": "9eda56e5c52ccb757f59b7513e3cb1c60e8d0c0f9f493cf889fed90252324908", "text": "Participatory approaches could start by harmonisation of natural resource conservation policies and policy instrument, such as what fishing gear were authorised and accepted by the Fisheries authorities on both sides of the border. c) Impact of Human Activities Several human activities were identified and their impacts described - these are summarised in the table below: .

Wildlife damaged crops, infrastructure, injured and killed humans, injured and preyed on livestock. People, on the other hand, settled on and near existing wildlife corridors, poached wildlife and encroached on their territories and dispersal areas. Human-Human conflicts were also identified. These included activities, interests and lifestyles one group of people may have which conflict with another group, such as: a) Fishers - livestock keepers conflict: Livestock tracks contributed to soil erosion leading to increased siltation, sedimentation and nutrient input into the lake. This promotes growth of weeds hence hindering fishing activities. b). Fisherfolk - agriculturists conflict: The impact of eutrophication and agro-chemical poisoning of the lake interfered with the fish breeding, hence reduced catch. c). Upstream - Downstream Users Conflict: If upstream users abstract more water, this would obviously affect downstream users. Causes of various conflicts were noted as: \uf0b7 Lack of wildlife watering points within and outside protected areas; \uf0b7 Human settlements within wildlife corridors; \uf0b7 Diminishing natural resource base; \uf0b7 Increased agricultural activity. Some of the conflict resolution measures identified were thought to include: \uf0b7 Electric fencing of the Tsavo West National Park; \uf0b7 Provision of watering points inside and outside the parks for wildlife and livestock respectively; \uf0b7 Provision of alternative settlement areas instead of wildlife corridors; \uf0b7 Formulation of a comprehensive water management policy for the catchment. e) Ecological Changes One major evidence of ecological change was the manifestation and spread of the aquatic weed Typha in the Lake Jipe wetlands and open water. It was thought that causes to this ecological change were: \uf0b7 Siltation and sedimentation; \uf0b7 Nutrient inputs into the Lake. And the effects of these ecological changes included: Jipe Workshop Report 27 \uf0b7 Reduced open water surface available for fishing and other activities; \uf0b7 Decreased commercial fishery.

After this description, participants were divided into syndicate groups to define the Vision, Goal and Purpose of the proposed Lake Jipe intervention probably through an ecosystem management planning project. The reports were then presented at a plenary session by each group through their respective rapporteurs. The most suitable wording for each element was fashoined in plenary. The Purpose was linked to the Goal and would contribute to it, and the Goal was linked to the Vision and expected to contribute towards it also. Jipe Workshop Report 28 Vision, Goal and Purpose The VISION for Lake Jipe was proposed, debated, discussed and agreed to be: \u201cA Lake Jipe ecosystem that meets ecological and social-economic needs in perpetuity\u201d and the GOAL was similarly debated and became: \u201cto jointly manage the Lake Jipe ecosystem for conservation and sustainable use\u201d. The PURPOSE to realise the goal was described as: \u201cto develop an integrated cross-border management system that will ensure conservation and sustainable utilisation of the Lake Jipe ecosystem\u201d. The Vision was realised to be long-term and approachable over ten or more years. The goal, as a way of approaching the vision could become active in a shorter time. The prupose (or project purpose) would focus the intention of the project to work towards the goal and the vision. It was recognised that other actions and processes would and could also contribute to the goal and the vision and that any project developed here should encourage other such actions to work towards the goal and the vision. That is, no project alone could implement the goal and vision without other general support - from the communities, from the local government and from the national governments, NGOs and other interested parties. Results and Outputs In plenary, the outputs or results aimed at achieving the Purpose were defined. These were strategies of designing intervention measures towards the development of a management system for Lake Jipe that would work towards conservation of the natural resources with sustainable utilisation of the ecosystem. Initially there were eleven ideas for results, but these were refined and merged - resulting in the following seven areas: \uf0d8 Cross-border management structure developed. \uf0d8 Capacity built for management including awareness creation. \uf0d8 Policy harmonisation process initiated. \uf0d8 Management information generated and documented. \uf0d8 Management plans developed including land-use practices. \uf0d8 Alternatives to over-use of natural resources developed. \uf0d8 Sustainable project funding mechanisms established and developed. Jipe Workshop Report 29 WORKSHOP CONCLUSION As a preliminary consultative and planning meeting, the workshop was a resounding success. Various pertinent issues were critically discussed and ways forward forged. This is attested to by the various action plans that have been recorded in this Workshop Report. The workshop realised that management challenges facing Lake Jipe were a complex mixture of socio-economic and ecological factors, including reduced runoff, increasing siltation, decreasing water quality, shrinking fishery, advancing water plants, agricultural expansion, demand for urban water supply, and expanding irrigation. The importance of Lake Jipe and its wetlands cannot be gainsaid. As the workshop discovered during the excursion, the lake\u2019s swamps were important reservoir for the Ruvu-Pangani system. They also trapped sediments eroded from the catchment area, purified water for the Ruvu , controlled floods, and provided sanctuary for wildlife, especially birdlife. And from the human use perspective, the Lake Jipe basin provided fisheries; water transport (across the border and within country); attraction for wildlife tourism; water supply for domestic, irrigation and livestock uses; and reeds for fishing gear, building and roofing materials and for artefacts. It was also a good environment for honey production and provided dry season grazing - transhumance. It is therefore incumbent upon the stakeholders in this important resource to take the outcome of this workshop seriously and implement its recommendations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fd9b1854-90c3-422b-842f-8279411cba24": {"__data__": {"id_": "fd9b1854-90c3-422b-842f-8279411cba24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb78c1324bec07f63f2c5412ac74faadfca9f44148fe25f5ccf1885342561b74"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f7d6d65-23cf-41e7-a8c4-63718e264bef", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af10251a3594aea9d777299d4a4deec08c71d25467aaea1eff2631651bb9f6eb"}}, "hash": "ad31802c3b0ee01127f00fecc3fa9473c06e947fb6fe4fa23162f767661820ef", "text": "WORKSHOP RECOMMENDATIONS At the end of the workshop, it was decided that the management plan should do the following during project design, development and implementation: Consultation with Stakeholders \uf0b7 hold a stakeholders meeting to update them on the progress of this initiative;

He suggested the need to identify activities to achieve the desired outputs and that these need to be built into a Project Proposal to be presented to possible donor(s) through IUCN. IUCN would exchange ideas with CDA and PBWO which would liaise closely with NES and NEMC in their respective countries, especially where sub-committees on wetlands exist. The model for cross- border coordination (section 3.2.4) would be expanded by IUCN. In conclusion, Dr. Howard praised the workshop as a strong networking forum, adding that a follow-up would be organised within the next six months. He urged for closer cooperation among stakeholders and underscored the centrality of CDA and PBWO in the ecological management of the Lake Jipe basin - now and in the future. The District Administrative Secretary for Mwanga, gave a vote of thanks before the local District Officer, who was the host in Taveta, closed the workshop. Jipe Workshop Report 31 Appendix 1: Roles and Responsibilities of Different Stakeholders This was important to understand the role and responsibilities of different stakeholders in order to see where they would benefit and assist in developing a management strategy (ecosystem management process) for the Lake Jipe ecosystem. CDA and PBWO are very important stakeholders in the project development process, especially for coordination and communication at the national level. For the purposes of the Lake Jipe\u2019s management planning process, the role of CDA and PBWO would be decided upon during the initial stakeholders meeting. Following are brief accounts on roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders: PBWO: The Pangani Basin Water Office (PBWO) is a regulatory body which allocates water use in consultation with the District Administration Offices. PBWO is not a management authority. Management authority responsibility is vested in other institutions of government, including the District Administrative Offices. PBWO may implement a policy or directive based on advice from NEMC through the Central Government via the district administrations. CDA: The Coast Development Authority (CDA) is among six other statutory authorities established in Kenya. CDA\u2019s mandate spans seven districts in the Coast Province, and its jurisdiction includes the Exclusive Economic Zone. It is responsible for rural development with a vision to improve the standards of living and human condition in Coast Province. CDA is mandated to encourage development in river basins and catchment areas within the Coast Province. NEMC: The National Environment Management Council of Tanzania is a statutory body set up in 1983. Its main objective is to carry out advisory and coordination roles (not implementation) of all environmental issues in Tanzania. It is currently under the Vice President\u2019s Office. The Council is divided into five directorates: \uf0b7 Directorate of Research, Education Extension and Documentation; \uf0b7 Directorate of Natural Resources; \uf0b7 Directorate of Environmental Impact Assessment; \uf0b7 Directorate of Pollution Prevention; \uf0b7 Accounts and Administration. Through these directorates, NEMC can effectively play advisory and coordination roles on policy issues affecting the management of a shared ecosystem such as Lake Jipe. NES: The National Environment Secretariat is a national body mandated with the coordination and policy development of environment in Kenya. It works through the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Environment to develop policies on environment e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c120fdc-fdc2-4c2a-b205-bbd15397644c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c120fdc-fdc2-4c2a-b205-bbd15397644c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Lake Jipe cross-border planning workshop ...on proposal for the development of mechanisms for trans-boundary management of a shared ecosystem : workshop report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6aa1560dbb7ef82738d7f435d9bd47bba9738f8e0abd207da04436c8925baede"}, "2": {"node_id": "c4c47e0b-d005-45f4-922b-ae4ad94e73b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/lake-jipe-cross-border-planning-workshop-proposal-development-mechanisms", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e51d1dab241e3cf6b4dd85bef72df0cdd31384c375b7153d91e423eb5850f143"}}, "hash": "6f1a51022429d1fce0b98eeed5738cfe641c71d2ed3650a7b346f33568d4001e", "text": "the Standing Sub-Committee on Wetlands (currently working on the development of a national wetlands policy).

Jipe Workshop Report 32 KWS is the custodian of the Ramsar Convention in Kenya. It is an active member of the Standing Sub-Committee on Wetlands for the development of a policy on wetlands. Involvement with wildlife conservation in protected areas does not allow KWS time to implement and manage independent projects. As a result, KWS works with NGOs and other relevant sections within the national conservation grid to effect projects. KWS is a major stakeholder in Lake Jipe as Tsavo West National Park borders the south-eastern shores of the lake. Wildlife use Jipe as a watering point, food source and good habitat. IUCN: IUCN is a membership organisation, whose members are governments, or government institutions and NGOs. It has an international spread and is represented in all continents. Locally, IUCN has a regional mandate for conservation of nature and natural resources within ten countries of Eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean. IUCN promotes cross-border cooperation and conservation of biodiversity. EAWLS: The East African Wild Life Society is a regional NGO whose mission is to promote wildlife conservation in East Africa. Representation in the region is high and EAWLS is already recognised by the East African Co-operation with respect to environmental conservation. EAWLS is a membership organisation, whose members are of various categories: corporate, associate, and individual. The Society collaborates with other institutions, including IUCN (of which it is one of its oldest members) to further the environmental and conservation agenda. Other collaborators include KWS, to whom the Society acts as watchdog on conservation issues. MIFIPRO: Mixed Farming Improvement Project (MIFIPRO) started in 1984 as a collaborative effort between COOPIBO (a Belgian NGO), Community Development for Trust Fund (CDTF) of Tanzania and the Mwanga District Council. Its headquarters at Kigonigoni village, is about 50 kilometers from Mwanga District township. At the end of the funding period after ten years, COOPIBO had spent US $ 800,000 on the project. MIFIPRO was then transformed into a Trust Fund in 1994, with a vision to: \u201ca better community of the rural area\u201d. Since 1995 to date, the Fund, governed by Board of Trustees, has been supported by The Netherlands Organisation for International Development Cooperation (NOVIB). MIFIPRO\u2019s mission is: \u201cto contribute to sustainable agricultural and rural development as well as improvement of living conditions of smallholders\u201d. MIFIPRO believes that development responsibility should be in the hands of the beneficiaries. Thus the organisation promotes a bottom-up approach empowering communities it works with through decision-making and active participation at the grassroots. The current MIFIPRO Trust Fund\u2019s activities include: \uf0b7 Agricultural extension: This includes introduction and promotion of cash and food crops, such as sunflower, safflower, lablab and groundnuts; \uf0b7 Improvement of traditional irrigation schemes: Involves on-farm demonstrations on water management, water harvesting techniques and irrigation practices. So far more than 600 farmers have been trained; \uf0b7 Promotion of use of Draught Animal Power: For ploughing, cultivation and weeding; \uf0b7 Livestock improvement by promoting de-stocking and zero-grazing; Jipe Workshop Report 33 \uf0b7 Promotion of conservation and management of natural resources through community afforestation and agro-forestry programmes, soil and water conservation, and creation of buffer zones; \uf0b7 Promotion of income-generating activities to women groups including training in savings and credits, writing project proposals, identifying alternative sources for income- generation; \uf0b7 Support to grassroots organisations, especially empowerment of the small-scale farmer\u2019s groups. The support extends to training in skills such as leadership, management and organisational. Jipe Workshop Report 34 Appendix 2: List of Workshop Participants Dr. B A. J. Mwandotto, Dep.

ECONOMICS AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY INTRODUCTION S ome of our planet's greatest wealth is contained in natural forests, plains, mountains, wetlands and marine habitats. These biological resources are the physical manifestation of the globe's bio- logical diversity, which simply stated is the variety and variability among living organisms and the ecological complexes in which they occur. Effective systems of management can ensure that biological resources not only survive, but in fact increase while they are being used, thus providing the foundation for sustainable development and for stable national economies. But instead of conserving the rich resources of for- est, wedand, and sea, current processes of development are depleting many biological resources at such a rate that they are rendered essentially non-renewable. Ex- perience has shown that too litde biological diversity will be conserved by market forces alone, and that effective government intervention is required to meet the needs of society. Economic inducements are likely to prove the most effective measures for converting over-exploitation to sustainable use of biological resources. ECONOMIC OBSTACLES TO CONSERVATION The fundamental constraint is that some people earn immediate benefits from exploiting biological 1 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y resources without paying the full social and economic costs of resource depletion; instead, these costs (to be paid either now or in the futue) are transferred to society as a whole. Further, the nations with the greatest biological diversity are frequendy those with the fewest economic means to implement conservation programs. They need to use their biological resources to generate income for their growing populations, but problems arise when these resources are abused through mismanagement rather than nurtured through effective management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b61a19c2-98d7-4ccc-b7b5-2c9ea90373d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "b61a19c2-98d7-4ccc-b7b5-2c9ea90373d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Economics and biological diversity : executive summary and guidelines for using incentives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab786576fa0aa4c0fce318838527d5d93ba6822938a626eedf4fb170c6dd7183"}, "2": {"node_id": "aa82c5e3-51c1-4f57-a0a2-f2ad92563fd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce03a772d336bbaef847155b6795419d0621c50d03eb6db123aa232ac8e7d1ec"}}, "hash": "8347707ede4afae0a2d4e60d2c3a028ed99a9f18201417f6350b679edd16eb4a", "text": "Other major economic obstacles to conservation include: \u2022 biological resources are often not given appropriate prices in the marketplace; \u2022 because the social benefits of conserving biological resources are often intangible, widely spread, and not fully reflected in market prices, the benefits of pro- tecting species and natural areas are in practice sel- dom fully represented in cost-benefit analysis; \u2022 the species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services which are most over-exploited tend to be the ones with the weakest ownership; \u2022 the discount rates applied by current economic plan- ning tend to encourage depletion of biological resources rather than conservation; and \u2022 conventional measures of national income do not recognize the drawing down of the stock of natural cap- ital, and instead consider the depletion of resources, i.e., the loss of wealth, as net income.

Approaches for determining the value of biological resources include: \u2022 assessing the value of nature's products\u2014such as fire- wood, fodder, and game meat\u2014that are consumed direcdy, without passing through a market; 2 E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y \u2022 assessing the value of products which are commercially harvested, such as timber, fish, ivory, and medicinal plants; and \u2022 assessing indirect values of ecosystem functions, such as watershed protection, photosynthesis, regulation of climate, and production of soil. Some biological resources can be easily transformed into revenue through harvesting, while others provide flows of services which do not carry an obvious price- tag. However, an ecosystem which has been depleted of its economically-important species or a habitat which has been altered to another use cannot be re-built out of in- come. The costs of re-establishing forests or reversing the processes of desertification can far exceed any eco- nomic benefits from over-harvesting or otherwise abus- ing biological resources, so estimates of the environ- mental costs of depletion need to include costs of the time and effort required to restore resources to their former productivity. Since the value of conserving biological resources can be considerable, conser- vation should be seen as a form of economic development. Assessing values and costs of protecting biological resources provides a basis for determining the total value of any protected area or other system of biological re- sources. Since the value of conserving biological resources can be considerable, conservation should be seen as a form of economic development. And since bio- logical resources have economic values, investments in conservation should be judged in economic terms, re- quiring reliable and credible means of measuring the benefits of conservation. USING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO PROMOTE CONSER VA TION To the extent that resource exploitation is governed by the perceived self-interest of various individuals or 3 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y groups, behavior affecting maintenance of biological diversity can best be changed by providing new ap- proaches to conservation which alter people's percep- tions of what behavior is in their self-interest. Since self-interest today is defined primarily in economic terms, conservation needs to be promoted through the means of economic incentives. Since self-interest today is defined primarily in economic terms, conservation needs to be promoted through the means of economic incentives. An incentive for conservation is any inducement which is specifically intended to incite or motivate governments, local people, and international organiza- tions to conserve biological diversity. A perverse incen- tive is one which induces behavior which depletes biological diversity. A disincentive is any inducement or mechanism designed to discourage depleting of bio- logical diversity. Together, incentives and disincentives provide the carrot and the stick for motivating behavior that will conserve biological resources. Direct incentives\u2014either in cash or in kind\u2014are ap- plied to achieve specific objectives, such as improving management of a protected area. Indirect incentives do not require any direct budgetary appropriation for bio- logical resource conservation, but apply fiscal, service, social, and natural resources policies to specific conser- vation problems. Incentives are used to divert land, capital, and la- bor towards conserving biological resources, and to pro- mote broader participation in work which will benefit these resources. They can smooth the uneven distribu- tion of the costs and benefits of conserving biological resources, mitigate anticipated negative impacts on local people by regulations controlling exploitation, compen- sate people for any extraordinary losses suffered through such controls, and reward the local people who assume externalities through which the larger public benefits. Incentives are clearly worthwhile when they stimulate 4 E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y activities which conserve biological resources, at a lower economic cost than that of the economic benefits received. To function effectively, incentives require some de- gree of regulation, enforcement, and monitoring. They must be used with considerable sensitivity if they are to attain their objectives, and must be able to adapt to changing conditions.

Governments have often instituted these perverse incentives for important political or social reasons, and the impact on the environment is often an external factor. Economic incentives have usually been far more effective in over-exploiting biological resources than conserving them. While incentives to convert forests and other wilder- ness to agricultural uses may have been appropriate when biological resources were plentiful, the process is reaching its productive limits (and indeed has exceeded them in many places). A major step in moving from ex- ploitation to sustainable use is for governments to re- view the impacts of all relevant policies on the status and trends of biological resources. Based on the policy re- view, governments should eliminate or at least reduce policy distortions that favor environmentally unsound practices, discriminate against the rural poor, reduce 5 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y economic efficiency, and waste budgetary resources. Overcoming the damage caused by perverse incentives will require new incentives to promote conservation, ap- plied at a series of levels and in a number of sectors. INCENTIVES WHICH DEPLETE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY Numerous examples can be quoted of government-designed incen- tives which have perversely led to the destruction of biological resources. Outstanding examples: \u2022 A recent study by the World Bank has shown that a series of policies, tax incentives, and legal rules enacted by the government of Brazil in order to ac- celerate the pace of settlement in the Amazon ba- sin has led to massive deforestation which is causing severe environmental problems and the depletion of biological diversity. \u2022 A combination of incentives has made the overstock- ing of grazing land in Botswana a response that is privately rational, and socially expensive. Along with numerous other incentives, artificially elevated prices for beef offered by the EEC has led to an in- crease in the national catde herd to levels that ex- ceed the carrying capacity of the range, leading to reduced populations of wildlife and accelerated soil erosion. \u2022 In Indonesia, overly generous logging agreements that leave most of the rents from logging virgin forests to concessionaires, and excessive incentives to forest-product industries that encourage ineffi- cient investment in wood-processing capacity, com- bine to increase deforestation far beyond what it would be without these policies. Poorly drafted and enforced forestry stipulations are inadequate to en- sure sustainable forestry practices in the face of these powerful incentives. 6 E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y APPLYING INCENTIVES AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL The specific package of available biological re- sources varies considerably from place to place, depend- ing on such factors as soil, rainfall, and history of human use. For the people living in or near the forests, plants and animals provide food, medicine, hides, building materials, income, and the source of inspiration; rivers provide transportation, fish, water, and soils; and coral reefs and coastal mangroves provide a permanent source of sustenance and building materials. Depending on these resources, rural people have typically developed their own means of managing a sus- tainable yield of benefits. Biological resources are often under threat because the responsibility for their manage- ment has been removed from the people who live closest to them, and instead has been transferred to government agencies located in distant capitals. But the costs of con- servation still typically fall on the relatively few rural peo- ple who otherwise might have benefitted most direcdy from exploiting these resources. Worse, the rural peo- ple who live closest to the areas with greatest biological diversity are often among the most economically disad- vantaged\u2014the poorest of the poor. Under such conditions, the villager is often forced to become a poacher, or to clear national park land to grow a crop. Changing this behavior requires first examining government resource management policies to determine how they may stimulate a villager's poach- ing and encroachment. Economic incentives designed to reverse the effects of these policies may provide the best means of transforming an exploiter into a conservationist. Appropriate measures may include assigning at least some management responsibility to local institutions, strengthening community-based resource management systems, designing pricing policies and tax benefits which will promote conservation of biological resources, and introducing a variety of property rights and land ten- ure arrangements. These measures may serve to rekindle 7 E C", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da24b47b-02f9-4247-924c-0f516158aeeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "da24b47b-02f9-4247-924c-0f516158aeeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Economics and biological diversity : executive summary and guidelines for using incentives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30e1a574876507198129b042dd97516750b3304eaa267bb8234bee858741d7da"}}, "hash": "30e1a574876507198129b042dd97516750b3304eaa267bb8234bee858741d7da", "text": "O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y COMMUNITY INCENTIVES FOR CONSERVING BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES Changing the behavior of local people toward biological resources of national concern usually requires a package of direct and indirect incentives, in cash and in kind. Such packages have proven effec- tive in a number of cases, including: \u2022 At the village of Ban Sap Tai, adjacent to Thailand's Khao Yai National Park, creative rural development techniques have encouraged local cooperation in protecting park resources. Most important was the establishment of an \"Environmental Protection So- ciety,\" a community-based NGO which is part credit cooperative, part non-formal education center and part collective business enterprise.

To develop more effective ways of protect- ing the watershed and its biological resources while bringing enhanced benefits to local people, several pilot rural development projects have been designed to maximize self-help, confidence-building and con- trol over resources by the villagers themselves. \u2022 Coastal villages in the Philippines have long been dependent on the productivity of coral reefs, but as traditional management systems break down, overexploitation has increased. A project carried out by Silliman University, USAID and the Asia Foun- dation has enhanced fisheries resources through building new systems of responsibility for resource management in three island villages. traditional ways of managing biological resources which have been weakened in recent years. Which members of a population have their access to biological resources enhanced and which members have it restricted by government policies is of profound importance in determining whether the resources will make a sustainable contribution to society. People liv- ing in and around the forests, wetlands, and coastal zones, often exercise more power than governments over the use of the biological resources, so they should be given incentives to manage these resources sustainably at their own cost and for their own benefit. 9 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y SUPPORT FROM THE NATIONAL LEVEL FOR COMMUNITY-BASED INCENTIVES The biological resources which support the communi- ty are also of considerable interest to the nation and the world. Further, incentives at the local community level are likely to require considerable support from compatible policies at the national level. Biological resources do not occur only in wilderness, and economic incentives may also be used more generally throughout the country to en- courage settlement patterns and production systems that are directed at the sustainable use of the resources of forest, savanna, wetland, and sea. The specific policies required at the national level will derive from what is required at the community level to conserve biological resources.

This is not as easy as it sounds. Many conservation problems are due to divided responsibility among sectoral units, leading to fragmentation, poor coordination, conflicting direc- tives, and waste of human and financial resources. This can only be overcome by examining the impact of deci- sions in one sector on the ability of another sector to depend on the same resources. In most cases, the op- timal balance point where the benefit of considering secondary impacts is overtaken by the cost of doing so lies well beyond the current practice of taking decisions based on a very narrow range of sectoral considerations. INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR INCENTIVES PACKAGES Biological diversity is a public good, and species and ecosystems in one part of the world can provide signifi- 10 E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y cant benefits to people in distant nations. Indeed, some experts believe that far greater benefits from conserving native gene pools, especially in the wilds of the tropics, will be gained by wealthy temperate nations than the often poverty-stricken nations doing the conservation. Further, much of the depletion of biological diversity over the past 400 years or so has been caused by powerful global forces, driven primarily by markets in colonial, and then indus- trial, countries. Because the international community as a whole benefits from conservation, it should contribute to the costs of conserving biological resources. Much of the depletion of biological diversity over the past 400 years or so has been caused by powerful global forces, driven primarily by markets in colonial, and then industrial, countries. An important means for doing so is through the pro- vision of economic incentives from the temperate na- tions to the tropical ones. These can include direct incentives such as grants, loans, subsidies, debt swaps, and food; and indirect incentives such as commodities agreements, technical assistance, equipment, and infor- mation. Development assistance often contains a package of such incentives, including both direct on-the-ground projects and very abstract incentives such as peer pres- sure and public image. FUNDING FOR CONSERVATION INCENTIVES Governments seldom have sufficient capital or labor to manage their nation's biological resources in an op- timum way, even though investments in conservation can be very cost-effective. Conservation programs are usually implemented through resource management agencies who need sufficient and reliable sources of support to implement an effective incentives scheme. Support from government budgets might include national bank loans, initial contribution to revolving funds, the government portion of shared costs, and education and training. 11 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y Some incentives involve little more than an adminis- trative decision or regulation, such as the enactment of a law or monetary policy action, while others involve bilateral agreements or cooperation with international agencies, as in food for work programs. In many develop- ing countries, large externally-supported development projects can often include elements which support in- centives for conserving biological resources. Community development activities may already be in progress in communities located near areas important for conserv- ing biological resources, in which case linkages with changed behavior toward conservation can be incorpo- rated with little additional cost. Additional innovative funding mechanisms for sup- porting incentives include: tax deductability for dona- tions of cash, land, or services; charging entry fees to protected areas; returning profits from exploiting bio- logical resources to the people living in the region; im- plementing water use charges for the water produced by a protected area; building conditionality into extrac- tive concession agreements; seeking support from inter- national conservation organizations; and considering \"conservation concessions,\" similar to those for forestry or mining. The threats to biological resources have such pro- found implications for humanity that governments must take decisive action, and accept that some additional in- vestments will be required. But sustainble development of biological resources will likely be far less expensive than rehabilitation programs, and most conservation ef- forts have proven cost-effective on traditional economic grounds. Action is required at the strategic level, where gov- ernments establish national and international objectives for addressing on a broad front the fundamental prob- lems of degradation of biological resources, and at the tactical level, with specific actions designed to address specific problems. 12 E X E C U T I V E S U M M A R Y PAYING FOR ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES Incentives packages require funds if they are to be effective.

Examples: \u2022 Costa Rica has implemented a wide range of innova- tive funding mechanisms. A large percentage of land acquisition costs for Costa Rican parks has come from the Agrarian Development Institute, which has issued special national parks bonds to expropriate many land holdings. Many other government agen- cies have provided manpower, equipment, and oc- casionally monetary support to park management. Special proprietary funds are used for operating ex- penditures of the conservation authorities, drawing on donations, transfers from other agencies, fees and charges for visitor services and concessions, and a series of fiscal stamps. \u2022 The Luangwa Valley of Zambia is one of the richest wildlife areas in the country. Based on the premise that at least part of the revenues earned from wild- life should be returned to managing the wildlife re- source, a Wildlife Conservation Revolving Fund was established in 1983. Income to the Fund comes from the harvest of hippos, and from auctions among sa- fari hunting companies for the rights to hunt in the Lower Lupande Game Management Area. Forty per- cent of the proceeds are handed over to the local Chiefs for community projects of their choosing and 60 percent is devoted to wildlife management costs. Once economic benefits started to flow to the local villages, the reduced poaching of elephants has led to an increase of their populations to the level where sustainable harvests would far exceed the total costs of effective management programs.

To pro- tect this diversity, 15 protected areas have been es- tablished, covering about 11 percent of the land area. As with many Latin American countries, Ecuador is suffering from significant external debt ($9.4 billion in 1987). After examining the situation, a small group of Ecuadorian professionals organized a private foundation to use the debt crisis as an op- portunity to attract financial resources to be invested in conservation of biological resources. Through do- nations in hard currency, a fraction of the Ecu- adorean external debt will be purchased at discount value on the secondary financial market. Funds in local currency to pay for the debt will be used to support conservation activities. \u2022 The World Heritage Convention has encouraged the Federal Government of Australia to provide subsi- dies to states having World Heritage Properties, to compensate for income which might be lost through cessation of extractive uses. In the case of the tropi- cal rainforests of Queensland, the Federal Govern- ment has offered a package to the state worth some $71.6 million. 14 GUIDELINES FOR USING INCENTIVES To CONSERVE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY INTRODUCTION W hile packages of incentives can work to con- serve biological resources at community, national, and international levels, they are not always easy to apply. The major con- straints faced by an incentives package can include: \u2022 the long period of time between investment in con- servation and return on the investment; \u2022 short-term hardships caused to subsistence resource users who lack alternative livelihoods; \u2022 lack of information on the economic benefits of con- servation; \u2022 lack of sufficient financial resources for conservation, especially in developing countries; \u2022 the problem of benefits from conservation accruing to other countries (international externalities); \u2022 low political payoffs from investments in conservation; and \u2022 weakness of government institutions at local level, with resulting inability to implement effective management. The problems are so serious that governments must take decisive action, and accept that some additional in- vestments will be required; but sustainable development of biological resources will likely be cheaper than reha- bilitation programs, and many\u2014even most\u2014conser- vation efforts have proven cost-effective on the basis of 15 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y traditional economic criteria, when all costs and benefits are considered. Action is required at two general levels: The regional or national plan; and the specific project.

They include details on how incentives packages can be designed and implemented by resource management agencies, and how specific project interventions can be most effective. 16 GUIDELINES FOR CENTRAL GOVERNMENT PLANNERS INTRODUCTION W hile the natural wealth of forest, wetland, and sea has great potential for supporting sustainable development, problems have arisen as governments and local popula- tions have increased their demands on the biological resources. Since future consumption of goods useful to humanity depends to a considerable extent on the stock of natural capital, conservation is a precondition for sus- tainable development. Many of these resources have con- siderable market value, and if managed appropriately their sustained productivity can help support rural and urban communities far into the future. Significant po- litical benefits can ensue. It is apparent that conserving biological resources requires appropriate government policies in many sec- tors, and that using economic incentives will not bring about miraculous cures to society's conservation ills. However, economic approaches can help clarify issues and indicate costs and benefits of alternative courses of action, providing an important tool to governments that are concerned about managing biological resources more effectively. Since governments establish the policy framework within which individuals and institutions operate, they should ensure that the resource management agencies have the policy support which will enable them to carry 17 ECONOMICS AND BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY out their assigned responsibilties. And since human decision-making is usually based on economic thinking, the benefits of linking economics more explicitly with the conservation of biological resources are manifest. GUIDELINE 1: MAKE RAPID INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES In order to develop informed policies on depletion rates, rates of sustainable yield, national accounting sys- tems, and land use planning, all governments should build the capacity to assess the status, trends, and utility of their biological resources. This capacity should include: \u2022 national compilations of the flora and fauna (at least higher plants and vertebrates) contained within the na- tion, in addition to the more usual assessment of stocks of timber, fish, and minerals; where these compilations do not yet exist, development projects might require that rapid appraisal methods be employed\u2014perhaps through the use of indicator species which can pro- vide the optimal return on investment of field time\u2014to ensure that biological resources are being given an ap- propriate level of priority; \u2022 institutionalized biological surveys, perhaps carried out by university departments of biology or similar local institutions, to determine what species occur where and in what numbers, and how these parameters change over time; \u2022 a national program for monitoring the status and trends of biological resources, linked to international systems such as UNEP's Global Environmental Moni- toring System and the World Conservation Monitor- ing Centre (operated by IUCN, in collaboration with UNEP and WWF); and \u2022 regular publication of the available information on sta- tus and trends of biological resources, and the vari- ous forces which are affecting these trends. These efforts will help-governments to recognize the consequences of their development activities on the 18 G U I D E L I N E S F O R C E N T R A L G O V E R N M E N T P L A N N E R S biological resources of the nation, and help identify ex- ternal effects of development projects on biological resources. However, in-depth assessments are time- consuming, and action should not be delayed until \"all the information\" is available; instead, some rapid initial assessments need to be done. Development assistance agencies may be willing to help support such efforts.

The sustainable levels of production of economic benefits from biological resources, including fish, timber, wildlife, medicinal plants, and other goods and services, should be estimated and demands upon benefits planned within those limits. Governments should develop means to assess the true costs of allowing the depletion of bio- logical resources to continue and seek alternative paths toward sustainable development. These factors should be reflected in the prices of forest products and other biological resources. 19 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y The review and formulation of all national policies which have a direct or indirect bearing upon biological resources must therefore: \u2022 estimate the relevant benefits which biological resources can produce; \u2022 treat biological resources as capital resources and in- vest accordingly in preventing their depletion; \u2022 ensure that the objectives of sustainable utilization are met; and \u2022 address the basic needs of the local people who depend on biological resources for their continued prosperity. GUIDELINE 3: ESTABLISH NATIONAL POLICIES FOR MANAGING BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES The incentives which are required to conserve bio- logical resources at the community level usually require commensurate policies at the national level. A national or regional conservation strategy can be an effective means of reviewing such policies, and determining what shifts are required to achieve national objectives for con- serving biological resources. Major policy components of the required integrated action might include the fol- lowing considerations: \u2022 The many economic and financial benefits of inte- grated rural development linked with conservation of biological resources need to be quantified and brought to the attention of policy makers. \u2022 Both conflicts and potential for cooperation between the various activities of agriculture, fisheries, forest- ry, conservation and rehabilitation need to be identi- fied in integrated plans and programs. \u2022 Institutional reform and improvement is often a prerequisite to good design and implementation of in- tegrated sectoral development plans and programs. \u2022 Legislation consonant with the socio-economic patterns of the target group and the natural resources being utilized needs to be formulated, both to institute dis- incentives and to ensure that incentives carry the power of law. 20 G U I D E L I N E S F O R C E N T R A L G O V E R N M E N T P L A N N E R S \u2022 Policies and legislation in other sectors need to be reviewed for possible application to conservation of biological resources and community involvement in such work. \u2022 Effective incentives need to be devised to accelerate integrated development to close any gap between what the individual sees as an investment benefit and what the government considers to be in the national interest. \u2022 The rural population needs to be involved in the de- sign and follow-up of plans and projects, not simply their implementation. Systems of incentives can be designed in a large number of ways, and numerous options exist for coor- dinating these incentives with other national policy ob- jectives. In designing packages of incentives, govern- ments should compare several options, with estimated costs and benefits, for each of the various national ob- jectives being addressed. Systems of incentives need to be supported by suitable machinery for implementing the system, including regulation, enforcement, monitor- ing, and feedback. Systems of incentives need to be supported by suitable machinery for implement- ing the system, including regulation, enforcement, monitoring, and feedback. All government sectors which depend on biological resources should design policies to encourage the sus- tainable use of these resources, possibly as part of the process of preparing a national conservation strategy. In addition, other sectors which have major impacts on bio- logical resources, such as agriculture, commerce, trans- port, and the military, should ensure that their policies are consistent with conserving biological diversity, or at least do not unnecessarily deplete biological resources. Coordinating and controlling natural resource use in order to deal with external effects may require the creation of new agencies with wide-ranging authority over certain aspects of the operations of implementing ministries within a particular region.

Drawing on the latest advances in genetics, popu- lation dynamics, and conservation biology, governments need to state, as a matter of public record, what propor- tion of the current land and water area is intended to be legally protected for conserving biological resources. Such policy objectives can often be incorporated as part of a national protected area system plan or a national conservation strategy; on the basis of such national ob- jectives, governments can measure the costs and benefits of implementing conservation programs effectively. GUIDELINE 4: REMOVE OR REDUCE PERVERSE INCENTIVES A major step in moving from exploitation to sus- tainable use is for governments to analyze the impacts of all relevant policies on the status and trends of bio- logical resources. Such an analysis would involve detailed determination of costs and benefits of direct and indirect values. A major step in moving from exploitation to sustainable use is for governments to analyze the impacts of all relevant policies on the status and trends of bio- logical resources. Based on the policy analysis, governments should eliminate or at least reduce policy distortions such as subsidies that favor environmentally unsound practices, and at the same time discriminate against the rural poor, reduce economic efficiency, and waste budgetary resources. An analysis should be made of incentives provided to promote activities which affect lands important for conserving biological resources, including such measures as tax concessions, credit, grants or indirect incentives such as provision of infrastructure. Future incentives should be designed to ensure a more optimal, sustain- 22 G U I D E L I N E S F O R C E N T R A L G O V E R N M E N T P L A N N E R S able production of a range of benefits as well as an equitable distribution of such benefits. GUIDELINE 5: ESTABLISH A STRUCTURE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES IN THE REGION While those resources contained within stricdy pro- tected areas are usually a government monopoly, bio- logical resources in buffer zones, game reserves, national forests, and communal properties are often \"open ac- cess goods\" and need to be brought into some form of resource-use control. Granting usage rights can often be an effective incentive to control the consumption of a biological resource of considerable national importance. Such products as firewood, medicinal plants, and meat can often be made available to local communities more effectively through direct harvesting than through mid- dle-men, and usage rights can often provide economi- cally disadvantaged communities with highly valued resources. Granting usage rights can often be an effective incentive to control the con- sumption of a biological resource of considerable national importance. Incentives can be used to create an institutional set- ting in which the property rights to specific populations of species of plants or animals are held by a single decision-making unit. Communities, lineages within a community, or other forms of informal cooperatives, have often provided the basis for community-based re- source management systems. Such systems have proven their relevance over time, but are now being over- whelmed by modern incentives for exploitation. To counteract this trend, governments should consider ways and means of implementing incentives which would ena- ble these systems to become effective once again. In ad- dition, community-based resource management systems which are functioning well\u2014such as protection of sacred 23 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y forests, water-use cooperatives, and equitable sharing of access to fisheries and grazing lands\u2014should be strength- ened through being incorporated into the incentives package. The intention of att packages of incentives and disincentives aimed at the local community should be to ensure that the local people steadily enhance their capacity to utilize biological resources in an optimal and sustainable manner. The intention of all packages of incentives and dis- incentives aimed at the local community should be to ensure that the local people steadily enhance their ca- pacity to utilize biological resources in an optimal and sustainable manner. This will often involve self-reliance built on sustainable uses of the biological resources avail- able in the local ecosystems, and will effectively reduce the dependence of rural communities on external inputs. 24 GUIDELINES FOR RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AGENCIES people who", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca3102d7-825b-4cbf-875f-70474dd05696": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca3102d7-825b-4cbf-875f-70474dd05696", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Economics and biological diversity : executive summary and guidelines for using incentives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3240f2a7810d8dae1666a1e967a787105e971c69ae0ef8cbb607fa447da9af43"}}, "hash": "3240f2a7810d8dae1666a1e967a787105e971c69ae0ef8cbb607fa447da9af43", "text": "are affected by how the resource is managed. Fortunately, this perspective is beginning to change and agencies are becoming increasingly aware of the many benefits of working with local communities, and the costs of not doing so. In most cases, local incentives packages for conserving biological resources will need to be ad- ministered by the resource management agency, or at least with the involvement of the agency. The following guidelines suggest how resource management agencies can enhance their capacity to de- sign and implement incentives packages, based on the assumption that they receive the necessary policy sup- port from central government. Where this capacity re- quires improvement, assistance might be sought from various international agencies. Many of the guidelines for designing and implementing development projects affecting biological resources will also be relevant to the resource management agencies. INTRODUCTION M ost natural resource management agencies\u2014 such as departments of national parks, for- estry, and fisheries\u2014have tended to be more concerned with the resource than with the 25 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y GUIDELINE 1: DEVELOP THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR IMPLEMENTING ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO CONSERVE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY Any incentives scheme must be designed within the capabilities of the relevant institutions. In seeking to de- velop that capacity, the management agency should ask the following questions about itself: 1. Does the agency have real coverage of the target areas, and enough staff to both promote the plan and pro- vide the technical assistance, education, and training to carry it out? If not, can the agency gain access to the necessary staff in other ways? 2. Is the necessary inter-agency, bilateral or international cooperation within the capabilities of the executing agency staff? 3. Is the balance appropriate within the agency between headquarters managerial staff and the field staff who are actually implementing the incentives package? 4. Are the field staff sufficiently well trained to be effec- tive workers in community development, as well as in conservation of biological resources? 5. Are the local administrative and decision-making procedures of the agency implementing the incentives package sufficiently decentralized to be effective? 6. Does the institution have solid technical and research data to support field staff? 7. Does the institution have simple, non-bureaucratic procedures with minimum red tape so that incentives can become real tools for sustainable development of biological resources? The answers to these questions will provide the re- source management agency with guidance on how it needs to develop further its capacity to implement in- centives packages. The first step in this process may be to establish a \"Community Development Liaison Offi- cer,\" with the mandate to become familiar with the ac- tivities of all government and NGO agencies in the locality and to seek ways and means of linking those ac- tivities with local and national conservation objectives. 26 G U I D E L I N E S F O R R E S O U R C E M A N A G E M E N T A G E N C I E S GUIDELINE 2: ENSURE COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT IN THE INCENTIVES PACKAGE The foundation of any incentives package is com- munity support, and such support is gained only through involvement. The following elements are essential: Motivation. Potential participants must be convinced that the problem being addressed by the incentives pack- age is a high priority for the community. If farmers are shown that the proposed project can help overcome pres- ent constraints, the results are likely to be positive. This is done by making the community part of the project planning process from the earliest stages, and making them the leading actors throughout the program. Benefits. Both the individual farmer and the larger community must clearly perceive the benefits they will derive from the planned conservation action, either through direct profits from the action or else from the incentives themselves. Information. The community needs to be informed about the incentives package, including its costs and benefits, and any accompanying disincentives. The im- plementing agencies need to clear up any doubts and encourage the rural people to participate fully. The out- come of the promotion campaign should be a better in- formed rural population which participates actively in conservation activities. Viable options. The options offered to rural people need to be accessible, and within the capacity of govern- ment or private enterprise to provide. Solid financial and logistical backing must be guaranteed and any res- trictions to local participation eliminated. Skills.

Determining which incentives will be most useful in stimulating the desired behavior at the community level should begin with analysis of how current govern- ment social and economic policies are affecting the 27 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y behavior of the villagers toward biological resources. It is often useful to undertake a socio-economic survey of the communities affected by regulations controlling use of biological resources. Such surveys can also provide the necessary raw material for determining the types of in- centives that are required to bring about the desired changes in behavior. Information collected might include: \u2022 the ethnic diversity of the communities and their so- cial structure; \u2022 the traditional location and proximity of householder and kin groups for rituals, labor exchange and other important community activities; \u2022 standard indicators of socio-economic well-being, in- cluding demographic parameters such as population and age structure as well as indicators of health and education; \u2022 the pattern of economic activity, in both time and space, particularly in regard to how this affects bio- logical resources; \u2022 patterns of land tenure, land use, and access to resources; \u2022 the biological resources now being used, how the resources are being harvested, the degree of awareness about controlling regulations, and possible alternative sources of income; and \u2022 the importance of the biological resources, both eco- nomically (food, raw materials, income) and socially (role in kin and other community relationships). This information can provide managers of biologi- cal resources with the necessary insights into the needs and desires of the local people, and can avoid misun- derstandings and disruptions when implementing incen- tives packages. Such surveys can also provide the necessary infor- mation for determining the appropriate level of incen- tives that will move individuals to respond in the socially desirable way. They can also indicate the best means of providing incentives, ensuring that they are perceived as fair, equitable, and fairly earned. Community-level in- stitutions should be fully involved in the design, im- plementation, and interpretation of such surveys. 28 G U I D E L I N E S F O R R E S O U R C E M A N A G E M E N T A G E N C I E S GUIDELINE 3: DESIGN REALISTIC INCENTIVES PACKAGES, AND MONITOR THEIR APPLICATION TO ENSURE THAT MODIFICATIONS ARE MADE IF NECESSARY Elements to bear in mind when designing and im- plementing incentive packages that are effective include the following: 1. The incentives should serve to catalyze initiative. They should be considered fair compensation for work done, and not as a gift. 2. The incentives must tend to emphasize the implemen- tation of mechanisms and methodologies over simply supplying money in cash. Where cash is supplied, the tendency should be to invest more money in commu- nity development works. 3. The incentives package should be reviewed when new circumstances arise. The technology being used needs periodic review as well. 4. The incentives should be part of an integrated ap- proach targeted at eliminating the battery of con- straints to conservation due to local physical and social circumstances; they should help correct market failures. 5. Incentives which imply distribution of surpluses among contracting parties\u2014such as the harvest of cane or meat from national parks\u2014must be carefully and clearly regulated. No group should feel that its in- terests are being neglected without consultation. 6. The incentives package should produce both short- term and long-term results, the former to make them attractive to the target audience and the latter to en- sure their longevity. 7.

A senior staff person might be appointed, with terms of reference for determining what opportunities exist for productive collaboration with other sectors, and par- ticularly with community development initiatives (both governmental and non-governmental). The development of each protected area should be guided by a long-term (five years is a useful planning horizon) management plan which specifies the objectives for the area, the management steps required for achiev- ing the objectives, the means currendy available for im- plementing management, and the additional means required to implement the plan. The latter should in- clude potential economic incentives and disincentives, and the policies required to convert their potential into reality. Each plan should also include mechanisms for providing incentives and disincentives to local people. This section should be prepared with the full involve- ment of the affected communities, include objectives for the incentives, specify what is expected from the com- munity in return for the incentives, and outline options for implementing the incentives. 30 G U I D E L I N E S F O R R E S O U R C E M A N A G E M E N T A G E N C I E S Protected area managers should ensure that all educational and interpretive materials used in and around the area also include appropriate mention of eco- nomic relationships with surrounding communities. GUIDELINE 5: DEVELOP INNOVATIVE FUNDING OR OTHER MECHANISMS THAT WILL ENABLE THE PUBLIC TO SUPPORT CONSERVATION OF BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES Since few government conservation agencies have sufficient funding to carry out their mandates effectively, innovative funding mechanisms need to be sought out- side the traditional government sector. Some of these may require policy support from the central government or ministries of finance, such as tax deductability for do- nations of cash, land, or services. Other options which might be considered include: charging entry fees; return- ing profits from exploiting biological resources to the people living in the region; implementing water use charges for the water produced by a protected area; es- tablishing linkages with major development projects; building conditionality into extractive concession agree- ments; seeking support from international conservation organizations; and considering \"conservation conces- sions,\" similar to those for forestry or mining. Protected area management authorities, or those seeking to help support them, should consider the establishment of a Foundation or Trust which will support conservation of biological resources, either directly through the protected area authority or more broadly to cover all aspects of biological resource conservation. Labor and other donations in kind can often be very useful means of enabling the public to express the value they place on the existence of certain biological resources. Protected area authorities should therefore give careful consideration to the mechanisms available for encouraging voluntary community service labor for conserving biological resources. 31 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y GUIDELINE 6: ENSURE THAT INCENTIVES ARE PERCEIVED AS SUCH Incentives and disincentives aimed at changing the behavior of individuals must clearly and explicitly indi- cate the linkage between rewards and behavior. This will usually require that effective information programs are provided to those receiving the benefits. When individu- als or communities first receive an incentive, they should be informed in detail of how the incentive works and why they are receiving it. They should then be reminded on a regular basis that the benefits are flowing to them because they are contributing to national objectives for biological diversity, or live in or near an area which is of national importance for sustainable use of biologi- cal resources. Incentives and disincentives aimed at changing the behavior of individuals must clearly and explicitly indicate the linkage between rewards and behavior.

Appropriate disincen- tives exist in most countries, in the form of laws and regulations, supported by fines and jail sentences; but national legislation is seldom sufficiently well enforced to provide a particularly powerful disincentive. When supported with appropriate incentives and by public opinion, the local community can often be an effective enforcer of disincentives. Governments need to enact policies which enable the local communities to play this positive role in enforcing disincentives. 33 GUIDELINES FOR DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS INTR ODUCTION I n most countries, both governments and the pri- vate sector are already using incentives, but these incentives are not being used to support conserva- tion. In order to demonstrate how incentives can be applied to change behavior in directions that lead to sus- tainable use of biological resources, field projects can be designed to address urgent problems. Demonstration projects test a full range of methodologies, and develop experience in implementation of construction works, community development, application of incentives, training, and technical assistance. Successful projects may become showcases, convincing rural people, govern- ments, academia, and the private sector that conserva- tion is both necessary and beneficial; they can lead to a series of replications throughout the country. It is apparent that virtually all projects which have a component which deals with biological resources will benefit from incorporating economic incentives and dis- incentives into the project. The following guidelines are aimed at assisting those responsible for designing and implementing development projects, either at national or international level and with governmental or non- governmental agencies, to ensure that all relevant mat- ters have been taken into consideration. 35 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y GUIDELINE 1: DESIGN THE INCENTIVES AS A PACKAGE Incentives and disincentives can seldom stand alone; they need to be part of an overall strategy or plan which includes a variety of incentives and disincentives. In selecting the elements for inclusion in such a package, the following points are pertinent: 1. Consider the factors which are universally relevant and provide the foundation for almost any kind of incen- tives package. These include: secure land tenure; de- velopment and strengthening of local institutions; training and education; and technical assistance. 2. Based on information gained from surveys of the tar- get communities, design the specific package of incen- tives to meet the highest priority needs of the villagers, with explicit objectives to be attained. When incen- tives are designed to enhance the management of a protected area, they should be closely linked to the management plan for the area. This requires that the protected area manager is fully involved in the design and implementation of the incentives package. 3. Assess the resources, including the biological resources and the human resources available for implementing the incentive. The biological resources may need to be surveyed, using local universities, research center staff, and other expertise that may be available. 4. Assess human motivation for both conservation and exploitation. What are the factors underlying current over-exploitation of biological resources, and what motivating factors are available for changing those fac- tors? The needs and aspirations of the local people need to be discovered before any reasonable system of incentives can be designed. 5. Assess all development plans which might influence the incentives. What other development projects are affecting the project area? 6. Conduct a preliminary economic analysis. What is the opportunity cost for working in a particular area or region, and how does this area relate to other areas having the same biogeographic characteristics? 36 G U I D E L I N E S F O R D E S I G N I N G A N D I", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5a8596b-287b-4f9e-9f90-d1dd3f417a4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5a8596b-287b-4f9e-9f90-d1dd3f417a4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Economics and biological diversity : executive summary and guidelines for using incentives", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/economics-and-biological-diversity-executive-summary-and-guidelines-using", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f398ab75a80e577d8e4cb1ee4cd2966250c27bac3b94bfa1eb82257cb7e041b"}}, "hash": "3f398ab75a80e577d8e4cb1ee4cd2966250c27bac3b94bfa1eb82257cb7e041b", "text": "M P L E M E N T I N G D E V E L O P M E N T P R O J E C T S 7. Select the types of incentives. Incentives usually must be site-specific, but certain aspects of the incentives issue can be underscored as part of land use planning policies and plans for conservation: \u2022 Incentives need to be classified as general in nature or as targeted at specific priority regions in the country. \u2022 Incentives which are nation-wide or region-wide in scope (such as taxes or use rights) must be established and regulated by a legal body, to guarantee users that they are entitled to insist on State compliance where they themselves have complied with the es- tablished regulations. \u2022 Incentives in a national scheme must integrate land tenure and its regularization in such a way that the cultivators are guaranteed that they will reap the fruits of their labors. \u2022 Incentives must be designed to ensure continuity of plan activities even after the incentive is no longer applied. \u2022 Incentives must be well planned and realistic. Funds must be available to back them, and they must com- plement one another and be carefully promoted beforehand. GUIDELINE 2: DETERMINE THE CAPACITY OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO BENEFIT FROM INCENTIVES The capacity to benefit from incentives will vary con- siderably from community to community. The effective- ness of a package of incentives aimed at a specific community depends on a number of factors, including: 1. the major objectives of the incentives scheme (the most important issue here is to be very clear and explicit about what conservation objectives are to be achieved by the incentive); 2. the capacity of the community to absorb incentives (vil- lages with well-developed institutions will usually be able to absorb incentives more effectively than poorly 37 E C O N O M I C S A N D B I O L O G I C A L D I V E R S I T Y organized villages, which may first require appropri- ate institutions to be developed); 3. the initial state of the biological resources to be managed (incentives to manage existing resources are different from incentives to rehabilitate resources that have been depleted); 4. the level of motivation of the community (communities which are eager to cooperate and take advantage of opportunities such as tourism are quite different from communities which need to be convinced that cooper- ation is in their own best interest; in the latter case, an initial promotion campaign may be required); 5. the constraints which the incentives are intended to overcome (these can include: lack of title to land; un- clear responsibility for biological resources to be con- served; insufficient information about available options or rights under the law; lack of access to resources, expertise, or appropriate markets; and in- sufficient awareness of the benefits available from con- servation action); 6. the effect of time on the incentives (including the time required to apply the incentive, the time over which the incentive needs to be applied, the time required for the incentive to bring about the desired change in behavior, and the time to recover any recoverable investments); and 7. the method of distributing the incentive to the commu- nity (communities with strong institutions may use them to distribute the incentives, while other mecha- nisms may be required in other cases; this will obviously vary with the objectives and degree of motivation). GUIDELINE 3: ENSURE THAT PROJECTS WHICH INCORPORATE INCENTIVES INCLUDE ALL NECESSARY ELEMENTS FOR THEIR SUCCESS When designing or assessing a project which incor- porates economic incentives, the following questions need to be answered. Any negative answers should 38 G U I D E L I N E S F O R D E S I G N I N G A N D I M P L E M E N T I N G D E V E L O P M E N T P R O J E C T S require additional explanation; some projects may be designed to seek answers to these questions. 1.

By signing and ratifying the conventions on biodiversity (CBD), climate change (UNFCCC), and desertification (UNCCD), governments officially committed to implement these agreements and monitor and report on their progress. These international agreements are an historic step forward, but the second half of the equation\u2014implementation at national level\u2014now requires urgent attention. As the title of this publication suggests, implementation of international agreements in individual countries is an art, not a science. There are diverse factors and challenges at play, including political will, adequate finance, and complex governance arrangements.

Julia Marton-Lef\u00e8vre, Director General, IUCN Prologue We will not be able to meet the challenges of climate change and achieve the Millennium Development Goals with the contribution of men only; women\u2019s input will double the impact. 2012 | 5 Climate change is a major threat to the environment and natural resources, which we need for the sustainable development of our globe. Climate change will undermine the very foundation of socioeconomic development and will increase inequality and poverty. It will have a serious impact on the livelihoods of poor women in developing countries, as the increasing droughts and storms will affect agriculture and water resources, which are often the responsibility of women. Women can, however, play a central role in adaptation to climate change. Women can also lead the way towards more sustainable consumption in developed countries and emerging market economies, as they will make some 80 per cent of the daily purchasing for families and take the lead in households combating climate change. Thus, the full participation of women in all decision-making and activities concerning climate change is essential. We will not be able to meet the challenges of climate change and achieve the Millennium Development Goals with the contribution of men only; women\u2019s input will double the impact. This was also one of the key conclusions of the UN Secretary General\u2019s Panel on Global Sustainability, which I co-chaired with the President of South Africa Jacob Zuma. The panel emphasized the importance of women\u2019s full participation in strengthening green economies and providing women access to property, credit, and other productive resources. The role of women in promoting sustainable economic development cannot be overestimated. Recently, it has come to light that women\u2019s global earning power has had a bigger impact on the global economy than the GDPs of China and India combined. Finland has supported the participation of women in the recent climate negotiations. For this purpose, we established a Women Delegates Fund as a component of cooperation with the Global Gender and Climate Alliance. Improved awareness has lead to greater participation of women, which is now over 30 per cent. Gender considerations are already included in the work programmes of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and in the decisions relating to new bodies such as the Green Climate Fund and Technology Mechanism. In addition to international cooperation, Finland has supported active participation of women in national and local activities. The interested governments have prepared \ufb01rst national and regional strategies in cooperation with IUCN, its global programme, commissions, and members. This valuable publication describes the process and strategies for integrating women in national climate activities in their countries. I hope that these examples will encourage other countries to follow suit. At present, local and national action is needed to make the difference. Tarja Halonen, Former President of the Republic of Finland Co-chair of the UN Secretary General\u2019s Panel on Global Sustainability Forward 2012 | 7 Women are central actors in a country\u2019s response to climate change I n Nepal, women farmers avoid crop failure in the face of changing weather patterns by growing off-season vegetables and bananas, which are more resilient to \ufb02ood and drought (ActionAid, 2007). In Jordan, women\u2019s management of small-scale irrigation projects and involvement in water harvesting and soil conservation improves the ef\ufb01ciency of water use (Al-Naber & Shatanawi, 2003). In Tanzania, when men migrate from home for longer periods due to the impacts of climate change, women take over the role of livestock herding and pasture management (Matinda, 2010). In Nicaragua, following a disaster, women were actively involved in evacuating those at risk, transporting materials to clear roads, and organizing food collection brigades and health care campaigns (Delany & Shrader, 2000). Women often lead the way in adapting to climate change impacts, but they also play a key role in mitigating climate change by optimizing energy ef\ufb01ciency, using low-footprint energy sources and techniques, and in\ufb02uencing a household\u2019s and community\u2019s consumption patterns (Rojas, 2012).

This lack of a connection between gender and climate change at the global and national levels was a sign of the times\u2014prior to the UNFCCC Bali Action Plan, and the launch of the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA) in the same year, the theme of gender and climate change was largely nonexistent on the global stage, and most NAPAs and national communications had already been written. Now, following several years of advocacy, capacity building, and awareness raising, governments have agreed multilaterally that gender equality is a key component in achieving climate change goals. Since 2008 and to date, more than 60 of\ufb01cial gender references have entered the UNFCCC negotiation text, and the \ufb01nal outcomes of the Cancun (2010) and Durban (2011) conferences included eight and seventeen references to gender, respectively. With these global mandates in place, the urgent next step is implementing them and determining how to design climate change policies and programming in a way that addresses gendered realities. The Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA) was launched at the UN Climate Change Conference in Bali in December 2007 and convenes over 60 UN agencies and civil society organizations. 8 | the art of implementation A critical step in the implementation process is anchoring global agreements within national contexts\u2014through the development of climate change gender action plans (ccGAPs). Beginning in January 2010, ccGAPs were developed in various countries and regions under IUCN\u2019s leadership. IUCN on behalf of the GGCA supported the development of ccGAPs in Nepal, Liberia, Tanzania, Jordan, Egypt, Panama, and Haiti. In Haiti, IUCN engaged the support of WEDO and the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity to develop that country\u2019s ccGAP. Two regional governing bodies\u2014those of Central America and the Arab states region\u2014 also broke new ground by collaborating to develop regional strategies on gender and climate change. Separately, IUCN collaborated with United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in the development of Mozambique\u2019s strategy. In parallel, IUCN leveraged the methodology of the ccGAPs to facilitate distinct processes in other countries and had similar results. IUCN worked with partners to support the mainstreaming of gender in Costa Rica\u2019s action plan for the national climate change strategy and partnered with WEDO to develop Gender and REDD+ roadmaps in Ghana, Uganda, and Cameroon. These visionary countries and regions are among the world\u2019s pioneers in integrating gender in national climate change decision-making. More strategies will soon follow, as still more countries have communicated requests to IUCN for facilitating these processes. Established in 1948, IUCN is a membership organization made up of more than 1,000 member organizations including more than 80 states, more than 110 government agencies, and more than 800 non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Why do the ccGAPs matter? They represent a country\u2019s intention to empower and respond to the needs of the often invisible \u201cother half\u201d of the population in the context of climate change. They link national and global policy in a concrete and synergistic manner, communicating to women\u2019s constituencies, a country\u2019s population at large, and the international community that gender matters and why it matters. Most importantly, ccGAPs have the potential to enhance the effectiveness and ef\ufb01ciency of climate change and socioeconomic development responses. The underlying principle of the ccGAPs is the transformative nature of gender interventions. If women had the same access to the resources that male farmers do, farm yields could increase by 20-30 per cent and the number of hungry people in the world could be reduced by 12-17 per cent (FAO, 2011). More equal control over household resources and subsequent investment in women\u2019s and children\u2019s education and health have been linked to a country\u2019s economic growth.

The work was lead by IUCN at the national level as part of a joint initiative with the GGCA, and with the \ufb01nancial support of the government of Finland for the ccGAPs and of DANIDA for the REDD+ roadmaps. The section that follows outlines the steps and elements of creating a ccGAP or REDD+ roadmap. The third section delves into some of the principles behind the strategies and what has worked best. The fourth section tells a story from each country, highlighting key sectors that demonstrate the gender dimensions of climate change in different national contexts. The \ufb01nal section concludes with some recommendations for how to continue the momentum.

The motivation for these strategies is also closely linked to a growing global recognition of the importance of a gender dimension in climate change and environmental decision making, in which IUCN, the GGCA, and other actors have played an important role. Each country presents a distinct context that requires a targeted approach. However, some elements of the methodology are universal: an understanding of the political, socioeconomic, and environmental circumstances; capacity-building on targeted themes to ensure strong engagement and ownership; and a meaningful participatory and multi-stakeholder process. Steps Toward the Development of a ccGAP 12 | the art of implementation 1. Take stock The ccGAPs are anchored to a country\u2019s existing national processes on climate change, and on gender. Following a government\u2019s formal request to develop a ccGAP, IUCN undertakes research to map the country\u2019s legislative and policy framework and any institutional initiatives in areas as diverse as natural resources, socio-economic issues, industry, and \ufb01nance. This examination of existing frameworks encompasses the multiple legal layers in the country, including existence of both traditional and customary law. Based on this assessment, IUCN identi\ufb01es and interviews key stakeholders and institutions, as well as potential champions, in order to ascertain the top priorities, challenges, and gaps. Assessing technical capacities in collaboration with IUCN\u2019s country of\ufb01ces, relevant government departments, and other constituencies rounds out the knowledge base and helps to orient the country team. 2. Level the playing \ufb01eld In order to enhance the engagement of women and women\u2019s organizations in the development of the ccGAP and in climate change activities in general, IUCN organizes a training session to build both technical knowledge and women\u2019s con\ufb01dence on climate change themes, and to identify women\u2019s priorities and ideas.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "797fbb74-17fa-437f-8ed3-9876458c47f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "797fbb74-17fa-437f-8ed3-9876458c47f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "320d07cad626f87b20efef1f7e8606d13936e7fcd4adbe0c3f3fae33e7daf5f3"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f860b2c-43d3-4604-a5e7-2b269a98fc36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8665363b5e6d3cb9b65c5a48215cdfa1102d0a5e5989a8a2b282ed5604d0497a"}}, "hash": "c307558b2924c5b291a0c6882c2c2b2bc5fc37b5baec45f7e6ee7db8107690a1", "text": "Depending on the country context, the representation in training sessions ranges from women with experience in national and global policy to women who are farmers or entrepreneurs. 3. Capture diverse voices and views As part of a multi-stakeholder workshop, representatives from government, non-governmental institutions, academia, international institutions, and community groups, among others, assess the country\u2019s current situation in relation to gender and climate change, envision a future scenario across priority sectors, and agree on action steps toward that scenario. Actions fall within the realm of both adaptation and mitigation in line with a country\u2019s existing climate change planning processes. 4.

Connecting multiple sectors Gender equality is a crosscutting topic that is pertinent to diverse sectors and brings seemingly strange bedfellows together. The national multi-stakeholder workshops are often a unique, and sometimes the sole, opportunity for representatives from diverse government departments and ministries to sit together and consider the linkages among them. Participants in the workshops welcome the opportunity to build social capital between government departments and have the space to brainstorm innovations outside the box of their own sector. New connections are also forged between government representatives and participants from NGOs and other institutions. The opportunity to address gender from a multi-stakeholder perspective has lead to a sea change in individual attitudes on the subject. Time and again, participants have expressed their surprise at gender equality being a development issue rather than a cause limited to feminists; thus, gender equality was newly recognized as a precondition of sustainable development. The presence of diverse viewpoints and experiences makes for a more holistic and ecosystem-wide approach to both gender and climate change and is more institutionally realistic for the ccGAP itself. Although a wide thematic berth is useful at the outset of the workshops, the \ufb01nal ccGAPs are more narrowly focused on priority sectors and actions. And while gender dimensions can be found across many sectors and initiatives, a pragmatic approach that leverages the potential of women and women\u2019s organizations in critical sectors is a solid \ufb01rst step. After the development of several ccGAPs, it became clear that integrating the ccGAPs within the existing country policy and institutional frameworks is essential. Working across multiple sectors can mean a more lengthy, complicated, and involved process, but an integrated approach avoids the development of a stand-alone document that has no relevance to other national priorities and initiatives. A ccGAP that is part of the existing fabric of a country\u2019s policy regime will gain much more relevance and buy-in. 2. Capacity to build an effective strategy Governments, donors, and institutions at all levels express signi\ufb01cant interest in addressing the gender dimension in their climate change programming, but they also express limited understanding of what steps to take or how to orient their overall approach for optimal impact. Thus, the ccGAP development process is underpinned by targeted capacity building that guides stakeholders\u2019 preliminary steps. Participants come away with enhanced knowledge of climate change and/or gender themes, as well as an enhanced understanding of gender and development.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2631c7e6-de87-4c0c-acc3-ecb0de263a8d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2631c7e6-de87-4c0c-acc3-ecb0de263a8d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f58c40b2864060a285a34531c30d04fd4c926e975dd4d3956a61251ff55ac469"}, "2": {"node_id": "ded8b516-01d3-46f2-9c29-c8ef5ff1c5de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbc1af0536113c59a78d7190aad362e92bed6796c30b78a653c3a7173a34c061"}}, "hash": "dfb79b3d5faf18374869269f8bbce37428a40b70006d9bd792d4e5c01d2f9556", "text": "Depending on the country and institutional context, the training content may focus heavily on the technical components of mitigation, disaster risk reduction, biodiversity, REDD+, or other topics.

Lessons Learned 16 | the art of implementation Taking the time to enhance participants\u2019 comfort across these themes is a critical component of designing an effective ccGAP. The participation of all staff from the bottom administrative posts to the top management posts is also key to capturing diverse viewpoints and ensuring comprehensive institutional understanding and cooperation in the strategy\u2019s implementation. 3. A placeholder for emerging opportunities The development of a ccGAP is a key moment in a country\u2019s acknowledgement that gender equality is central to climate change decision making and implementation, but it is only an initial step. While strategies and roadmaps include short-term actions, any legislative and institutional reforms will take time. Importantly, the ccGAP is a long-term placeholder for the moment in time when policy and planning opportunities emerge. Participants note that having the ccGAP in place can be most useful at the moment a country is ready to undertake the next phase of adaptation planning, set emissions reductions goals, prepare REDD+ plans, or to reform policy in any climate- related sector. In one case, the ccGAP turned the attention of an international institution to gender and catalysed the inclusion of a gender approach in a major regional report. Civil society and other institutions have noted that the ccGAPs provide a platform for coordinated actions, and a fountain of action ideas, on the gender dimensions of climate change across multiple actors at the national and local levels. 4. Ownership, harmonization, and guardianship Anchoring the ccGAP in existing national climate change processes, rather than creating a parallel process, is critical to ensuring ownership and avoiding a document that will gather dust on a shelf. A harmonized approach avoids the pitfalls of high transaction costs, fragmentation, and over-burdening of governments and institutions, and it opens the door to ef\ufb01ciency, coordination, and cost effectiveness\u2013\u2013all elements of good governance. Cameroon 2012 | 17 National ownership is not just government involvement but also includes the engagement of civil society and other concerned stakeholders, such as academia and the private sector. Because they are driven and led by countries themselves, the national strategies are built on the capacity of local actors, are entrenched in the local context, respond to local needs, suit internal institutional arrangements, and undergo national validation, thus securing ultimate success in implementation. As the ccGAP is validated and adopted, guardianship of the strategy by government and civil society that can shepherd it through is critical. 5. Monitoring and learning The ccGAPs bene\ufb01t considerably from the long-term presence of IUCN and its partners in these countries. The ccGAP development process\u2014from the preliminary phase of information gathering to the later stages of implementation\u2014leverages existing local relationships built over decades and a deep knowledge of the country\u2019s circumstances and challenges. These relationships are built on trust and mutual understanding, leveraging in no small part on-going collaboration around other projects and initiatives, which in some instances has spanned decades. This reputation allows for a close monitoring and mentoring relationship with ministries and other stakeholders as the ccGAP is designed and put into practice. At the outset of the ccGAP\u2019s adoption and implementation, it is important that government representatives who are new to the theme can count on a trusted institution to accompany the process. This relationship can help with course corrections, troubleshooting, additional capacity building, sustained momentum, and monitoring to determine whether initial actions resulted in the intended impact. Monitoring can also be useful beyond the individual country. Participants in the ccGAP development process have bene\ufb01tted from learning about what other countries are doing, including how certain sectors are interlinked, how to get beyond characterization of women as victims, and how to expand actions to other sectors such as transport, tourism, waste, and urbanization. In some instances, the ccGAP processes have spurred greater regional coordination. At their best, the national processes have developed tremendous innovations, connecting climate change and gender equality goals across multiple sectors in a pioneering manner.

Efforts in Nepal to instil greater equality in the forestry and agricultural sector have come up against the need for broader institutional reforms such as those included in the ccGAP. In parallel, women\u2019s successes and struggles in forestry and agriculture may provide lessons for how to best implement the ccGAP in Nepal. Forestry Nearly 80 per cent of Nepalese rural households derive some or all of their livelihoods from forest resources. Community forestry has enjoyed a high pro\ufb01le success, improving the resource rights of local people as well as the health of forest ecosystems in Nepal. Over 14,000 Community Forest User Groups (CFUGs) manage a sizeable portion of the country\u2019s forested land\u20141.2 million hectares\u2014bene\ufb01ting almost 1.7 million households. Importantly, the country\u2019s community forestry policy mandates that at least 33 per cent of the Executive Committee membership of these user groups should be women. This has led to tremendous steps forward for women\u2019s involvement in forestry decision making. Other women-only user groups are led by and made up entirely of women participants (ADB, DFID, and World Bank, 2012; National Planning Commission, 2010). During 2001-2010, several estimates indicated that women managed about 768 to 900 of the community forests, or about \ufb01ve to six per cent; however, the forests handed over to women are usually small in area and either are degraded or are plantation in nature (D Gurung 2012, pers. comm., 5 August). Nevertheless, policy is still being translated into practice. Nepal\u2019s historical hierarchies endure despite formal laws guaranteeing equal treatment to women and men, and to various castes. CFUGs operate in this setting of gender inequality and social hierarchy, resulting in continued exclusion of women and other marginalized groups from decision-making and accessing resources and related \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts. Women who serve on Executive Committees are sometimes seen as \u201ctoken\u201d members, where their views are not valued and they rarely serve in of\ufb01cer positions. While women are the primary users of forest resources, including for fuel and fodder, one study found that only about 17 per cent of households sent women to CFUG meetings. Local Adaptation Plans of Action (LAPAs) Learning from the Community Forestry User Group process in Nepal, the country\u2019s unique LAPAs are part of Nepal\u2019s national climate change planning process. The goal of LAPA processes is to link national climate change decision making with bottom-up climate risk assessments undertaken by community members. Since LAPAs are intended to catalyse cross-sectoral coordination around climate resilience, they could potentially provide a platform for gender equality measures (Regmi & Karki, 2010). As the ccGAP is implemented, it will be critical to ensure that women participate equitably in decision making and that they derive concrete bene\ufb01ts from local natural resource governing bodies. Why wouldn\u2019t women participate in CFUGs? Their limited ownership of land and other assets prevents access to credit and technologies, which gives them less bargaining power. Women are burdened with household and family care tasks that may prevent them from attending meetings. And societal norms mean that committees expect the male head of household to attend meetings. These common obstacles translate into women not attending or into them sitting quietly at the back of the meeting room (Ghimire-Bastakoti & Bastakoti, 2004).

Although a few women do participate in Nepal\u2019s REDD governing mechanism, they do not represent women as a stakeholder group per se, re\ufb02ecting the lack of recognition of women\u2019s role as a major forestry stakeholder.

A major stumbling block is that women and the rural poor often do not have property titles required for collateral and the granting of larger loans (OECD, 2012). But as with forestry, there are important steps forward. Through their participation in groups, cooperatives and income-generating initiatives, women farmers have increased skills, social status, and decision-making power (ADB, DFID, and World Bank, 2012). Women\u2019s participation in the government\u2019s agricultural training programmes increased from 20 per cent in the mid-1990s to 30-40 per cent of participants in 2007, partly due to efforts of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives to achieve gender balance and collect information on women farmers. Opportunities for women\u2019s employment, skill training, and access to credit are intended to come from rural infrastructure projects (UNFPA, 2007). By amendment to the Country Code, unmarried daughters now have the right to ancestral property (other than land) irrespective of age, whereas previous conditions required that they be above the age of 35 (OECD, 2012).

Liberia Women\u2019s workshop in Liberia National strategy workshop in Liberia 34 | the art of implementation Drawing on Liberia\u2019s priority sectors, the following section focuses on coastal erosion and health to illustrate some of the challenges and solutions within the context of gender and climate change. Coastal erosion Liberian President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf observed that coastal erosion potentially affects the livelihoods of half the country\u2019s population. Rising sea levels in the low-lying cities of Monrovia and Buchanan and unregulated sand mining of coastal areas compounding the effects of climate change threaten the security of coastal populations and the country itself. It has been estimated that 230,000 people are at risk and 2,150 km2 will be lost by a one meter sea level rise, including land and infrastructure and much of Monrovia, valued at US$250,000,000. Houses on the shores of the country are collapsing at the edge of the sea due to coastal erosion from climate-related sea level rise and other factors. A large proportion of these people live on low-lying land, often in unplanned and illegal settlements. In Buchanan, for example, about 250 people lost their homes in recent years, with the last several years seeing a loss of a full 10 meters from the area\u2019s coastal beaches. In other populated coastal areas, the Liberian Environment Agency measured between three and \ufb01ve meters of land being lost annually, with 50 meters of shore having disappeared since 2005 from one town alone. Some families, unable to afford new dwellings, are still living in the portion of their home that has not been taken over by the rising tidewaters. Exacerbating this situation, the coastal population is poor, and access to health and education is limited. A large proportion of the coastal community lives in temporary and/or poorly constructed housing with little protection from sea or storm surges (UNDP, 2010). Unregulated sand mining and unsustainable harvesting of mangroves, which act as natural barriers from storm surges, further accelerate beach erosion. Sand is being mined throughout Liberian coastal cities largely for the purpose of supplying construction sites\u2014a pro\ufb01table business (EPA, 2007). In addition to erosion, sand mining along beaches and streams can lead to inland salt-water intrusion, threaten infrastructure, and prevent the growth of any tourism development in the future (Daily Observer, 2012). The disturbance to coastal areas caused by sand mining also threatens marine species and \ufb01sheries, leading to loss of livelihoods for coastal communities (The Informer, 2012). Women in Liberia play an important role in artisanal \ufb01sheries and dominate \ufb01sh marketing, and their livelihoods will be impacted by these climate-induced impacts on the coasts. Artisan \ufb01shing involves small-scale \ufb01shing practices using traditional techniques. Over 33,000 people are involved in producing and processing \ufb01sh in this artisanal manner\u2014around 60 per cent are Liberians, and of those 60 per cent are women (World Bank, 2010). Despite their domination in this \ufb01eld, women lack access to credit, extension services, technology, and training opportunities, and thus face existing discrimination that exacerbates the impacts of climate change (Williams, n.d.). To counteract the negative impacts of climate-related coastal erosion, the Liberian government has announced a short-term plan to protect infrastructure, but it lacks the \ufb01nancial resources for major projects. The government faces challenges in responding to climate change in coastal areas from the national level, particularly with the limited information and forecasting available in the country on sea levels and coastal erosion.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51472ecc-b4aa-4681-9b9e-96805fc31e4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "51472ecc-b4aa-4681-9b9e-96805fc31e4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "113a4837f50b13edb234ded9481b1a5306717dab8cb9462cb2a715515ff6f8ed"}, "2": {"node_id": "493ac7ed-d4c0-4bbf-b470-4b4eddbf4177", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4774ca0281f78a8f738524d1f1d56fc751615c8db1e594226d9546bb5162715a"}}, "hash": "7e0d975f6fe54ff727e7ddee03b4317383e1e58992ded5284bb4073fd2310ea9", "text": "The capacity of coastal counties to plan and respond to climate change also needs to be strengthened.

This happens directly, through death and injury in \ufb02oods, storms, and high temperatures, and indirectly, through changes in how diseases spread and the quality and availability of water, air, and food. Gender, along with age, socioeconomic class, and occupation, is one of the determining factors of the speci\ufb01c health impacts of climate change. The indirect health impacts of climate change in Liberia, as in other countries, are dif\ufb01cult to estimate; however, there are differences worldwide in how climate change hazards affect women\u2019s and men\u2019s health. Changes in rainfall can reduce the availability of water for drinking, cooking, and sanitation, which can increase the food insecurity and work burden of more vulnerable groups such as women and girls. On the other hand, emotional stress caused by sudden changes in water availability has contributed to a higher suicide rate among male farmers (WHO, 2011).

Women in Liberia, and especially young girls, face high rates of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation, and HIV/AIDS (Government of Liberia and UNMIL, 2011). And in addition to living in a country with limited health care, women have limited means of employment, sustainable livelihoods, and high rates of malnutrition. Climate change will particularly exacerbate Liberian women\u2019s and children\u2019s contraction of certain diseases. Climate change is expected to impact the prevalence and spread of water-borne pathogens, such as cholera, as well as vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, which are particularly tied to changes in rainfall. Other climate-sensitive diseases include respiratory diseases, such as tuberculosis, and diseases exacerbated by malnutrition, including HIV/AIDS (EPA, 2012). In Liberia, rainfall and temperature increases, combined with \ufb02ooding due to sea-level rise, will result in the country\u2019s heightened vulnerability to epidemics of malaria, cholera, diarrheal disease, increased incidences of yellow fever and other diseases, and the potential for dengue fever to spread to Liberia. Malaria remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Liberia, with 42 per cent of inpatient deaths attributable to malaria and taking its greatest toll on young children and pregnant women. According to the World Health Organization and the Liberian Ministry of Health, the entire country\u2019s population of over 3,950,000 people is at risk of malaria (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, 2009a). Malnutrition, caused by inadequate dietary intake and disease and exacerbated by poverty and poor access to health care, is another major public health problem in Liberia (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, 2011). Climate change is having a detrimental effect on the agricultural sector in Liberia, affecting the production of the country\u2019s main staple crops, which is particularly disadvantageous for women. Women are more prone to nutritional de\ufb01ciencies because of their unique nutritional needs, especially when they are pregnant or breastfeeding or when their household follows a food hierarchy that prioritizes some household members over others. The civil crisis had a signi\ufb01cant impact on food security and nutrition that is still being felt today. The 2010 Comprehensive Food Security and National Survey identi\ufb01ed that 42 per cent of children under \ufb01ve years of age were chronically malnourished. In fact, 41 per cent of Liberians are insuf\ufb01ciently fed (Ministry of Agriculture and WFP, 2010). While this is an improvement from the levels of acute malnutrition in 2006, when 27 per cent of children were underweight, the levels of chronic malnutrition remain amongst the highest in the world (UNICEF, 2012). According to the 2011 national Liberia Micro-Nutrient Survey, 44 per cent of the deaths of young children are associated directly or indirectly with malnutrition, and about 60 per cent of children and almost 40 per cent of pregnant women are suffering from anaemia (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, 2009b; Klemm, R., et al., 2011).
