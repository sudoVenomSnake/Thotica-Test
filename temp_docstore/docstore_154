Resolutions have led to important and critical global and international decisions. As far back as 1963, the first Resolution on marine turtles was adopted, calling for research into potential conservation measures. In 1972 in Banff, the plight of marine resources in general was raised, highlighting the need for improvements in fisheries management. Two decades later this led to the ecosystem approach to fisheries that was adopted by the FAO. However, the first comprehensive Resolution about marine conservation was adopted in Amman in 2000, when IUCN Members called for ratification of the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement, as well as the creation of a representative network of marine protected areas (MPAs), including in the High Seas. At the Barcelona Congress (2008) another key resolution for accelerating progress to establish marine protected areas and creating marine protected area networks was instrumental in preparing CBD Aichi Target 11 (Nagoya, 2010). A Resolution in Jeju (2012) to facilitate protection through the establishment of protected areas as specified by Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 further strengthened this, as did a Resolution adopted in Hawai\u2018i (2016) which set the scene for the post-2020 targets. Since IUCN\u2019s early congresses, Resolutions have addressed a diverse array of marine issues and helped to advance the marine cause, including: RESOLUTIONS Water Policies on water resource management are essential, but often lengthy in coming. IUCN Resolutions have also been instrumental in raising local awareness of the need to increase conservation efforts for specific bodies of water. IUCN Members have called for restoration of Lake Pedder in Tasmania, Australia and the Tatshenshini-Alsek River System in Canada and the USA (both in Buenos Aires, 1994), protection of the Macal River Valley in Belize (Amman, 2000), and conservation of Chilean Patagonia (Jeju, 2012), among others.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bae01449-8032-487a-a504-10375a08c24e": {"__data__": {"id_": "bae01449-8032-487a-a504-10375a08c24e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The impact of IUCN resolutions on international conservation efforts : an overview", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11ebfc718a6e2ef69c9803d0fa37a2cf26336ebd80dbaf827024be8484529757"}, "2": {"node_id": "ddeedd90-a41e-43ce-b60e-5213642fbc8a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1d0bdc7d0683efec58ed9be7371d1c6a698ed619b910c8eb6a4edc4e384db36"}}, "hash": "f0507070289ae93ede6d982642e66bd5ddb4d34dfe012bf6cf2c888a43a0245b", "text": "Reiterating a call for environmentally sustainable development of the Mekong River Basin (Montreal, 1996), a Resolution was adopted in Bangkok (2004) to promote responsible management of water resources in the Mekong Delta.

Dam construction, irrigation and water diversions were the subject of a Resolution adopted in Buenos Aires (1994), and led to the world Commission on Dams (WCD), a multi-stakeholder body initiated by the World Bank and IUCN in 1997 and formally established in 1998. The WCD was tasked to review the development effectiveness of large dams and assess alternatives for water resources and energy development, as well as develop internationally acceptable criteria, guidelines and standards. In Amman (2000), IUCN Members urged governments at all levels to support WCD recommendations. In Jeju (2012), IUCN engagement with dams was renewed with a Resolution on dams and hydraulic infrastructure when it called upon governments and states to commit to an international policy framework on dams, including the Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol (HSAP). IUCN currently sits on the governance committee of the HSAP. IUCN does not act alone in the water sector, but many of its Resolutions have helped shape the current and future focus of the global water community. One noteworthy example is the water and Nature Initiative (wANI), led by IUCN\u2019s Water Programme from 2001\u20132012. More than 200 IUCN Members and partners worked together to develop, implement and scale up sustainable water resource management in more than 25 countries in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Oceania. The wANI toolkit (https://www.iucn. org/theme/water/resources/wani-toolkits), a series of eight publications on various facets of water management such as environmental flows and payments for watershed services, supports learning on mainstreaming the ecosystems approach in water resource management. Translated into a myriad of languages, the series attests to the far-reaching impact this initiative has had. IUCN has consistently supported and fostered both the implementation of integrated water resources management (IwRM) and its conceptual development. Promoted in a Resolution adopted at the Barcelona Congress (2008), IUCN has both developed programmatic implementation and financing of IWRM. It also applied an ecosystems approach to IWRM through the Water and Nature Initiative. As a founder of the World Water Council, IUCN has consistently remained at the development edge of IWRM as a conceptual framework for water resource management globally. Run-off and evaporation (Athens, 1958) Environmental effects of acid rain and snow and other acid deposition (Christchurch, 1981) Future water resource developments needed to safeguard the natural water regimes of rivers, floodplains and wetlands (Buenos Aires, 1994) Drought and flood mitigation strategies (Amman, 2000) Public access to land and water (Montreal, 1996) Protecting the Earth\u2019s waters for public and ecological benefit (Bangkok, 2004). Only 3% of the earth\u2019s water is freshwater, two-thirds of it frozen in glaciers and polar ice caps. The growing global population faces considerable challenges to safeguard and protect clean and healthy water sources. IUCN has long been a champion of equitable water management, and over the years many World Conservation Congress Resolutions have brought this and many other concerns to the public eye, including: RESOLUTIONS Of particular global importance is the Resolution passed in Barcelona in 2008, which included a call to consider certification of the extractives industry. Talks with the industry gained traction and at the 2012 Congress, Nespresso and other major aluminium producers and users announced they would join leaders from different sectors under the umbrella of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) to create a new Performance Standard for the industry. IUCN was asked to lead the standard-setting process, which it completed in December 2014. Now an independent organisation, ASI plans to launch a robust certification programme for the industry in 2018. Another IUCN engagement today can be traced back to a 2004 Resolution adopted in Bangkok that highlighted the threats from Olympic Games and other major sporting events to protected areas and biodiversity. This Resolution underscores the establishment of a multi-year engagement between IUCN and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which aims to support the integration of biodiversity into the Candidate Cities\u2019 bids, and the development of guidelines on the mitigation of biodiversity impacts in all sport venues and events. A number of Resolutions adopted in Hawai\u2018i (2016) will undoubtedly impact the way the corporate sector does business in the future.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc8756bb-4e71-4b93-bf48-f4f5e7fc7829": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc8756bb-4e71-4b93-bf48-f4f5e7fc7829", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The impact of IUCN resolutions on international conservation efforts : an overview", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4abb48249031c4ae46a41233ed665d6be210b0af8f828f511997a4184af7e7b5"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bbd3efb-d5b6-4bbb-bb78-8c83ab1454a4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79e92532fc1e901f48a172b2a2ee0fc23a7da042262850436f3841ad3f504575"}}, "hash": "edd02c4b3179d8cd351da5ec22481007a90619200c01636e3fc41828659fa102", "text": "One Resolution called on businesses to contribute actively to the implementation of the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011- 2020 and Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and to integrate biodiversity into their strategies and activities with the aim to transform their economic models.

IUCN\u2019s Business and Biodiversity Programme is leading IUCN\u2019s response in both instances. Also in Hawai\u2018i, for the first time, Members called on business to respect all land and seascapes classified under any of IUCN\u2019s categories of protected areas as \u2018off limits\u2019 for damaging industrial activities \u2013 such as mining, oil and gas, agriculture \u2013 and infrastructure developments \u2013 such as dams, roads and pipelines. Prior to this, only World Heritage sites have been formally recognised as no-go areas. Most notable, however, is the 2016 IUCN World Conservation Congress outcome document known as the Hawai i Commitments, which identified private sector engagement as one of the top five challenges requiring urgent action. This declaration will certainly influence IUCN Members and further engage business to help conserve the integrity and diversity of nature, while ensuring that their use of natural resources is more equitable and ecologically sustainable. For decades, IUCN Members have recognised the essential role the business sector must play in supporting conservation and sustainable development. Back at the Perth General Assembly in 1990, a Resolution raised awareness of the need for environmental standards and a \u2018code of conduct\u2019 for the corporate sector. Several years later, in Buenos Aires (1996), Members voiced their desire for IUCN to take a leading role in this sector when they called for a productive relationship between IUCN and the private sector. Further strengthening this, Members agreed that IUCN should take measures to influence private sector actions in favour of biodiversity (Bangkok, 2004). IUCN has continued to influence the business sector, for example, by: Private sector Encouraging transnational corporate compliance in all operations, whether in the home country or offshore (Montreal, 1996) Urging all governments and financial institutions impacting biodiversity to protect and respect all protected areas, including international designations (Amman, 2000) Developing guidelines for conservation organisations working with the private sector (Barcelona, 2008) Reducing the impacts of infrastructure and extractive industries on protected areas (Barcelona, 2008) Recognising green growth as a sustainable strategy for nature conservation and economic development (Jeju, 2012) Strengthening corporate biodiversity measurement, valuation and reporting (Hawai\u2018i, 2016) Adopting and encouraging implementation of the first global policy on biodiversity offsets (Hawai\u2018i, 2016). RESOLUTIONS Climate change and biodiversity (Montreal, 1996) Climate change mitigation and land use (Amman, 2000) Climate and energy (Amman, 2000) Climate change and human rights (Barcelona, 2008) Adaptation to climate change of coral reefs and marine ecosystems and people that depend on them (Barcelona, 2008) Deforestation and land degradation related to climate change and desertification (Barcelona, 2008) Ecosystem management for disaster risk reduction (Jeju, 2012) Food security, ecosystem restoration and climate change (Jeju, 2012) Protected areas as natural solutions to climate change (Jeju, 2012 and Hawai\u2018i, 2016). RESOLUTIONS The importance of cross-sectoral work was underlined in a Resolution adopted at the 2012 World Conservation Congress (Jeju) that has been guiding IUCN\u2019s climate change work since. This Resolution advocated nature- based solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation, and emphasised their potential to contribute towards addressing this global challenge. Nature-based solutions are a sustainable and cost-effective way to mitigate and adapt to climate change, secure water, food and energy supplies, reduce poverty and drive economic growth. IUCN works on nature- based solutions to climate change at global, national and local levels including through Forest Landscape Restoration (including the Bonn Challenge), various REDD+ projects, the Blue Carbon Initiative, Ecosystem-based Adaptation, eco-disaster risk reduction, and climate change Gender Action Plans (ccGAPs). Nature-based solutions are an integral part of a lasting climate solution. The culmination of decades of negotiations for a legal instrument applicable to all Parties to reduce GHG emissions came in 2015 at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, when 195 countries adopted the landmark Paris Agreement with the aim of enhancing global action to address climate change. At the 2016 World Conservation Congress (Hawai\u2018i), IUCN Members were proactive in uniting high-level decision makers from government and business with climate and nature science experts to discuss and decide how to move the Paris Agreement into action. With a foundation in place, IUCN continued to bring climate-related issues to the spotlight.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4301df83-7a28-47ef-9d6b-587928b1079a": {"__data__": {"id_": "4301df83-7a28-47ef-9d6b-587928b1079a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The impact of IUCN resolutions on international conservation efforts : an overview", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1498a2278d193684fef0c87071efcdc8b646fd0c1da80ae566fd34644a02888e"}, "2": {"node_id": "29d9c690-6a96-4c8d-b021-88ae6a712f38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts-overview", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0e5dfae591df1e94c17680e694495ca210b7f08fec0181ab64c69cd8076ed40"}}, "hash": "62d626647b0cd7bcb64c61d9d43b8cbf09264c482939704cb3b7c1a2487ac2c8", "text": "Acknowledging that forests, oceans and other natural systems all play an important role in enhancing adaptation strategies, work has spanned all sectors: By the 1980s the scientific community had reached a consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were driving global warming.

They also urged developed countries to reduce their emissions by at least 20 per cent by the year 2000 and all countries to end deforestation by 2010 and take measures to optimise the carbon storage capabilities of forests. Two years later, at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, also known as the Earth Summit, 165 countries signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which aimed to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to prevent human-caused climate change. In the 1960s, global-level recognition of the linkages between human activities, the climate and nature was limited.

Much of the additional uncited information on individual species (distribution, population size and trend, Red List status, ecology, threats and conservation action) derives from the factsheets on the BirdLife Data Zone http://datazone.birdlife.org (BirdLife International 2016a). Species range maps were updated by BirdLife International from those used for the 2016 BirdLife/IUCN Red List of birds. For African species, the work of Rob Davies (HabitatInfo) and Ralph Buij (Wageningen University) has greatly contributed to these maps, using information from the African Raptor Databank (http://www.habitatinfo.com/african-raptor-databank/) and tracking data from a range of research projects across the continent. Refinement and updating of distribution maps was enhanced, particularly for three of the Asian species, by observations downloaded from eBird (http://ebird.org/content/ebird/).

Acknowledgements The Coordinating Unit of the CMS Raptors MOU wishes to record a debt of gratitude to the following generous contributors of financial and in-kind support: Environment Agency \u2013 Abu Dhabi on behalf of the Government of the United Arab Emirates has provided core funding for the Coordinating Unit since its establishment in 2009; the Federal Office for the Environment, on behalf of the Government of Switzerland; the Regional Governments of Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha, on behalf of the Government of Spain; and the Environment and Protected Areas Authority, Sharjah, on behalf of the Government of the United Arab Emirates. Substantial in-kind support was also received from BirdLife International, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB \u2013 BirdLife UK) and the Vulture Conservation Foundation, as well as wider support in the form of working time contributed by all the members of the Vulture Working Group. Without all of these valuable contributions the Vulture MsAP could not have been developed. 5 Contents Foreword ................................................................................................................................................. 8 Executive Summary ................................................................................................................................. 9 How to use this Action Plan .................................................................................................................. 12 List of acronyms and abbreviations ...................................................................................................... 13 1.

They also provide critically important ecosystem services by cleaning up carcasses and other organic waste in the environment: they are nature\u2019s garbage collectors and this translates into significant economic benefits. Studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures, carcasses take up to three or four times longer to decompose. This has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases in both wild and domestic animals, as well as elevating pathogenic risks to humans. In addition, vultures hold special cultural value in many countries, including historically such as Nekhbet, a goddess in ancient Egyptian mythology. The IUCN Red List status of African-Eurasian vultures has seen drastic changes for the worse in recent years: by the end of October 2015 the majority of species were listed as Critically Endangered, the highest category of threat, indicating a very high risk of extinction in the wild. Unless effective conservation action is implemented or expanded across the range of these birds, there is a significant likelihood that several of these species will indeed become extinct in the near future. The main reason for this is major population declines driven by poisoning, both intentional and otherwise. The precipitous population decline of three species in India and elsewhere in South Asia during the 1990s was due primarily to secondary poisoning by the veterinary drug diclofenac. In Africa, the threat of poisoning has accelerated in recent years, with a range of drivers, which all lead to carcasses being laced with highly toxic substances; sometimes vultures are the targets, sometimes they are, through their scavenging habits, the unintended victims.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8e1d883e-78bd-4779-a143-7385d0522b33": {"__data__": {"id_": "8e1d883e-78bd-4779-a143-7385d0522b33", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5460d81e90b2d9d7398c780b4e8fb869f177de0319eb996eb91e893e2ce48632"}, "2": {"node_id": "91757e1e-d2bf-4f3b-a951-85431cefb926", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c87e1326e19bff3f2c6dd53372f5e8722b5a9c2544a214321de02b5d82fd38c"}}, "hash": "f0b1ce21d55c128d7b7b499f55d5f16441edbb5fb09ce27f8ea49b6c69677245", "text": "The immense scale and extent of the population declines of vultures in Africa have only recently been exposed and has led to the term \u2018African Vulture Crisis\u2019.

The Multi-species Action Plan to Conserve African-Eurasian Vultures (Vulture MsAP) is the result of extensive consultation with stakeholders, conservation and species experts, aims to rapidly halt current population declines in all the 15 African-Eurasian vulture species. This includes bringing the conservation status of each species back to a favourable level and providing conservation management guidelines applicable to all Range States. Some outstanding work has been and continues to be done to conserve vultures. Long may this continue! However, the threats are both severe and challenging to address, and a step change in conservation action is required, led by Governments and supported by all stakeholders, including many who have so far not recognised the importance of vultures. Lessons learned and good practice can be applied more widely but new and creative solutions need to be found to address the clear and present danger that threatens to drive this spectacular group of birds to extinction. The many stakeholders concerned with vulture conservation must work together, and not rest until all vulture species are safe from this threat, ensuring that the millions of people who also benefit from them in many ways can continue to do so. 9 Executive Summary Vultures, by cleaning up carcasses and other organic waste in the environment, provide critically important ecosystem services that also directly benefit humans. This Multi-species Action Plan to Conserve African-Eurasian Vultures (Vulture MsAP) aims to provide a comprehensive strategic conservation Action Plan covering the geographic ranges of all 15 migratory Old World vultures and to promote concerted, collaborative and coordinated international actions towards the recovery of these populations to acceptable levels by 2029. The species that are the focus of this plan are: \u2022 Bearded Vulture Gypaetus barbatus \u2022 Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus \u2022 Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus \u2022 White-headed Vulture Trigonoceps occipitalis \u2022 Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus \u2022 Himalayan Griffon Gyps himalayensis \u2022 White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis \u2022 White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus \u2022 Indian Vulture Gyps indicus \u2022 Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris \u2022 Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres \u2022 R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vulture Gyps rueppelli \u2022 Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus \u2022 Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus \u2022 Lappet-faced Vulture Torgos tracheliotos With the exception of Western Europe, where populations of most species are increasing, vulture populations in Africa, Europe and Asia are in decline, facing a range of threats from a variety of anthropogenic factors. The IUCN Red List status of vultures has seen drastic changes in recent years: by the end of October 2015 the majority of species was listed as \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019. The precipitous collapse of populations of at least three species of vulture in South Asia over the last 25 years is mainly ascribed to food (i.e. carcase) contamination by the use of a single anti-inflammatory veterinary drug (diclofenac). On the African continent vulture populations have also declined considerably in most areas over the last 30 years. However, the range and extent of threats facing these species are more varied compared to that of south Asia with various forms of acute poisoning currently known to be the main reason for the decline. These are driven by several factors, some being particularly influential: conflicts between humans and carnivores due to risks perceived by humans, including to their domestic livestock, which unintentionally kill vultures; poachers actively targeting vultures to prevent them exposing their activities to wardens by soaring above illegally killed elephants and other game; and deliberate collection of vultures for illegal trade and belief-based use to fuel superstitions. Poisoning in various forms is a concern throughout vultures\u2019 ranges. Other threats, also operating to varying extents over large areas include habitat loss and degradation, decreasing food availability, fragmentation of remaining populations, human disturbance, collisions with wind turbines and powerlines, and electrocution on electricity infrastructure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "837e85c9-76be-441e-952e-aa21d2b5ad8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "837e85c9-76be-441e-952e-aa21d2b5ad8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aa5b7bcf5e54d844ec34357799abedf879cb3fa819e5df3c869ba2dd7a18bff3"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b097221-149b-4950-bfe5-263e9c9f8105", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ffb860234f36ac362e880d3677676ee834e736a9e93b6d63a38680bf2d68f21"}}, "hash": "2be8e9de6a613100484bfcadd95deb26c54d4ed277695d5172636482bdcd5961", "text": "This plan is the result of extensive consultation with stakeholders, conservation and species experts and has the following aims: \u2022 To rapidly halt current population declines in all species covered by the Vulture MsAP; \u2022 To reverse recent population trends to bring the conservation status of each species back to a favourable level; 10 \u2022 To provide conservation management guidelines applicable to all Range States covered by the Vulture MsAP.

To recognise and minimise mortality of vultures by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and occurrence and threat of toxic NSAIDs throughout the range covered by the Vulture MsAP; 3. To ensure that CMS Resolution 11.15 on the phasing out the use of lead ammunition by hunters is fully implemented; 4. To reduce and eventually to halt the trade in vulture parts for belief-based use; 5. To reduce and eventually to halt the practice of sentinel poisoning by poachers; 6. To substantially reduce vulture mortality caused by electrocutions linked to energy generation and transmission infrastructure; 7. To substantially reduce vulture mortality caused by collisions linked to energy transmission and generation infrastructure; 8. To ensure availability of an appropriate level of safe food to sustain healthy vulture populations; 9. To ensure availability of suitable habitat for vultures to nest, roost and forage; 10. To substantially reduce levels of direct persecution and disturbance of vultures caused by human activities; 11. To support vulture conservation through cross-cutting actions that contribute to addressing knowledge gaps; 12. To advance vulture conservation by effective promotion and implementation of the Vulture MsAP. The Vulture MsAP extends over 12 years and will require a concerted effort throughout this period to ensure successful implementation. The 125 actions recommended in the Vulture MsAP focus on aspects related to research and monitoring, policy and legislation, education and awareness and direct conservation action and all contribute to the successful implementation of the plan across its entire range. Most (108) actions are categorised as either High or Medium priorities for implementation. The remaining 17 actions are judged to be Essential, as their immediate implementation is considered most important to ensure that progress towards achieving the goal of the Vulture MsAP is made as quickly as possible. These Essential actions focus on addressing specific aspects of the critical threats, cross-cutting conservation actions that can be implemented by most Range States to the benefit of vultures, and the establishment of a functional framework for the implementation of the plan across the entire range. The many key stakeholders and their respective roles in achieving these objectives are identified, alongside policy opportunities and barriers to effect wide-scale changes. An overview of international conventions, agreements and policies also provide context in terms of existing structures and possible synergies that can be used to support and assist the achievement of the objectives of the Vulture MsAP. Range States are encouraged to use this document as a guide for the drafting of national vulture conservation action plans suited to the situation, needs and available information in their respective countries. Finally, information is presented on the proposed structure, processes and resources required for successful implementation. This includes details of the coordination team, steering committee, global and regional working groups and other support structures considered essential to ensure effective implementation. It also provides guidance on the monitoring, evaluation and review 11 processes to be followed during the implementation of the Vulture MsAP, as well as components that should be included in communications, fundraising and resource mobilisation plans to promote and garner support for the plan from Range States and other target audiences. The document concludes with a series of Annexes, which provide supplementary information that was collected during the course of the development of the Vulture MsAP and is considered potentially valuable to support planning and implementation. 12 How to use this Action Plan This Multi-species Action Plan to Conserve African-Eurasian Vultures (Vulture MsAP) begins with an introduction on the rationale, aim, objectives, time frame and methods that were followed to develop the Plan for consideration at the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Migratory Species (Section 1). Section 2 explains the overall geographical and species scope of the Plan, moving on to accounts of the 15 species (Section 3); from this, the reader can learn about each of the species, identify which occur in any given area or country of interest, and recognise the main threats to their survival. The threats are described in more detail (Section 4) and mapped according to their severity in each region. Data are insufficient to identify threats and their severity for each country, but in most cases the severity of a threat is comparable in all countries across a given region; where this is believed not to be the case, this is stated. In this way, the reader can then identify the threats in any given area (Annex 3).

This analysis points to the most appropriate objectives, results and actions needed (Section 7) to combat each threat, via further general information on those most likely to be concerned with or affected by vulture conservation actions (stakeholders: Section 5), and relevant policy and legislation (Section 6). Supplementary information and links for further information are provided in Annex 7. Each action proposed is not necessarily appropriate across the entire MsAP range, and it is important to carefully assess the situation, the data and resources available and the key threats for any given area or species before taking them forward for implementation or incorporation into a localised species action plan. The Plan also contains information on, or links to, existing plans and policies focused on relevant threats, individual species or groups of species (including through links presented in Annexes). Two of these documents were developed concurrently with the development of the Vulture MsAP and were consulted extensively with regard to the two species concerned. These are: \u2022 Flyway Action Plan for the Conservation of the Balkan and Central Asian Populations of the Egyptian Vulture (EVFAP, Annex 4) and \u2022 Flyway Action Plan for the Conservation of the Cinereous Vulture (CVFAP, Annex 5). A Blueprint for the Recovery of Asia\u2019s Critically Endangered Gyps Vultures (Annex 7) already exists. It was developed by the Saving Asia\u2019s Vultures from Extinction (SAVE) consortium and is annually updated by the SAVE members. The Blueprint provides clear guidance in terms of regional vulture conservation; the recommended actions in the Vulture MsAP reflect this. 13 List of acronyms and abbreviations AMCEN African Ministerial Conference on the Environment ARDB African Raptor Databank AWF African Wildlife Foundation BCN Bird Conservation Nepal BirdLife BirdLife International BNHS Bombay Natural History Society CITES Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora CMS Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals COP Conference of the Parties CR Critically Endangered (an IUCN Red List category of threat) CU Coordinating Unit (of the CMS Raptors MOU) CZA Central Zoo Authority (India) DEA Department of Environmental Affairs (South Africa) EAC East African Community ECOWAS Economic Community of West African States EN Endangered (an IUCN Red List category of threat) EWT Endangered Wildlife Trust (South Africa) FAP Flyway Action Plan IFC International Finance Corporation IGAD Intergovernmental Authority on Development IUCN International Union for the Conservation of Nature IUCN SSC VSG IUCN Species Survival Commission: Vulture Specialist Group IVRI Indian Veterinary Research Institute LC Least Concern MOU Memorandum of Understanding MsAP Multi-species Action Plan NGO Non-governmental Organisation NSAIDs Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NT Near Threatened (an IUCN Red List category of threat) OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development RSC Regional Steering Committee (of South Asian Governments) PPWG CMS Preventing Poisoning Working Group RSPB Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (UK) SAVE Saving Asia\u2019s Vultures from Extinction (consortium) SEO/BirdLife Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Ornitolog\u00eda (Spanish Ornithological Society \u2013 BirdLife Spain) SsAP Single-species Action Plan TPF The Peregrine Fund, Inc.

In addition, the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) was tasked to support the Coordinating Unit in facilitating development of the Vulture MsAP. In February 2016, the Coordinating Unit established an Interim Steering Group, including representatives from IUCN SSC Vulture Specialist Group, BirdLife International and other specialists, to guide the planning and preparations for the development of the Vulture MsAP. Mission To bring together representatives of Range States, partners and interested parties, to develop a coordinated Vulture MsAP for submission to the 12th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP12) to the CMS, scheduled to be held in October 2017. Aim and Objectives The overall aim is to develop a comprehensive strategic conservation Action Plan covering the geographic ranges of all 15 migratory Old World vultures to promote concerted, collaborative and coordinated international actions through achievement of three objectives: 1. To rapidly halt current population declines in all species covered by the Vulture MsAP; 2. To reverse recent population trends to bring the conservation status of each species back to a favourable level; and 3. To provide conservation management guidelines applicable to all Range States covered by the Vulture MsAP. Timeline and milestones Table 1 reflects the outline timetable that has been followed to ensure that the overall delivery deadline, established by CMS Resolution 11.14, is met. 15 Table 1.

A Multi-species Action Plan has the same goal, but focuses on several species with declining populations facing a range of threats within an identified geographical scale. Conservation actions for such mobile and wide ranging species as vultures can only be effective if implemented across international political boundaries at the flyway scale; this requires a broad collaborative approach and the engagement of all Range States. These fundamental necessities underpin the principles for developing such plans: scientific rigour; stakeholder consultation; participation and consensus; and consideration of existing efforts. The methods used to develop this Vulture MSAP adhere to these principles. Species assessment and status review The 15 species of vultures stipulated by consensual agreement in the Vulture MsAP Project Charter were assessed by means of extensive literature review. Evidence for threats were identified, and the success or otherwise of conservation measures taken, were similarly assessed. Species conservation status is based on the information provided by the IUCN Red List\u2019s delegated authority in terms of the status of threatened birds, BirdLife International. Questionnaires To acquire the most current information and feedback with regard to species population status and trends as well as existing threats and conservation actions focused on vultures within range countries, questionnaires were used. The questionnaires requested information per species from Range States and species experts on biological information, threats and conservation effort. This tool also enabled the capture of current information that was not yet accessible through peer reviewed scientific literature and other publications. Questionnaires were drafted and distributed to stakeholders in all Range States for completion and submission at least 10 days prior to the commencement of each regional workshop. However, questionnaires completed subsequent to 16 these deadlines and during the regional workshops were also considered and included in the overall datasets derived from these responses.

Coordination Overall planning, direction and oversight of the development of the Vulture MsAP was provided by the Coordinating Unit of the CMS Raptors MOU. BirdLife International and the Vulture Conservation Foundation were contracted to supervise and manage particular aspects of the process. Three Regional Coordinators and one Overarching Coordinator were appointed, primarily to take responsibility for the collection of regional information, coordination and arrangement of regional workshops and to contribute to the drafting of the Vulture MsAP. In February 2016, all Range States were invited to submit nominations for the Vulture Working Group which ultimately included over 60 individuals. A subset was invited to form a 20-person Steering Group which met regularly via online teleconference. Regional Workshops Four regional workshops were held between October 2016 and February 2017 within the Vulture MsAP range, each relating to a significant part of the global range of African-Eurasian vultures (Table 2). A total of 212 delegates attended these workshops, the aim of which was to gather the information necessary to develop the regional component of the Vulture MsAP, including all vulture species that occur in the region being covered by the Plan, with special attention given to species status, threats and priority conservation actions. The workshops all followed a similar agenda and were conducted with facilitation provided by a range of experienced participants who were briefed on the methods to be followed. Table 2.

Identified threats were categorised, based on the feedback received, from additional information presented and questionnaire responses received prior to each of the regional workshops. Group discussions assessed and categorised threats in terms of the scope, severity and time frame, while also evaluating the quality of evidence that these assessments were based upon. Each threat was then ranked in order of its impact at levels ranging from critical to low, and subsequently analysed to determine demographic impacts, drivers and root causes. These allowed problem trees to be drawn up, an example of which, for unintentional poisoning (Figure 1) is shown below. The threats are presented, along with supporting scientific evidence, in Section 3. 17 Unintentional Poisoning Use of poisons in vermin control programmes targeted at feral dogs and rats Poor disposal of poisoned carcasses Lack of appropriate guidelines of vermin control through poison use Poor knowledge of impacts to wildlife Poison use is cheaper and faster than alternative vermin control methods Lack of resources Poisoning of damage- causing animals Human-animal conflict related to loss of livestock and crops Breakdown of effective herding and livestock management practices Lack of resources and capacity of wildlife authorities to respond to conflict Lack of appropriate and rapid response from Wildlife authorities Inadequate distribution of revenue from wildlife management Weak legislation on illegal wildlife poisoning and crime Figure 1. An example of a problem tree for Unintentional Poisoning produced from results of threat analysis at the African Regional Workshop. Group discussions were aimed at identifying and understanding the drivers and root causes of each threat and to identify appropriate actions to reduce their respective impacts. Each action was also allocated a level of priority and timeframe for implementation within the Vulture MsAP framework. Parties responsible for implementation as well as key stakeholders for each action were also identified. The combined outcome of these processes is reflected in Section 7 - Framework for Action. Overarching Workshop An Overarching Workshop was held on 16 - 19 February 2017 at Toledo, Spain which was attended by 40 participants. The key objectives were to undertake the following tasks to assist in the preparation of a consultative 2nd draft of the Vulture MsAP: \u2022 Review the first consolidated draft of the Vulture MsAP, incorporating the four regional components from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, and other inputs; \u2022 Elaborate certain key strategic components of the Vulture MsAP which were not collectively considered at the four Regional Workshops; and \u2022 Engender and develop multi-lateral support, including identifying 'Vulture Champions'. 18 External review In January 2017, a first draft of the Vulture MsAP had been circulated for initial review to 50 specialists involved in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d126f03-71f0-49f2-afaa-031d7e99a71c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d126f03-71f0-49f2-afaa-031d7e99a71c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8b13e2762bac68f745f20120a33b4f89fe8cf1511d7ca3dc4cd8d66e916cea58"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc8a014a-a6a9-4250-9b32-c4805c66b554", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22c106ee39a8fa0c4b51f90446ed08a3189343aec92ec7554589745e4e1dd764"}}, "hash": "df2209979226932796de9d248977098fdc713f22df2194219fede815362374a0", "text": "Vulture MsAP Steering Group, the Technical Advisory Group to the Raptors MOU and pre-registered participants for the Overarching Workshop.

Additional information and suggested amendments gathered at the Overarching Workshop were incorporated to produce a 2nd Draft of the Vulture MsAP. As part of a month-long Public Consultation Exercise, which commenced on 16 March 2017, the Coordinating Unit of the CMS Raptors MOU posted the 2nd Draft on the Raptors MOU website (found at http://www.cms.int/raptors/en/news/public-consultation-exercise-2nd-draft-multi-species-action- plan-conserve-african-eurasian) and circulated the link to more than 1000 email addresses, including contacts within the Range States covered by the Vulture MsAP. Written feedback was received from 58 respondents, raising more than 250 separate issues. All these comments and suggestions were carefully reviewed and, where appropriate, incorporated in the Vulture MsAP. The final draft Vulture MsAP was submitted to the CMS Secretariat in May 2017, for consideration at the 2nd Meeting of the Sessional Committee of the CMS Scientific Council (July 2017), and by the 12th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CMS (October 2017). 19 2. Scope 2.1 Geographic scope The Vulture MsAP covers most of the combined land masses of Africa and Eurasia, an area supporting a readily defined community of vulture species, several with ranges spanning more than one continent. A total of 128 Range States (Figure 2) host populations of one or more species of African-Eurasian vultures and are therefore included within the geographic range of the Vulture MsAP. This includes a small number of Range States where vultures have been recorded only rarely or in very small numbers of non-breeding individuals, so no specific conservation actions are proposed in these countries. Figure 2. Map showing Vulture MsAP Range States of Africa and Eurasia (shaded), together with Parties to CMS and Signatories to the Raptors MOU. 2.2 Taxonomic scope The Vulture MsAP covers 15 of the 16 species classified as Old World vultures (Table 3). Taxonomy and nomenclature (del Hoyo et al. 2014) are as used by CMS and also the IUCN Red List, which for birds is maintained by BirdLife International.

Consequently it is treated as Least Concern in the Red List. The seven vulture species of the Americas are not closely related to those of Africa and Eurasia and face different (and in most cases much lesser) threats; they are not considered further in this Vulture MsAP. 21 3. Biological assessment 3.1 Introduction The 15 vulture species considered in this Vulture MsAP are large-bodied (2\u201310 kg) birds adapted for energy efficient soaring flight exploiting updraughts and thermals. They feed on organic tissues from carcasses of large mammals and other carrion located from the air, by seeing either the carcass itself or the responses of other vultures to it. They eat meat, offal, intestines and bones, typically of domestic cattle or wild ungulates, and can take sufficient food into the crop at one meal to last several days. Nests are typically on cliffs or in trees; some species are colonial breeders.

Gyps vultures are typically widespread and abundant, historically accounting for the majority of individual vultures in both Africa and Asia. Five of the remaining seven species are fairly similar to Gyps in their size, structure and ecology (although Hooded Vulture is notably smaller), and together these 13 species form their own taxonomic group. The remaining two, Egyptian and Bearded Vulture, are relatively distinct from the others (and each other) in appearance and are not their closest relatives, but as raptors dependent on scavenging they are treated as vultures.

Distribution: In Europe, the distribution is patchy, following a widespread decline over the last two centuries principally because of direct or indirect human causes; it has disappeared from almost all mountains ranges across Europe. The population in the Balkans was the last to become extinct, as late as in the beginning of this century (Andevski 2013), and the species remained only in the Pyrenees, Corsica and Crete. Since the mid-1980s the species has been reintroduced to several European mountain ranges, initially in the Alps, and more recently in Andalusia, Grands Causses and Picos de Europa. In Asia, the main and substantial populations occur along the full length of the Himalayas, extending from central China westwards through all the montane states of northern India, and Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan into central Asia as well as Mongolia. Middle Eastern Red List Category: Near Threatened (2014); previously Least Concern. Population size: 2,000\u201310,000 (1,300\u20136,700 mature individuals) Population trend: Decreasing Distribution: Africa, Europe, Asia 23 populations extend from south-west Iran into much of Turkey, with more isolated populations in Yemen and south-west Saudi Arabia. Bearded Vultures occur in Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania in East Africa, Lesotho and South Africa in southern Africa, and Morocco. They could conceivably survive in Algeria and Mauritania. Population size and trend: The current European population estimate is 590\u2013749 pairs, which equates to 1,200\u20131,600 mature individuals. Population trends in Europe vary regionally and locally. Even though the population in western Europe (207) is increasing, the last two island populations, Crete and Corsica, are stable and near extinction respectively. There is a lack of information for the species in Turkey and the Caucasus. The species has been successfully reintroduced in the Alps (Austria, France, Italy and Switzerland) and Andalusia, Spain (Zink and Waldvogel 2015). Asian populations are regarded as being relatively large and stable but with signs of significant, more localised declines. There are reports of declines in observations over recent decades, notably from Turkey, upper Mustang (Nepal), Uttarakhand (India) and Yemen, but birds are apparently surviving in these areas. The higher Himalayan populations together with those in south-east Kazakhstan and Armenia are all regarded as more stable. In Africa, the largest known populations are found in Ethiopia, where there is an estimated few hundred pairs (Angelov 2013), but this population has not been fully assessed. There is also a small population of less than 10 pairs in Kenya and northern Tanzania (BirdLife International 2016a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "31203965-1e3f-4df1-84f2-607f0041bb81": {"__data__": {"id_": "31203965-1e3f-4df1-84f2-607f0041bb81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4a8088cb20bcf3d74365e3a4996fd07eba3a5b5367136c5b42fc0f87289cce7"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a2450d5-6885-426f-92c8-2e5a5906da0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5e3fa5d3089811a5c390bc47a5100d3b91e255e9b68dd9c7154d0f142b59354"}}, "hash": "260584c1076183d3a7c92a5bd46b66d4500dfbef88301f39847e999efde3bb2b", "text": "The geographically isolated population in Lesotho and South Africa is currently estimated at 200\u2013250 individuals and has declined by more than 80% over the last three generations (Kr\u00fcger 2015).

Although younger birds can exploit large areas moving across much of Europe before becoming territorial, the species shows philopatric behaviour, which has a negative effect in the expansion of occupied territories (Don\u00e1zar 1993). Irregular movements for this species have also been recorded in Europe with recent records for this species from Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. In southern Africa, tracking studies indicate that adult, breeding birds are largely sedentary and forage within close proximity of active nests; juvenile and immature birds can cover most of the species\u2019 range in the region while foraging, regularly crossing the border between Lesotho and South Africa (Kr\u00fcger 2015). Habitat: The species occupies remote mountainous areas, with precipitous terrain, usually above 1,000 m; and in Europe and Asia in particular areas where large predators such as wolves, snow leopard and golden eagles are present, and there are herds of mammals such as mountain goats, ibex, and sheep (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In Africa, it is also restricted to higher altitudes such as the Ethiopian highlands and the Ukuhlamba-Drakensberg, but in southern Africa it is almost entirely dependent on livestock carcasses due to the almost complete absence of wild ungulates over much of its range. Usually they are limited to alpine habitat, with vegetation being the distribution limiting factor (Hiraldo et al. 1979). Ecology: As a scavenger, Bearded Vultures consume prey remains left by predators or other scavengers; 70% of the biomass of their diet is bones. Of the remainder, 25% consists of soft tissue and 5% skin (Hiraldo et al. 1979). Only during the period when they are raising young do they need soft tissue. Bearded Vultures preferentially consume large bones up to 25 cm in length and 3.5 cm in diameter (Llopis 1996). Bones too big to be swallowed whole are dropped on to a rocky surface from 20\u201370 m height, with the birds collecting the fragments and the marrow (Boudoint 1976). The species is mostly monogamous, but trios (two males and one female) are also often documented (Razin 2015). They construct large nests (averaging 1 m in diameter), composed of branches and wool, situated on remote overhanging cliff ledges or in caves that are re-used over the years. Breeding occurs from December to September in Europe and northern Africa; October-May in 24 Ethiopia; May-January in southern Africa; year round in much of eastern Africa; and December-June in India (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Eggs are incubated for 54 days on average and nestlings fledge after almost four months in the nest (Margalida 2002). In the case where two eggs are laid, obligatory \u2018cainism\u2019 occurs in which the older sibling kills the younger (Thaler and Pechlaner 1980), a common trait in larger raptors. Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits). Feeding on carcasses poisoned by poison baits targeting mammalian predators is thought to be the most significant cause for declines in this species in Europe (Margalida et al. 2008), southern Africa (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2014) and Morocco (Cherkaoui 2015). In Ethiopia, the species is threatened by the use of poisons to control dogs at refuse tips (BirdLife International 2017). In some parts of Spain, Bearded Vultures are believed to be at risk from organophosphate exposure when feeding on the carcasses of livestock that were given anti-parasitic treatment prior to death (Mateo et al. 2015). \u2022 Collision with energy infrastructure (powerlines). Mortalities of birds colliding with powerlines and other cables are known from Europe and southern Africa (Kr\u00fcger et al. 2014). The planned expansion of the powerline network in the Ethiopian highlands could have a substantial impact on this species (BirdLife International 2017). Other types of cables with which this species is known to collide include ski-lift and cable car infrastructure. \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (lead).

Subedi pers. comm.). \u2022 Human disturbance. A range of human activities in close proximity to nesting sites may have an impact on breeding success and may cause abandonment of previously successful nests. These include recreational activities such as mountaineering, climbing and recreational aviation, such as paragliding. A range of developments and construction could have a similar effect. Pipeline construction through the Altai and Caucasus mountains, and powerline construction is planned from Tajikistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan and India (BirdLife International 2017) that could impact on this species. \u2022 Habitat loss and degradation. Rapid increases in grazing pressure and human populations driven by pastoralism in West Asia could reduce the amount of food and available nesting sites for this species (BirdLife International 2017). Potential threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). Although the species is primarily a bone eater, the most significant potential threat to the species in South Asia may be from diclofenac, through ingestion of contaminated carcasses and resultant kidney failure (reviewed by Das et al. 2011). It is not known if diclofenac residues remain within bones of treated animals, but the local collapse in Gyps species could allow this species greater access to feed on soft tissues from which it would have been excluded (BirdLife International 2017). 25 \u2022 Collision with energy infrastructure (wind farms). Proliferation of wind farms in various parts of the species\u2019 range should be closely monitored to assess and record any impact on the species. Rushworth and Kr\u00fcger (2014) predicts devastating consequences for the southern African Bearded Vulture population should the several thousand turbines currently planned for development by the Lesotho government, materialise. \u2022 Genetic bottlenecks. Small, isolated populations of this species could in the long term suffer a reduction in genetic diversity which could influence breeding success and the long term survival of such populations unless they are carefully managed. This also applies to re- introduced populations in areas where genetic exchange with existing wild populations is unlikely. \u2022 Climate change. It is predicted that species breeding at higher altitudes, such as Bearded Vulture in southern Africa, may experience range contractions due to increased temperatures (Simmons and Jenkins 2007). 3.3 Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus Distribution: Egyptian Vulture is a Palearctic, Afrotropical and western Indo-Himalayan species: a breeding (summer) migrant across the northern part of the range, but with resident populations and non-breeding visitors further south. The northern breeding range includes southern Europe and North Africa eastwards through the Balkans, Turkey, Iran, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. There are sedentary populations in Spain: on the Balearic Islands (on Menorca mainly) and (endemic subspecies majorensis) the Canary Islands, consisting of fewer than 40 pairs in each case (Kretzmann et al. 2003); recently, a wintering population of 120 individuals has been recorded in Extremadura (S\u00e1nchez at al. 2015). A very small resident population is also present on the islands of Cabo Verde. The smaller Asian subspecies (ginginianus) is largely sedentary, remaining within the Indian sub- continent (Pakistan, India, Nepal), although other populations (of the nominate race) are also sedentary in Arabia (Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen) as well as much of the Central and East African range. The African range is huge, concentrated along a broad band of the Sahel from Sudan (Nikolaus 1987) and Ethiopia (holding the largest African breeding population: Mundy et al. 1992), Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti west to Senegal (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004, Petersen et al. 2007, Wacher et al. 2013) and south to Kenya and northern Tanzania. It also occurs in North Africa (Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya and Egypt: Levy 1996). A few resident pairs may occur in Angola, but it is currently considered regionally extinct as a breeding species in South Africa (Taylor et al. 2015) and Namibia (Simmons et al. 2015).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dfd9f0a-7e88-4b3a-8ffb-069c5ab185c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dfd9f0a-7e88-4b3a-8ffb-069c5ab185c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "025657ada74b952fcd627c55aa9f6213ad4a92e2bbad512cd688f26fbf907cd5"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3ef2854-e9a7-4440-b889-a89f31d0c9e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8a0e9dd7839750ec80ac49beed8eea389dfba7f91e18d020d3d102d9f5bd100"}}, "hash": "ed617d0c57df6a71148fcf284a9ca538dd673afdc555b934daba1e01a1c95dfd", "text": "2015) and Namibia (Simmons et al. 2015).

The population is generally decreasing all over its range, except for some isolated island populations in the Mediterranean on Menorca and in the south- western part of Asia, notably Socotra (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Porter and Suleyman 2012) and Masirah (Angelov et al. 2013c). In India, it has declined by more than 90% in the last ten years (Cuthbert et al. 2006); European populations have declined by 50\u201379% over the last three generations and there is evidence of high juvenile mortality on migration (Oppel et al. 2015). Western, eastern and southern African breeding populations also appear to have declined significantly, as have Arabian populations (Jennings 2010). Africa holds the main wintering grounds of the eastern migratory population, but the African estimate for annual wintering and migrating individuals is less than 2,000. Ethiopia holds probably the largest congregation of wintering Egyptian Vultures in eastern Africa, with over 1,000 individuals annually; however, a decline in these numbers has been reported over the last five years (Arkumarev et al. 2014). Buij and Croes (2014) states that the species occurs in Cameroon as a breeding resident and as a Palearctic migrant. In Chad, Djibouti, Niger, Nigeria, and Somalia the current population status is unknown (Meyburg et al. 2004, Oppel et al. 2015). Movements: The populations breeding on the Canary Islands, Balearic Islands, Cabo Verde islands, Socotra and Masirah Island, on the Arabian Peninsula, and those on the Indian subcontinent are 27 sedentary. Northern breeders conduct long distance intercontinental migrations, flying over land, and often utilise the narrowest part of the Strait of Gibraltar or the Bosphorus and Dardanelles on their way to sub-Saharan Africa (Garc\u00eda-Ripoll\u00e9s et al. 2010, L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al. 2014, Oppel et al. 2015). Other known migration bottlenecks are the Gulf of Iskenderun in Turkey (Oppel et al. 2014), Suez in Egypt (Bougain and Oppel 2016), and Bab el Mandeb between Yemen and Djibouti (McGrady et al. 2013). On the Indian subcontinent, the population is elevated, especially in north-western India, by the migrant nominate race in the winter, but the exact regional distribution and status of the two races remains unclear. Egyptian Vultures are rare and irregular visitors to southern Africa, where they used to breed; a few may still do so in northern Namibia. Migratory adult birds spend about 6\u20137 months on the breeding grounds (March-September) and the rest of the year along the flyway and in the wintering grounds. After the first migration (August- October), the juvenile Egyptian Vultures remain in the wintering regions for at least 1.5 years (in some cases up to three years) and do not attempt spring migration in the year after their first arrival in Africa (Oppel et al. 2015). Habitat: In most parts of its breeding range, this species inhabits arid woodlands and semi-arid bush country, especially canyons and rocky areas, often near villages and along roads. It usually occurs singly or in pairs, less commonly in small groups, and rarely in large groups of more than 100. It soars low in search of food. It roosts on cliff faces or in dead trees and is rarely found far from nesting cliffs. It is less wary and more tolerant of humans than other vultures. The wintering habitat includes mainly sub-deserts and savanna in the Sahel zone (Oppel et al. 2015, Meyburg et al. 2004) where birds often roost on pylons (Arkumarev et al. 2014). Ecology: The Egyptian Vulture typically nests on ledges or in caves on cliffs (Sar\u00e0 and Di Vittorio 2003), crags and rocky outcrops, but occasionally also in large trees, buildings (mainly in India), electricity pylons (Naoroji 2006) and exceptionally on the ground (Gangoso and Palacios 2005).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0bbca1e-6266-4f93-bcfe-8e96c7467c85": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0bbca1e-6266-4f93-bcfe-8e96c7467c85", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f1e37a05a430d4a440252bd1b41814ba79c9204c206698d72c32c08ceadac11"}, "2": {"node_id": "af507330-6c8a-40fa-9cd7-da0de04a1935", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22c58c5ee5260ece2c865462c51f66b155d42d354f39275a6982665e8201ca29"}}, "hash": "cb4e9fd4252833bcb692a9d36d7a8e22bc2d97c384bd1d53ee16aa89d8ac2fed", "text": "It forages in lowland and montane regions over open, often arid, country, while also scavenging at human settlements, being an opportunistic scavenger with a broad diet including carrion (not only livestock but often domestic chicken), tortoises, organic waste, insects, young vertebrates, eggs and faeces (Margalida et al. 2012, Dobrev et al. 2015, 2016).

Disposal of poisoned feral dog carcasses from problem animal control actions at dumps in Ethiopia also pose a threat (BirdLife International 2017). \u2022 Electrocution on or collision with energy infrastructure. Incidents of mortality involving this species have been recorded on the Canary Islands (Don\u00e1zar et al. 2002) and Oman (Al Fazari and McGrady 2016) and is considered a possible risk in regions of Spain (Don\u00e1zar et al. 2007 2010, de Lucas et al. 2008) and in Africa, especially at congregation sites where a 30 km section of powerline near Port Sudan is known to have caused the deaths of hundreds of Egyptian Vultures and other birds of prey since its construction in the 1950s (Angelov et al. 2013). 28 \u2022 Decline of food availability (wild and domestic ungulate populations). Improvement of slaughterhouse sanitation and declines in wild ungulate populations seem to have contributed to the decline of this species in Africa (Mundy et al. 1992, Ogada et al. 2016). Amended management practices at refuse dumps in Europe and the Middle East (Al Fazari and McGrady 2016) may also result in reduced availability of food. \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). Veterinary drugs, especially NSAIDs have been implicated in the serious declines of this species recorded in South Asia (Cuthbert et al. 2006, Galligan et al. 2014), with population trends closely corresponding to those of Gyps vultures known to reflect diclofenac use in that region. Secondary threats: \u2022 Direct persecution (belief-based use). At least four cases of direct persecution of Egyptian Vultures are known from West Africa (Nikolov 2014, Buij et al 2016) while 15\u201316 individuals of this species have been shot in Macedonia between 1983\u20132002 (Grubac et al 2014). \u2022 Poisoning (problem animal control). An estimated 60 Egyptian Vultures (>60% of the national population) were poisoned during a single incident in Macedonia in 1993 after the birds fed on a poisoned dog carcass (Velevski et al 2003). The use of poisons to control feral dog populations in Ethiopia also poses a threat to wintering Egyptian Vultures (Abebe 2013). \u2022 Human disturbance and Habitat degradation are also considered threats to this species.

A small population persists in Baluchistan, Pakistan, with 59 seen in 2005, as well as isolated pairs in Sindh up to 2016 (WWF Pakistan pers. comm.). Movements: The species is largely sedentary; however, individuals can forage over considerable areas and there is some seasonal altitudinal movement (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Bildstein (2006) categorises it as an irruptive and local migrant. As with Gyps species, immatures are probably more nomadic (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Little is known about movements, but new satellite tracking data indicate that at least some birds move across international borders between India and Nepal (Coordinating Unit of the Raptors MOU 2015). Range of movement patterns may also have reduced in tandem with its decline (Naoroji 2006).

They attend carcasses with other vultures but tend to be more timid. Breeding pairs are territorial and they exclude conspecifics. Nests are usually built in tall trees, often at the top, however smaller shrubs (2\u20133 m in height) will be used in the absence of taller trees. Because of their territorial behaviour, Red-headed Vultures generally occur at lower densities than other Asian vulture species. 30 Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). The anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, may be a major cause of mortality, as is the case in Gyps vultures (Oaks et al. 2004, Shultz et al. 2004). However, the toxicity of diclofenac and other veterinary NSAIDs to Red-headed Vultures has not been tested experimentally and there are no relevant post-mortem findings for Red-headed Vultures indicating toxicity or lack of it. Given the similarity of recent population trends of this species to those of Gyps bengalensis and G. indicus (Galligan et al. 2014) and other species of raptors (Cuthbert et al. 2014), it is prudent to treat diclofenac as a major threat to this species pending improved information. \u2022 A second NSAID commonly used in South Asia, ketoprofen, has also been identified to be lethal to Gyps vulture species (Naidoo et al. 2009); measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicate that concentrations are sufficient to cause Gyps vulture mortalities (Taggart et al. 2007). There are risks of poisoning from other NSAIDs. Although there is no evidence either way concerning the toxicity of NSAIDs to Red-headed Vultures, it is sensible to regard NSAIDs as a major threat to this species. \u2022 Decline of food availability (wild and domestic ungulate populations). The primary reason behind this species\u2019 decline in South-east Asia (Myanmar and countries to the east) is thought to be the demise of large wild ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry resulting in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (BirdLife International 2016a). \u2022 Poisoning (problem animal control). Accidental poisoning at carcasses deliberately laced with pesticides to kill feral dogs or wild carnivores (BirdLife International 2017) is a major threat in South-east Asia, China and more recently in north-eastern India (Assam). Secondary threats: \u2022 Habitat loss and degradation. The loss of trees (general forest loss and direct destruction of nesting trees) is a threat mainly in South-east Asia and China. \u2022 Electrocution on or collision with energy infrastructure. This risk is likely to be a threat in many parts of the range, although there is currently little documented evidence for this. \u2022 Intentional poisoning (belief-based use). Together with related persecution, this has been reported in Cambodia. 31 3.5 White-headed Vulture Trigonoceps occipitalis Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route Figure 6: Distribution map of the White-headed Vulture Trigonoceps occipitalis.

The species is thought to be a long-lived resident that maintains a territory (Murn and Holloway 2014, del Hoyo et al. 1994). It nests and roosts in trees, most nests being in Acacia spp. or baobabs (Mundy et al. 1992). The species is highly sensitive to land use and is highly concentrated in protected areas (Murn et al. 2015). Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits). Especially in East and southern Africa, poisoned baits targeting mammalian carnivores causing livestock losses kill these birds when they feed on the baits themselves or the animals that were killed by them. \u2022 Decline of food availability (wild ungulate populations).

Secondary threats: \u2022 Intentional poisoning (sentinel poisoning). Especially in southern Africa (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2015), carcasses of large mammals such as elephant and buffalo are deliberately laced with poison after being poached, to reduce vulture numbers in areas where poachers are active. 33 3.6 Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route Figure 7: Distribution map of the Hooded Vulture Necrosyrtes monachus. Distribution: A widespread resident throughout, and endemic to, sub-Saharan Africa, including densely forested areas in Central Africa. Population size and trend: Estimated at 197,000 individuals (Ogada and Buij 2011) but rapidly declining; this decline has been projected at 83% (range 64\u201393%) over the last three generations (Ogada et al. 2016). Movements: The species is generally considered sedentary, with some dispersal of non-breeders and immature birds, especially in response to rainfall (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Recent satellite tracking has shown that individuals move several hundreds of kilometres from their capture sites between South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe (Coordinating Unit of the Raptors MOU 2015).

In southern Africa, it tends to avoid human settlements and often breeds in large trees along river courses (Roche 2006). It occurs up to 4,000 m, but is most numerous below 1,800 m. Ecology: The species feeds on carrion, but in urban areas it congregates at slaughterhouse disposal sites and rubbish dumps. It is gregarious at larger carcasses but because of its smaller size is often dominated by larger species. Generally, north of the equator it is a human commensal, gathering in large numbers in urban areas (Ogada and Buij 2011). South of the equator it is generally more solitary and is largely found in conservation areas where it relies on natural food for most of its diet (Anderson 1999).

Population size and trend: The current population estimate is in the region of 66,000\u2013334,000 mature individuals (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, BirdLife International 2017), although this is not based on survey data. The population trend from counts in part of Nepal indicates a decline during 36 the period when diclofenac was in widespread use, 1994\u20132006 (Acharya et al. 2009), but with a partial recovery up to 2014 (Paudel et al. 2015). These surveys only cover a very small part of the range and other studies have shown more stable trends. Movements: Bildstein (2006) lists this species as a partial and rains migrant with some seasonal altitudinal movements in the winter (also Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Naoroji 2006). Naoroji (2006) describes it as a common resident throughout the Himalayas \u2018prone to some altitudinal winter migration\u2019 where it descends into the lower foothills. Its winter movements and extent of wandering into the plains have not been fully monitored or documented. However, immature individuals routinely wander large distances beyond Sino-Himalaya and Central Asia in the winter, into the plains of South-east Asia (over 30 records between 1979 and 2008 involving many more individual vultures) and some even to southern India (Ding and Kasorndorkbua 2008, Praveen et al. 2014). A satellite tagged individual in India marked outside the species\u2019 breeding range was tracked to Kazakhstan (Naoroji 2006, V. Prakash and D. Pain pers. comm.). Habitat: This species inhabits mountainous areas, mostly at 1,200\u20134,500 m, but has been recorded up to 6,000 m (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). In winter it moves lower down, with juveniles wandering into open plains and grasslands; it has been observed foraging on rubbish dumps (BirdLife International 2016a). Ecology: The Himalayan Griffon feeds exclusively on carrion (del Hoyo et al. 1994). It soars and glides over large areas often with other vultures in search of carcasses. Small numbers attend carcasses which can be consumed rapidly, and are dominant over other vulture species except Black Vultures. Del Hoyo et al. (1994) report that the species is often associated with domestic ungulate flocks in mountainous areas.

Diclofenac poisoning has been less well documented in Himalayan Griffon compared to other Asian Gyps vultures (Green et al. 2004) but the species is known to be susceptible to its negative effects (Das et al. 2010). Veterinary use of diclofenac is probably infrequent within the breeding range of Himalayan Griffon so adults are unlikely to be exposed, but immatures are likely to be exposed to the drug when they migrate to lowland areas of India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan; indeed, there are documented incidents of this (Das et al. 2010).

Young birds probably always moved there, but the empty niche means that far more are now likely to be going into these areas with high diclofenac prevalence. Given the high sensitivity of vulture population growth rate to additional mortality of adults (Niel and Lebreton 2005, Green et al. 2004), but lower sensitivity to decreased recruitment of young, the effects of diclofenac on population trends of this species are likely to be lower than for lowland Gyps species. Other NSAIDs, known to be toxic to Gyps vultures, are likely also to affect this species. \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits).

An extensive road transect survey in 2015 revised the population estimate for India down to 6,000 individuals (Prakash et al. in review). The smaller additional populations in Nepal (substantially fewer than 2,000 individuals: DNPWC 2015), Cambodia (130 individuals in 2014, 92 in 2015: Sum and Loveridge 2016), Myanmar, Bangladesh (260 individuals: MoEF 2016), Bhutan and Pakistan (250\u2013350 individuals estimated in 2015: WWF Pakistan pers. comm.) are unlikely to increase the total overall figure above 8,000. Extremely rapid population declines of about 50% per year were documented in India and Pakistan (Prakash 1999, Gilbert et al. 2002), resulting in a decline in India of about 99.9% between 1992 and 2007 (Prakash et al. 2007). The species declined in Pakistan, from being abundant in the 1990s to extinction in most of the country, with low hundreds of pairs, mostly confined to Sind province. Nest counts in one breeding area in India and widespread road transect surveys across northern India show that the rapid decline began in about 1994, approximately coincident with the introduction of the veterinary NSAID diclofenac, based upon surveys of veterinary pharmacists (Cuthbert et al. 2015). Three road transect surveys in India in 2007, 2011 and 2015, indicate that the population in India has been approximately stable during that period and increasingly associated with areas within and near National Parks (Prakash et al. 2012, Prakash et al. in review). Road transect surveys in western Nepal from 2002 to 2009 showed a decline of 75%, but with a partial recovery in 2010 and 2011 (Chaudhary et al. 2012, Prakash et al. 2012).

In the Himalayan foothills, it occurs up to about 1,500 m where it utilises sparsely wooded areas, open areas and human settlements (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Ecology: White-rumped Vultures feed exclusively on carrion and often associate with other vulture species when scavenging at rubbish dumps and slaughterhouses. Food is located by soaring with other vulture species, and considerable aggregations can form. The species adapts well to supplementary food provided at vulture restaurants. It is a highly social species and is usually found in conspecific flocks and regular communal roost sites are used. White-rumped Vultures nest in small colonies in tall trees (5\u201330m in height), often near human habitation, and adjacent to roads, streams or canals (del Hoyo et al. 1994). A study by Murn et al. (2015) indicates that the spatial pattern of nests relies on both the distribution of trees and the ability of trees to support more than one nest. These results highlight that the preservation of larger nest trees and the sustainable management of timber resources are essential components for conservation management. Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). The anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, is the major cause of mortality (Oaks et al. 2004, Shultz et al. 2004). Mortality from this cause has continued in India well after the statutory ban on veterinary use of diclofenac (Cuthbert et al. 2016), though the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac in dead cattle has declined (Cuthbert et al. 2011, Cuthbert et al. 2014). Aceclofenac is closely chemically related to diclofenac and is in legal veterinary use, despite 39 the fact that it metabolises quickly and almost entirely to diclofenac in the bodies of treated cattle (Galligan et al. 2016). \u2022 NSAIDs other than diclofenac are also a threat. Ketoprofen, commonly used in India, has also recently been identified to be lethal to the species; measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India have occurred recently in north-east India (Assam) and is a major threat in SE Asia (Naidoo et al. 2009, Taggart et al. 2007). The recent co-occurrence of extensive visceral gout in dead wild vultures of this species with high levels of a third NSAID, nimesulide, in the liver and kidneys indicates that this drug is probably also causing vulture deaths (Cuthbert et al. 2016). \u2022 Decline of food availability (wild and domestic ungulate populations). The demise of large ungulate populations and improvements in animal husbandry result in a lack of available carcasses for vultures (BirdLife International 2017); this is likely to be the primary reason behind long term decline in South-east Asia, where diclofenac is not used. \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits). Animal carcasses are deliberately laced with pesticides to kill feral dogs and wild carnivores (BirdLife International 2017); this is a major threat in South-east Asia and China and has also occurred recently in north-east India (Assam). Secondary threats: \u2022 Habitat loss and degradation. The loss of trees (general forest loss and direct destruction of the nesting tree) is a threat mainly in South-east Asia and China. \u2022 Electrocution on or collision with energy infrastructure is likely to be a threat in many parts of the range, although there is currently little documented evidence. \u2022 Intentional poisoning (belief-based use), together with related persecution, has been reported in Cambodia. 40 3.9 White-backed Vulture Gyps africanus Distribution: The White-backed Vulture is the most common and widespread vulture species in Africa, occurring extensively throughout West, East and southern Africa.

Juveniles, in particular, disperse over vast areas. For example, six immature birds tracked from South Africa were found to range across six countries (South Africa, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Botswana and Zimbabwe) and three were noted to travel more than 900 km from their place of capture (Oschadleus 2002, Phipps et al. 2013a) with mean foraging range of 269,103 km2. Some populations are thought to shift their ranges in response to food availability and seasonal rains (Bildstein 2006, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). White-backed Vultures tagged in Kenya are known to travel across large portions of Kenya and into Tanzania (Kendall et al. 2014). Like R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vulture, this species has also been recorded with increasing frequency in the Iberian Peninsula over the last 10 years and these birds are assumed to accompany Griffon Vultures during their northward migration; however, numbers reaching Iberia appear to be significantly smaller than for R\u00fcppell\u2019s, more suggestive of vagrancy, and this occurrence is not included in the range map. Habitat: Primarily a lowland species of open wooded savannah, particularly areas of Acacia. They require tall trees for nesting, usually in loose colonies of 2\u201313 nests (del Hoyo et al. 1994). The species has also been recorded nesting on electricity pylons in South Africa (Anderson and Hohne 2007, de Swardt 2013). Ecology: White-backed Vulture is a highly gregarious species congregating at carcasses, in thermals and at roost sites. The species feeds on carrion and bone fragments of larger carcasses, mainly soft muscle and organ tissue. They soar together with other vultures, which can facilitate efficient foraging. After feeding, they often bathe together with other species at favoured sites (del Hoyo et al. 1994). In South Africa, Monadjem et al. (2013) showed that adult survival was high for vultures with many regularly visiting supplementary feeding sites. Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits) is a major threat, especially in East and southern Africa (Ogada and Keesing 2010, Otieno et al. 2010, Kendall and Virani 2012, Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Botha et al 2015). \u2022 Intentional poisoning (sentinel poisoning). Prevalent in southern Africa (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012, Ogada et al. 2015, Murn and Botha 2017), this is the deliberate poisoning of the carcasses of large mammals such as elephant and buffalo after being poached to reduce vulture numbers in an area where poachers are active; large numbers of birds have been killed in this manner. All vultures occurring in areas where this is practiced are susceptible to this threat, but the threat to White-backed Vultures is particularly severe because of the large number of birds of this species that congregate at carcasses. \u2022 Intentional poisoning (belief-based use) is a threat especially in West and southern Africa (McKean and Botha 2007, McKean et al. 2013, BirdLife International 2017). \u2022 Habitat loss and degradation results mainly from rangeland conversion to crop farming (Virani et al. 2011) and from bush encroachment (Schultz 2007). \u2022 Decline of food availability (wild ungulate populations) affects populations especially in West Africa (Craigie et al. 2010) but also in East Africa (Western et al. 2009) Secondary threats: \u2022 Electrocution on energy infrastructure.

However, there is some evidence of a further decline between 2011 and 2015 (Prakash et al. in review). Movements: Largely sedentary, however individuals forage over considerable areas and immatures are perhaps more nomadic (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is categorised by Bildstein (2006) as an irruptive and local migrant and Naoroji (2006) shows a distribution map of the species where it is present across much of India, described as an uncommon to rare resident (with local migration). The range of movement patterns showed by this species may also have reduced in tandem with its disappearance (Naoroij 2006). Note, however, there have been no tracking studies of this species to date. Habitat: Indian Vultures were previously found in many cities, towns and villages across its range, as well as in a wide range of agricultural habitats and wooded areas. It nests primarily on cliffs and suitable ruined buildings; the belief that it will also nest in trees (del Hoyo et al. 1994) may be mistaken, referring to the similar Slender-billed Vulture (which certainly nests in trees) before the taxonomy was clarified distinguishing the two species. Ecology: This species feeds almost entirely on carrion, and often associates with White-rumped Vulture when scavenging at rubbish dumps and slaughterhouses. Gyps vultures in India play a key role in the wider landscape as providers of ecosystem services, and were previously heavily relied upon to help dispose of animal (especially cattle) and human remains. Indian Vultures soar in search of carrion, often with other vulture species, and are highly gregarious at carcasses. The species can benefit from supplementary food provided at vulture restaurants. They nest in small to large colonies at cliff-nesting sites and smaller colonies when nesting in trees. When the latter is preferred as a nest platform, large trees (7\u201315 m in height) are used (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). The anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac, used to treat domestic livestock, is the major cause of mortality (Oaks et al. 2004, Shultz et al. 2004). Mortality from this cause has continued in India well after the statutory ban on veterinary use of diclofenac (Cuthbert et al. 2016), though the prevalence and concentration of diclofenac in dead cattle has declined (Cuthbert et al. 2011, Cuthbert et al. 2014). Aceclofenac is a pro-drug of diclofenac that is in legal veterinary use, despite the fact that it is almost all rapidly metabolised to diclofenac in the bodies of treated cattle (Galligan et al. 2016). \u2022 NSAIDs other than diclofenac are also a threat. Ketoprofen, commonly used in India, has also recently been identified to be lethal to the species, and measurements of residue levels in ungulate carcasses in India indicates that concentrations are sufficient to cause vulture mortalities (Naidoo et al. 2009, Taggart et al. 2007). The recent co-occurrence of extensive visceral gout in dead wild vultures of related species with high levels of a third NSAID, nimesulide, in the liver and kidneys indicates that this drug is probably also causing vulture deaths (Cuthbert et al. 2016). Secondary threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits) affects vultures that consume carcasses deliberately laced with pesticides to kill feral dogs or wild carnivores. \u2022 Electrocution on or collision with energy infrastructure is likely to be a threat in many parts of the range, although there is currently little documented evidence for this. \u2022 Human disturbance.

Population size and trend: The population is considered to be approximately 1,000\u20132,499 mature individuals, equating to 1,500\u20133,750 individuals (BirdLife International 2016a). An extensive road transect survey in 2015 revised the population estimate for India down to just over 1,000 individuals in India (Prakash et al. in review). There is little information on the Myanmar population, but the Cambodia figure based on coordinated vulture feeding site counts was 63 individuals in 2013, and 47 in 2015 (Sum and Loveridge 2016). Nepal has fewer than 50 (DNPWC 2015) and is unlikely to hold more than 15\u201320 individuals, and a single breeding pair was recorded in Bangladesh in 2015 (MoEF 2016). An extremely rapid decline of more than 95% in 10\u201315 years has been documented (Prakash et al. 2003), although the rate of decline in India has now slowed and the population there may now be stable (Prakash et al. 2012, Prakash et al in review). The species was formerly widespread in Nepal, but is now very rare there. The main populations remaining are in Assam (north-east India) and Cambodia. Movements: The species is largely sedentary, however individuals can forage over large areas and there are some seasonal altitudinal movements (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). It is categorised by Bildstein (2006) as an irruptive and local migrant. As with other Gyps vultures, immatures are likely to be more nomadic. Satellite tagged individuals are known to cross international borders between Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam (UNEP/CMS 2015). Naoroji (2006) reports that some southward winter movement exists, and in winter the species has been seen in India well south of the narrow range in the north where it is normally considered resident. The range of movement shown by this species may also have reduced in tandem with its disappearance (Naoroij 2006). 45 Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route Figure 12: Distribution map of the Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris. Habitat: Across the range, Slender-billed Vultures are found in dry open country and forested areas, although often rely on human habitation for nesting sites and carrion. In South-east Asia it is primarily a lowland species. Ecology: The species feeds almost entirely on carrion, scavenging at rubbish dumps, slaughterhouses and carcasses of wild ungulates. They often soar with other vulture species to locate food and are highly gregarious at food sources. The species adapts well to supplementary food provided at vulture restaurants. Slender-billed Vultures are solitary nesters, primarily in trees. Nesting trees tend to be large, usually at a height of 7\u201325 m.

It formerly bred in Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Namibia, and a small number of roost sites are still used in these countries. Population size and trend: In 2006, the total population was estimated at 8,000\u201310,000 individuals (BirdLife International 2016a), roughly equivalent to 5,300\u20136,700 mature individuals. The global population estimate was revised in 2013 with an estimate of 4,700 pairs or 9,400 mature individuals (Taylor et al. 2015). Piper et al. (1999) reported continued declines in the population in the late 1990s. However, there have been recent population increases (Benson 2015). 47 Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route Figure 13: Distribution map of the Cape Vulture Gyps coprotheres. Movements: The species is considered an irruptive and local migrant by Bildstein (2006). Recent satellite tracking projects have shown that individuals can cover large distances. Phipps et al. (2013b) reported average home ranges of 121,655 km2 for five adults and 492,300 km2 for four immature birds satellite tagged in South Africa. Bamford et al (2007) showed similar results for juveniles in Namibia, but significantly smaller ranges for adults (21,320km\u00b2). The tagged vultures travelled more than 1,000km from the capture site and long distance cross-border movements were not unusual with a total of five countries (Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and South Africa) entered by different vultures. A Cape Vulture satellite tracked in 2014 was recorded moving more than 1,000km between South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe and Mozambique (K. Hoogstad pers. comm. in Coordinating Unit of the Raptors MOU 2015). Small numbers of Cape Vultures have been released in Namibia with satellite tags and have made cross-border movements into Angola (Diekmann and Strachan 2006), while others have reached Zambia (A. Botha pers. comm.). Habitat: Savanna and open grassland, usually near mountains; the most significant breeding sites are located in the savanna biome while smaller colonies are found in the Ukuhlamba-Drakensberg and along the south-east coastal regions of South Africa. Uses cliffs for nesting and roosting (Mundy et al. 1992, Del Hoyo et al. 1994). Trees are also used as nesting and roosting sites but the extent of this remains unclear. Ecology: It is a carrion feeder specialising on larger carcasses, mainly soft muscle and organ tissue. Cape Vultures are highly gregarious, often soaring in groups using conspecifics to help locate food. They are colonial nesters. 48 Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits). The practice of the placement of poisoned baits targeting mammalian carnivores that kill these birds when they feed on the baits themselves or the animals that were killed by them is known to be the most significant threat that affects this species across its range (Boshoff and Anderson 2006). Considered to be the primary reason for the decline of the species and its current extinction as a breeding species in Namibia (Diekmann and Strachan 2006). \u2022 Electrocution on or collision with energy infrastructure. In South Africa, a large number of fatalities have been associated with powerline collisions and electrocutions and more than 1000 Cape Vultures have been killed in this manner in South Africa since 1996 (EWT Mortalities Database).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ace927b-987f-40d8-a494-574df95c9a65": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ace927b-987f-40d8-a494-574df95c9a65", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6676dc0b9298885990e340f8eee803c3f3a0fff1a6b52f4a5693cb748f8e85a"}, "2": {"node_id": "f95b5d1c-872b-4e6a-920d-62ebec1b73de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86676926750cec47ef7b2c57e2a0fff990077a645d2c1318d10479085f339bdd"}}, "hash": "b7acb66a36ea4e4bf812ddcf1427d5cda0f92b8b0a22872963188673fc42064e", "text": "With extensive plans for the development of wind energy installations in South Africa and Lesotho currently in process, many of which will take place within the breeding range of the Cape Vulture, there are concerns that this may further increase the impact of energy infrastructure on this species in future (Pfeiffer and Ralston-Paton 2016). \u2022 Intentional poisoning (belief-based use).

These include recreational and tourism related activities such as mountaineering, climbing and recreational aviation such as paragliding. \u2022 Intentional poisonoing (sentinel poisoning). Almost all sentinel poisoning incidents in southern Africa have occurred outside of the breeding range of this species, so there have been few recorded mortalities from this practice among Cape Vultures to date. However, as the trend in elephant poaching, and the sentinel poisoning associated with it, seems to be expanding and increasing in southern Africa, and South Africa in particular, this is likely to change. \u2022 Decline of food availability. Boshoff and Anderson (2006) ranked a lack of carrion, (particularly during chick rearing) as a significant threat to the species, but acknowledge there was no substantial research to back up this hypothesis. \u2022 Habitat loss and degradation. Schultz (2007) indicated the foraging ability in certain parts of the species\u2019 range may be severely impeded by bush encroachment and thickening which affects the birds\u2019 ability to detect food on the ground. \u2022 Climate change.

Their range also extends south of the Sahel belt through the savanna regions of East Africa in Kenya, Tanzania and they are reported to occur in northern Mozambique. For occurrence in the Iberian Peninsula, see movements below. Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route Figure 14: Distribution map of the R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vulture Gyps rueppelli. Population size and trend: Formerly abundant, the species has experienced extremely rapid declines in much of its range, particularly West Africa. Although the population was estimated at 22,000 50 individuals in the early 1990s (Mundy et al. 1992), based on recent rapid declines projected at 97% (94\u201399%) over the last three generations (Ogada et al. 2016) it is now certainly much lower. Movements: The species is considered an irruptive and local migrant by Bildstein (2006). Daily foraging movements of up to 150\u2013200 km have been recorded (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) and in West Africa they regularly disperse several hundred kilometres north and south in response to seasonal rains (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Recent satellite tracking studies have shown that the species can cover huge areas. Ogada (2014) found that the home range size of a satellite tagged adult was 55,144 km2, while that of an immature bird was 174,680 km2. Kendall (pers. comm.) has found the average home range of this species to be 100,000 km2 with individuals moving between Kenya, Tanzania as far south as Ruaha National Park as well as South Sudan and Ethiopia. In the last 15 years, the species has been recorded far away from its breeding colonies, reaching the Iberian Peninsula and north-eastern regions of South Africa (Kemp and Kemp 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, De Juana 2006). It has been suggested that the movement of R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vulture across the Strait of Gibraltar into Europe in the company of migrant Griffon Vultures may be a regular, annual and considerably under-recorded phenomenon (Guti\u00e9rrez 2003, De Juana 2006, Ram\u00edrez et al. 2011), and this is therefore mapped as a regular, non-breeding population.

It occurs from India west to Portugal and Spain, including some island populations in the Mediterranean (Sardinia, Crete, Cyprus and recently established in Mallorca) as well as the Kvarner Archipelago in Croatia. The range also includes Turkey, the Crimean Peninsula and the Caucasus (Katzner et al. 2004), and to the Middle East and into Central Asia. In North Africa, it is probably extinct as a breeding species, even though it occurs in large numbers during migration in Morocco. The species has been successfully reintroduced to France, Italy and central Bulgaria. Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route (see 3.1) Figure 15: Distribution map of the Griffon Vulture Gyps fulvus. 52 Population size and trend: The European population is estimated at 32,400-34,400 pairs (BirdLife International 2017). Spain alone holds an estimated 25,000 pairs. The population in Europe is significantly increasing (around 200% in the last 12 years), mainly owing to implementation of conservation measures, notably campaigns to minimise poisoning and provide safe food at vulture restaurants. Its range has also expanded thanks to reintroduction projects in France, Italy and the Balkans (Deinet et al. 2013). Movements: Some birds are migratory, overwintering in Africa, although many others are resident or nomadic (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Breeding adults are largely sedentary, but most juveniles are migratory or nomadic. Don\u00e1zar (1993) found that 30% of juvenile Griffon Vultures in Spain migrate for long distances in late winter and spring. Susi (2000) reported that almost 100% of Croatian juveniles migrate. There are concentrations of migrating birds in some specific locations, e.g. Gibraltar and Suez (Bijlsma 1987); Terrasse (2006) found that large numbers move through the eastern Pyrenees in spring northward into France and other countries in western Europe. In south- western Europe, some French birds join the autumn migration of Spanish birds to northern Spain and western Africa (Terrasse 2006); these birds return to France in late winter and early spring, often accompanied by Spanish birds. In recent years, more Griffon Vultures have been seen in central and northern Europe (including Belgium, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia and the Netherlands). This may be linked to the large population increase in Spain and France. Habitat: The species roosts and nests on large cliffs and soars over surrounding open countryside in search of food. It avoids woodlands. The landscape should support the formation of thermals (Mebs and Schmidt 2006) as large vultures prefer to save energy by gliding and soaring over active flight. Generally, it occurs from sea level up to an elevation of 1,500 m and occasionally as high as 2,500 m (Slotta-Bachmayr et al. 2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d534362-97b6-44c9-9aaa-f6462d0ce62a": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d534362-97b6-44c9-9aaa-f6462d0ce62a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0490dd42b0587f3bef5e14ab551bfe58e67dd668f62659e5d946d4b3e23479e0"}, "2": {"node_id": "eaf451f6-476c-4bde-8e5c-a52c399c3087", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66f1e576e28e6cf64a502541d3ebe4e3800a1eb0b11b7f0cb8be978d1d7449ec"}}, "hash": "8b62a9cfe76a3793b74215a0f4694b8f67edd3113fc04dda8f9e1b001522f597", "text": "2006). Ecology: The species needs cliffs for nesting; the nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred (del Hoyo et al. 1994). Griffon Vulture nests in colonies of up to 100 pairs on large cliffs, walls of ravines, and precipices. It feeds almost exclusively on carrion of medium-sized and large domestic and wild animals, often in large numbers, although there are a few records in Spain of birds approaching injured or weak sheep or cattle. Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits) is the most significant threat to Griffon Vultures. Birds are normally killed when feeding from poisoned carcasses set for mammalian predators (Snow and Perrins 1998, Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001) as a result of human predator conflicts. \u2022 Electrocution on energy infrastructure is a threat affecting the species in its entire range of distribution.

In Spain (Ferrer 1993, Palacios and Garcia-Bacquero 2003), in Portugal (Infante et al. 2005) and in the Middle East (Israel), electrocution is also identified as a serious threat to the species (Prinsen et al. 2012). \u2022 Collision with energy infrastructure is considered a highly important threat, especially caused by wind energy development (Strix 2012), but also from electricity cables. \u2022 Decline of food availability (domestic ungulate populations). In parts of Asia and eastern Europe, a reduction in available food supplies has resulted from changes in livestock management practices (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001, Orta et al. 2015). Secondary threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). Veterinary NSAIDs pose a threat to this species. One case of suspected poisoning of a Griffon Vulture caused by flunixin, an NSAID, was recorded in 2012 in Spain (Zorrilla et al. 2015). Diclofenac, a similar NSAID, has caused severe declines in Gyps vulture species across Asia and, following its approval for veterinary use in Spain, could 53 Red List Category: Near Threatened (since 2004) Population size: 15,600\u2013 21,000 individuals Population trend: Stable to slightly increasing Distribution: Europe, Asia potentially cause significant effects on populations of Griffon Vultures there too (Green et al. 2016). \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (lead). Several instances of lead poisoning have been recorded in the Iberian Peninsula (Mateo 1997, Carneiro 2015), where it was also proven that the source of the lead poisoning was ammunition used in hunting. \u2022 Human persecution (without poison) was a serious threat to the species throughout the 19th and 20th centuries in much of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East and was one of the main reasons for population decline. Now it appears to be more relevant to the eastern Europe and Central Asia and possibly the Middle East. \u2022 Habitat degradation and Human disturbance are additional, more localised, threats. 3.15 Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus Alternative names: (Eurasian) Black Vulture, Monk Vulture Distribution: This species breeds in Spain, Greece, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Ukraine, Russia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, Afghanistan, northern Pakistan (BirdLife International 2017), Mongolia and mainland China, with a reintroduced population in France (Heredia 1996, Heredia et al. 1997, BirdLife international 2017). The wintering range includes additional states to the south of the breeding range, in Saudi Arabia, Iran, northern India, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, DPR Korea and Republic of Korea (North and South Korea, respectively). It appears to be very rare and of irregular occurrence in Africa (e.g. Egypt: Goodman and Meininger 1989), with no reliable records in Sudan (Nikolaus 1987) but several observations in West Africa (Borrow and Demey 2014, A. Cami\u00f1a pers. comm.). Population size and trend: The most recent global population estimate for Cinereous Vulture is 7,800\u201310,500 pairs, which equals to 15,600\u201321,000 mature individuals. This consists of 2,300\u20132,500 pairs in Europe (BirdLife International 2004) and 5,500\u20138,000 pairs in Asia. Although quantified information is not available, the trend across Asia is believed to be an ongoing moderate decline. The latest population count for wintering Cinereous Vultures in the South Korea was 2,532 individuals in 2012 (Cultural Heritage Administration 2012). In Europe, the species occurs in Spain (2,068 breeding pairs in 2012\u201315 and increasing), Portugal (up to 18 pairs) and France (31 pairs in 2016). In Greece, the population is located at a single colony (21\u201335 breeding pairs, slowly increasing). Recently collected data from Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East suggest a population estimate of 9,657\u201312,306 breeding pairs, with a stable or increasing population trend in Europe and probably declining in Asia. 54 Resident Breeding visitor Non-breeding Probably extinct Extinct \uf050 Passage route Figure 16: Distribution map of the Cinereous Vulture Aegypius monachus.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d6824620-375d-4666-8617-f3e216d3701c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d6824620-375d-4666-8617-f3e216d3701c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44cd4604542e6381efdc48d803414d4f230f5c827c7f45507cea8ae08b1c6b97"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d4dd573-b706-4d3c-83e6-552ba84a7bb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "89b760286c28ceb5a049f6c6bb678da8a0ca00a33a10ddb52739480d499df052"}}, "hash": "0dbdbd2c855d92625907f01c6001a1ee2d35659d15b88446fd5b763639ba3d26", "text": "Movements: The species is a partial migrant (Bildstein 2006); while it is sedentary in some areas, many individuals winter south of the breeding range, and there is also a good deal of nomadism.

Many adults and juveniles in Mongolia apparently migrate in autumn to wintering areas in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) (Batbayar 2004, Batbayar et al. 2006), while birds from central Asia migrate to the Indian subcontinent, southern China, Russian Far East, and the Republic of Korea (Batbayar 2006). In Europe, the adults are mostly sedentary, while the juvenile birds disperse over larger areas.

Habitat: The species prefers arid hilly and montane habitat, including wooded areas and semi-desert, areas above treeline, and agricultural habitats with patches of forest. Birds spend much time soaring overhead in search of food. They perch more often on trees than on cliff faces or on the ground. Although not numerous, in places of abundant food they may congregate in large flocks (Flint 1984). Ecology: The species inhabits forested areas in hills and mountains at 300\u20131,400 m in Spain, but occurs at higher altitudes in Asia, where it also occupies scrub and arid and semi-arid alpine steppe and grasslands up to 4,500 m (Thiollay 1994). It forages over many kinds of open terrain, bare mountains, steppe and open grasslands. Nests are built in trees or on rocks (the latter extremely rarely in Europe but more frequently in parts of Asia), often aggregated in very loose colonies or nuclei. Its diet consists mainly of carrion from medium-sized or large mammal carcasses, although 55 Red List Category: Endangered (LC in 1988, VU in 2000, EN in 2015) Population size: 8,500 individuals Population trend: Decreasing Distribution: Africa, Middle East snakes and insects have been recorded as food items. Live prey is rarely taken. In Mongolia, at least, the species is reliant on livestock numbers for successful nesting (Batbayar et al. 2006). Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits). Birds are killed by feeding on carcasses deliberately laced with pesticides to kill feral dogs or wild carnivores across the species\u2019 range. This seems to be on the increase in areas such as Mongolia (Batbayar 2005). \u2022 Electrocution on or collision with energy infrastructure. Dixon et al. (2013) recorded Cinereous Vultures among the species killed on power lines during a study in Mongolia. Although little substantive data concerning mortalities of this species are known, it is unlikely that such mortalities are under-recorded. \u2022 Decline of food availability (wild and domestic ungulate populations) in Asia and eastern Europe. Numbers of livestock have substantially reduced in areas of the former Soviet Union, due to changed agricultural practices and urbanisation. McGrady et al. (2007) link declines in the species in Georgia and Armenia to the cancellation of subsidies for sheep herding and the resultant reduction in availability of food. Lee et al. (2006) also state that the species is dependent on supplementary feeding in South Korea due to the lack of available food in the environment. Secondary threats: \u2022 Habitat degradation and Human disturbance. \u2022 Direct persecution. Batbayar (2005) report an increase in the deliberate persecution of this species in Mongolia and the trapping or shooting of birds in China for their feathers. \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (NSAIDs). Overwintering birds in northern India could be exposed to veterinary NSAIDs such as diclofenac which could severely impact this increasing population (BirdLife International 2017). \u2022 Climate change Reduced breeding success has been documented as low and fluctuating temperatures have resulted in failure of eggs to hatch (Batbayar 2005); this could possibly be attributed to climate change. \u2022 Intentional poisoning (belief-based use) occurs in South-east Asia in particular.

Compared to many other African vulture species, it has a rather 56 fragmented distribution. There is a small breeding population in the Arabian Peninsula (Oman, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen). It has been extinct in Algeria and Tunisia since the 1930s, and now only small populations remain in southern Egypt and Mauritania (Mundy et al. 1992). It may be extinct in Djibouti (E.

The last records from Morocco concerned two birds in 1972 (Shimelis et al. 2005).

Population size and trend: The African population has been estimated to be at least 8,000 individuals (Mundy 1992), and around 600 pairs in the Arabian Peninsula (Jennings 2010). This gives a total population of at least 9,200 individuals. This may prove to be an overestimate given current trends for this species (80% projected population declines in Africa over three generations: Ogada et al. 2015b), as for other African vultures, as well as apparently severe declines in the Middle East (M. Shobrak pers. comm.). Movements: Lappet-faced Vultures are regarded as a partial migrant that makes significant movements in response to rainfall (Bildstein 2006). Tagged birds had an average home range size of 22,000 km2 and moved between Kenya and Tanzania (Coordinating Unit of the Raptors MOU 2015). Murn and Botha (ibid.) satellite-tagged an individual which moved more than 200 km from the capture site in South Africa and travelled into Mozambique. Two immature individuals satellite tagged in Saudi Arabia (Shobrak 2014) had a mean home range size of 283,380 km2 and moved about 57 400 km before returning in the autumn. Vagrants have been reported in Morocco, southern Libya, Jordan and Spain (Ferguson-Lees and Christie 2001). Habitat: The species inhabits dry savanna, arid plains, deserts and open mountain slopes (Shimelis et al. 2005), up to 3,500 m (BirdLife International 2017). In Ethiopia, it is also found at the edge of forests, having been recorded at Bonga forest and forest in Bale Mountains National Park in 2007, as well as the Afro-alpine habitats of the national park in 2005 (BirdLife International 2017). Ecology: Lappet-faced Vultures range widely when foraging and whilst they take a broad range of carrion, they are also known to hunt, probably taking a variety of small reptiles, fish, birds and mammals (Mundy et al. 1992). Although usually a more solitary species, up to 50 birds may gather with other vultures at larger carcasses. Lappet-faced Vultures usually build solitary nests often in Acacia but also in Balanites, Terminalia and Maerua (Shimelis et al. 2005, Shobrak 2011). They do not usually breed until at least six years of age and fledge on average 0.4 young/pair/year (Mundy et al. 1992). Timing of breeding can vary significantly across the species\u2019 range, for example in Mozambique, egg-laying occurs from late April until mid-August, with a peak in May and June (Parker 2005). A nest found in Oman contained a small chick in early March, and was thought to have fledged in mid-June (Wernery 2009). Major threats: \u2022 Unintentional poisoning (poison baits) at carcasses deliberately laced with pesticides to kill feral dogs or wild carnivores, especially in eastern and southern Africa (Komen 2009, Otieno et al. 2010, Groom et al. 2013, Kendall and Virani 2012). \u2022 Human disturbance. This is particularly significant at nests on the Arabian Peninsula where low tree densities result in people establishing dwellings under or near trees used by this species for breeding, causing them to abandon nesting sites (Shimelis et al. 2005, Shobrak 2011). The same probably applies in areas of sparse tree cover elsewhere within the species\u2019 range. In large protected areas containing elephants, nesting trees have also been pushed over and destroyed by these animals (Murn and Botha 2017). \u2022 Intentional poisoning (belief-based use). During an incident of sentinel poisoning in the Gonarezhou National Park in Zimbabwe, most of the 15 Lappet-faced Vultures killed had the bills removed, presumably for belief-based use (Groom et al. 2013). The species has been recorded in trade in West and Central African markets with 858\u20131,284 reported over six years in West Africa (Buij et al. 2016); see also Rondeau and Thiollay (2004) and McKean et al.

The 15 birds killed in Zimbabwe in an incident of sentinel poisoning (above) were subsequently used in belief-based practices.

Threats In this section, the threats to vultures are described in narrative form, and a summary of their overall impact is presented in Table 4. Not every factor that kills a vulture is a threat to the entire population. However, no threats or causes of mortality are ignored in this Vulture MsAP, but some are considered local or of limited impact, with evidence suggesting that they cause individual mortality rather than population-level declines. Where this is believed to be the case, it is explained, and the focus is maintained on the major, non-natural factors of mortality that limit or cause population declines. The most significant threats per region were identified from feedback provided via the Questionnaires and Regional Workshops (Figure 18). Data are insufficient to identify threats and their severity for every country, but in most cases the severity of a threat is comparable in all countries across a given sub-region. This allows readers to select species which occur in any given country (Section 3; Annex 2), to identify the threats which impact on each species (Table 4; Annex 3), and then to be presented with the most appropriate actions to conserve the species within a country or region (Section 7). Conservation actions generally focus on addressing one or more threats and/or their root causes. In this way, the information in Sections 3 and 4 of the Vulture MsAP links to and determines the Objectives and Results, which, along with the detailed Actions to achieve them, are set out in Section 7. 60 Figure 18. Map indicating priority threats for the Vulture MsAP range. The Russian Federation is a Range State, but vultures are restricted to the North Caucasus and Altai- Sayan regions (the latter being near the borders of Mongolia and Kazakhstan); more northerly parts of the Federation are not shown. 61 4.1 Poisoning Poisoning, in its various forms, is by far the most significant threat that impacts the vulture species that are the focus of this Action Plan. In the context of vultures there are two broad types of poisoning: unintentional (secondary) poisoning, where vultures are not the intended target; and targeted poisoning, where vultures are intentionally killed. The use of poisons to kill wildlife intentionally has a long history worldwide. The main types of poisoning that affect migratory birds, including vultures, are covered in the CMS Guidelines to Prevent the Risk of Poisoning to Migratory Birds (2015). Both natural plant and animal based toxins and synthetic pesticides have been used to kill wildlife, a method that is silent, cheap, easy and relatively effective (Ogada 2014). Many classes of pesticides have been used to poison wildlife, including organochlorines, organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids. Populations of scavengers have been decimated by feeding on poisoned carcasses (Virani et al. 2011, Ogada et al. 2012 and Botha et al. 2012). Vultures, for which the primary food source is meat, soft tissue and organs from naturally occurring carcasses, are obviously at risk. All the vulture species that are covered by this Vulture MsAP are affected to varying degrees by unintentional (secondary) and intentional poisoning. Both South Asia and Africa have seen precipitous declines in vulture populations over the last 30 years due to poisoning. This has directly contributed to eight species currently being listed as Critically Endangered. In South Asia, unintentional poisoning by veterinary NSAIDs has caused catastrophic declines to vultures. The effects of poisoning with NSAIDs, and particularly diclofenac, has been quantified using a variety of approaches and shown to be the main impact on Gyps vulture populations in India, Pakistan and Nepal; it has caused the largest population declines over the shortest timeframe of any known group of birds in history.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a51d630-e27f-49c7-a164-32daedf23cb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a51d630-e27f-49c7-a164-32daedf23cb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c542b88cb46015b416e42ef50cf51e52eaa7f6cd62486ca36429637a46b684ad"}, "2": {"node_id": "bed7d913-2d8f-4537-a24c-c4b246271fd4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "884c366e62f3272417ce3370caaf41cd404469464ad67bb3e787733608587deb"}}, "hash": "33256781152e156456999c8e442cfea2343d4cecc99068666597736516a1b8e4", "text": "Certain NSAIDs that are known to be highly toxic to vultures are becoming available elsewhere and are a significant cause for concern. 4.1.1 Unintentional (secondary) poisoning Unintentional poisoning occurs when vultures consume poisoned baits set out for other species or when they consume carcasses of animals that have died from poisoning.

Human-wildlife conflict Farmers who experience frequent crop-raiding by elephants, buffalo and other herbivores and herders who lose livestock falling prey to predators, will occasionally resort to poisoning those animals in an effort to deal with the problem. Synthetic pesticides are widely used as the poison of choice for killing these \u2018problem\u2019 animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, hyenas and jackal. The use of pesticides in poison baits is illegal in the vast majority of countries but implementation and enforcement of regulations is often weak. Consequently, poisoning has become the most widely used means of killing particular wildlife species. Poisoning using baited carcasses is indiscriminate and can affect a wide range of non-target species. In fact it often does not affect the target individual or species, but instead kills a multitude of unintended species, including vultures. In Europe, poison seems rarely used to kill vultures deliberately; they are normally secondary victims of poison used against wild predators (usually carnivorous mammals: wolves and foxes) impacting on human activities (mainly livestock farming and hunting). This practice is illegal in all European countries, but is still carried out in places by local people who consider it to be a quick way to resolve 62 conflicts with these predators. The main driver for such intensive use of poison is the concern of livestock breeders regarding predators, and the protection by hunters of small game animals. Its widespread use has, as in Africa, been facilitated by poor implementation and poor enforcement of legislation and the ready availability of legal and illegal poisonous substances on the market. Poisoning of wildlife in Europe reached its peak in 1940\u20131950s, when it was legally used by the authorities as a tool to control wild predators. In this period, many vulture populations vanished from their original distribution ranges in Europe. These were dark decades for wildlife and especially for vulture species in the Mediterranean region. In some areas (e.g. Greece) this problem has transformed into human-human conflict, which has even deeper roots (Skartsi et al. 2014). In Spain alone (the country holding about 90% of Europe\u2019s vultures), it is estimated that about 9,000 wildlife incidents involving the use of poison baits are detected annually. In 1992\u20132013, about 185,000 animals were found poisoned, from which 34% were birds of prey. In Spain, most of the cases involving use of poison baits to kill wildlife are related to hunting activities. During 1990\u20132007, a total of 211 poisoning incidents were registered, killing 294 Egyptian Vultures in Spain (Hern\u00e1ndez et al. 2009). Problem animal control Vulture populations that are more associated with human settlements may also be susceptible to unintentional poisoning where toxic substances are used to control problem animals such as feral dogs. Poisons used include strychnine and warfarin and, in Ethiopia at least, have resulted in the deaths of two species of vulture (Abebe 2013). Although data on unintentional poisonings in urban environments are difficult to acquire, it is likely that poisoning of feral dogs and other pest species (e.g. rodents) may have a significant effect in Africa. In Europe and Asia, this threat is potentially most relevant to Egyptian and Cinereous Vultures. Mass poisoning events have recently become a serious concern in Assam, north-east India (S. Ranade pers. comm.). In 2014 alone, 179 vultures were killed in seven separate incidents. Targets have typically been feral dogs which may kill livestock, spread disease including rabies, or have other negative impacts on people. Livestock owners may respond by attempting to kill the dogs with poisoned baits, on which vultures may also feed. Such poisoning events have probably been occurring for a long time (in Assam and elsewhere), but may have increased in frequency as vultures have declined, mammalian scavengers (especially feral dogs) have increased, and expanding human populations have reached wilder areas. In Cambodia, unintentional poisoning is the biggest threat to vultures (Loveridge et al. in review).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6cb8b34a-34c8-422a-a207-3403be9e8fdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "6cb8b34a-34c8-422a-a207-3403be9e8fdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "52335f2ffe1a56071e5aecdc3c0bab6eeaf51fc3f0e884ae3f6eaecf0bf31ba2"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5c9bbc3-c0e3-4708-a94c-8be278ef46b0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e2c6ae5bc5025274f1529c6f65f330ea54a67559c1de7b0edaa299bc683064c"}}, "hash": "bdcc0895befbf3ad65f71b79aa721b435907898bbcfa976b9e9c5da5d6249621", "text": "in review).

The main factor causing the declines has been shown to be the veterinary use of a common NSAID, diclofenac. Diclofenac was used extensively for domestic livestock and any animals that then died within two days of treatment had highly toxic levels in the tissues that could cause kidney failure and death to any vulture feeding on the carcass (Oaks et al. 63 2004, Shultz et al. 2004, Green et al. 2004, 2006, Swan et al. 2006). Many Gyps vulture species worldwide rely on carrion from dead domestic ungulates as their traditional wild ungulate food sources have disappeared (Pain et al. 2003). This was the case over much of South Asia; after ingestion of livestock carcasses treated with diclofenac just prior to death, vultures die as a result of visceral gout that is caused by kidney failure. Typically, a vulture succumbs within two days of exposure to diclofenac. South Asian Governments responded relatively quickly by banning the veterinary formulations and use of diclofenac in 2006 in the cases on India, Nepal and Pakistan, and 2010 in Bangladesh. Iran also took this step in 2015. Diclofenac, however, remains in widespread illegal veterinary use (mainly of human formulations) even after the statutory bans although its concentration and prevalence in dead cattle available to vultures declined markedly (Cuthbert et al. 2011, 2014, 2016). There is evidence that other NSAIDs in legal veterinary use are also toxic to vultures, as well as possibly to other scavenging birds, with just one safe alternative, meloxicam, identified so far (Swarup et al. 2007). The clearest case concerns aceclofenac, which is a pro-drug of diclofenac, most of which is converted to diclofenac in treated cattle soon after it is administered (Galligan et al. 2016). Hence, aceclofenac is expected to be as toxic to Gyps vultures as diclofenac is. Ketoprofen was identified as lethal to Gyps vulture species in 2009 (Naidoo et al. 2010), and residues of this drug are found in ungulate carcasses in India at sufficient concentrations to cause mortality in vultures (Taggart et al. 2007). Neither drug has yet been withdrawn from veterinary use in Asian vulture Range States, though the Government of Bangladesh has recently banned the veterinary use of ketoprofen in Vulture Safe Zones in the country (Bowden et al. 2016). Other NSAIDs thought to be toxic to vultures include nimesulide (Cuthbert et al. 2016), carprofen (Cuthbert et al. 2007), and flunixin (Zorrilla et al. 2014). Wild White-rumped Vultures were recently found dead in India with high levels of nimesulide associated with extensive visceral gout, suggesting that this drug is damaging or destructive to the kidneys in Gyps vultures in a similar way to diclofenac (Cuthbert et al. 2016). Evidence suggests that a wild Griffon Vulture found dead in Spain may have been killed through ingestion of flunixin (Zorrilla et al. 2014), supporting concern raised by Cuthbert et al. (2007) that this drug may be toxic to vultures. The availability of new NSAIDs is increasing (Khan 2013) and most are untested as regards their toxicity to vultures. In surveys of pharmacies in 11 Indian states in 2007\u20132010, NSAIDs containing 12 active compounds were on sale for veterinary use on livestock (Cuthbert et al. 2011). These were aceclofenac, analgin (also known as metamizole), diclofenac, flunixin meglumine, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, mefenamic acid, meloxicam, nimesulide, paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen), phenyl butazone and piroxicam (Bowden et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd68789b-49af-4fcc-8f9b-1446879f4a21": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd68789b-49af-4fcc-8f9b-1446879f4a21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "701819c7cc80248b3e57123ec2f1d292e1bec940c0f2872d3cf16f508f5cd086"}, "2": {"node_id": "80b8517b-a0f3-46d1-8492-98de8b69dced", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "996b1576ed76dbb46f922a7ac595a118d7cc2945f520581c3585a1c592713dde"}}, "hash": "663598a5f3a6ea0687c07f5d8fa4ef37a83b7cfe941c7fda8868e1288013ca5c", "text": "2016). Of these, only diclofenac (toxic), ketoprofen (toxic) and meloxicam (non-toxic) have been subjected to experimental safety testing on captive Gyps vultures. The only reliable NSAID safety testing method available at present is in vivo testing on captive vultures. All four Gyps species treated experimentally with diclofenac so far (White-rumped, Griffon, Cape and White-backed) have been found to die from kidney failure within a few days of administration of a dose of the drug below the Maximum Likely Exposure (MLE) level from carrion derived from domesticated ungulates. The use of any Gyps species in experiments to test NSAID safety to Gyps vultures in general is probably valid. However, diclofenac is of low toxicity to several other bird species tested including Pied Crow (Corvus albus), Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura), domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) and American Kestrel (Falco sparverius) (Hutchinson et al. 2014); therefore, testing NSAIDs on surrogate species that are not Gyps vultures is invalid if the objective is to test for toxicity to Gyps vultures (Cuthbert et al. 2006).

A further problem is that immortal cell cultures are not currently available for vultures. Hence, in vitro safety testing is not practical at present and would take considerable time and resources to develop. Lack of engagement from the pharmaceutical sector and governments has to date been another constraint for NSAID safety testing. Since publication of the discovery of the toxicity of veterinary diclofenac to vultures in 2004, results of safety tests of NSAIDs on Gyps vultures have been published for only two compounds: meloxicam and ketoprofen. Both tests were funded by a conservation charity rather than by pharmaceutical companies or government agencies. CMS Resolution 11.15 calls for safety testing of NSAIDs to determine whether their veterinary use poses a low risk to vultures and for approval of NSAIDs for veterinary use to be conditional on their safety to vultures. No NSAID safety test results have been published since CMS Resolution 11.15, but the Government of India has commissioned safety tests on at least two compounds, which are likely to begin in 2017. In 2007, diclofenac was found to be on sale at a veterinary practice in Tanzania (BirdLife International 2016a), and more recently an increase in its availability has been noted in Ghana (J. Deikumah pers. comm.). It was also reported that in Tanzania, a Brazilian manufacturer has been aggressively marketing the drug for veterinary purposes (BirdLife International 2017) and exporting it to 15 African countries (BirdLife International 2016a). Three of the African endemic vultures are of the Gyps genus and are likely to be susceptible to diclofenac poisoning (and possibly other NSAIDs) \u2013 although further research on all African species is required, also taking into account differences in carcass disposal systems in most African countries (compared to Asia) which may affect the likely exposure of vultures to this threat. Anecdotal information unearthed during the Middle East Regional Workshop revealed that diclofenac is readily available as a veterinary drug in the United Arab Emirates and apparently used to treat camels and some other domestic livestock. Diclofenac has been approved for veterinary use in several European countries. It is manufactured by an Italian company (FATRO), where its use was authorised in 1993. Since 2009, it has been exported and approved in Estonia, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Turkey. Despite the overwhelming evidence of the threat posed by this drug to vultures in Asia and real concerns about the impact that it may have on European vulture populations, the drug was also authorised for veterinary use in Spain in 2013. It is now becoming widely available on the EU market. Government regulatory authorities have concluded that very few ungulate carcasses containing diclofenac will be eaten by vultures, because of existing sanitary regulations. However, simulations using a combined demographic-toxicological model indicate that numbers of ungulate carcasses contaminated with diclofenac assumed by the government authorities could potentially cause significant effects on populations of Griffon Vultures in Spain (Green et al. 2016). The discovery of residues of the NSAID flunixin in the carcass of a wild Griffon Vulture found dead in Spain with visceral gout (Zorrilla et al. 2014) demonstrates that current sanitary regulation of veterinary NSAIDs in Spain is not fully effective. If flunixin can reach a wild vulture, it seems probable that diclofenac will also do so. It is also important to consider the risk of poisoning from other NSAIDs. The recent co-occurrence of extensive visceral gout in dead wild vultures of related species with high levels of the NSAIDs flunixin and nimesulide in the liver and kidneys indicates that these drugs are probably also causing vulture deaths (Zorrilla et al. 2014, Cuthbert et al. 2016). Numerous other NSAIDs of unknown toxicity to vultures are used to treat livestock throughout Asia, Europe and Africa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25ac34aa-ccac-48f2-8664-bf9f2a4f5dc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "25ac34aa-ccac-48f2-8664-bf9f2a4f5dc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c5ff65a949587deb63547fdb8f73a13d2e1db76f09acefae00f20d425caef05f"}, "2": {"node_id": "efe62d3a-d398-4097-a169-620abe02c6bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9db8346acdc034829e28e74858f860b6b60772e0ab71333eb33e00b1c7911e6d"}}, "hash": "d12e0e6380a49b491a615f0d281182710aeab1356d2a1447b7e4bf2229535df9", "text": "Many are detected in livestock carcasses available to vultures in South Asia (Taggart et al. 2009). 65 Lead poisoning The impacts of lead poisoning through the ingestion of spent lead ammunition used by hunters and wildlife managers to kill game is well known for a wide range of bird species (Watson et al. 2009, Delahay and Spray 2015), contributing to population declines as well as creating extensive avoidable deaths and sickness amongst waterbirds and scavengers.

In addition, many free ranging, released California Condors suffer repeatedly from lead poisoning caused by ingestion of fragments of lead bullets from the discarded viscera of hunter- killed deer and survive only because they are recaptured and given remedial treatments. Without this expensive ongoing action, population simulations indicate that the re-introduced wild populations would rapidly decline to extinction (Green et al. 2008). Elevated Blood Lead Levels (BLL) have recently been found in White-backed and Cape Vultures in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana (Kenny et al. 2015, Naidoo et al. 2017). In areas where game-hunting is a significant activity the ingestion of lead fragments by vultures could have both lethal and sub-lethal effects. Naidoo et al. (2017) suggest that elevated BLL could have a detrimental impact on breeding productivity, especially important for slow-reproducing species, and with these effects being compounded in small and rapidly declining populations. In critical cases, lead poisoning in vultures and other scavengers can result in death, but it can often results in sub-lethal level poisoning that can impose a number of secondary effects (such as reduced mobility or increased risk of collision). However, more research is required to assess and determine the impact of these secondary effects, which could be serious. Lead poisoning may be the most significant threat to Bearded Vultures in Europe (Margalida et al. 2008). There is also evidence of negative effects of accidental lead intoxication to Cinereous and Egyptian Vultures in captivity (Pikula et al. 2013), as well as in wild Egyptian Vultures (Bounas et al. 2016). Bioaccumulation Whilst direct mortality from poisoning is highly visible and newsworthy, all species of African- Eurasian vultures are long lived and at a high trophic level (high up the food chain), which increases their vulnerability to bioaccumulation. Whilst most attention has been given to the lethal impacts of toxins on vultures, bioaccumulation may have sub-lethal but significant negative effects on reproductive success, immune response and behaviour. However, there is no robust evidence for such effects at present so more research is needed. 4.1.2 Intentional poisoning targeted at vultures Belief-based use and the bushmeat trade Pesticides are increasingly used to acquire wild animals or their body parts for consumption and commercial trade. Where vultures are concerned, a major driver of this trade is referred to here as belief-based use, in which wildlife parts and derivatives are used in attempts to treat a range of physical and mental diseases, or to bring good fortune. Vultures are sold alongside other species of birds, mammals, reptiles and other taxa at markets specialising in supplying belief-based users. Williams et al (2014) include six vulture species out of a group of 19 conservation priority bird species that were recorded most frequently in markets in 25 African countries surveyed. The term \u2018traditional medicine\u2019 is sometimes used, although no evidence of medicinal benefits is known; other terms (some used in specific sub-regions) include juju, muthi and fetish. The trade associated with belief-based use has existed for many years in some areas (especially parts of West, Central and 66 southern Africa) and is accepted as cultural practice. However, not all of the uses for vultures have such a history: for example, those uses which supposedly increase a user\u2019s chances of winning in recently introduced national lotteries and sport betting practices. With the rapid growth of human populations and more effective bird-harvesting methods (through highly toxic poisons) the negative impact on vulture populations is becoming more apparent.

These practices are not well documented, and may be unusual in East Africa, but poisoning incidents have been recorded from Tanzania, where vulture carcasses without heads have been discovered, following a pattern of mutilation frequently seen for belief-based use. Although belief-based use of vultures is known from Range States outside of Africa, this threat seems to be especially prevalent on this continent having been recorded particularly in West Africa and to a lesser, but still significant extent in southern Africa, and with indications of increasing incidence in East Africa (Figure 19). Across West and Central Africa the Hooded Vulture is one of the most heavily affected species, with an estimated 5,850\u20138,772 individuals traded over a six-year period in West Africa alone (Buij et al. 2016). In Nigeria, a survey of medicinal traders found this to be the most commonly traded species of vulture, accounting for 90% of all vulture parts traded (Saidu and Buij 2013). Hooded Vultures are also killed for belief-based uses in South Africa but not as commonly as other species (McKean et al. 2013), perhaps simply because of the relatively low population in the country compared to other species. White-backed Vultures are regularly traded in West Africa, with an estimated 924\u20131,386 individuals traded over a six-year period, which most likely represents a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij et al. 2016). The decline and possible extirpation of White-backed Vulture in Nigeria has been attributed to the trade in body parts for traditional juju practices (BirdLife International 2017). In South Africa, White-backed Vulture is one of the most prevalent vulture species in trade, according to a survey of traditional healers and traders (McKean et al. 2013). As a result of this and environmental pressures, it is predicted that the population in Zululand (District Municipality of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) could become locally extinct in 26 years (from 2007), unless harvest rates have been underestimated, in which case local extinction could have been be 10\u201311 years away (McKean and Botha 2007). McKean and Botha (2007) also predicted that with current harvesting levels, Cape Vulture populations in the Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Lesotho could become locally extinct within 44 to 53 years. However, should the numbers of White-backed Vultures continue to decline, a larger proportion of the current harvesting pressure is likely to fall on the Cape Vulture. In this instance, the Cape Vulture populations in Lesotho, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape could be exhausted within 12 years. The less numerous R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vulture has been heavily exploited for trade in West Africa (Nikolaus 2006) and the estimated numbers traded of 1,128\u20131,692 individuals over a six-year period represents a significant proportion of the regional population (Buij et al. 2016). Lappet-faced Vultures have also been traded in substantial numbers in West and Central African markets, with a known offtake per year of 143\u2013214 individuals (Buij et al. 2016); considering the relatively small population size and fragmented distribution this must be exerting serious pressures on regional populations. The species has also been recorded being used for belief-based use in small numbers in South Africa (McKean et al. 2013). White-headed Vultures have also been recorded being traded in small numbers in West and Central Africa (Buij et al. 2016), which, given the small population size, is likely to be significant. In South Africa, this species is killed for belief-based use (BirdLife International 2017). In Zambia, White-headed Vultures are known to be poisoned for use in witchcraft (Roxburgh and McDougall 2012). 68 In Mongolia, there is a recent growing demand for Cinereous Vulture feathers associated with contemporary religious practices (Batbayar 2005). Belief-based persecution of Bearded Vultures has been recorded in Nepal, where the birds are believed to have medicinal value and are associated with prosperity (Acharya et al. 2010).

Sentinel poisoning The recent increase in poaching of elephants has resulted in an increase in mass poisoning of vultures.

Between 2012 and 2014, Ogada et al. (2016) recorded 11 poaching-related incidents in seven (largely southern) African countries, in which 155 elephants and 2,044 vultures were killed. In at least two incidents, the harvesting of vulture body parts (seemingly for belief-based use) may have provided an additional motive. Vulture mortality associated with ivory poaching has increased more rapidly than that associated with other types of poisoning, accounting for one third of all vulture poisonings recorded in Africa since 1970. To date, all of the known cases of sentinel poisoning that have caused vulture mortalities have occurred predominantly in southern Africa, but the potential for this practice to occur widely in East Africa and parts of West Africa where elephant poaching is prevalent should not be underestimated (Figure 20.). 69 Figure 20. Map of Africa showing potential severity of the threat of sentinel poisoning, based on known incidents, areas subject to poaching pressure on large mammals such as elephants, and vulture distribution in Africa (unpublished map courtesy of HabitatInfo/African Raptor Databank; for methods and additional information see http://www.habitatinfo.com/african_vulture_maps/). The scale of deaths at a single carcass can be significant, regularly exceeding 100 individuals. For example, at least 144 White-backed Vultures were killed after feeding on an elephant carcass in Gonarezhou National Park, Zimbabwe, in 2012 (Groom et al. 2013); over 500 vultures were found dead in Bwabwata National Park, Namibia, in 2013 after feeding on a single poisoned elephant carcass (Ogada et al. 2016). This phenomenon has also recently been recorded in South Africa, where two incidents resulted in deaths totalling 154 White-backed Vultures after feeding from poisoned elephant carcasses in the Kruger National Park (Murn and Botha 2017). 4.2 Mortality caused by power grid infrastructure 4.2.1 Electrocution Bird mortality by electrocution on power poles is a global problem that has become more prevalent in recent years as energy demand increases, resulting in infrastructure growth often in previously undeveloped areas. Electrocution associated with powerlines occurs when a bird comes into contact with two wires, one of which is live, or when it perches on a conductive pylon (for example, a metal 70 structure) and comes into simultaneous contact with a live wire. Large species such as vultures, eagles and storks are particularly vulnerable. Electrocution risk can be very significant at old, badly designed and insulated poles and poorly sited power lines. Effective planning, design and mitigating measures can dramatically reduce the impact of energy infrastructure on avian populations (BirdLife International 2017). Electrocution from powerlines is one of the key threats to Cape Vultures in South Africa (van Rooyen 2000, Boshoff and Anderson 2006) with data suggesting that this cause of mortality makes a significant contribution to low juvenile and immature survival rates. Despite this, in certain situations vultures might derive some benefit from the presence of power lines in relation to increased nesting, roosting sites and nursery areas (Phipps et al. 2013a), which may allow them to expand their range, especially if suitable mitigation measures can be taken to lessen the risk of electrocution. Shimelis (2005) highlights the threat of electrocution and collisions from powerlines for the Lappet- faced Vulture with 49 individuals killed in South Africa between 1996 and 2003. Certain power lines can have disproportionate impacts. Since construction in the 1950s, one approximately 30 km line from Port Sudan to the Red Sea coast was estimated to have electrocuted many hundreds and perhaps thousands of Egyptian Vultures; it was replaced in 2014 with a fully insulated bird-safe distribution line running parallel to the previous one. In Morocco, a 24 km powerline in the south-west is reported to have killed a significant number of raptors including threatened species, but no vultures to date (Godino et al. 2016). The impact of electrocution on vultures in the rest of Africa is poorly known, but there are many areas where this threat could have a substantial impacts (Figure 21).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec1ed00e-dfc8-4434-848b-66e0dd3e30a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec1ed00e-dfc8-4434-848b-66e0dd3e30a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "515ba6fb30e9e46ac98b5cfff728a121472bec6d29c231f1628917b6d7ad6764"}, "2": {"node_id": "b6e48a66-2d8d-4e2c-ae23-e7a73ec2e1c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84a0047097e8deec9fbb7af4e6858c86519fe08fbced3574f45a29b1dd060f5d"}}, "hash": "94b1fb1605295358b96c567bfe1023eff6b1568eb440b6c80eced7baa3d044c1", "text": "Electrocution along power lines is among the main causes of vulture decline in Europe, significantly affecting the Egyptian Vulture population in the Canary Islands (Donaz\u00e1r et al. 2002) and the Griffon Vulture population in Israel (Leshem et al. 1985).

Feedback and discussions during the Asian and Middle East Regional Workshops indicate that the threat posed by electrocution on power grids to vultures and other soaring birds is not extensively monitored within these regions and the impacts could therefore be underestimated. Harness et al. (2013) confirmed that power lines in Rajasthan, India, were responsible for bird electrocutions, but found no vultures among those species killed. Existing studies are, however, extremely limited, but the threats from similar infrastructure elsewhere well enough known, that this risk must be taken seriously in view of the increasing density of power grids. 4.2.2 Collisions Each year millions of birds die worldwide as a result of collisions with above ground power lines. The impact on populations is likely to increase as energy infrastructure continues to grow, especially in developing countries. As for electrocution, the risks can be significant in old, poorly sited power 72 lines. Under the current commitments to reduce carbon emissions, Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are increasing their investments in renewable energy, particularly large wind farms. However, any renewable energy installations (e.g. solar and geothermal generation facilities) will inevitably lead to an expansion of the powerline distribution network which will likely increase the risk of collisions for vultures in certain areas. Despite their acute vision, vultures\u2019 field of view and normal head position when foraging can make them unaware of obstructions in their direction of travel, and they may be particularly vulnerable to collisions with infrastructure such as wind turbines and powerlines (Martin et al. 2012). The proliferation of renewable energy initiatives can therefore be detrimental to vultures if the location of turbines and associated infrastructure are in areas favoured by these birds (Jenkins et al. 2010). Whilst energy infrastructure will affect vultures across the Vulture MsAP range, much of what we know about these impacts comes from southern Africa. For Cape Vultures in the Magaliesberg, a large number of fatalities are associated with powerline collisions, and this is probably one of the main factors that have caused declines of the species in South Africa (BirdLife International 2017). An estimated minimum number of 80 vultures (Cape and White-backed Vultures) are killed annually by collision with powerlines in Eastern Cape Province (Boshoff et al. 2011). Shimelis (2005) highlights the threat of collisions with and electrocution by powerlines for the Lappet-faced Vulture with 49 individuals killed in South Africa between 1996 and 2003. A controversial wind farm development in Maluti-Drakensberg, Lesotho, an important site for Cape Vultures, was given approval in 2014 (Anonymous 2014), and is likely to result in significant vulture mortality if substantial mitigation measures are not implemented. Even relatively small scale wind energy developments in the Lesotho Highlands pose a threat to local vulture populations (Rushworth and Kr\u00fcger 2014), and could lead to local extinctions. There are currently extensive plans for the increase of generation capacity, including wind turbines, and the expansion of the existing powerline network in East, Central and West Africa (https://www.usaid.gov/powerafrica) to respond to increasing demand for electricity in these areas. The map (Figure 22) indicates areas in Africa suitable for the development of windfarms and its associated energy infrastructure, and reflects the enormous potential scope of the threat of collision across the continent. 73 Figure 22. Map of Africa showing areas apparently suitable for the development of wind energy installations, taking into account wind speeds and distance from existing electricity grids and cities, that could potentially pose a threat of collision for vultures and other soaring birds (unpublished map courtesy of HabitatInfo/African Raptor Databank; for methods and additional information see http://www.habitatinfo.com/african_vulture_maps/).

Very little scientific information is available about this threat in Asia and the Middle East. Kumar et al.

Four main factors could reduce food (carcass) availability for vultures. First, a reduction in the numbers of dead livestock could result from carcasses being buried or burned, or dumping sites for carcasses being closed entirely. These measures could be prompted by concerns over smell or risks to public health to reduce the number of rotting carcasses. Second, competition for food with feral dogs and other scavengers: an example of this is the increase in feral dog populations in India (Cunningham et al. 2001, Markandya et al. 2008) followingthe decline in vultures due to poisoning by NSAIDs. Third, reduced wild ungulate populations diminish food availability for vultures where these are more important than livestock. And, fourth is the impact of improved animal husbandry which results in fewer carcasses being available for vultures to feed on (Mundy et al. 1992). The extent and impact of this threat varies considerably within the Vulture MsAP range. It is considered significant in Africa and South-east Asia and relevant in Europe, but not a significant threat in South Asia. Declines in large mammal populations have been recorded across Africa since the 1970s (59%) with the largest declines in West Africa (85% decline in protected areas: Craigie et al. 2010). In East Africa, Western et al. (2009) show that wildlife populations in National Parks and other protected areas have declined at similar rates to the wider countryside. BirdLife International (2017) cites declining ungulate populations as a threat for five of the African endemic vultures. In contrast, livestock populations in Africa have more than doubled since the 1960s, and vultures will feed on livestock carcasses if local practices allow them to be available to scavengers. However, use of domestic ungulate carcasses for food by humans, changes in animal butchering practices, improvements in livestock management and sanitation at slaughterhouses may offset the increased numbers of livestock as a potential food source for vultures, either partly or completely. Hence, although not fully established, declines in abundance of wild ungulates are likely to have impacted vulture populations, especially where the ungulate declines have been most severe, such as in West Africa. Improved sanitation is likely to have impacted Hooded Vultures more than other African species due their strong association with human settlements in at least part of their range (Thiollay 2006, Ogada and Buij 2011). Hooded Vultures at five slaughterhouses visited in northern Cameroon were competing for scraps with domestic dogs. Based on expert opinion, Boshoff and Anderson (2006) ranked a lack of carrion as a significant threat to the Cape Vulture, although they acknowledged that there was no substantial research to back up this hypothesis. The increasing use of supplementary feeding sites (vulture restaurants) by a population of Cape Vultures in the Magaliesberg Mountains may suggest a level of reliance on such artificial food sources due to declining natural food (Wolter et al. 2007). Provision of food at vulture restaurants also has the potential to guarantee poison-free food and to modify the birds\u2019 behaviour, encouraging them to forage only in safe areas and thereby minimising their movements in areas where poisoned baits may be used. One of the main reasons for the decrease, including in certain cases to extinction, of several vulture species in Europe has been a significant reduction in food resources (Don\u00e1zar et al. 2009, Ogada et al. 2012). A lack of \u2018natural\u2019 food resulted from the introduction of restrictive veterinary sanitary regulations (due to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, Regulation CE 1774\u20442002) in most European countries, leading to a decline in the extensive keeping of domestic animals, and sometimes a reduction or even extinction of wild mammals (ungulates and lagomorphs). The application of this 75 sanitary legislation, by greatly restricting the use of animal by-products not intended for human consumption, deprived bird populations of the resources they depended on to survive.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a6b25e0-10ed-4a6f-95e8-78df7ed74630": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a6b25e0-10ed-4a6f-95e8-78df7ed74630", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4104bd581069963ceac3256ee4357a7d0460e90f945c4c9f673227058457f732"}, "2": {"node_id": "a1b21467-32bc-4718-8d72-15f261696a7e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ce03fd3da32e47cbbe3fc33731d39b853c4b1153186ab757e3ddab97e6c1b49"}}, "hash": "46788b1990191d76df0f716a1f2fa5589bc50a47a36b971fe14b3727d8bc8220", "text": "It has been estimated that in some parts of Spain, 80% of animal carcasses originating from farms are being removed for industrial disposal; in the case of cows this figure reaches 100% (Don\u00e1zar 2009, Margalida 2010).

In eastern Europe, the Egyptian Vulture seems dependent upon small scale farming practices, in contrast with the land management intensification under the EU Common Agricultural Policy (Oppel et al. 2017) elsewhere in the region. The loss of traditional mobile livestock management practices (pastoral nomadism) is among the variety of anthropogenic factors that threatens vulture populations (Marinkovi\u0107 and Karadzi\u0107 1999, Mateo-Tom\u00e1s 2013). Traditional mobile pastoral practices can and do provide safe food for vultures. Different methods of supplementary feeding for vultures have been developed, aiming to rescue and restore endangered populations suffering food shortages or to manage their populations (Ewen et al. 2015, Fielding et al. 2014). Ewen et al. (2015) emphasise the need for a better evaluation of positive and negative effects before implementing supplementary feeding and for a method to determine whether this type of artificial feeding is necessary among other alternative actions for conservation. It was evidenced that food shortage threatening Egyptian Vultures in the Balkans was not related to the negative trend of the population (Dobrev et al. 2015), and that supplementary feeding did not increase productivity or survival (Oppel et al. 2016). In southern Africa, where supplementary feeding sites have been used since the 1970s, tracking studies have illustrated that these sites do not significantly influence the foraging movements of Cape Vultures (Kane et al. 2016), while supplementary feeding in the vicinity of Cape Vulture breeding colonies during the nest-building stage can increase the number of breeding pairs and ultimately the number of offspring (Schabo et al. 2016). Evidence does not suggest that food shortage accounts for the vulture population crash across the Indian sub-continent. However, this does appear to be a threat in other parts of Asia, most notably South-east Asia. Across the Indian sub-continent, there is evidence that food availability for vultures has remained high. A study in India (V. Prakash pers. comm.) combining vulture survey data with information from bone and hide collectors about carcass dumps and cattle mortality suggested that enough meat was available to sustain a vulture population far in excess (around 20 times) of the actual number present. Other factors appeared to be the cause of the low population. In South-east Asia, where large areas of suitable habitat for vultures still remain, food shortage in the latter part of the 20th century has almost certainly played a major part in vulture declines (Pain et al. 2003): wild ungulate populations crashed in the region due primarily to uncontrolled hunting and habitat loss (Srikosamatara and Suteethorn 1995, Duckworth et al. 1999, IUCN 2000) and this has been accompanied by a reduction in the number of free-ranging livestock and improvements in animal husbandry. 4.4 Habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation The impact of habitat change on vulture populations is complex although it is often cited as a contributing factor to vulture declines. This may concern large scale modification affecting food supply (considered above) or other ecological factors. Both cliff and tree-nesting vultures have 76 specific breeding site requirements, which are easily affected by human activities such as: quarrying; construction of tourist or leisure facilities near breeding cliffs; widening of roads and highways; logging, other forms of deforestation and clearance of large trees in agricultural areas. Habitat loss and degradation are suspected to have contributed to the dramatic declines of vultures (Hooded, R\u00fcppell\u2019s, White-backed, White-headed and Lappet-faced) outside protected areas in West Africa (Thiollay 2006, Ogada and Buij 2011), with the root cause being the rapid increase in the human population and loss of suitable habitat as a result of settlement expansion. Thiollay (2006) highlights the complexity of habitat degradation with dramatic changes in natural resource management changing large tracts of woodland to shrub land, increased desertification and the decline in large game outside of protected areas.

This coincided with a long-term decline in the Cape Vulture population in that country. Land use changes in southern Africa are varied and include degradation by intensive agriculture, cultivation, urbanisation, roads, dams, mines, desertification, afforestation and expansion of alien vegetation. Further quantitative research is needed to determine which of these factors are most important for the Cape Vulture, or indeed any of the African vulture species. In South-east Asia, there is too little information about nesting sites for vultures to infer that they are under threat. There should be no shortage of nesting sites in intact habitat (T. Clements pers. comm.), but known nesting trees of vultures have been cut along the Sesan River, Cambodia, after which new nests were not observed; this suggests that selective logging may force vultures to relocate and impact vulture nesting success (Sum and Loveridge 2016). 4.5 Disturbance from human activities A wide range of human activities can cause disturbance, such as construction of infrastructure, agriculture, aviation, mining, blasting and quarrying; some examples documented in the literature are presented below. Generally, White-backed Vultures are vulnerable to nest harvesting or disturbance by humans, especially outside protected areas (Bamford et al. 2009) perhaps more so than other species because of their preference for nesting in trees. Komen (1985) considers human disturbance at breeding colonies of Cape Vulture a significant problem. It has been documented that R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vulture suffer from disturbance, especially from climbers. For example in Mali, the Hombori and Dyounde massifs are dotted with at least 47 climbing routes, on which expeditions take place every year, mainly during the species' breeding season. However, the precise impact of these activities is not known (Rondeau and Thiollay 2004). Benson (1985), indicates that climbing also impacts nesting Cape Vultures in South Africa. Lappet-faced Vultures are especially sensitive to nest disturbance (Steyn 1982). The impact may be growing with expansion of human settlements (for example in Ethiopia: BirdLife International 2016a) and the increasing recreational use of off-road vehicles which is reported in Africa (Mundy et al. 1992) and Saudi Arabia (Shimelis et al. 2005). Also in Saudi Arabia, suitable large nesting trees may be subject to the most intense human disturbance as shepherds also use the same large trees for shelter for themselves and their livestock (Shobrak 2011). 77 Aviation may cause disturbance, which may be a significant problem for already rare species. The South African Air Force maintains a policy of keeping a flight-restricted 2 km buffer from Cape Vulture colonies to avoid disturbance, but as far as is known such measures are not widespread elsewhere. Recreational aviation has also been recorded causing disturbance to vultures. In South Asia, there is anecdotal evidence of disturbance at cliff nesting sites of vultures caused by quarrying activities. Nesting sites of White-rumped Vultures are threatened by logging at some sites in Nepal (H. Baral pers. comm.). However, in India, most of the nesting habitat, both within and outside protected areas is not currently threatened or affected by disturbance. There have been reports of birds being chased away from or prevented from nesting on buildings or monuments of historical significance in parts of South Asia, but no further details are known. In Spain, cork harvesting it is considered to be one of the main causes of disturbance to the Cinereous Vulture during the breeding season, because this activity is carried out in June and July when chicks are being reared (Margalida et al. 2010). Pairs in an area of a colony exposed to intrusive anthropogenic activity had 20% lower breeding success than those in the same colony that were not exposed to these disturbances (Margalida et al. 2010). 4.6 Disease Infectious diseases were considered as a possible explanation for the South Asian vulture declines, before diclofenac was found to be the cause. Analyses revealed no evidence of avian influenza or West Nile virus in White-rumped Vultures found dead in Pakistan, nor were viruses isolated from the kidney, spleen, lung and intestine of these birds (Oaks et al. 2004). Assessments of herpes and other viruses have produced no indication that any are associated with serious pathology (L.

In Europe, a threat assessment for Egyptian Vultures in the Balkans produced 182 samples from 49 individuals from Bulgaria and Greece. A wide range of microorganisms was tested for, all known as potential pathogens for vultures, but none of the sampled individuals were found to be infected; only very low concentrations of Newcastle Disease were detected in most samples and, in some, low concentrations of Avian adenovirus and Avian circovirus were detected. This indicates contact with these viruses (which are probably very common), but without symptoms (Andevski and Zorrilla Delgado 2015). 4.7 Climate change Climate change affects birds in different ways, altering distribution, abundance, behaviour, genetic composition, and timing of events like migration or breeding. Direct effects of climate change such as changes in temperature and rainfall patterns can also impact birds due to increased pressure from competitors, predators, parasites, diseases and disturbances (e.g. fires or storms). 78 Very little research has been published to illustrate the impact of climate change on vultures. It is, however, speculated that the species breeding at higher altitudes (Bearded and Cape Vulture) in southern Africa may experience range contractions due to increased temperatures (Simmons and Jenkins 2007). There are concerns that Cape Vulture breeding colonies in the north of the species\u2019 range are at greater risk from the effects of climate change than those in the south and that areas currently containing the bulk of the breeding population may become unsuitable for breeding (Phipps et al. 2017). The overall impact of climate change can be more severe when it occurs with other major threats such as habitat loss and reduction in available food sources. Additional research on the impact of climate change on vultures throughout the Vulture MsAP range is necessary. 4.8 Other threats A range of additional threats affect vulture populations throughout Africa and Eurasia, but these are often species-specific, with more localised effects than those discussed above. However, particularly at breeding sites, these can have locally significant impacts on productivity, the importance of which is likely to increase if vultures continue to decline and populations become more fragmented. \u2022 Drowning. Historically Cape Vultures were susceptible to drowning with records of at least 120 individuals (21 incidents) being killed in small farm reservoirs in southern Africa between the early 1970s and late 1990s (Anderson et al. 1999). Modifications to many reservoirs have now been made (Boshoff et al. 2009) and it is not clear if this remains a significant threat. A significant number of satellite-tagged juvenile Egyptian Vultures from eastern Europe have been lost in the Mediterranean Sea, presumed drowned, during their first migration (Oppel et al. 2015). \u2022 Illegal killing, taking and trade in various forms not covered above can be directly targeted at vultures. In some cases, this can be purely because of a dislike of or superstition against vultures and may involve poison, shooting or capture. In South-east Asia, vultures are sometimes caught and held as pets or display animals. This is certainly known in Cambodia, but appears to be exceptional and this threat was treated as \u2018low priority\u2019 in the national vulture action plan (Sum and Loveridge 2016). There are also cases of nest robberies (Griffon and Egyptian Vultures) in eastern Europe by egg collectors (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds 2014). \u2022 Sport hunters may occasionally shoot at vultures as novel targets. In parts of central Asia vultures are known to be hunted for trophies and taxidermy. \u2022 Other collisions (in addition to those with energy infrastructure) o Before vulture numbers were significantly reduced in South Asia, collisions with aircraft were considered a serious concern. The number of fatalities caused directly by these crashes may not have affected population levels, but shooting and poisoning to reduce vulture numbers near airfields, although unquantified, could have had a negative impact in the 1970s and 1980s. o Trains (northern India) kill numbers of vultures and are a cause of mortality at least on a local scale. o Kite strings (north-west India) also kill and injure locally significant numbers of vultures annually during kite festivals.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29a00482-641d-4e4a-9008-6b8f4e333bf8": {"__data__": {"id_": "29a00482-641d-4e4a-9008-6b8f4e333bf8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdf72679b804119eb2105da31e64e4bc6e1e0fbd1e3b034acaf886137c091ef6"}, "2": {"node_id": "321e92e8-bbe0-42bd-ae2d-965fe77dc094", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "73bdb27c0d6ebbe6e26226c79af01e984d6d3bdeb120942b0e433bd68837b078"}}, "hash": "d049535e922684aef396f42d6a27a60c3f58699c1a8d18bf7eafa2c7da668f01", "text": "o Motor vehicles can kill vultures in areas where individuals feed on dead animals along the roads (e.g. Egyptian Vultures in Sudan: Birdlife International 2017). 79 Table 4.

Stakeholders and potential collaborators A very wide range of stakeholders are involved with or can potentially influence vulture conservation actions (Table 5), mainly as a result of the birds\u2019 extensive distribution across Africa and Eurasia, their high ecological significance making them relevant across many sectors, and the range of threats that they face. With so many Range States, space does not permit a catalogue of stakeholders for each country. However, the main categories of stakeholders have been identified. Based on generic descriptions of these and commonalities between countries, it should be possible to identify most if not all relevant stakeholders in any given Range State. In particular, many conservation and non-conservation stakeholders, that may be directly concerned with vultures, nevertheless have priorities that are affected by the same threats as those suffered by vultures. An example is health authorities dealing with belief-based use of vultures by people for various reasons which is at best medically ineffective and at worst potentially lethal if the body parts used were obtained from poisoned birds. Another is big cat or elephant conservationists dealing with poisoning and/or poaching which also kills many vultures. Vulture conservationists cannot solve many of the threats on their own, so it is vital that they engage with the many other stakeholders identified here with the aim of developing strategic alliances to achieve shared goals.

Policies, legislation and action plans relevant for management A number of international conventions and other intergovernmental policy frameworks exist that provide a platform for tackling the main threats to vulture populations as set out in Section 4: For example, poisoning, mortality caused by power grid infrastructure, decline of food availability, habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation and human disturbance. Yet these conventions, with the exception of work through the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) and its associated agreements and task forces on poisoning, energy and the illegal killing, taking and trade in migratory birds, provide little or no reference to vultures, including in the national plans of Parties (e.g. the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature). This section briefly outlines the responsibilities that selected international processes and relevant conventions place on countries, before looking in more detail at the frameworks (and often substantial gaps) that exist in international policies to deal with two of the greatest threats to vultures, i.e. poisoning (through its different pathways) and impacts from power grid infrastructure (with specific reference to wind energy infrastructure collision risk, transmission line electrocution and collision risk, both from existing and planned developments).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2dd135a-af12-4a03-a486-3bbe4f456760": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2dd135a-af12-4a03-a486-3bbe4f456760", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f4a0790574970b297a6a8ea04af7e4fc2fcc910ad13e3beb2841b1a63c6f4b90"}, "2": {"node_id": "855faf8b-2a5d-4040-afc3-5b5309d45f23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8f411f177ad563bd6778f1aed7061822a3a39b5af86486154a3737f866c102b7"}}, "hash": "e61d12d4d27705f880b6b58ed5aab9624757cd89b7cae6f75772a47a4e3c26fe", "text": "A country-by-country or region-by-region analysis of policy and legislation is beyond the scope of this Vulture MsAP, although Range States are encouraged to undertake such reviews.

The 2030 Agenda adopts sustainable development as the organising principle for global cooperation through the 17 Goals. These Goals reflect the Agenda\u2019s five key themes of: people, planet, prosperity, peace, and partnerships. The 17 goals are further refined into 169 targets. SDG 14 and SDG 15 are derived directly from the Aichi Targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity (see section 6.1.3 below), but it is the cross cutting nature of the SDGs that provides the opportunity to engage across sectors and to highlight the role that vultures play in the broader environment and how their conservation can contribute to the achievement of wider aims such as improvements in human health and development. The SDGs are, however, not legal rules. There is an emphasis on \u2019national ownership\u2019 of the goals: to be as effective as possible, they need to be translated into nationally owned sustainable development strategies and integrated national financing frameworks. This process is only just underway in many countries, if at all. 6.1.2 United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) The United Nations Environment Assembly is regarded globally as the highest-level decision-making body on the environment. All 193 United Nations Member States are members of UNEA, which develops resolutions and makes global calls for action to address critical environmental challenges. UNEA has already begun to recognise and highlight a number of the poisoning issues surrounding wildlife. With the continued decline in species due to poisoning, there is a great urgency to add 86 political momentum to this issue, if the critical problems of poison baits, toxic NSAIDs and the continued use of lead ammunition (despite almost all other industrial and consumer products being now mandated as lead-free) are to be tackled. UNEA has already adopted resolutions that have relevance to these issues (see below), but a resolution that addresses poisoning more explicitly may be important in accelerating political action: \u2022 UNEA Resolution 2/7 Sound management of chemicals and waste, which recognises \u201cthe significant risks to human health and the environment arising from releases of lead and cadmium into the environment\u201d. \u2022 UNEA Resolution 2/14 Illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products, which is of direct relevance to the issue of poisoning, as poisoning is often used in poaching. The Resolution \u2018Further requests the Executive Director, within the mandate of the United Nations Environment Programme, to work with other relevant intergovernmental and non- governmental international organizations to identify and compile the current status of knowledge on crimes that have serious impacts on environment including illegal trade and trafficking in wildlife and its products, in particular, in terms of their environmental impacts, and to identify inter-linkages between these crimes and to report thereon to the United Nations Environment Assembly at its next session;\u201d \u2022 The vulture crisis was highlighted at UNEA\u2019s second session (UNEA2) in May 2016 by a side- event Healthy Vultures, Healthy People. A UNEA Resolution directly addressing the issue of wildlife poisoning would help to build on the important work of CMS and create greater political awareness of this issue, both as it affects vulture populations specifically and other species more broadly. Such an approach would enable better integration of relevant environmental and human health dimensions and highlight how Member States and UN agencies can work towards eliminating the poisoning of wildlife. 6.1.3 Convention on Biological Diversity and the Aichi Targets In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) adopted the 20 Aichi Biodiversity Targets as part of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020, where they are framed under five strategic goals to be translated into action through National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs), with the objective of halting biodiversity loss and enhancing the benefits it provides to people. While necessarily broad, these targets cover areas of specific relevance to the existence and conservation of vultures, notably Targets 8 and 12 (CBD Secretariat, undated), which adopt International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifications as their metric. Indeed Target 12 explicitly states: \u201cThough some extinctions are the result of natural processes, human actions have greatly increased current extinction rates.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adce5bf1-ec20-4e4c-a502-e16543b6fc53": {"__data__": {"id_": "adce5bf1-ec20-4e4c-a502-e16543b6fc53", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c92a11afa0b56aacb9f09d4bedd47018fc81f4fc208103bc3cd911a23d2c7d70"}, "2": {"node_id": "46684df5-66d0-49cf-ab80-6697ac87256c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64a0882f4aa7504450095e3332ad8d31c338c62138d875d8b00ec71c45faa81e"}}, "hash": "243ec948c5ac00a8fa03db0ecac45905d993ccb9089dc3012b93f4f264880574", "text": "Reducing the threat of human-induced extinction requires action to address the direct and indirect drivers of change [...].

The Cancun Declaration (Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity 2016) from CBD COP13 in December 2016 specifically calls for: 87 \u2022 Prevention of agricultural pollution, and the efficient, safe and sustainable use of agrochemicals, fertilizers and other agricultural inputs. \u2022 Promotion of the use of biodiversity in agricultural systems to control or reduce pests and diseases. CBD also requires that Parties apply thorough assessment procedures, Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) and Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) when it comes to the planning of activities with an impact on biodiversity (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Netherlands Commission for Environmental Assessment 2006). This is crucial in respect of the planning of energy installations and specifically renewable energy and associated transmission grids, and is discussed in Section 3. 6.1.4 Convention on Migratory Species The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) provides a number of mechanisms, for example, Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), Resolutions, Task Forces and Guidelines that have the most direct relevance to vulture conservation. These can be summarised as follows: The MOU on the Conservation of Migratory Birds of Prey in Africa and Eurasia (Raptors MOU), concluded in October 2008, has an Action Plan which contains activities with specific references to poisoning and power lines and their impact on birds of prey. The Action Plan mentions the following activities that are of relevance in relation to power lines and are quoted below in full: \u2022 1.4 Review relevant legislation and take steps where possible to make sure that it requires all new power lines to be designed to avoid bird of prey electrocution. \u2022 2.3 Conduct risk analysis at important sites (including those listed in Table 3 ) [of Annex 3 of the Raptors MOU] to identify and address actual or potential causes of significant incidental mortality from human causes (including fire, laying poisons, pesticide use, power lines, wind turbines). \u2022 2.4 Conduct Strategic Environmental Assessments of planned significant infrastructure developments within major flyways to identify key risk areas. \u2022 3.2 Where feasible, take necessary actions to ensure that existing power lines that pose the greatest risk to birds of prey are modified to avoid bird of prey electrocution. A range of other CMS Resolutions and Guidelines are highly relevant to vulture conservation, in particular: \u2022 Resolution 11.14 on the Programme of Work for Migratory Birds and Flyways, which provided the mandate to develop the Vulture MsAP. \u2022 Resolution 11.15 on Preventing Poisoning of Migratory Birds (Convention on Migratory Species 2014a): see Section 2. \u2022 Resolution 11.16 on The Prevention of Illegal Killing, Taking and Trade of Migratory Species (Convention on Migratory Species 2014b): see Section 2.1. \u2022 AEWA Conservation Guidelines No. 14 (2014): Guidelines on How to Avoid or Mitigate Impact of Electricity Power Grids on Migratory Birds in the African-Eurasian Region; see Section 3.3 (Prinsen et al. 2012). \u2022 CMS, AEWA, International Renewable Energy Agency and Birdlife International (2014): Renewable Energy Technologies and Migratory Species: Guidelines for sustainable deployment.

It is suggested that this process takes into account the needs of vultures as well as landbirds. 6.1.6 Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora The Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) regulates the international trade in wild animals and plants, alive or dead and including body parts, to ensure that this practice does not threaten their survival. This legally-binding agreement provides a framework under which its Parties adopt their own implementation legislation at national level. The species covered by CITES are listed in Appendices, according to the degree of protection they need. Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction; trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances. Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival. African-Eurasian vultures are covered by Appendix II, under a \u2018catch-all\u2019 heading that includes nearly all raptors (a few species, but no African-Eurasian vultures, are listed on Appendix I). Trade, particularly in body parts for belief-based use, is a critical threat to vultures in parts of their African range, and so an assessment is underway to inform a potential future proposal to transfer (at least) African vulture species from CITES Appendix II to Appendix I. 89 6.2 Poisoning and chemical use 6.2.1 Overarching agreements Two international conventions exist that have relevance to the problems of vulture poisoning from chemical use. However, there is no systematic requirement for chemical or pharmaceutical companies to conduct pre-authorisation research and testing of products to assure that they do not have unintended consequences for non-target pest control, or cause wider damage to the environment. The Rotterdam Convention entered into force in 2004 and in January 2017 it had 156 Parties. The objectives of the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure for Certain Hazardous Chemicals and Pesticides in International Trade are: \u2022 To promote shared responsibility and cooperative efforts among Parties in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals in order to protect human health and the environment from potential harm; and, \u2022 To contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The Convention regulates the international trade of certain chemicals and currently regulates 43 products, including 32 pesticides. It applies to banned or severely restricted chemicals, and to severely hazardous pesticide formulations. Annex II of the CMS Resolution 11.15 on Preventing Poisoning of Migratory Birds outlines key legislative recommendations developed by the CMS Preventing Poisoning Working Group (2013) in Tunis, Tunisia, for the Rotterdam Convention as follows: i. Substitute (remove and replace) insecticides with a high risk to birds with safe alternatives, and inclusion of criteria in the Rotterdam Convention to reduce risks of imports toxic to birds, promotion of Integrated Pest Management, and identification of areas of significant risk of poisoning of migratory birds and mitigation of impacts through working with stakeholders. However, the Rotterdam Convention does not apply inter alia to pharmaceuticals, including human and veterinary drugs, and thus does not apply to the need to promote wildlife/vulture-friendly testing on NSAIDs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f341d2e-65af-4f5c-a680-4bee3595fa7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f341d2e-65af-4f5c-a680-4bee3595fa7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd62372a20188862612cf1b7ab06062e6c2afa163469474d96d99c1c52d8ab01"}, "2": {"node_id": "d559eca6-492c-46ea-b570-0cc72ecb2223", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87d477565eb8385a2bb560274274f3bb0c355b8d5bdc4fe8ddaec2e5fec83cca"}}, "hash": "732bac5c48ca27176829013b6453479fd0fb39a08316b9303afed1bcc749bdd8", "text": "The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants is an international environmental treaty, signed in 2001 and effective from May 2004, that aims to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).

SAICM is distinguished by its comprehensive scope as a framework recognising that the essential economic role of chemicals and their contribution to improved living standards needs to be balanced with recognition of potential costs. These include the potential adverse impacts of chemicals on the environment and human health. The diversity and potential severity of such impacts makes sound chemicals management a key cross-cutting issue for sustainable development. The framework specifically references UNEA resolution 1/5 (see Section 6.1.3.) and the International Conference on 90 Chemicals Management (ICCM) resolution IV. The framework is supported by the World Health Organisation and highlights, inter alia, actions on issues which need global or coordinated action. 6.2.2 Rodenticides The CMS Preventing Poisoning Working Group recommendation (2013) incorporated in Annex II of CMS Resolution 11.15 on Preventing Poisoning of Migratory Birds urges Parties to: Restrict/ban the use of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides in open field agriculture (excluding best practice use for invasive species management); use best practice for the treatment of rodent irruptions minimising use of second-generation anticoagulants; and stop permanent baiting, with preventive rodent measures used instead. 6.2.3 NSAIDs and other veterinary medicines The CMS Guidelines to prevent the risk of poisoning of migratory birds, adopted by CMS Parties at COP11 in 2014 through Resolution 11.15 on Preventing Poisoning of Migratory Birds contains clear recommendations in relation to the issue of diclofenac, as set out in Annex II, clauses 3.1.and 3.2: 3.1. Prohibit the use of veterinary diclofenac for the treatment of livestock and substitute with readily available safe alternatives, such as meloxicam. 3.2. Introduce mandatory safety-testing of NSAIDs that pose a risk to scavenging birds, \u2018\u2026including multi-species testing with burden of proof on applicant; VICH/OECD to evaluate and provide guidance on wider risks of veterinary pharmaceuticals to scavenging birds. The Resolution goes on to state: \u2022 Safety testing of all veterinary NSAIDs that could be used to treat animals that may become food for scavenger bird species should be introduced as mandatory. \u2022 This includes safety testing of substances that are currently on the market as well new substances. \u2022 Mandatory safety testing of risks to these species will reduce the likelihood of exposure to substances that are highly toxic to birds. Safety testing of new and existing NSAIDs for veterinary treatment of cattle should be revised to include multiple species testing by the applicant. Currently however, no specific policy instrument exists to ensure that the development of future NSAIDs, nor the retrospective assessment of existing products, is wildlife friendly. General guidance only references the broader environment, but there is a need to develop vulture-relevant safety parameters in parallel with existing human parameters, e.g. withdrawal times for various edible tissues and edible products, to assess carcass safety. The regulatory approvals for diclofenac given by governments in South Asia were a result of a process error, arising from the fact that the assessments relied on acute, single species testing (Enick and Moore 2007). In Europe, much concern has been raised about the licensing of veterinary diclofenac. The drug does not have a central marketing approval for veterinary use from the European Medicines Agency (EMA); it may be authorised independently in each Member State. Despite the toxicity tests needed, it is clear that environmental risks, in particular the risk to necrophagous species, were not fully considered in at least Spain and Italy. In response to pressure, in August 2014, the European Commission opened a public consultation and asked the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use (CVMP) to issue advice as to 91 whether or not veterinary medicines containing diclofenac present a risk for vultures and other necrophagous birds in Europe. In December 2014, the CVMP issued the advice that veterinary diclofenac does represent a real risk to European vultures. They therefore suggested that a number of risk management measures should be taken to avoid the poisoning of vultures, including more regulation, veterinary controls, better labelling and information and/or a ban of the drug.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "380f490f-5d41-467a-b5b7-fd7f875bba34": {"__data__": {"id_": "380f490f-5d41-467a-b5b7-fd7f875bba34", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b4ff864383c0b78d8cf4ddfdfe4ed00df86eb0f4ee700d4586bcc4815619419"}, "2": {"node_id": "6c41d791-d324-4584-9cd1-3b38204b52fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2c02935f80f115dbd18e0a9e616d44f77185f56792e01a50ef711cc91f2cc5b"}}, "hash": "348120fbfcda9c7e1ea4f40e1ac2a8e4a58b507eb66e959f5c97e4f631a8b6f1", "text": "However the CVMP fell short of recommending one or more of the possible solutions listed as they did not have sufficient information or remit to evaluate their effectiveness, although they recognised that only a complete ban would reduce the risks to zero.

The signatory governments were Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan; a Regional Steering Committee was established which has met more than annually since then, and has also created dedicated national vulture recovery committees in each of these countries, to oversee its implementation. 6.2.4 Lead poisoning The African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) has played a key role in tackling lead poisoning of waterbirds since the 1990s. While overall progress has been slow, significant work by the CMS Preventing Poisoning Working Group has brought together the evidence on lead poisoning leading to Resolution 11.15 - Preventing Poisoning of Migratory Birds, including substantive guidelines which propose the need to phase out of lead ammunition across all habitats. Annex II of CMS Resolution 11.15 emphasises the need to: Phase out the use of lead ammunition across all habitats (wetland and terrestrial) with non- toxic alternatives within the next three years with Parties reporting to Conference of the Parties (CoP12) in 2017, working with stakeholders on implementation; promotion of leadership from ammunition users on safe alternatives, and remediation of lead polluted sites where appropriate. Building on CMS Resolution 11.15, in 2016, the IUCN World Conservation Congress adopted Resolution 82 calling for action from the IUCN Director General and Commissions as well as governments and all the IUCN member organisations to work towards the phasing out of lead ammunition. Importantly, the motion brought together hunting, wildlife management and conservation stakeholders and resulted in an almost entirely consensus text (voted for by 92% of 134 governments and 94% of 621 NGOs), illustrative of the progress that had been made. The motion encourages governments to phase out, where feasible, lead shot used for hunting over wetlands and lead ammunition used for hunting in areas where scavengers are at particular risk from the use of lead ammunition, based on scientific evidence, and the replacement of it with suitable alternatives. 6.3 Mortality caused by power grid infrastructure Almost all countries have legislation that brings the construction of power lines and new energy installations under regimes including Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), which should take into account existing habitat and wildlife conservation legislation, including for birds. Specific mention of the problems of avian electrocutions or collisions is rare. 92 SEAs and EIAs are mandatory in most countries, are required by many donor organisations and are recommended actions under the principal biodiversity conventions. But despite this their effectiveness is often limited and sometimes such requirements are ignored. A common constraint on both EIAs and SEAs is the adequacy of reliable baseline information on the biodiversity importance of sites (such as a site\u2019s importance along a flyway for migratory species). Environmental Statements submitted by developers seeking consent for their proposals sometimes fail to consider impacts on ecological functions and processes, impacts beyond site boundaries and cumulative impacts. Furthermore, even when EIAs have been carried out effectively and have identified necessary mitigation and compensation measures, such actions may be ineffectively implemented and long term management and monitoring is often inadequate. Such problems may be exacerbated by limited capacities and resources within governmental organisations to manage and review EIAs and for non-governmental conservation organisations and other stakeholders to scrutinise and contribute to them. CBD and CMS recognise environmental impact assessment as an important tool to ensure that development is planned and implemented taking biodiversity considerations into account. CBD requires parties to apply impact assessment to projects, programmes, plans and policies with a potential negative impact on biodiversity. CBD strongly supports and requires that Parties apply thorough assessment procedures (SEA and EIA) if it comes to the planning of activities with an impact on biodiversity; see CBD COP Decision VIII/28 (March 2006) and Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Netherlands Commission for Environmental Assessment (2006). 6.3.1 Renewable energy (primarily wind energy) Wind energy is an important source of energy that can significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions, yet such renewable energy technology deployments can have a range of potentially significant impacts on soaring birds of prey, including vultures. Specifically, wind farm developments have the potential to cause fatalities and injury. More urgent emphasis must be placed on the development of alternative technology to replace current wind turbines that pose a threat to vultures and other soaring birds. Designs such as bladeless turbines that produce energy equally or more efficiently, compared to current wind turbine technology, should be a priority for research and development. Currently, the most effective way to detect and avoid severe environmental impacts of wind energy developments is to perform Strategic Environmental Assessments (SEAs) at large spatial", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fac3dd3-0ab3-4b2b-bfcc-8550917992aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fac3dd3-0ab3-4b2b-bfcc-8550917992aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c23c3bbe1f78435b4a226ee2aae7365d3ee6f351e0718f180bebee006c95b03"}}, "hash": "7c23c3bbe1f78435b4a226ee2aae7365d3ee6f351e0718f180bebee006c95b03", "text": "scales. SEAs enable strategic planning and siting of wind energy developments in areas with least environmental and social impact whilst maintaining economic benefits. The SEA is a means by which environmental considerations are incorporated into policies, plans and programmes in order to achieve the best possible outcome for all stakeholders. This is particularly effective with respect to power line routing and grouping, as appropriate corridors for lines can be identified proactively, well before reaching the individual project stage. The EIA process allows for the assessment of impacts at the project level. Although project-based and fairly late in the planning process, this still provides an essential mechanism for minimising the collision and electrocution risk for birds. Wind farm developments need to consider: \u2022 Environmental impacts and in particular avifaunal specialist studies need to be carried out; 93 \u2022 Threatened bird species (and other bird species considered to be of conservation importance for various reasons) and/or the impact on habitat where regional populations of birds and/or their habitat will not be negatively impacted on; \u2022 The placement of turbines/blades so that they are not located on major migration routes and especially migration bottlenecks where large numbers of birds are highly concentrated, inside protected areas (nature reserves, national parks, Ramsar sites) and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), inside buffer zones (the range of which is determined by the relevant species) around IBAs, nature reserves, national parks and Ramsar sites, in habitats where wind farms are known to pose high collision risks to birds (mountain ridges and cliff breeding and roosting sites would be examples of such critical locations); \u2022 A greater emphasis on the development of alternative technology, such as bladeless turbines, is needed and should be actively promoted to prevent or reduce the known negative impact of current wind turbine designs on vultures and other soaring birds. EIAs and avifaunal specialist studies undertaken for all proposed wind farm developments should include the effects of the associated infrastructure such as power lines and roads on birds. 6.3.2 Transmission lines The most significant intervention to reduce the risk of electrocution from energy infrastructure is proper planning and routing of networks and the use of infrastructure designs that minimise the risk. This applies to existing and planned networks and is the most effective means to reduce mortality caused by electrocution over the long term. Where appropriate, re-routing or retrofitting of existing networks should also be implemented. Electrocution Mitigation for electrocution is far more straightforward than that for the risk of collision. Since the problem is a physical one, whereby a bird bridges certain clearances on a pole structure, large birds of prey such as vultures and storks, particularly in habitats where perches and nest sites are limited, are at most risk. Most incidences occur during the breeding season and in the immediate subsequent months when young birds are most affected. The solution is relatively straightforward, and involves ensuring that a bird cannot touch the relevant components simultaneously. Specific mitigation measures may include: \u2022 Erecting power poles that are specifically designed to be \u2018bird-safe\u2019; \u2022 Add-on mitigation or retrofitting; \u2022 Insulation; and, \u2022 Perch management techniques. Collision As for electrocution, the most significant intervention to reduce the risk of collisions with energy infrastructure is proper planning and routing of networks and the use of infrastructure designs that minimise the risk of this threat. This applies to existing and future networks and is the most effective in the long term. Where appropriate, re-routing of existing networks should be implemented. Once infrastructure exists, line modification in various forms is the most widely used approach. Line modification can take several forms, which can be broadly divided into those measures that make power lines present less of an \u2018obstacle\u2019 for birds to collide with, those that keep birds away from the power line, and those that make the power line more visible. 94 Several options exist to minimize collision risk. Wind energy and power line technologies vary in size and design which presents different types of threats to birds and other biodiversity. There are tailored mitigation measures developed to address these, based on the mitigation hierarchy such as installing nests on power lines or shut down on demand for wind turbines. The success of mitigation measures is largely dependent on the adequacy of baselines and monitoring approaches. Monitoring of collisions should consider the fact that birds that are injured subsequent to colliding with conductor lines can sometimes wander some distance away from the point of impact once grounded, and monitoring should include widening the search pattern for such birds along lines to improve the chances of locating", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cc457c6-ef97-4b4a-a8cb-151a04eb7c2b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cc457c6-ef97-4b4a-a8cb-151a04eb7c2b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86b31d7e861c9ba7b52cf91534d57c8b9a9d3c6b235c1e814a0e0c004aed1a6c"}, "3": {"node_id": "c3541563-70d8-4cea-ae0a-d9c3b47c25da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "594dc276eb02e617251a61e7780644bfa4a8f818a1316a8cfb4592491baeb679"}}, "hash": "6fd351d177e0f4caa30929cd31897e8d5afabbe57cb37a5c4022efb2eda5ddca", "text": "them. Some mitigation measures may only be specific to a type of landscape feature or species. The effectiveness of a mitigation measures may also depend on the level of environmental protection a government provides in the form of legislative framework and transparency of information. 6.3.3 Guidelines A number of guidelines address the issues surrounding new energy developments, transmission risk of electrocution (mainly from older installations) and transmission line collision risk (both existing, planned and cumulative): \u2022 AEWA Conservation Guidelines No. 11 (2008): Guidelines on how to avoid, minimise or mitigate impact of infrastructural developments and related disturbance affecting waterbirds (Tucker and Treweek 2008). \u2022 AEWA Conservation Guidelines No. 14 (2012): Guidelines on How to Avoid or Mitigate Impact of Electricity Power Grids on Migratory Birds in the African-Eurasian Region (Prinsen et al. 2012); \u2022 CMS, AEWA, International Renewable Energy Agency and Birdlife International (2014): Renewable Energy Technologies and Migratory Species: Guidelines for sustainable deployment (van der Winden et al. 2014); \u2022 BirdLife International (2016b): Mitigating the effects of Wind Farms and Power Lines. There are also a number of regional agreements, guidelines and initiatives such as: \u2022 The Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats or Bern Convention. In 2003 the Bern Convention published the report Protecting Birds from Powerlines: a practical guide on the risks to birds from electricity transmission facilities and how to minimise any such adverse effects (BirdLife International and NABU 2003); \u2022 In 2010, The Bern Convention published Implementation of Recommendation No 110/2004 on minimising adverse effects of above ground electricity transmission facilities (power lines) on birds (Council of Europe 2010). This contained a total of 14 reports from Bern Convention Parties on how they have dealt with the recommendations as requested in 2004; \u2022 EU Directives: The EU has a number of legislative instruments to deal with migratory birds and power lines. At the species level it concerns the Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) and the Habitats Directives (92/43/EEC) with its articles on preventive measures and assessments of plans and projects in the light of the aims of both Directives; \u2022 EU has agreed on a number of Directives dealing with EIA and SEA procedures and when and how to implement these; these are also directly relevant for power line construction. The EIA Directive includes a specific obligation for overhead electric power lines of 220 KV (or more) and longer than 15 kilometres. Both EU assessment procedures ask for special attention if power line construction would affect Natura 2000 sites and areas of special conservation concern (SPAs); 95 \u2022 The Budapest Declaration, adopted in 2011 after a special European Conference on power lines and bird mortality. This Declaration refers to the Resolutions as adopted by the Bern Convention (2004) and CMS (2002) and, for the EU Member States, to the regulations within the framework of the EU Bird Directive. It also highlights the need to strictly apply the SEA and EIA procedures during planning of new power lines. The Declaration also calls on all interested parties to undertake all possible actions which can help to minimise the effect of power lines on bird mortality; \u2022 Renewable Grid Initiative: Through the RGI European Grid Declaration, 24 inaugural signatories (including TSOs, NGOs and citizen groups) committed to supporting grid expansion to integrate renewables in line with nature conservation objectives; \u2022 BirdLife South Africa / Endangered Wildlife Trust: best practice guidelines for avian monitoring and impact mitigation at proposed wind energy development sites in southern Africa. 6.4 Conservation (captive) breeding and reintroduction IUCN, through the Species Survival Commission (SSC), has published guidelines to assist in determining when ex situ management may contribute to species recovery. The most recent guidance (IUCN/SSC 2014) proposes a five-step decision-making process: 1. Conduct a review of the species\u2019 status; 2. Define the role(s) that ex situ management might play; 3. Assess the precise nature of the ex situ population and how it can contribute to the proposed initiative; 4. Determine resources and expertise required, and appraise the feasibility and risks; and 5. Make an informed, transparent decision based on the above. Further IUCN guidance is available on reintroductions and other conservation translocations (IUCN/SSC 2013), which often go hand-in-hand with conservation breeding or related forms of ex situ management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3541563-70d8-4cea-ae0a-d9c3b47c25da": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3541563-70d8-4cea-ae0a-d9c3b47c25da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "86b31d7e861c9ba7b52cf91534d57c8b9a9d3c6b235c1e814a0e0c004aed1a6c"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cc457c6-ef97-4b4a-a8cb-151a04eb7c2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fd351d177e0f4caa30929cd31897e8d5afabbe57cb37a5c4022efb2eda5ddca"}}, "hash": "594dc276eb02e617251a61e7780644bfa4a8f818a1316a8cfb4592491baeb679", "text": "Several programmes have achieved the successful reintroduction of vultures to parts of Europe from which they had been extirpated, for example Bearded, Griffon and Cinereous Vultures.

The SAVE consortium is engaged in the conservation breeding of three species of Gyps vultures in South Asia following the declines of vulture populations due to poisoning by diclofenac and other NSAIDs. Conservation breeding and reintroduction can play a significant role in the conservation of vulture species as long as IUCN criteria and guidelines are met. However, this type of intervention is typically seen as a last resort, considered when all other measures to maintain viable vulture populations in the wild have been exhausted. Reintroduction of vultures into their historical range should only be considered when the threats that led to their demise have been effectively addressed. If this practice is accompanied by supplementary feeding, it is important to ensure that carcasses provided for this purpose are subject to safety screening to reduce the risk of exposure to NSAIDs and other potentially harmful substances. 96 Table 6.

The Table provides an overall priority for each action (Essential, High or Medium); a suggested timeframe for its implementation; and an indication of the relevant sub- regions in which the action is required, as highlighted in the overarching threats map (Figure 18). Each action is categorized as either Direct Conservation Action, Education & Awareness, Policy & Research or Research & Monitoring. A total of 17 Essential actions have been identified (shaded in pink): their immediate implementation is considered most important to ensure that progress towards achieving the goal of the Vulture MsAP is made as quickly as possible.

Summary of critical threats, key issues and associated Essential actions The full range of anthropogenic threats facing vultures is identified and discussed in some detail in Section 4. The Framework of Conservation Actions (Table 7) sets out a total of 125 actions that need to be implemented to respond and ultimately combat the wide range of threats impacting vultures and their populations. In Table 7, each action is assigned a level of priority based on the scale, scope and urgency of the overarching threat which it is intended to address. As a result, 17 are identified as Essential actions which need to be acted on immediately. This section aims to link these Essential actions with the critical threats they seek to address. 7.5.1. Poisoning (see Section 4.1) Unintentional secondary poisoning - Human-wildlife conflict Vultures are killed when feeding on poisoned bait set for mammalian predators as a result of human-predator conflicts or for the control of problem animals, e.g. feral dogs. \u2022 Action 1.1.1. Conduct an overall situation analysis of wildlife poisoning associated with human-wildlife conflict, with special attention to vulture mortality: covering state of knowledge, drivers and motivations, poisons used (actually or potentially), analytical capacity, hotspots, knowledge gaps and best practice on reducing conflicts and related poisoning. \u2022 Action 1.1.3. Implement awareness campaigns, specifically covering (a) negative impacts on vultures and other non-target species; (b) likely ineffectiveness of poisoning as a problem animal control technique; (c) impacts of poisoning on human and livestock health; and (d) legal alternatives to mitigate of human-wildlife conflict. \u2022 Action 1.2.2. Establish protocols and train and support relevant agency staff (conservation, rangers, police and judiciary) to rapidly respond to poisoning incidents including sharing of best practices. \u2022 Action 1.3.2.

International Coordination of Implementation 8.1. The need for an Implementation Plan An Implementation Plan is a management tool which requires key stakeholders to think through the way in which planned actions can be put into practice, including devising appropriate organisational structures, roles and responsibilities of the parties involved and the monitoring methods required to facilitate delivery of tangible outputs within set timeframes. In the context of the Vulture MsAP, the process to develop an Implementation Plan encouraged consideration of the critical components required to deliver successful vulture conservation initiatives before any actions are executed, thereby saving time, effort and money. This planning is proactive, instead of reactive, which allows best practices to be applied with the aim of ensuring the most effective stewardship of time and resources to deliver the anticipated results in a timely manner. It also allows an opportunity to consider vital aspects such as international coordination; the need for and securing of resources; and effective communication of the aims, objectives and actions recommended in the Vulture MsAP to identified key stakeholder groups through a communications strategy. Implementation of the Vulture MsAP was one of the key issues considered during the Overarching Workshop which was held in Toledo, Spain on 16\u201319 February 2017. 8.2.

The proposed coordination structure for the implementation is reflected in Figure 23. It follows closely the organisational structure established to develop the Vulture MsAP as set out in the original Project Charter published by the Coordinating Unit of the CMS Raptors MOU in early 2016, and can be summarised as follows: Coordinating Unit of the CMS Raptors MOU: It is proposed that the Coordinating Unit should retain overall responsibility for guiding and overseeing the implementation of the Vulture MsAP. This includes spearheading efforts to secure resources, recruitment and appointment of one or more Coordinators and liaison with the Range State governments, Vulture MsAP Working Group and associated Steering Group, other CMS structures and relevant stakeholder groups. Overarching Coordinator: It is considered essential for an Overarching Coordinator to be appointed to take responsibility for, and oversee the day-to-day implementation of, the Vulture MsAP throughout the vast African-Eurasian range. This person should report directly to the Coordinating Unit of the CMS Raptors MOU. The appointment of a full time Overarching Coordinator is seen as a vital step towards successful implementation of the Vulture MsAP; finding the necessary resources to fund this position is therefore a priority. Regional Coordinators: The appointment of 3\u20134 Regional Coordinators covering Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East would further assist in the implementation of the Vulture MsAP at regional levels. This structure worked extremely well during the development of the Vulture MsAP and can potentially facilitate continued direct involvement by key partners such as BirdLife International, Vulture Conservation Foundation and IUCN SSC Vulture Specialist Group. These positions could be part-time if insufficient resources are initially available. Existing Terms of Reference for these positions could readily be modified to encompass functions relating to implementation. Vulture MsAP Working Group (VWG): The VWG was established in early 2016 based on nominations received from Range State governments and partners in response to a call issued by the 137 Coordinating Unit to all Range States covered by the Vulture MsAP, partners and interested parties. The aim was to create an efficient and effective mechanism for two-way communications with all Range States, partners and interested parties, to ensure implementation of a comprehensive and widely-supported Vulture MsAP. Currently there are over 60 members of the VWG but the number can be open-ended because it is anticipated that the VWG will function solely by means of electronic communications. However, subject to available resources, VWG members will be invited to participate in relevant regional implementation-related meetings and workshops covering their respective regions. Vulture MsAP Steering Group (VSG): In September 2016, 20 members of the VWG were invited by the Coordinating Unit to serve on a VSG, to actively support development of the Vulture MsAP. Subsequently, three online teleconferences were held which proved to be an effective way in which to guide the process. It is proposed that the VSG continues to operate during the implementation phase of the Vulture MsAP. Members are expected to act as champions of the Vulture MsAP and to take responsibility for leading and driving forward discrete tasks, relevant to their respective regions. The VSG will communicate electronically, including via online teleconferences as and when required. Subject to available resources, the VSG will aim to hold at least one face-to-face meeting in the intersessional period between CMS COPs. Regional Vulture Committees (RVCs): Due to the vast geographic scope of the Vulture MsAP, it is envisaged that RVCs be established by the Regional Coordinators to facilitate communications within the regions. Subject to available resources, these RVCs should aim to meet annually but would otherwise communicate electronically, including via regular online teleconferences hosted by the respective Regional Coordinator. National Vulture Task Forces (NVTFs): The Vulture MsAP has been drafted to ensure that it is relevant to each and every one of the 128 Range States covered by the plan. However, it is anticipated that each national government may decide to utilise the Vulture MsAP to develop a tailored National Vulture Conservation Strategy (NVCS) focussed solely on the species that occur within their jurisdiction and to address the specific threats each of these species are facing. This is a critically important step to be taken by countries hosting internationally important breeding, wintering or migrant species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cbde238-31ea-460f-9b33-967ae1d37137": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cbde238-31ea-460f-9b33-967ae1d37137", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45b36282fbc6a1a4e53639409691865b3707420fd61991e476915d99fe0355db"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5cb6e3c-17b4-4f31-8018-08a008f8e282", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a22ae612173303c28f6ec7d17b56253b64af457579a48cb8dc2aae7357f0ee46"}}, "hash": "90b80fa652852e5ac4dde373c101fe67e3bf583f76db01d98be9d13bf13db6b5", "text": "Ideally, these NVCSs should be developed to complement and support existing National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) already in place under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

Where appropriate, these Task Forces should also promote the implementation of other relevant policies and plans that contribute to the conservation of vultures, e.g. CMS Resolutions, guidelines, relevant species flyway action plans, etc. Public support: Broad public awareness and support for the Vulture MsAP and its objectives could be a powerful tool when engaging with Range States and other stakeholders. In addition to implementing an effective communications plan aimed at a range of target audiences, consideration should be given to the establishment of a structure through which interested individuals and organisations can express their support. An example of such a structure is the \u2018Friends of the Landbirds Action Plan\u2019 (FLAP) which was adopted to support the implementation of the African- Eurasian Migratory Landbirds Action Plan. Potential synergies with existing initiatives such as International Vulture Awareness Day (IVAD) could assist in making this possible without requiring substantial additional resources. 138 Figure 23. Proposed coordination framework to oversee implementation of the Vulture MsAP. Arrows indicate reporting or supervision/advisory relationships. Green arrows and boxes indicate primarily advisory structures; blue arrows and boxes primarily concern implementation and reporting. 8.3. Monitoring and Evaluation To avoid placing an unnecessary additional burden on Range State governments, it is proposed that existing CMS practices be followed in terms of monitoring and evaluation during implementation of the Vulture MsAP. Accordingly, the proposed reporting arrangements integrate neatly with existing triennial online reporting requirements for CMS Parties and Signatories to the Raptors MOU. 8.3.1 Triennial Evaluation and Reporting It is proposed that the Overarching Coordinator, supported by the Regional Coordinators and including contributions from members of the Vulture Working Group, will prepare regular written progress reports on the implementation of the Vulture MsAP. These reports will need to be submitted to the Coordinating Unit at least six months in advance of meetings of the Conference of Parties to CMS and three months in advance of Meetings of Signatories to the Raptors MOU. To avoid duplication of effort, active liaison will be required by those promoting implementation of the Vulture MsAP to ensure effective engagement with existing CMS National Focal Points and National Contact Points to the Raptors MOU. Range States that are not a Party to CMS or a Signatory to the Raptors MOU will be encouraged to report in concert with the existing CMS-related time frames via a specially developed online questionnaire. 139 8.3.2 Mid-term Evaluation and Progress Report A mid-term progress report is envisaged in 2023, approximately half way through the implementation period proposed in the Vulture MsAP. The Overarching Coordinator will take the lead in gathering the information via the Regional Coordinators and other established networks, which may differ between regions. This process should not only assess progress in terms of existing objectives, but also contribute to informing and guiding decisions in terms of actions that may need to be amended according to changing circumstances and emerging threats. 8.3.3 Full-term Final Report A Final Report on implementation of the Vulture MsAP should be prepared in 2029 in time for consideration by CMS COP16. Prepared by the Overarching Coordinator, this report should review and assess implementation and the overall impact on the populations of all 15 species within their respective ranges. Range States would be encouraged to submit national reports on progress over the entire Vulture MsAP timeframe to contribute to this full-term Final Report. 8.4. Communication 8.4.1 The need for communication of the Vulture MsAP Strategic communication is an essential supporting component of the overall coordination of the implementation of any action plan. This section outlines the main messages that should be communicated to support the implementation of the Vulture MsAP; proposes some of the main communications mechanisms; and identifies key communication outputs. It is not in itself a strategic communication plan \u2013 such a plan will need to be elaborated in greater detail through the coordination framework and by stakeholder institutions, and should sit alongside the Vulture MsAP. It will need to identify actions, key messages, audiences, lead institutions, timescales and resources required. Intensive communications have been essential to the development of the Vulture MsAP, for example, ensuring wide participation in the Public Consultation Exercise and encouraging Range States to support adoption of the Vulture MsAP at CMS COP12. The challenge to implement the Vulture MsAP will require the buy-in of Range State governments and a wide range of partners and stakeholders. The purpose of a strategic communications plan for the Vulture MsAP is to raise awareness of it, and to gain multilateral support for its financing and implementation.

The audiences are very diverse, potentially involving any and all of the stakeholders identified in Section 5. 8.4.3 Communications mechanisms and channels A wide range of communications mechanisms will need to be used to generate support for the Vulture MsAP, and also to build consensus and further elaborate plans and commitments for its implementation. Supporters should not miss opportunities to promote the Vulture MsAP in their existing communication streams, whether these primarily concern vultures or other relevant conservation themes. Appropriate communications mechanisms and channels include: \u2022 Websites and existing electronic communication channels of the many stakeholders, including secretariats of multilateral or intergovernmental agreements, including especially CMS, CBD and CITES, and events such as COPs, Meetings of Signatories to the Raptors MOU and UN Environment Assembly (UNEA); \u2022 Other multilateral and bilateral institutions, governments and civil society organisations including NGOs; major civil society congresses (e.g. BirdLife International, IUCN) can provide strong opportunities to project messages; \u2022 High level advocacy events, such as those hosted by large institutions and conventions may provide opportunities for side-events which can attract strong interest; \u2022 International Vulture Awareness Day, marked annually, provides unique global communications opportunities; \u2022 Development of an interactive (multi-media) web-based tool to present the content of the Vulture MsAP in an attractive, user-friendly and accessible way; and 141 \u2022 Production of a range of online and hard copy publications, including translations into the UN suite of languages, such as briefings, posters, articles and reports. Messaging must be developed with and among networks and partners \u2013 no single organisation has a complete understanding of how to reach all stakeholders. In particular, developing synergies with relevant non-vulture interest groups is vital: there are many of these, among environmental (such as elephant and carnivore conservation groups) and non-environmental (such as public health and agricultural) constituencies. 8.4.4 Supporting materials and information sharing The story of the vulture crisis, together with the importance of the vultures and the stories of those working to conserve them makes for compelling narrative. This has already attracted a significant amount of attention from the mainstream media as well as in social and other online media, particularly in association with the Asian and African vulture crises. The potential for video documentaries and articles is very high. At a more technical level, as indicated above (8.4.3), simple illustrated digests or summaries of the Vulture MsAP in appropriate local languages are considered likely to be highly effective, typically covering the rationale for conservation, threats, objectives, actions and how individuals can provide support.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b06e5b5f-388e-4ff7-8ecc-1118e5f802d5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b06e5b5f-388e-4ff7-8ecc-1118e5f802d5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "63a1616d383a0c075d6ccb2c0d918b99cf90535cbe21d2fd0bf471d47bfbd50f"}, "2": {"node_id": "32d80b7a-a2c1-458a-9356-6871951dfbd9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "432f0fbeec1cb9728e9f4da0f6201b728cfb4b671a8e3027725a5593631f2a97"}}, "hash": "f55d6c57832b17b29e6221b9a63cf8bf7c932b46a4f9c0c565290a799e5f693c", "text": "An interactive online version of the Vulture MsAP could allow readers to extract information and to generate concise reports relevant to their country, region or species of interest.

Finally, national vulture conservation plans or strategies should be developed as a priority, and promoted where none exist, driven by national task forces. This is an ideal way to promote pride and national ownership of vultures and the need to conserve them. For information sharing, a central repository of information on vultures and their conservation could be effective, perhaps in the form of a \u2018Friends of the Vultures\u2019 website or portal where anyone could engage and be kept up to date with vulture news and conservation actions. This would provide a mechanism for stakeholders and the general public to engage and to stay involved. This may also allow links to other environmental programmes or campaigns relevant to specific threats to vultures, for example on illegal killing or taking of birds, illegal wildlife trade or renewable energy impact mitigation. 8.5. Budgeting, fundraising and resource mobilisation Developing a comprehensive budget and fundraising plan is beyond the scope of this Vulture MsAP. However, it is considered useful to confirm the key principles that should guide budgeting, fundraising and resource mobilisation, and also to identify some opportunities in relation to specific issues associated with vulture conservation. 8.5.1 Budgeting Costs relating to the implementation of the Vulture MsAP can be considered in terms of those which relate to the coordination structure, and those required to implement the practical conservation actions. Budgeting and fundraising for vulture conservation implementation activities to deliver the Vulture MsAP should be driven primarily by the stakeholders most responsible for those activities. To support this, proponents may wish to elaborate on the Framework of Conservation Actions for African-Eurasian Vultures outlined in this plan (Table 7). The proposed Overarching and Regional Coordinators, together with other key individuals contributing to the coordination framework 142 (Section 8.2), should be well placed to facilitate or provide inputs to this process. To enable this, it will be necessary for all stakeholders to keep the relevant the coordinators informed. The costs of the proposed coordination structure will include the employment costs of the coordinators, together with operational costs, mainly travel and office costs. Travel for the Coordinators and others may include the suggested annual meetings of the Regional Vulture Committees and for engagement with appropriate CMS Task Forces, Working Groups and other technical or capacity-building gatherings that may be required. Regular meetings to promote implementation of the Vulture MsAP should also include Vulture Steering Group meetings, mostly via online teleconferences. Communications and awareness-raising costs would include activities identified in Section 8.3 (above), including development of a web-portal and information repository (subject to the development or enhancement of existing databases, to avoid duplication or undermining). It is therefore important to seek pledges of funding, most likely from CMS Parties, for the coordination structure and its operations (mainly coordinators and meetings) at the earliest possible opportunity. Following recruitment, the anticipated Overarching and Regional Coordinators should assist with fundraising for the practical implementation of the Vulture MsAP. Project expenditures to deliver the Vulture MsAP are required to cover a vast range of actions. Approaches based on nationally developed vulture conservation plans and prioritised projects may be the most cost-effective way forward. As a step towards this, support is needed to develop fundraising and communications plans including lists of agreed priority projects to which to fundraise and agreed fundraising roles. 8.5.2 Fundraising and resource mobilisation Projects and plans National plans and priority projects would be suitable for support through small to medium-sized grants which could be funded nationally. However, the large scale of the threats, together with their policy relevance, makes vulture conservation highly suitable for larger donors such as governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies. Larger projects could support governments to develop National Vulture Conservation Action Plans (preferably multi-species, where more than one occurs) drawing directly on information contained in the Vulture MsAP, followed by implementation of agreed actions. The coordination framework will be expected to play a key role in encouraging and recruiting stakeholders to support development of such large projects and the proposals to source the funding for these. The top priority funding sources should therefore be governments, and in certain regions multilateral agencies where these channel government support: for example, the European Union LIFE+ programme has been the single biggest supporter of vulture conservation in Europe. Only they can deliver and sustain the level of funding to implement the Vulture MsAP effectively. Fundraising, in line with the advocacy necessary effectively to promote support for the Vulture MsAP, should look beyond the wildlife and environment arenas and actively consider engaging", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e411e85a-5c3a-4a3a-8db1-3467e9c9f05d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e411e85a-5c3a-4a3a-8db1-3467e9c9f05d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Multi-species action plan to conserve African-Eurasian vultures", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "394ccd69f575cb20b8279ca673b17ce1de1dfb4577f01fafb763e15ae0146648"}, "3": {"node_id": "6bb65300-9928-4497-ab49-62c45d3e3d79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/multi-species-action-plan-conserve-african-eurasian-vultures", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "df496106faa6be5ee3121bc2c556c1079e002728f46aeb5b9c5be68e01c43e2c"}}, "hash": "b6bc3ab6363dccea94c67c1d6933cefeb4d4585519450bdb04b25fd722cc92b1", "text": "other sectors such as agriculture, livestock farming and public health, into which vulture conservation needs to be integrated or mainstreamed. Mainstreaming is likely to be based at least partly on the ecosystem services offered by vultures, on which further research is needed to fully develop robust arguments for support. 143 At smaller or more localised scales, other supporters are likely to be appropriate, including: \u2022 Embassies may be approached to finance small to medium sized national projects; \u2022 Trusts and foundations are best suited to specific priority action projects with high chances of achieving rapid impact; national Vulture MsAPs are likely to be valuable mechanisms to assist in identifying and promoting such projects as well as selecting other funding sources; \u2022 Individuals, often but not always those of high net worth, may make commitments to provide medium and long term resources for conservation actions under CMS family (which includes the Raptors MOU). Such supporters can become Migratory Species Champions by helping to guarantee the timely planning and implementation of projects and other initiatives; \u2022 Fundraising appeals, typically through NGOs, face challenges related to negative public perceptions of vultures, but can be successful if well planned and including a component of attitude change (which is also an additional benefit); \u2022 The private sector may contribute either through philanthropy or Corporate Social Responsibility programmes. Non-project approaches: mobilising and mainstreaming Mainstreaming of environmental issues can be defined as the active promotion of environmental sustainability in the identification, planning, design, negotiation and implementation of strategies, policies and investment programmes. Environmental issues are addressed strategically as a cross- cutting dimension of development, and implies moving beyond environmental impact mitigation to a more encompassing and strategic approach to achieving sustainability. Clearly, this is a vast subject area on which only brief notes can be presented here, where specific approaches can be recommended that are particularly appropriate for vulture conservation. Mainstreaming may be based on development and advocacy for sectoral guidelines, of which a range exists to support migratory species conservation including vultures (Section 6). Resources for vulture conservation can be mobilised by promoting the application of these guidelines into development projects and other long term plans. Mainstreaming is often most realistic and achievable when existing policies are being opened up for review. Resources can also be mobilised for vulture conservation without classical fundraising or governmental or intergovernmental funding or planning approaches. Support in kind, underpinned by awareness, may be equally or perhaps even more powerful. Vulture Range States often include significant areas of land where management can be influenced in favour of vultures, working with land owners and land managers to encourage positive action for vultures. This is the principle behind the concept of Vulture Safe Zones, being implemented in Asia and now also Africa. This has the added advantage that the focus is less on prohibition and negative messaging, and more on positive action. With appropriate definition and marketing, this has the potential to develop into a recognised sign of good environmental practice, with reputational and business benefits. Moreover, the Vulture Safe Zones concept is potentially applicable in any of the Range States and could be led by small NGOs, community groups or even highly motivated individuals. National networks of Vulture Safe Zones have the potential to offer a realistic, achievable and effective grass roots approach to vulture conservation. 144 9. References Abebe, Y. D. 2013.

development of the Vulture MsAP and were augmented by inputs received at the European and Middle Eastern Regional Workshops held in October 2016 and February 2017, respectively. These data reflect current status and breeding population estimates for the four vulture species about which we know the most. Unfortunately, the same level of information is not available for species occurring in Africa and a substantial part of Asia.

In Europe, many wetlands have been destroyed or degraded by human activities, including drainage, agricultural land use, regulation and damming of river courses, pollution, eutrophication, invasions of non-native species and other actions. In northern Italy, many wetlands have disappeared and been replaced by intensive croplands or industrial areas, leading to a drastic decline of many wetland species. In Slovenia, the decline of wetlands has also been going on for long, but has accelerated since the country joined the European Union. Wetlands are disappearing as farmers are trying to improve grasslands using drainage and fertilisation or convert them into crop fields. The Adriatic Marbled Bush-Cricket, Zeuneriana marmorata (Fieber, 1853), is a rare bush- cricket species, which is found in a few wetlands in north-eastern Italy (Friaul) and Slovenia. It has a loud and characteristic song, which creates a unique acoustic atmosphere in the very few places where it still occurs. The species is found in marshland habitats with rush (Juncus) and sedge (Carex) vegetation in Slovenia (Fig. 1) and in reed beds of some northern Italian coastal lagoons. Only four populations of this species are still existing with an estimated total of 3,000-5,000 adult individuals per year (a very small number for an insect species). The complete remaining habitat of this species has a size of 0.57 km\u00b2 (57 ha), the majority of which (41 ha = 72%) is located in the Ljubljansko barje (Lubljana marshes) in Slovenia. Within its habitat, Z. marmorata is mostly the dominant species of Orthoptera (i.e. bush-crickets, crickets and grasshoppers).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98a668f7-c9a2-4f00-8816-754fa95ea874": {"__data__": {"id_": "98a668f7-c9a2-4f00-8816-754fa95ea874", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Adriatic marbled bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) : a national action plan for Slovenia 2016-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "60697795d3c81064074174aa00a39ad2e169ebf1b3de37b4c5c924d306ea1696"}, "2": {"node_id": "82107791-e79b-4b9d-b4bd-f9302215e144", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8163b876d522813f3a24b5779d8f56152183e360c52a29d4d70400d7af4d40ec"}}, "hash": "55411e66f01db587c2257d5f1e808e994361232cfcf2e2376eb146e76d03a9f9", "text": "bush-crickets, crickets and grasshoppers). It is quite sedentary and sensitive to habitat destruction. Figure 1: Habitat of Zeuneriana marmorata in Ljubljansko barje. \u00a9 Stanislav Gomboc 5 The destruction and fragmentation of habitats led to extinction of most Italian populations of the species, especially in the area of the Venice lagoons (Fig. 2). For several decades, Z. marmorata was presumed to be extinct, until it was rediscovered in a small reed lagoon in Lisert near Monfalcone (Kleukers et al. 1997). The species was considered an Italian endemic until it was found in Slovenia in the Ljubljana marsh in 2004 (Gomboc & \u0160egula 2005). This area now maintains the largest known population of Z. marmorata, with estimated 2,000 to 4,000 individuals. Even this population occurs in a very small area of just 41 ha. Considering the history of land use and periodically high groundwater level, it is likely that Z. marmorata was formerly more widespread in the Ljubljana marsh. Currently, it is confined to a small area of extensively used sedge meadows, between Ig and \u0160kofljica. Many of these meadows have recently been converted into cornfields or are now intensively used (i.e. fertilized and mown more often), both of which is detrimental to the population of Z. marmorata. The use of heavy rotating machinery for mowing is also problematic for the species as many individual die during mowing events. Other sedge meadows are abandoned and have become overgrown with the alien plants Solidago canadensis and S. gigantea, that make the habitat unsuitable for the bush-cricket. Therefore, the remaining population of Z. marmorata in the Ljubljana marsh has a high extinction risk.

Subsequently, the species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species (Kleukers et al. 2015). If the wet meadows of the Ljubljana marsh are not immediately preserved from conservation into cornfields or intensive grassland management, the Adriatic Marbled Bush-Cricket will disappear from the area. Therefore, a conservation strategy for the species has been developed in cooperation with the major stakeholders.

The body size of males and females is 16-21 mm (measured from the head to the end of the abdomen). The wings are short and only used for sound production in males. Hindwings are absent in both sexes and thus the species is unable to fly. In males the wings reach the end of the abdomen or are slightly longer, while in females they reach two thirds of the abdomen. Males use the fore wings to produce a calling song, which is audible at a long distance. The colour of the wing is not as dark as the body, usually medium brown. The antennae of both sexes are very long, much longer than the body. The hind legs are long and designed for jumping \u2013 as typical in Orthoptera. They can jump up to 0.5 m when starting from the ground. The female has a short upcurved ovipositor, which is up to 5 mm long. Females lay eggs in plant stems, usually in the aerial parenchyma on the top of stems. Nymphs are similar to adults, but are darker coloured (Fig. 4). In appearance they are similar to the nymphs of the widespread Common Dark Bush-cricket (Pholidoptera griseoaptera), which can be found at the edges of the marshland habitat within shrubs.

In Europe, four species of the genus are known. They all have narrow distributional ranges in southern Europe (Harz, 1969). Z. marmorata (Fieber, 1853) and Z. amplipennis (Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1882) are closely related species and both occur in wet, periodically flooded meadows. To clarify the systematic status of both species, additional studies are necessary. Z. amplipennis occurs locally along the Sava river basin in Vojvodina and in the surroundings of Belgrade and is classified as Endangered on the IUCN Red List (Chobanov et al. 2016). The other two species, Z. burriana (Uvarov, 1935) and Z. abbreviata (Serville, 1839), are grassland species which occur in northern Spain and southwestern France (Morin, 1994; Harz, 1969). Until Z. marmorata was found in Ljubljansko barje in Slovenia, it was considered an Italian endemic species. However, Fieber described the species in 1853, after the female holotype with the locality description \u201cIllyrien\u201d, which was a large area at this time. The so-called Illyrian Provinces (during the French rule) and Illyrian Kingdom (after the restored rule by Austria) included also Ljubljana, which was even the capital of the Illyrian Provinces.

Among this material, there were also Orthoptera. The Schmidt collection is now deposited in the Slovenian Museum of Natural History in Ljubljana. Included are nine boxes of Orthoptera, which are poorly labelled, and which do not contain Z. marmorata. It is nevertheless possible that Fieber described the species after Schmidt\u2019s material, collected in the surroundings of Ljubljana. Therefore, Ljubljansko barje may possibly be even the type locality from which Z. marmorata was described. Biology & Ecology Z. marmorata has a univoltine life cycle, which means that it has one generation per year. Eggs hibernate in the stems of sedges (Carex), meadwort (Filipendula ulmaria) or other higher plants and hatch around mid May in Slovenia.

They are specialized on marsh habitats and are highly sedentary. They are often found in sunny places on high sedges, where they can concentrate in high numbers. Nymphal development takes about 1-1.5 month. Based on data from related species it is assumed that nymphs moult six to seven times before they become adult. In Ljubljansko barje, adults are found from mid June to the end of September. The last nymphs can be found until the beginning of July, in cooler years also until the mid of July. The life span 8 of the adults is about 2-3 months. Adult males appear to be territorial and can usually be found within a few square metres throughout their adult life. They are highly sedentary and do not leave their location unless necessary, e.g. when meadows are mown. The song of the males is very loud and audible at a distance of up to 30 m, depending on wind and noise. It can therefore be used to locate singing males for monitoring purposes as adults are very difficult to find in high vegetation. Males use the song to attract females as well as to deter other males. When other males approach, they produce a rivalry song to defend their position. During warmer summer days, males are singing the whole day with only shorter breaks. When disturbed they immediately stop singing for about ten minutes. This behaviour is often mimicked by other males in the vicinity. Very often males sing in alternation with each other (\u201cduetting\u201d). When singing, males climb to the top of plants, such as sedges (Carex), meadwort (Filipendula ulmaria), rushes (Juncus) or other higher plants, which are exposed to the sun. Their singing position is probably chosen to improve audibility of their songs and enhance thermoregulation, as they are directly exposed to the sun. As they need to heat up in the morning, their dark body has the function to absorb the heat and it also serves as a camouflage when the insect is hiding on the ground as it has the colour of wet soil. When singing, males often walk around on the plant stem or the upper leaf. When they are approached, they stop singing and jump down in the vegetation, where they are very difficult to find. This is presumably an anti-predator strategy to avoid insectivorous birds. During rearing, it was observed that singing males are attracting birds. At the beginning of their adult lives males sing throughout the day, starting in the morning and even continuing during night if the temperature is sufficiently high. Later in the season, when nights become cooler, they only sing during warm sunny periods of the day. Towards the end of their lifespan they sing shorter, which is the reason why monitoring needs to be ideally performed in August. Females mature slightly later than males. They mate more than once and lay single eggs in the upper part of the soft stems of grasses and other herbs herbal plants on the wet meadows. Eggs were found in the upper part of the stems inside the parenchyma (Fig. 5). Most probably they are laid in the upper parts to survive flooding periods. At the end of their lives, females which were held in a terrarium, placed the eggs also in detritus on the ground. The exact locations where eggs are hibernating is important for conservation management. If eggs are mainly laid in plant stems, their survival can be increased by avoiding mowing the meadows after eggs are laid (from mid July onwards). The vegetation with the deposited eggs should remain on the meadow until the next year. If the eggs are partially laid in the ground, mowing is not as critical as these eggs can survive mowing and removal of hay. 9 Much aspects of the biology of Z. marmorata remains unknown. In 2016, some nymphs were caught and reared in insectariums. The captive insects were fed with salad (Lactuca sativa), oat flakes or other seed, raisins and in small amount dry insects for aquarium animals as other dead grasshoppers, we put in the terrarium. They were also ate leaves of Rubus idaeus, which were placed in the insectarium as canopy.

At the edges of the wet meadows, other Orthoptera are present that live in dryer or warmer habitats or in the bushes, such as Poecilimon gracilis (Fieber, 1853) and Oecanthus pellucens (Scopoli, 1763). Oedipoda caerulescens (Linnaeus, 1758) and Sphingonotus caerulans (Linnaeus, 1767) have recently been found on a deposit of construction waste, which has been dumped on some meadows. Recently, Aiolopus thalassinus (Fabricius, 1781) has also established in some wet meadows, as this species has expanded its range in Slovenia as a consequence of climate change. 10 Information on the biology and ecology of Z. marmorata is still incomplete. It is very difficult to observe the species in nature, as it is hiding in dense vegetation and rapidly hides in the vegetation when disturbed. Further research is therefore necessary on the following points: - Diet in natural conditions - Oviposition in nature - Microclimatic conditions for egg development, survival, diapause - Ecology of the nymphs and how many instars they pass - Survival rate and main predators - Impact of mowing (timing and technique) on species survival - Colonisation capabilities of the species - Isolation of small subpopulations and their viability at a longer term. Function and values The Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket has not received much attention by the public so far. It does not look very special to the human eye and lives in marshes, which are usually avoided by people. Therefore, Z. marmorata remained a \u201chidden\u201d species not known to the public. Given the small range of the species and the fact that its largest population is found in Ljubljansko barje, the region can be seen as a Key Biodiversity Area for this species. As Z. marmorata is one of the most abundant species on the flooding meadows, it is likely to be an important food source for birds, but probably also for small mammals and predatory insects and spiders. More important is the role of Z. marmorata as a bioindicator of habitat quality of the marshland. Z. marmorata is connected tightly to high grass structure with dense and humid vegetation. This habitat is important for nature protection and the local population as water reservoir, also as clean ground water source, as a compensator of fluctuating temperatures and other ecosystem services. The marshes are situated in a regional park, which many people are now visiting more often to enjoy nature or perform recreational activities. The area is also a cultural UNESCO World Heritage site for its prehistoric pile dwellings as a part for the serial World Heritage Site \u201cPrehistoric Pile-Dwellings in the Alpine Area\u201d. Historical account The assumed historical distribution of Z. marmorata is shown in Figure 2. The geographic range decreased rapidly as a consequence of urbanization and habitat conversion into cropland after the land was drained to improve its economic value. The real historic distribution of Z. marmorata is unknown. Most probably Z. marmorata was distributed much wider than we know today, not just along the reed lagoons in northern Italy, but also in 11 Ljubljana marsh. It was presumed to be extinct since 1949 until it was rediscovered in 1996 near Monfalcone and in 2004 in Ljubljansko barje in Slovenia (Kleukers et al.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e844bde3-95a9-40d2-953b-a3492b6c4b4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "e844bde3-95a9-40d2-953b-a3492b6c4b4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Adriatic marbled bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) : a national action plan for Slovenia 2016-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "195394eac28c6123a78e14755db51dac337f1ea97c24661e2b89035d44acb21b"}, "2": {"node_id": "cd11083d-36f0-45a3-8060-97353f130a1d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "300dd22a4b3f53bc7f1e29fdbb7248b11f2da660b2ecd789f99b569d7d72ba48"}}, "hash": "3d198b9d6997d6667fec5c1a1b41cbe818527d1ac3a068a8720da0e8fafd2a17", "text": "1997, Gomboc & \u0160egula 2005). After the Second World War, many Italian lagoons were heavily sprayed with insecticide against Anopheles to supress malaria in the Adriatic region, which could have a strong impact on Z. marmorata populations. After 1949 no individuals were found any more in the area of Chioggia close to Venice (Kleukers et al. 1997). Most of the remaining populations of. Z. marmorata are very small and isolated, so that they are unlikely to survive for a longer term. In Italy, most of the land has been urbanised and converted into intensively used crop fields. The same has happened recently in the Ljubljana marsh, where more than half of the previous meadow area was turned into crop fields. Other meadows were drained and fertilized in order to increase productivity. Today, the distribution is patchy and covering altogether about 57 ha, more than two third (41 ha) of which are located in the Ljubljansko barje.

The population estimated at this time was about 2,000 individuals at the end of August (Fig. 6), but given that the survey was done rather late in the season, the real number might have been twice as high. Surveys in other potentially suitable habitats remained unsuccessful, including other areas within the Ljubljana marsh, the lagoons near Koper, Cerknica Lake, Grosuplje marshland and elsewhere. Hence, the population of the Ljubljana marsh is the largest remaining population of the species. Figure 6: Distribution of Z. marmorata in Ljubljansko barje, end August 2008. Data: Paul Veenvliet 12 Current distribution and demography Currently only four populations of Z. marmorata are known worldwide (Fig. 7). Three of them live in lagoons in Northern Italy: Marano lagoon, Isola della Cona, and Lisert near Monfalcone. The largest remaining population occurs in Ljubljansko barje between Ig and \u0160kofljica (near Ljubljana in Slovenia). Figure 7: Current distribution of Z. marmorata with four remaining populations in Italy and Slovenia (yellow circles). Data and map by Francesca Tami and Stanislav Gomboc. In 2016, a detailed survey of the known Z. marmorata sites was carried out during the main season by counting the singing males to obtain detailed information on their current distribution. In the Ljubljana marsh, the first count was carried out from 26 July to 6 August 2016. During this time, most meadows were unmown and a large number of individuals were found, ca. 2,200 singing males (Fig. 8). If a balanced sex ratio is assumed, the complete population size estimate in Ljubljansko barje is ca. 4,400 individuals. Coordinates of each singing male were collected with a GPS and the data were used to prepare distribution maps. After the first survey, many meadows were mown for the first time in the year. At that time, a movement of the individuals from the mown meadows to nearby meadows with remaining vegetation or to the higher remaining patches of vegetation at the banks of the drainage ditches was observed. Many individuals died as a consequence of mowing with heavy rotating machinery. To estimate this effect, a second survey after mowing of most meadows was conducted (19 to 27 August 2016). At that time 708 singing males were observed (Fig. 9), suggesting a total population size of about 1,400 individuals at that time. This was a significant decline of individuals after mowing, but also a decline compared to the survey end of 2008, which took place during a similar time. 13 The season 2016 was generally favourable for Z. marmorata, as no longer periods of drought occurred during spring and summer. Furthermore, most meadows were mown late as a consequence of their inclusion in environmental measures to improve the situation for Coenonympha oedippus (False Ringlet), which is a European habitats directive species. The highest abundance of Z. marmorata was observed on meadows that were not mown until autumn 2016, showing that the measures for C. oedippus also benefit Z. marmorata.

Where blue dots do not overlap with purple or yellow dots, there species has lost suitable habitat. Some meadows from 2008 are now cornfields and not suitable for Z. marmorata anymore. Especially the eastern subpopulations close to \u0160kofljica are declining rapidly and may disappear within a few years. The main threats to these two subpopulations are intensification meadow management, abandonment of meadows, deposition of construction waste on the meadows and encroachment of invasive species, particularly Solidago spp. The Italian populations of Z. marmorata occur in reed lagoons close to the sea (Fig. 11-14), with brackish vegetation. Individuals are found on reed and lower forbs and sedges inside open parts of the reed beds. A survey of Z. marmorata carried out in 2016 by Francesca Tami and Yannick Fannin shows that the number of individuals and abundance is substantially lower than in the Ljubljana marsh. However, the reed beds are very difficult to access so that the data is less accurate than the data from Slovenia.

Habitat and resource assessment In the Ljubljana marsh, Z. marmorata inhabits partially flooded and swamp meadows, where the ground water is very high (Figs. 15 & 16). From autumn to spring these meadows are periodically flooded for at least a short period, often more than once a year. In order to improve harvests, ditches are maintained which drain the water to the river I\u0161ka.

Habitat of Z. marmorata at Lisert in Monfalcone, Italy, 15 August 2016. \u00a9 Stanislav Gomboc Threat analysis The main threats to Z. marmorata in the Ljubljana marsh are: 1. Increasing area of a corn fields, leading to habitat conversion and fragmentation 2. Intensification of grassland management with different mowing times or more cuts 3. Fertilisation of meadows to increase productivity 4. Drainage, leading to deterioration of habitats and allowing intensified agricultural land use 5. Use of heavy machinery on meadows 6. Abandonment of meadows which are overgrown by invasive plants and shrubs 7. Spread of alien invasive plants 8. Climate change with more extreme weather (increasing lengths and severity of droughts, flooding events during summer, increasing temperatures) 9. Plans to build a new road in the eastern part of the Ljubljansko barje 10. Deposition of construction waste close to a subpopulation of Z. marmorata 21 Since 2006 drastic changes in agricultural practices have been observed in Ljubljansko barje, especially because land owners obtained higher subsidies for crop fields than for meadows. As a consequence many meadows were turned into corn fields, leading to destruction of habitats and fragmentation of the remaining meadows (Figs. 18 & 19). Currently, about half of the general area in which Z. marmorata occurs has been converted into cornfields. Cornfields are generally not suitable as habitats for the species and probably very difficult to restore. They thus represent the most drastic alteration of the habitat. Due to the increasing economic health of the local farmers, agricultural land use has generally been intensified, including the use of heavy machinery, fertilizers, drainage and different or new mowing times. The use of heavy rotational mowing machines is problematic as modern tractors weigh more than 5 t, have broad tires and work at a high speed. They compact the soil and kill many individuals, as these are not able to jump away. During the survey in 2016 it has been observed that only approximately one fourth of the adult individuals (sometimes even less) can survive this kind of mowing. Drainage and fertilization are changing the vegetation of the habitat. As Z. marmorata appears to be restricted to very wet habitats, this deterioration is likely to be detrimental to the species. The best timing of mowing is currently not fully understood for the species, but it is likely that more than one mowing event per year has negative consequences. Some meadows have been abandoned and are overgrown by shrubs or invasive Solidago spp. These degraded habitats are not utilized by Z. marmorata. Encroachment of S. spp. has also been observed in some sedge meadows, but is most problematic in disturbed sites. The effects of climate change on Z. marmorata is little understood. However, as a wetland species it is likely to be sensitive to the increasing lengths and severity of droughts. It might also be affected by flooding events during summer or by increasing temperatures, but this requires further study.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cfe1da7b-db4a-4678-9cc8-f779a89218a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "cfe1da7b-db4a-4678-9cc8-f779a89218a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Adriatic marbled bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) : a national action plan for Slovenia 2016-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1664df1a1202ae2c763b8ebd6686e75ca6fd5a2d1f7cf77f92442d5f25b0663e"}, "2": {"node_id": "91bbff78-0749-40ce-a1e8-9c57cf744092", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f26f9b3740a7588ee6e4649ad05ee6eaa104e07c7764e01a3da90c25de39d9df"}}, "hash": "91b2758f6c76b2029892372ae159501dd7d9ef1ae7d591558a4d9803263b097d", "text": "Plans to construct a new bypass road west of \u0160kofljica have recently been brought back into use, which would cross the remaining population of Z. marmorata.

A further expansion of this deposition might lead to a complete collapse of the eastern subpopulation. 22 Generally, the situation in Slovenia is slightly better than in Italy, where it is assumed that most of the suitable habitat of the species has been destroyed in the 20th Century. Due to the very fragmented land structure in Ljubljansko barje and the diverse land ownership, there is a more diverse land use in place, so that the species was able to survive in areas which are still suitable. This diverse land ownership also contributed to different timing of mowing of small parcels, where specimens could escape to the unmown meadows in vicinity.

The Park was established in 2009 and is one of the youngest parks of Slovenia. A management plan is currently being prepared for the park to benefit protected species as well as the cultural heritage sites. It is almost finalised and ready for implementation. A few international nature conservation projects for conservation of habitats and important biodiversity areas were already successfully implemented in the area. The last of them was an EEA grant project LJUBA (People for Marsh - Biodiversity Conservation at the Ljubljana Marsh), which was addressing the main causes of biodiversity loss in the Ljubljana Marsh. The purpose of the project was to improve the conditions for three habitat types listed on annex I of the habitats directive (purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), extensive meadows and lowland bog) as well as four habitats directive species (fen orchid (Liparis loeselii), False Ringlet (Coenonympha oedippus), Scarce Large Blue (Maculinea teleius), Marsh Fritillary (Euphydryas aurinia) (http://www.ljuba.si/en/about/)). This project has been completed in 2016. Z. marmorata has benefited from the project, as some conservation management was implemented on meadows with Z. marmorata. The late mowing of meadows was mainly conducted to benefit Coenonympha oedippus populations, but these meadows became also more suitable for Z. marmorata. The farmers, which implemented these measures, received compensation payments for the protection of special butterflies sites and for mowing meadows after 16 August. However, the area of meadows under these measures was still rather small and the project has been completed in 2016. Therefore, the park is now trying to continue with the same conservation strategy in the future and is looking for additional funds and farmers which may be interested in participation. The park is now preparing conservation strategy for the area. Under this strategy, landowners can implement different agricultural measures as optimal for preserving biodiversity of the area and receive additional compensation for preserving high quality habitat types of Ljubljana Marsh. The park is currently looking for funding for this approach. 24 CONSERVATION STRATEGY PLANNING Methodology Guidelines To develop the conservation strategy for the Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket in Slovenia, the handbook of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN SSC 2008), strategies from other species and advice from experts were used.

This was done through a participatory workshop, involving species specialists and planners, ministries and state government agencies, managers, researchers and other stakeholders. Participants These included experts from the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning (MESP), the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food (MAFF), the Institute of the Republic of Slovenia for Nature Conservation (IRSNC), the Ljubljana Marsh Regional Park (KPLB), the Faculty of Education of the 25 University of Ljubljana, local municipalities, IUCN Species Survival Commission members, Zavod Symbiosis, Zavod EGEA (see Appendix I for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92fee14e-3645-4e37-ac4c-92c7d45b393d": {"__data__": {"id_": "92fee14e-3645-4e37-ac4c-92c7d45b393d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Adriatic marbled bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) : a national action plan for Slovenia 2016-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f72d143577e6a3c5fa90e9233f7e745da636edec526ce01187d77b82effac5e"}, "3": {"node_id": "f2c71445-796c-4618-a9c1-0958b13c8c83", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan-0", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3d267f7a1c7db6dbc72201cb2c177c8c205e455a2bfece038998b872566113e"}}, "hash": "8441550e3100f1ac677ec117965b699e2124a512a77ea489e58156201f761e85", "text": "a detailed list of participants). Programme The workshop ran from 18th to 19th September 2016 and was divided into two main parts: core group discussions (on 18th in English), stakeholder discussion, including the development of a vision, goals, objectives and actions (on 19th September in English and Slovenian). The first day was used for developing a draft vision and potential goals and objectives by the core group in order to present it to the stakeholders during the next day. A field trip was also organised for the core group. On 19th September, information on the species (biology, ecology, threats) and on the strategic planning process was presented. The vision, goals, objectives and actions were discussed and modified by stakeholders and a field trip took place. Another workshop was held on 20th of September in Italy (Isola della Cona Conference Room \u2013 Riserva Naturale Regionale Foce dell\u2019Isonzo, Staranzano) to develop a parallel strategy also for the Italian populations. The workshop programmes are given in Appendices II and III. 26 Vision The Ljubljansko barje, a unique marshland with outstanding value regarding its natural and cultural heritage, will maintain large areas of well-connected wetland habitats, under sustainable meadow management, supporting a large viable population of the Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket, Zeuneriana marmorata, and other associated threatened wetland species. It will become a major pillar of a network of wetlands ranging from northern Italy to Slovenia that maintain populations of Zeuneriana marmorata. The vision was carefully worded to reflect the following points: (i) \u201coutstanding value regarding its natural and cultural heritage\u201d: the Ljubljansko barje is part of the cultural UNESCO World heritage site \u201cPrehistoric Pile- Dwellings in the Alpine Area\u201d, but also NATURA2000 site with occurrences of several rare and threatened species. (ii) \u201clarge areas of well connected wetland habitats\u201d: the conversion of sedge meadows to crop fields has led to a substantial loss and fragmentation of the remaining suitable habitat that needs to be restored and re-connected. (iii) \u201csustainable meadow management\u201d: Changes in land use have led to intensification of grassland management with use of heavy machinery, which needs to be replaced by a management that benefits threatened species. (iv) \u201csupport a large viable population\u201d: Habitat management needs not only to focus on preventing further declines of the species, but also on increasing the population by restoration reconnection of habitat, as well as by translocation. (v) \u201cother associated threatened wetland species\u201d: Conservation management needs to be applied in a multi-species context, considering many threatened species of which Zeuneriana marmorata is one important flagship. (vi) \u201cmajor pillar of a network of wetlands\u201d: As the species is still present also in the Italian coastal wetlands, the conservation in Ljubljansko barje has to be planned in cooperation with partners in Italy. 27 Goals, objectives and actions Goal 1: Habitat management To increase the area of high quality wet grassland habitat in concordance with other relevant plans and strategies, facilitating population growth and spread of Zeuneriana marmorata and other threatened species in the area. In order to facilitate conservation planning, three zones are distinguished (Fig. 21): 1. Zone 1 (preservation zone): Most suitable habitats for Zeuneriana marmorata 2. Zone 2 (improvement zone): Habitats occupied by Z. marmorata of medium quality 3. Zone 3 (restoration zone): Currently not suitable areas between occupied habitats Figure 21: Proposed zonation for conservation management (green: preservation zone; dark yellow: improvement zone; light yellow: restoration zone).

Zeuneriana marmorata is immediately threatened by land use changes and may become extinct in a very short period of time if no conservation measures for species protection will be applied. All together just about 3000 specimens of the species remain, which is a very small number for an insect species. The purpose of the workshop is the development of an official conservation strategy for this species. We will present the current situation and species biology and discuss the necessary conservation measures for the long-term conservation of the species at the remaining localities.

In Europe, many wetlands have been destroyed or degraded by human activities, including drainage, agricultural land use, industrialization, regulation and damming of river courses, pollution, eutrophication, invasions of non-native species and other actions. In northern Italy, many wetlands have disappeared and been replaced by intensive croplands or industrial areas, leading to a drastic decline of many wetland species. The Adriatic Marbled Bush-Cricket, Zeuneriana marmorata (Fieber, 1853), is a rare bush- cricket species, which is found in a few wetlands in north-eastern Italy (Friuli Venezia Giulia) and Slovenia. It has a loud and highly characteristic song, which creates a unique acoustic atmosphere in the very few places where it still exists. The species occurs in coastal reed beds (Fig. 1), where it is only found where the reed vegetation is not too dense and the water not too saline.

Figure 1: Habitat of Zeuneriana marmorata in the Marano Lagoon \u00a9 Francesca Tami 5 The destruction and fragmentation of habitats has led to extinction of most Italian populations of the species, especially in the area of the Venice lagoons (Fig. 2). For several decades, Z. marmorata was presumed to be extinct, until it was rediscovered in a small wetland at Lisert near Monfalcone (Kleukers et al. 1997). The species has meanwhile also been discovered in the marshes south of Ljubljana (Slovenia) as well as in three other coastal wetlands in Friuli Venezia Giulia. Considering the history of land use, it is very likely that Z. marmorata was formerly more widespread in the North Adriatic coastal region of Italy. Currently, it is confined to three small areas of coastal reed beds: Lisert (Monfalcone), the mouth of Isonzo river and the Marano Lagoon. The species faces at least two severe threats. The population in Lisert has dramatically declined as a consequence of industrial development. It is also affected by changes in water level and subsequent encroachment of shrubs and trees. The coastal populations in the Marano Lagoon and at the mouth of Isonzo river are threatened by sea level rise. Subsequently, the species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species (Kleukers et al. 2015). If the remaining habitats in Italy are not immediately preserved, the Adriatic Marbled Bush- Cricket will probably disappear from the area. Therefore, a conservation strategy for the species has been developed in cooperation with the major stakeholders.

It is reported from a few locations in the north-east of Italy and Slovenia. The genus Zeuneriana is found in southern Europe and contains four species: in addition to Z. marmorata, Z. amplipennis is found from Serbia to Romania, Z. abbreviata in southwestern France and northern Spain and Z. burriana in northern Spain. The two eastern species are closely affiliated with wetland habitats. The genetic relationships of the species have not been studied and particularly the status of Z. amplipennis and Z. marmorata needs to be clarified. Biology & Ecology Zeuneriana marmorata is a medium-sized grasshopper (length: \u2642 16-20 mm, \u2640 17-21 mm), with a rather squat shape (Massa et al. 2012). Its basic colour is black or blackish-brown while the tegmina are dark brown in colour and are widely spread, almost reaching the apex of the abdomen in the male, while they are slightly shorter in the female (Figs. 3-4). The male cerci are widened at the base and have a robust curved tooth facing the inner side. The female ovipositor is 8-9 mm long, is slightly upturned and laterally flattened. The nymphs are blackish- brown, with the upper part of the pronotum and the back being of a lighter brown. Figure 3: Z. marmorata male \u00a9 Francesca Tami Figure 4: Z. marmorata female \u00a9 Silvano Candotto 7 The species is very elusive and difficult to observe. The specimens tend to be amongst dense vegetation. Males are easier to find than females as they sometimes climb up the tall stalks from which they sing, dropping or jumping down at the slightest sign of threat. The males emit a powerful song by rubbing the tegmina (forewings) together. This song is audible up to a distance of more than 30 metres. As the males sing during the main season, bioacoustic monitoring of the species is feasible. The species is not able to fly and the impression is that they are not very mobile \u2013 similar to other related taxa, but further research on the mobility of Z. marmorata is needed. The males appear to exhibit territorial behaviour. The species has one generation per year and hibernates during the egg stage like most of European Orthoptera species. The eggs are laid inside the stems of herbaceous plants (Fig. 5). No information on the average number of eggs laid, development length and their micro- climatic requirements exist. In Italy, nymphs of the species (the intermediate instars) were observed on 5 June 2016, so it is assumed that the eggs hatch in May. Adults have been seen or heard from the second half of June onwards (20 June 2014, 24 June 2016). The number of singing males decreases after the end of July; a few single specimens can be found until the beginning of September. Local variation in phenology (and in the peak of highest density) has been observed in the appearance of adults depending on the habitat. In thick reeds the adults appear later than those in areas of more open vegetation and drier areas. In Slovenia, the adult season starts a little later and adults may be found until end of September. The species feeds on leaves of Phragmites australis s.l. and, in the past, adults have been fed in captivity with grasses and forbs. In Slovenia some nymphs were reared in an insectarium and fed with salad (Lactuca sativa), oat flakes or other seeds, raisins and, in small quantities, Figure 5: Eggs of Z. marmorata deposited in the stems of grasses and herbs. \u00a9 Stanislav Gomboc Figure 6: Z. marmorata nymph \u00a9 Francesca Tami 8 dried insects.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f33cf3af-578f-42b0-8c1c-71e056ab80d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f33cf3af-578f-42b0-8c1c-71e056ab80d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Adriatic marbled bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) : a national action plan for Italy 2016-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "87a5fc3dd2405c9958c41bbeac06c07f20bfb63ac9e9c1716ea47232a99343cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "73cc8cde-0548-435d-9da5-502e5aa194fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d757a26b91cbc0ceae2d21b1f08fde02cf1b70c27b240342d30157aa979ca4c5"}}, "hash": "a6c214a8632989482cb3e1a14aff950eb3aa43fd5a558957f4f5213efd4d8ed3", "text": "They also ate leaves of Rubus idaeus, which were placed in the insectarium as canopy.

Two other rare Orthoptera species partly co-occur with Z. marmorata or in similar habitats: Roeseliana brunneri and Chrysochraon dispar giganteus. Function and values The Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket has not received much attention from the public so far. Given the small range of the species, its known locations along the Adriatic coastal region can be seen as a Key Biodiversity Area for this species. The species main ecological role is primary consumer. It is likely to be prey to other arthropods and vertebrates and might possibly also be a predator of small insects. These aspects are however not studied in detail. More important is the role of Z. marmorata as a bioindicator of habitat quality of the marshland as it is very sensitive to changes in habitat quality. It may also have value as a symbol species of threatened wetland habitats. Although it is difficult to observe, it is easily identifiable through its song. Historical account The type locality of the species is not exactly known, because Fieber (1853) described it on the basis of findings of the generic origin \"Illyrien\". Between 1816 and 1849 the Kingdom of Illyria was a State of the Austrian empire with its capital in Ljubljana, which included a very large area, from 1820 incorporating Carinthia, Carniola - part of today\u2019s Slovenia - Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste and Istria, today part of Slovenia and Croatia. Historical sites (specimens collected from the second half of the 1800s up to the 1940s) include the mouth of the Adige, Chioggia (at present in Veneto), Aquileia, Terzo d'Aquileia, Bistrigna - near Monfalcone - and Monfalcone (at present in Friuli Venezia Giulia) (Brunner von Wattenwyl, 1882; Giordani Soika, 1949; Kleukers et al., 1997; Marcuzzi et al., 1971; Fig. 7). Probably the historical range in Italy included the low plain and the coastal zone, at least between the mouth of the Timavo and the mouth of the Adige. 9 Figure 7: Present (green) and extinct (red) sites of Z. marmorata (1. Mouth of Adige River; 2. Chioggia; 3. Aquileia; 4. Terzo d\u2019Aquileia; 5. Monfalcone; 6. Bistrigna; 7. Cormor River \u2013 Muzzanella (Marano Lagoon); 8. Delta of Stella River (Marano Lagoon); 9. Mouth of Isonzo River; 10. Lisert and mouth of Timavo River, 11. Ljubljansko Barje in Slovenia). Causes of the reduction of the historical distribution: Reclamation (mainly between the two world wars and until the 1950s, but at the Lisert site more recently), with major changes in hydrology and the destruction of wetland habitats, which have been converted to cropland. Intensive agriculture has also led to the transformation of wet meadows (potentially suitable for Z. marmorata) to arable land (e.g. in the low Friuli plain). Social changes. A loss of interest in the agricultural use of wetlands has led to the abandonment of residual wet meadows that have subsequently developed into thick reed beds, which are probably less or unsuited to Z. marmorata. At one time the reed beds and wet grasslands were cut for production of litter with reeds also being used to make \u201cgrisiole\" (used with plaster to create false ceilings in homes) and \u201cgrasioi\u201d (long barrages used to fish with creels), and the seedheads of reeds used to make brooms. The fact that the wet meadows were mown is also evidenced by the following place names in the delta of the River Stella: Pr\u00f2 10 dela Cunata and Pr\u00f2 della Cuna Dolse (\u201cPr\u00f2\u201d = meadow).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfabbd0b-4b87-4b45-b2e7-c461b94c1be4": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfabbd0b-4b87-4b45-b2e7-c461b94c1be4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Adriatic marbled bush-cricket (Zeuneriana marmorata) : a national action plan for Italy 2016-2022", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "525b33825e61384414d23640bfa52461ee8c3e3762dd8a7a737946c8ea0a79ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "17b9898d-a94b-4496-870c-ca3da8f3294e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/adriatic-marbled-bush-cricket-zeuneriana-marmorata-national-action-plan", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5146f26e74bc7877e979c11ecab0e82632c7e891fb0b0ee60790bd3108466969"}}, "hash": "4b641dd9c715943ebd726809d87650f3296da8bbbbdcb81ebf4a272258a9d99f", "text": "These wet meadows near the mouth of the River Stella have not been mown for decades.

Current distribution in Italy 1) Lisert and Timavo (Fig. 8) Lisert Springs (Municipality of Monfalcone) The population was discovered in 1996 by Kleukers and Fontana (Kleukers et al. 1997). The site is in the Municipality of Monfalcone, between the State Road, the Moschenizza canal and the Tavoloni canal. It is separated by a gravel track and a railway overpass and the southern part is crossed by a railway siding. In some databases it has been named as \u201cSan Giovanni al Timavo (Trieste)\u201d, as the nearest village is San Giovanni al Timavo (located in another Municipality, Duino Aurisina). The location of Lisert could correspond to the historic one of \u201cMonfalcone\u201d. The area inhabited by Z. marmorata has a vegetation consisting mostly of Juncus sp. and Phragmites australis s.l. and undergoes occasional flooding. The wet meadow and reed bed area is surrounded by scrubland. The species is not evenly distributed in the area. Most of the population is found in the eastern part of the site (Fig. 9). 11 Figure 8: Situation of the two locations with Z. marmorata near Monfalcone (Lisert springs and mouth of Timavo). Figure 9: Main occupied habitats of Z. marmorata in the Lisert area. Map Yannick Fanin. 12 Z. marmorata was found in the following habitats: - Wet (from brackish to freshwater) grassland (Schoenus nigricans or Juncus maritimus) with Phragmites australis proliferations. Phragmites from sparse to almost thick patches. Areas rarely flooded in summer. The grassland located east of the viaduct is apparently more suitable for the species area. In this area there is a high density of Z. marmorata, but this decreases in areas with scrub and in the northern, drier portion. Phragmites australis under 1.8 m in height. - Phragmites australis reed beds with clearings of the wet grassland of Schoenus nigricans or Juncus maritimus. The species is present in reeds to the north-west of the railway bridge. The stems are up to 2-2.5 m high and there is a good density of Z. marmorata which decreases in the vicinity of the areas occupied by shrubs and trees. This area is rapidly undergoing scrub encroachment. In the reed beds on the central and western part of the site the species is present but does not appear evenly distributed. It is possible that some areas are flooded for a very long periods and are thus not suitable for Z. marmorata. - Reed beds of Cladium mariscus (great fen-sedge) with Phragmites australis, regularly freshwater flooded habitat at the springs \u201cLe Fontanelle.\u201d The site was not visited, but several males were heard singing from the opposite bank. - Meadows (with Phragmites proliferations) on artificial embankments. The grassland along the banks of the Tavoloni and Moschenizza Canals. The outer part of the embankment hosts wet meadows. Several specimens of Z. marmorata were identified among the reeds along the bank of Tavoloni Canals whilst along the Moschenizza only isolated individuals were heard.

In August 2016 the species was found in reed beds along the left bank of Isonzo too (near Punta Spigolo, Staranzano) (Fanin et al. 2016). Here the species lives both in reed beds and wet meadows with a prevalence of Phragmites australis and / or Juncus sp. The area is also periodically submerged by brackish water too. On the right bank the most suitable habitat for Z. marmorata appears to be the grassland located immediately south of the Isonzo River, where Juncus sp. forms a thick layer close to the ground and is accompanied by Phragmites, generally less than 2 m in height. Z. marmorata seems rare or absent in the rush bed with sparse growth of Phragmites 1-1.5 metres in height, 14 perhaps as a result of higher salinity. The species also lives along the edge of thick reed beds, along paths, and in areas in which Phragmites is decidedly dominant. On the left side the density of the species appears very high in reedbeds (with or without Juncus gerardi on the ground). It is not easy to establish precisely the area occupied by the species, because it is difficult to walk in the reeds as a result of the presence of flooded areas. Figure 11: Situation of the location with Z. marmorata at the mouth of Isonzo River (Lisert springs and mouth of Timavo). A list of habitat of Z. marmorata at the mouth of the Isonzo: - Flooded to dry (depending upon the tides), open brackish reed beds of Phragmites australis with organic litter on the ground (common reed stalks, driftwood, etc.) - Open brackish reed beds with or without wet carpets of Juncus gerardi on the ground - Brackish rush vegetation (Juncus acutus or J. maritimi) with sparse Phragmites australis canes - Edge of thick Phragmites reed beds along rivermouth banks 15 Figure 12: Occupied habitats of Z. marmorata at the mouth of Isonzo river. Map Yannick Fanin. 3) Lagoon of Marano (Fig. 13) In July 2016, the species was found in two areas of the Lagoon of Marano (Fanin et al. 2016). Three major subpopulations were found together with isolated singing males. The density of the species in this area (at least at the sites so far identified) is apparently lower than that observed at the mouth of the Isonzo and Lisert. The sites of the Lagoon of Marano can only be reached by boat, and at some of these it is not possible to land and / or is very difficult to walk, because of the presence of flooded areas and the at times very dense vegetation. Cormor-Muzzanella (Municipality of Marano Lagunare) The first area is located along the Cormor River, on the islet at the confluence of the Cormor and the Muzzanella. On the main site, located along the Rio Muzzanella, the vegetation consists mostly of Carex sp. and Phragmites australis. It was not possible to land at this site but at least ten males were heard singing. A group of a few single males (4 individuals) was found in another location (Bassut) on the same island, along paths near a hunting seat. The vegetation consists mainly of Carex sp. and reeds. 16 Figure 13: Situation of the locations with Z. marmorata in the Lagoon of Marano (1. Rio Muzzanella, 2.

However, it does not inhabit areas flooded for long periods (at least during the growing season). It is not tied to a particular type of plant association, but probably to certain microclimatic conditions (temperature, humidity) and vegetation structure. It tolerates at least mild salinity (at the mouths of the Timavo, Isonzo and Stella rivers). For this species the following quote fits very well: \u201cmany threatened species now exist in the most marginal parts of their former range, because humans have usurped the best areas; in effect, they are living in what could be termed the best of the worst areas\u201d (IUCN, 2008). For example, one hypothesis is that areas with low salinity were originally marginal in the species distribution as they are not optimal for the species but are now very important for the conservation of Z. marmorata, because half of the sites where it is still present, are at least partly flooded by sea or lagoon waters. The formerly suitable habitat in the plains has largely been transformed into non-suitable habitats, such as cropland. Threat analysis Direct threats Industrialization and infrastructural development. Large parts of the habitats in Lisert have been destroyed as a consequence of conversion of wetlands into industrial areas. This process might continue and threaten the remaining habitat of the species. Intensive agricultural land use. In the past, many wetlands in the region have been converted into cropland. While the process of habitat conversion has stopped, only a small part of original areas of wetlands remains. 18 Encroachment of shrubs and trees. The construction of dykes and embankments as well as drainage and abandonment have degraded the habitat quality in the Lisert area. The process of succession is now a problem and bushes have become abundant in large parts of the habitat (with only the eastern part of the grassland being cut occasionally, Fig. 14). In other sites (Isonzo), the reeds might naturally evolve towards more mature stages that are possibly less favourable for Z. marmorata. However, this process is currently little understood. Previous hydrological changes affect the water level and therefore have had and continue to have an effect on the vegetation at the site of the Lisert Springs (see above). Grazing. At the Isonzo mouth some habitats are currently grazed by horses. The grazed area is probably less or not suitable for Z. marmorata, but the effects of grazing have so far not been studied in detail. Habitat fragmentation. Z. marmorata populations occupy small areas and are isolated. As the species is highly sedentary, it is unlikely to be able to colonize new or existing habitats on its own. It might be possible that specimens and stems of reeds carrying eggs may be transported by water, but this has not yet been studied. At the \u201cLisert Springs\u201d site, habitat fragmentation has been aggravated by heavy changes to the hydrology (the implementation Tavoloni and Moschenizza canals and the backfilling of part of the natural water bodies) together with the construction of the railway viaduct and the paper-mill railway sidings. Pesticides. Pesticides represented a major threat in the past. The current use of pesticides in the area and its effects on the species are not known. One threat could be, for example, the use of herbicides along the Tavoloni and Moschenizza canal area of the Lisert Springs (currently flailing is performed).

Climate change - increase in sea levels. An increase in episodes of high water and flooding in the medium/long term could lead to an increase in salinity in some areas located at the mouth of the Isonzo and the Marano Lagoon, and could render the sites less suited to Z. marmorata which only tolerates slight salinity. Figure 14: Encroachment of shrubs and trees in the Lisert Springs site \u00a9 Francesca Tami Conservation & Management Z. marmorata has been assessed as Endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (Kleukers et al. 2015). The species is protected by the Autonomous Region Friuli Venezia Giulia Regulation (DPReg March 20, 2009 n. 074 / Pres.), which prohibits its capture. There are no ongoing specific actions to preserve this species. Some environmental groups have called for the establishment of a regional biotope (a strictly protected area) on the \u201cSorgenti del Lisert\u201d (\u201cLisert Springs\u201d) site (Municipality of Monfalcone), which is home to one of the populations of this species, but the process for the establishment has not been completed. 20 The site of the Lisert Springs is not subject to any form of protection. The other sites fall within protected areas with the island at the mouth of the Timavo located within the Natura2000 network, in the SPA (Special Protection Area) \u201cKarst areas of Venezia Giulia\u201d. The area at the mouth of the Isonzo enjoys more forms of protection, since it is included within the Regional Natural Reserve of the mouth of the Isonzo River and the SPA and SCA (Special Conservation Area) \u201cIsonzo Rivermouth - Isola della Cona\u201d. The populations of the Lagoon of Marano are located within the SPA and SCA \u201cLagoon of Marano and Grado\u201d while those along the Stella River are also within the River Stella nature reserve. Agricultural use: Part of the Lisert Springs site has been mown in recent years while the meadows along the banks are cut every year. In the past, clearings were mown (not every year) for hunting common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), both in Lisert and in the Lagoon of Marano. In the Isonzo Reserve, between Isola della Cona and Punta Spigolo, meadow habitats are managed through grazing of Camargue horses and, in the recent past, cattle. In the remaining part of the reserve the habitat is left to natural succession. Horses probably rarely graze in the area where Z. marmorata lives. In Stella reserve the habitat is left to natural succession; only in some areas are reeds cut and used in the construction (roofs and walls) of \u201ccasoni\u201d, typical fishermen\u2019s huts. 21 CONSERVATION STRATEGY PLANNING Methodology Guidelines To develop the conservation strategy for the Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket in Slovenia, the handbook of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (IUCN SSC 2008), strategies from other species and advice from experts were used. Definitions of Vision, Goals, Objectives and Actions were strictly adopted from the IUCN SSC handbook. The way they interact through the conservation strategy planning is shown in Fig. 15. Figure 15: Conservation strategy planning. Adapted from IUCN SSC (2008). As defined in the handbook, actions must be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-bound. Targets were included in actions and goals. Workshop To develop a conservation strategy for the Italian populations of the Adriatic Marbled Bush-cricket, the approach of the IUCN Species Survival Commission was used. This requires a review of the species\u2019 status and the threats it faces, and development of a Vision for the future, Goals, Objectives and Actions.

The vision, goals, objectives and actions were discussed and modified by stakeholders and a field trip to the habitat at the Isonzo river mouth took place. The workshop programme is given in Appendix I. 23 Vision The Italian North Adriatic coastal area will maintain a well-connected network of open wetland habitats, including reeds, marshes and wet meadows, that will be under sustainable conservation management, sustaining large viable populations of Zeuneriana marmorata and other associated threatened wetland species. The vision was carefully worded to reflect the following points: (i) \u201cwell connected network of open wetland habitats\u201d: The current area of remaining wetland habitats is rather small and needs to be increased and better connected. (ii) \u201cincluding reeds, marshes and wet meadows\u201d: Particularly open wetland habitats have become scarce in the Region. Encroachment of bushes and trees is a threat to many wetland species. (iii) \u201csustainable conservation management\u201d: Conservation management has just started in many parts of the Region and no management plans exist so far for many protected areas. (iv) \u201csustain large viable populations of Zeuneriana marmorata\u201d: Habitat management needs to focus on increasing the population of Z. marmorata as the remaining populations are probably too small to be viable. (v) \u201cother associated threatened wetland species\u201d: Conservation management needs to be applied in a multi-species context, considering many threatened species of which Zeuneriana marmorata is one important flagship.
