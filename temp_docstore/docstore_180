est spread of forests, on which local communities depend for timber, non-timber forest products, as well as cash crops and employment (FAO, 2010). Gender equality took a step forward with the forward-looking Tanzanian Constitution and Bill of Rights, the Tanzania Vision 2025 that aims to do away with gender and race imbalances, and the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty-MKUKUTA that points to gender bias in land ownership. But in practice, these goals have fallen short (Mascarenhas, 2007; United Republic of Tanzania, 1999; United Republic of Tanzania, 2005). In the area of land tenure, one of the major challenges is the disconnect between constitutional and customary laws\u2014even when there is a legal basis for gender equality in ownership of and access to land, customary and traditional laws at the local level have been found to perpetuate gender inequalities in practice. Certain sectors in Tanzania under the climate change umbrella, including \ufb01sheries and land as outlined below, are particularly gender blind. (van Ingen, et al., 2002). And despite its foresight in recognizing the gender aspects of development policy, the country\u2019s Initial National Communication and NAPA submitted to the UNFCCC did not incorporate gender considerations. Tanzania\u2019s National Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender in Climate Change is the result of collaboration between the IUCN Global Gender Of\ufb01ce, the IUCN Of\ufb01ce for Eastern and Southern Africa (ESARO) and its national country of\ufb01ce in Tanzania, the Vice President\u2019s Of\ufb01ce in Tanzania, and other key national institutions in Tanzania.

Worldwide, over 500 million people depend on \ufb01sheries and aquaculture for their livelihoods (World Bank, et al., 2009). Tanzania\u2019s sprawling coastline is a major contributor to the national economy, industry, and urban centres, and economic opportunity is closely entangled with the biodiversity of the coastal ecosystem (USAID, 2010a). Coral bleaching linked to the changing climate pattern of El Ni\u00f1o caused a 30 per cent loss of corals and \ufb01nancial losses of US$ 12-18 million in Mombasa, Kenya and Zanzibar, Tanzania. Mangroves and coral reefs, which are the primary coastal ecosystems in Africa, are also impacted by changing weather patterns, with endangered species such as manatees, marine turtles, and migratory birds at risk. Sea level rise of 0.5 meters along Tanzania\u2019s coastline would inundate 247 square kilometres of the country (IPCC, 2007). Climate change impacts are expected to intensify and affect Tanzanian \ufb01shers, coastal residents, resource users, recreation, infrastructure, and tourism development (USAID, 2010a).

On the islands of Jibondo and Juani, 90 per cent of octopus \ufb01shing is in the hands of women. Many of the roles played by women are time consuming and labor intensive. For example, women in coastal villages dominate in seaweed farming, which involves multiple steps including production, weeding, harvesting, drying, and marketing seaweed products (Chando, 2002). Nevertheless, income from these activities has meant improved livelihoods for women and their families.

Women\u2019s traditional role in collecting octopuses or lobsters has been intruded upon by men employing more ef\ufb01cient but destructive techniques (Bryceson, et al. (2007). And women in \ufb01sh processing companies along Tanzania\u2019s coast, who sometimes make up the majority of the factory workforce, are less likely to share in the same permanent employment, leadership positions, or wage levels as men (Chando, 2002). Through the ccGAP, Tanzania\u2019s leadership in Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) could be expanded to incorporate a gender perspective. The Arusha Process established a regional strategy for coastal management, and the country\u2019s national communications to the UNFCCC include ICZM approaches (Michel & Pandaya, 2010; USAID, 2010a). Tanzania\u2019s national integrated coastal management strategy signals the need to provide meaningful opportunities for stakeholder involvement, and conserve critical areas of high biodiversity while ensuring that coastal people continue to bene\ufb01t from the sustainable use of resources (Coastal Resources Center). But these principles, which were \ufb01rst enshrined in 1992 as part of Agenda 21, have not considered women\u2019s and men\u2019s different roles in practice. Coastal managers often do not understand the relationship between gender and coastal issues or how to design coastal programs accordingly (Diamond, 2001). Building on the experiences above, Tanzania\u2019s ccGAP includes targeted actions in the coastal sector, a sample of which is outlined on the following page. 2012 | 45 OBJECTIVES ACTION STEPS INDICATORS Develop gender- responsive programs/ projects addressing climate change adaptation in coasts \ufffd\ufffd Promote preparation and implementation of gender-responsive action plans related to climate change in all districts along the coast. \ufffd\ufffd Implement projects/programs that address climate change adaptation in coastal zones (restoration of coastal forests and coral reefs, sand dune restoration, sea walls, revetments, headlands, and beach nourishment). \ufffd\ufffd Enhance and encourage women\u2019s participation in ICZM projects. \ufffd\ufffd Train and involve women so that they can participate in research studies (i.e. monitoring and data gathering methods; gathering of \ufb02ora and fauna species; physical-chemical analysis; studies about the populations of birds, \ufb01sh, sea grasses, mammals; and studies about the medicinal properties of coral). \ufffd\ufffd Establish a network of women\u2019s organizations engaged in protection, management, and development of coastal and marine areas. \ufffd\ufffd Support and develop women\u2019s organizations\u2019 capacity so that they can be in charge of monitoring coastal and coral erosion, sea level and tide, light detection, and ranging, amongst others. \ufffd\ufffd Number of action plans that are gender-responsive \ufffd\ufffd Number of gender-related projects implemented \ufffd\ufffd Number of women participating in climate change adaption projects \ufffd\ufffd Women and men trained on the sustainable use of coastal resources \ufffd\ufffd Women and men who receive bene\ufb01ts from the project (productive bene\ufb01ts, training, or credit) \ufffd\ufffd Women and men participate actively in the conservation of marine-coastal resources Sample Actions From Tanzania ccGAP in the Coastal Sector Women farmers Equal access to land is another area of policy-practice disconnect. About 80 per cent of the country\u2019s population depends on access to land for their livelihoods. Women are the majority of those that work the land, but only 13.2 per cent of female- headed households, versus 86.7 per cent of male-headed households, receive credit to buy land (TGNP, 2010). This lack of secure land tenure means that women do not always have access to important resources. Women \ufb01nd themselves with one foot in a reformed Tanzania and another rooted in traditional law at the village level. Under traditional law, women could only use clan land, but not own it, in order to prevent land being lost to a woman\u2019s marriage outside the clan. The Tanzanian government partnered with NGOs to end these practices through new legislation. The Village Land Act, which came into force in 2001, enshrines the equal rights of women and men in acquiring and using land and calls for women to participate in decision making about land through equitable representation in the village land council.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d67fd52d-cc2c-4916-8a34-0e42b1f4f52e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d67fd52d-cc2c-4916-8a34-0e42b1f4f52e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be6954df9aa0868383301ad0b0467fd148b80f4a53f1df142cdbfc0a777d4c4b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0cef7bf-8a00-4072-91ce-1c4dea58846f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21f7aaa1fc8fd2707c20c3679470b80efe837031ce084f7d97d84dbc8345167a"}}, "hash": "28a142266d8258ce9eb37ac385b7b8d0e84f3ff6f2eaf381dcbdcf9bed5c2bca", "text": "The Land Act of 2002 further established land tribunals with at least 43 per cent representation by women and also stipulated that customs and practices that contradict gender equality are null and void.

Subsequently, women face particular hardships due to taking on more duties following male migration, reduced crop production, and the growing prevalence of epidemic diseases.

Alongside this positive outcome, the Mozambique strategy process was convened separately from the country\u2019s national climate change planning and of\ufb01cial communications to the UNFCCC. The result was a stand-alone document that now needs to be integrated into the country\u2019s climate change processes. This experience led IUCN to ensure that future national strategies in other countries would be as integrated with the government\u2019s other priorities. The Mozambique strategy has undergone a national legalization process; it was submitted for comment at provincial level, followed by its presentation to the National Council for Sustainable Development, where it was assessed positively. It was later adopted and endorsed by the Council of Ministers, and was recognized as a catalyst for the inclusion of a gender perspective in the development of the country\u2019s Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SCPR) under the Climate Investment Funds. The strategy, with its plan of action, sets out priorities that are in harmony with other major national environmental actions. In the rollout plan for implementing the strategy, the Ministry for the Coordination of Environmental Affairs has the objective of reaching around 1.5 million communities in a \ufb01ve-year period (2010-2014) and covering the entire country by 2025.

After the Copenhagen Conference, the Arab Women Organization was invited to get involved in the preparation of an Action Plan for Gender and Climate Change. The training on gender and climate change and the experiences I gained while being involved in preparing a gender and climate change strategy have given civil society and the women\u2019s movement a rare opportunity to learn and leave footprints in Jordanian policies and strategies. The Arab Women Organization received reports from two women activists who were trained with the GGCA Training Manual, who insisted on introducing the gender and climate change perspective while discussing risk management at a Jordanian Red Crescent Conference and while discussing sustainable agriculture in the Ministry of Agriculture. The multi-stakeholder workshop in Jordan is one of the best examples of how the theme of gender can bring together various government and non-government stakeholders on climate change around the same table for the \ufb01rst time. In its capacity as representative of the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment, Jordan was also one of the \ufb01rst countries to participate regularly in orientation sessions on gender and climate change for UNFCCC delegates organized by IUCN and GGCA. In Jordan, the ccGAP included the priority areas of water, energy, agriculture and food security, and waste reduction and management, as outlined on the following page.

The second National Communication to the UNFCCC therefore also identi\ufb01es water as a key priority area. An increase in water scarcity leads to insuf\ufb01cient domestic water supplies, having serious implications for equity of access and the quality of potable water. Changes in rainfall patterns due to climate change have pushed usually rain-fed areas toward irrigated agriculture, mounting the demands for water. Limited water for agricultural activities has led to an increased usage of treated wastewater for food production, which puts consumers at risk for water-borne diseases. Rangeland and livestock are also vulnerable to water scarcity. The United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2008-2012 identi\ufb01ed four key challenges related to water resources that could constrain progress toward the Millennium Development Goals within Jordan: 1. Water scarcity; 2. The supply, security and quality of drinking water; 3. Health, agriculture and food production vulnerability to climate change; and 4. Vulnerability of local biodiversity to climate change. And in the shadow of water scarcity in the region, political instability persistently looms. The Jordan River supplies the country with 75 per cent of its water supply. The river is also a primary water source for Israel, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestinians. Climate change and overuse is shrinking the river as well as the Dead Sea, and increasing the potential of con\ufb02icts in an already politically volatile region. The gender implications of water scarcity in Jordan are acutely evident. Women are the primary custodians of water in households, whether in urban or rural areas. They perform a variety of key roles\u2014for example, managing and rationing household water use, adapting to new water-saving techniques, and promoting sanitation. But women are often excluded from decision making and critical information that would empower their families and communities. During \ufb01eld visits ahead of the development of the ccGAP, women farmers who were experiencing hardship from drought indicated that they thought it would be temporary. If they had information about the impacts of climate change, women who are already playing a variety of roles from the household to farmers could take preventative action that would protect their own resources and also allay the country\u2019s water scarcity. Building on the experiences above, Jordan\u2019s ccGAP includes targeted actions in the water sector, a sample of which is outlined below: Sample Actions From Jordan ccGAP in the Water Sector OBJECTIVES ACTION STEPS INDICATORS Ensure that climate change and gender are integrated in water policies and strategies and that adaptation measures are proposed Revision of national legislation related to water to ensure than gender and climate change considerations are fully integrated. National policies include climate change and gender considerations 2012 | 57 ARAB STATES JORDAN A sample of actions in Jordan\u2019s ccGAP from other priority sectors is included below. Sample Actions From Jordan ccGAP in Other Sectors PRIORITY AREA ACTIONS Energy Encourage families to increase energy ef\ufb01ciency through enforcement of construction codes Agriculture and food security Promote women\u2019s participation in small-scale enterprises and food processing transformation industries Waste reduction and management Conduct \u201ctrain the trainers\u201d sessions for community centre representatives, teachers at schools, and imams and priests at mosques and churches Jordan\u2019s ccGAP is already making headway, and it is one of the most progressed ccGAPs to date. The Royal Household endorsed the ccGAP in 2011, giving it the appropriate weight in a country where the monarchy yields tremendous in\ufb02uence with the government and the Jordanian people. The Global Environment Facility has shown strong interest in the implementation of the ccGAP. In 2012 as part of the enabling activities for the preparation of Jordan\u2019s third National Communication to the UNFCCC, gender was expressed as a national priority in the context of climate change. This National Communication outlines the need for a comprehensive analysis of the socioeconomic and health impacts of climate change and for mainstreaming gender in the targeted sensitive areas of the country. In early 2011, the Jordanian National Commission for Women launched a national dialogue campaign on the status of women in the governorates of Aqaba, Karak, Ajloun and Irbid, and Madaba and Mafraq, which set priorities for rural and other women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c33f380-3c3d-4b1a-92a0-db130989b6e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c33f380-3c3d-4b1a-92a0-db130989b6e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f460d0b689afa0228d11882ec73d7385b86ade8a4e4aa15f08331fa1e524271"}, "2": {"node_id": "10285790-1f5d-4a07-ab11-7f2a9550a705", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de98c75dc75e8f8fa1c18ebc55bfe8bfe021a72eadd51f32bc8c2e647cdea02c"}}, "hash": "c7913f263349fc01e85529b9353e8968a68535788c8bb8c1dbf8db1e5edfc4ea", "text": "Following the development of Jordan\u2019s ccGAP, the Commission also included environment and climate change in the National Women\u2019s Strategy 2012-2015, as part of the theme of human security and social protection.

Hence, empowering both men and women, especially women, to increase their resilience to climate change is imperative. The goal is to switch their status from being victims to becoming main players and ultimately becoming development activators by all means. Therefore, CEDARE has joined hands with Ministry of Environment in Egypt, with the support of IUCN\u2019s Regional Of\ufb01ce for West Asia in developing a strategy that mainstreams gender into climate change resilience measures in Egypt.\u201d Amr Abdel-Meguid, Senior Regional Water Resource Specialist, Center for Environment and Development for the Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE) ARAB STATES EGYPT E gypt\u2019s latest national communications to the UNFCCC note that the most vulnerable sectors in the country to climate change are the coastal zone, agriculture, and water resources. Climate change is a serious concern for the dense population, extensive infrastructure, and farmlands that make up the Nile Delta. The annual \ufb02ooding that characterizes the Nile River is expected to \ufb02uctuate, and high temperatures will in\ufb02uence agricultural productivity, as will water stress and soil salinity (Handoussa, 2010). Alongside these environmental changes, urbanization is on the rise\u2014at an annual rate of four per cent over the past 40 years. In the country\u2019s largest city and capital, Cairo, the population more than tripled between 1947 and 1986, which gave rise to a larger informal sector economy. Nationwide, 60 per cent of Egypt\u2019s economy is within the informal sector and more than a third of the population lives in slums, where shelter and access to water and sanitation are inadequate (CAPMAS, 2011). 60 | the art of implementation The National Strategy for Mainstreaming Gender in Climate Change in Egypt, under the umbrella of the country\u2019s third National Communication to the UNFCCC, is the result of collaboration between the IUCN Global Gender Of\ufb01ce, the IUCN Regional Of\ufb01ce for West Asia (ROWA), CEDARE, and other key national institutions in Egypt. The IUCN Global Gender Of\ufb01ce originally planned to launch the national process at a time when a wave of protests, now called the Arab Spring, was emerging across Egypt and many countries in the Arab world. Following the rescheduling of the process, and now with the ccGAP in hand, the Egyptian revolution and the swearing in of the country\u2019s \ufb01rst democratically elected president present a remarkable context in which to mainstream gender in Egypt\u2019s climate change planning. In Egypt, the ccGAP included the priority areas of integrated coastal management, agriculture, water, tourism, health, energy and transport, urbanization, and waste management, as outlined below. Overview of Egypt ccGAP Overall Objective: To mainstream gender considerations into national climate change initiatives and policies, so that both men and women have equal opportunity to understand, participate in, and decide effective measures to implement mitigation and adaptation activities and henceforth bene\ufb01t from various climate change programs and funds, contributing to the national economic, environmental, and social sustainability.

Energy and transport In Egypt, rapidly rising levels of energy consumption have accompanied economic growth. During 2008-2009, energy subsidies were higher than the country\u2019s entire \ufb01scal allocation to education and health services. Petroleum products and natural gas are both the main reasons for greenhouse gas emissions in Egypt and the main sources of the country\u2019s energy supply. While natural gas is slowly replacing crude oil, due to the discovery of natural gas reserves, oil and gas make up over 90 per cent of Egypt\u2019s energy sources. In recent years, the Egyptian government pledged to produce 20 per cent of generated electricity from renewable sources by 2020 and adopted speci\ufb01c targets for reducing energy consumption. Energy ef\ufb01ciency and renewable energy sources, including hydropower, solar energy, and biomass, are expected to play a critical role in achieving energy security. However, the market has been slow to offer these options, partly due to the lack of information among households of the bene\ufb01ts. Indeed, energy consumption is tied to household economic status. The richest quintile of the country accounts for a disproportionately large share of the energy subsidy, while the poorest two quintiles account for only a tiny fraction.

While many countries have yet to incorporate a gender perspective in their energy planning, one way to do so is to address the kinds of energy needs where women predominate, for instance small-scale and informal agricultural activities. Mainstreaming gender into energy policies can include building women\u2019s capacities in technical and business skills that will allow them to operate and market energy equipment. Women\u2019s access to \ufb01nancing and credit is also critical to spurring entrepreneurial innovations (Cecelski & Dutta, 2011).

The strategy includes improved public transportation, improved energy ef\ufb01ciency, fuel switching, the development and use of new propulsion technologies, the development of rail transport and new methods for freight transport, the development of power train technologies, a shift from diesel to electri\ufb01ed railways, and the development and use of fuel-cells technology (EEAA, 2010; Handoussa, 2010). In the area of transportation, women\u2019s and men\u2019s needs and roles are also distinct in relation to private transportation, commuting patterns, and family responsibilities. Transport poverty is widespread in Egypt among low-income families, restricting access to employment, social networks, health and education services, and recreation. Traf\ufb01c pollution and poor air quality are the side effects of vehicles that are not environmentally friendly or well maintained. This has a particular impact on maternal health and the health of elderly people. In the context of overcrowding on public transportation, passenger safety is an issue, particularly when women are vulnerable to harassment and sexual abuse (Hamilton, 2001). Empowering women in the context of energy and transportation in Egypt could start with building technical capacity for their involvement in new economic activities, including how to sell energy services and energy technologies. Women are often in need of incentives and other \ufb01nancial supports to launch entrepreneurial efforts. On the national scale, gender- disaggregated data on energy needs, consumption patterns, and transport use would enhance the targeting of energy planning and expansion of sustainable transportation systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8346b9d-0e5e-491f-81b6-d811e7cfcaef": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8346b9d-0e5e-491f-81b6-d811e7cfcaef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "942a2d717dedff553c6181f30dbffc338dc62bf18b0ed2028eb19ddad3b33dc0"}, "2": {"node_id": "c59ce73b-bb26-4495-932e-3656e2955b89", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "629ba7083ad6687b3a82362e574610f8a3d5bcb09467f9e889c012e8b93d2fc3"}}, "hash": "6a7eb23aba57c614e94318eb09c7eb78fb467423784569585d10cc0bf39bf600", "text": "Building on the experiences above, Egypt\u2019s ccGAP includes targeted actions in the energy and transport sectors, a sample of which are outlined below.

Coconut is the basis for over 100 Gar\u00edfuna dishes, in addition to being used for roofs, crafts, and confections. Thus the loss of coconut groves from extreme weather events has an impact on food security and the economy that is sustained by the work of Gar\u00edfuna women. In the past, Gar\u00edfuna women fed their children coconut milk, but now young people\u2019s nutrition has been affected and new diseases have emerged (RUTA, et al., 2010c).

When we envision the future, it de\ufb01nitely will affect our children because we do not plant anything. People prefer to support the drug trade rather than farming and we want other types of food.

The mangrove stands are being used to process sewage, even though there are settlements of people that rely on water from the well. In the Gar\u00edfuna communities, it is women who travel into the hills. It is rare that women plant, because it is easier to go to the market to sell sliced coconut and crab.

From local to regional to global With the stories and recommendations of these women in hand, regional gender experts and women from the communities formed a technical committee to approach SICA, the institution responsible for developing the regional climate change strategy, with a formal proposal. IUCN was invited into the regional process and provided capacity building to enhance the regional technical committee\u2019s impact at the regional and global levels. The preliminary review of the draft climate change strategy identi\ufb01ed a tremendous gap in addressing women\u2019s concerns. However, this bottom-up collaboration through the political channels, along with the provision of gender technical expertise, led to a landmark climate change strategy that successfully responds to the needs of a key population in the region. As noted by Vivienne Solis Rivera, of CoopeSoliDar R.L. and IUCN\u2019s Commission on Environmental, Economic, and Social Policy, \u201cThere was no possibility of failure once people heard the voices of these women, who were so clear and strong and real that the political process had no choice but to respond.\u201d (V Solis Rivera, pers. comm., 9 July). Among the main principles of the \ufb01nal strategy are the crosscutting nature of gender equity and equality; coherence between governmental policies on gender equality; and recognition of the region\u2019s most vulnerable populations, such as rural and urban women (see above). The strategy incorporates numerous actions to raise the bar for women through all sectors, from analysing the gender dimension of food security, to valuing the ancestral practices of indigenous women, to reducing emissions through gender-sensitive forestry approaches. The strategy was upheld at a meeting with the Network of Women Ministers, approved and legalized by the Council of Ministers of the Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD). It created such political pressure that it led to the incorporation of gender as a mandate in the Heads of State declaration in relation to the climate change strategy for the region in July 2010. Central American negotiators then carried this message of gender equality in climate change decision making to Cancun, where gender policies made signi\ufb01cant strides in the outcome of the 2010 global climate change negotiations.

have a great support. We now have a \ufb02ag to hold up and say, this gender approach is in the strategy and so must be done.\u201d (A L Moreno 2012, pers. comm., 20 March). SICA\u2019s efforts to secure global recognition for the region\u2019s vulnerability to climate change impacts may have opened a door for the acknowledgement of women\u2019s particular vulnerability. The success of the strategy is also attributed to the fact that the Central American governments and women\u2019s movement and other non-governmental institutions joined hands and collaborated on the drafting of the strategy. This may be a lesson for the national climate change strategies in individual Central American countries, where IUCN has provided support in the past for establishing gender units and processes in environment ministries (Aguilar, 2002). Sample Actions From Central America Regional Strategy Besides giving voice to a population that is not usually at the forefront of decision making on climate change matters, women from affected communities were empowered to build their knowledge and had the opportunity to network with people facing the same challenges in other communities and countries. While the regional and global political processes are valuable, it is equally important to \ufb01nd ways to implement the strategy in speci\ufb01c locales and validate any actions with the communities that shared their experiences at the outset. At the community level, the linkages between gender and climate change are the most concrete, and speci\ufb01c actions to address gender equality more easily take shape.

As in many countries, climate change measures must transcend environment ministries and be embedded in multiple sectors in order to gain traction. Moreover, resources\u2014for any actions to be implemented, and to strengthen the Central American women\u2019s movement\u2014are critical for the strategy to take hold. PRIORITY AREA ACTIONS Extreme climate and risk management Conduct studies on vulnerability and risk to climate disasters in urban and rural areas by sector while considering gender, indigenous peoples, and communities of African descent. Implement measures to prevent risk at the appropriate level. Agriculture and food security Develop a regional fund for women so they can access productive economic resources and capital (land, capital, forests, technology, training and education). Forest ecosystems and biodiversity Include a gender perspective in national standards and guidelines in order to assure that women have access to and control over bene\ufb01ts provided by economic and \ufb01nancial incentives. Public health Review existing policies and adjust them to increase access of vulnerable populations to health services, with emphasis on indigenous communities, women, senior citizens, and people living in poverty. Coastal and marine resources Strengthen early warning systems for \ufb01shing communities and populations living in coastal areas and offer speci\ufb01c training to women and young adults in the area. Mitigation Design projects with a focus on gender to reduce emissions through savings in \ufb01rewood in homes and small and medium enterprises where \ufb01rewood is the main source of energy, and reduce risk for respiratory and ocular diseases in women and children. Institutional capacity building Joint programs on innovation and technological development for adaptation, including best practices in ancestral knowledge applied with a focus on gender and diversity. 2012 | 77 Panama \u201c We believe it was very positive to include Panama\u2019s national gender institution and grassroots women\u2019s organizations along with the country\u2019s environmental governing body in the consultation process to develop climate change policy. Mainstreaming gender into plans and programs is essential in environmental management. Climate change impacts affect women and men differently, particularly in natural disasters where women are more vulnerable. In this respect, we must ensure that the models and policies of development and integration prevent inequality, ensure respect for human rights, and recognize the contribution of women and men to the management of natural resources, environment and food production.\u201d Markelda M. de Herrera, Director, National Women\u2019s Institute of Panama LATIN AMERICA PANAMA I n April of 2007, Panama\u2019s President and Minister of Economy and Finance signed the country\u2019s National Climate Change Policy, which includes among its key principles the importance of the \u201cpromotion of the conscious participation of the citizenship, including gender equality.\u201d Panama is in the process of reviewing its National Environmental Policy, which will initiate the development of the National Climate Change Strategy. 78 | the art of implementation In 2011, the Climate Change Unit of Panama\u2019s National Environmental Authority requested the assistance of the IUCN Global Gender Of\ufb01ce to engage in the integration of a gender perspective in the country\u2019s National Climate Change Strategy. A national workshop was organized along two streams: under the umbrella of mitigation (energy, land use, and land use change) and under the umbrella of adaptation (agriculture and water resources). The multi-stakeholder workshop produced innovative actions in these sectors to be considered for incorporation in the national strategy. The workshop and resulting action steps were organized in partnership with RUTA and CoopeSoliDar and followed a process similar to that at the regional level sponsored by the Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD) of the Central American Integration System (SICA), as well as consultation workshops with women in various Central American countries. In Panama, the ccGAP included the priority areas of land use and land use change, energy, water resource management, and agriculture and food security, as outlined below.

Drawing on Panama\u2019s priority sectors, the following section focuses on land use change to illustrate some of the challenges and solutions within the context of gender and climate change. Land use change Panama\u2019s \ufb01rst National Communication to the UNFCCC pointed to land use change and forestry as responsible for over 58 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions, with conversion of forests and soil emissions among the culprits. While deforestation rates vary across the various provinces of Panama, generally the highest rates of deforestation occur adjacent to the poorest communities, due to small-scale agriculture and livestock production. Panama\u2019s deforestation rate has been recorded as 1.12 per cent during 1992-2000 and 0.4 per cent during 2000-2008, with losses of 41,325 hectares and 13,420 hectares respectively. A re-establishment of secondary forests occurred simultaneously during the \ufb01rst period, at a rate of 85 per cent, while employment in agriculture dropped by 31 per cent, suggesting that conversion of forests to agriculture may have not been the only cause of deforestation. Some of the communities with simultaneously high poverty and deforestation rates are indigenous comarcas (local administrations), but in recent years the trends in forest loss have been slowing. In Panama, a high percentage of the population is made up of people of African descent and indigenous peoples, the latter representing about 10 per cent of the population. In response to this slowing of deforestation, several studies in Panama and elsewhere have revealed that the cultural practices of indigenous groups linked with ownership rights to land, rather than policy changes protecting land, are responsible for the transition to more forest cover (PRISMA & CABAL, 2010). That is, the ability to control the use and access of land is a central factor in avoiding deforestation. This connection between land use change and community control of land is a revelation for the situation of women, due to the signi\ufb01cant gender differences in people\u2019s ability to control and use land in Panama. While 21 per cent of male farmers in Panama depend completely on farming for their livelihoods, this percentage drops to 4 for women. This is due to the limited land owned by women farmers and the lack of available conditions for improving their productivity, such as \ufb01nancing and technical assistance. By 2000, 38 per cent of women farmers in Panama worked on land that they owned, while 62 per cent of male farmers worked their own land.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2dbcff7-93df-4040-ab86-02e97f1d4e1e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2dbcff7-93df-4040-ab86-02e97f1d4e1e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8997e8d9393a8bfb99785fa36c51e302255480456f629c969cd24357881c8056"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2b96ae7-58b6-4bc4-9c6b-b46621a822f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "211804223acb56f7c1328b7ea8a16d9f230ec639b032efdf98a2e1ec72c5439a"}}, "hash": "02ffab11fa357e152bc91a3d00158a936cddc49815264757be40b7fe6c5224b6", "text": "There are gender differences in the size of land plots as well\u2014about 75 per cent of women have holdings smaller than 0.5 hectares and 64.5 per cent of men have properties over 0.5", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2f153a7-0e3b-4adb-857e-6d9af6904d15": {"__data__": {"id_": "f2f153a7-0e3b-4adb-857e-6d9af6904d15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7eab6f4fa65811db6e8c708808821e504a912b758095b4490e9c1a668bbc7922"}, "3": {"node_id": "8942f333-afd3-4e8f-a013-29fd71284e26", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c8c72a06012c3007c551355f940e612af6fc24a9f2b1b8983cfb9412d6ee903"}}, "hash": "a3a01ddca6f9bf66dca6ec015b2c57cd15d407db1574815bd29c9b2d05482e79", "text": "hectares. Male farmers receive signi\ufb01cantly more \ufb01nancial assistance or credit. In 2000-2001, male farmers received 93 per cent of the credit and \ufb01nancing and women farmers only received 7 per cent (MIDE, 2008). This stark discrimination against women\u2019s ownership of land and access to other key resources in Panama may prevent women\u2019s pursuit of environmentally friendly land uses. It will also impact whether they can reap the \ufb01nancial and other bene\ufb01ts of any payments for environmental services schemes, such as REDD+. Thus, one of the vehicles for women\u2019s empowerment pinpointed in the national workshop in Panama was soil conservation. A quarter of the country\u2019s land is degraded from agriculture due to use of chemicals, unsustainable farming practices, overuse, and slash and burn methods. This is aggravated further by a lack of soil management and by urban encroachment (Panama Digest, 2010). Building the capacity of women farmers to manage soil fertility would simultaneously strengthen women\u2019s technical leadership and visibility in the agricultural sector while contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases\u2014in effect, a win-win potential for both gender equality and climate change mitigation. 80 | the art of implementation Building on the experiences above, Panama\u2019s ccGAP includes targeted actions in the land use sector, a sample of which is outlined below.

Backed by a gender-sensitive national climate change strategy, the National Environmental Authority plans to host provincial workshops along the same adaptation and mitigation themes throughout the country. The Panama National Institute of Women and the Panamanian Center for Women will engage actively in these workshops, as well as with the climate change planning process in general, in order to provide targeted inputs on gender mainstreaming, ensure that the voices of women of African descent and indigenous peoples are heard, and strengthen relationships between the public sector and civil society. 2012 | 81 This stark discrimination against women\u2019s ownership of land and access to other key resources in Panama may prevent women\u2019s pursuit of environmentally friendly land uses.

The strong support of Costa Rica\u2019s leadership\u2014from the Ministry of the Environment to the National Institute of Women\u2013 bodes well for the \ufb01nalization of the gender-sensitive climate change plan. In advance of the multi-stakeholder consultative workshop in June 2012, IUCN, CoopSoliDar, and INAMU reviewed assessments of the four themes prioritized by the Costa Rican government: energy, transport, agriculture, and water. These partners, along with the Climate Change of\ufb01ce of the Ministry of Environment, Energy, and Telecommunications; gender focal points from governmental institutions; RUTA; and women\u2019s representatives from academia, indigenous groups, and civil society, participated in the consultative workshop to develop recommended actions, results, and indicators on gender to be incorporated in the national action plan. At the time of writing, a streamlined set of inputs has been presented to the government\u2019s Climate Change Of\ufb01ce for consideration.

For this reason, gender equity and equality are considered to be an important part of the action plan of the National Climate Change Strategy.\u201d Lauren Palma, Public Policy Coordinator, National Women\u2019s Institute (INAMU) \u201cEfforts to incorporate a gender perspective in the action plan of the National Climate Change Strategy are critical in a reality where climate change impacts are different for men and women.

LATIN AMERICA COSTA RICA 2012 | 87 Haiti LATIN AMERICA HAITI I n Haiti, environmental degradation and poverty are closely intertwined. Already the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most devastated environments in the world, Haiti was recently deemed the most vulnerable country to climate change (Maplecroft, 2012). Every rainy season, tropical storms wreak havoc on the country\u2014destroying crops and infrastructure, furthering erosion and droughts, and causing internal displacement and mortality. During one month in 2008, four hurricanes killed an estimated 800 people, with over 800,000 people affected (USAID, 2009). Climate change is expected to increase the severity of these storm cycles with heavier rain and \ufb02ooding.

Overview of Haiti ccGAP Overall Objective: The purpose of the gender and climate change program in Haiti is to ensure the integration of gender considerations in all policies and initiatives in environmental matters, particularly issues related to climate change, management and conservation of biodiversity, and land degradation, with a view to achieving the goals associated with sustainable development and the Millennium Development Goals. 2012 | 89 LATIN AMERICA HAITI Drawing on Haiti\u2019s priority sectors, the following section focuses on disaster risk reduction and food security to illustrate some of the challenges and solutions within the context of gender and climate change. Disaster risk reduction Although not directly associated with climate change, the 2010 earthquake brought Haiti\u2019s social and environmental vulnerabilities into sharp focus. The earthquake affected approximately three million people, including 316,000 deaths; 300,000 injuries; and one million left homeless (CBS News, 2010; CBC News, 2011; AP/Washington Post, 2010). The country\u2019s infrastructure was dealt a terrible blow, with the buildings of 1,300 educational institutions and 50 health care facilities rendered unusable. The damage crippled the country\u2019s leadership and governance structure\u2014as the Presidential Palace, the Parliament, and the majority of government buildings were destroyed\u2014as well as those of the private sector, which accounted for the largest \ufb01nancial and infrastructure losses (UNEP, 2010). Haiti\u2019s existing levels of poverty, alongside political instability, and rapid urbanization and population growth, exponentially increases the country\u2019s exposure to natural disasters. For women, there is a 1-in-16 chance of dying during childbirth during their lifetime (WHO, 2010). Prior to the earthquake, the majority of the population lacked access to electricity, water, and/or sanitation facilities, and the life expectancy and child nutrition rates were the lowest in the Western Hemisphere (UN-DESA, 2010). The earthquake deepened the existing health crisis\u2014the main causes of morbidity in Haiti include measles, tetanus, diphtheria, and AIDS, and malnutrition has been among the top ten causes. In the aftermath of the earthquake, poor sanitary conditions exacerbated the spread of a new epidemic of cholera that has killed over 7,000 people and infected a half million people, or \ufb01ve per cent of the population (Sontag, 2012). For women, there is a 1-in-16 chance of dying during childbirth during their lifetime (WHO, 2010). And according to the Post Disaster Needs Assessment, the loss of income resulting from the earthquake was in the order of US$ 53 million (Government of Haiti, 2010). Haiti\u2019s particular exposure to extreme weather is partly due to a landscape devoid of vegetation. Estimates of forest cover are as low as two per cent, the result of clear-cutting that can be traced to the Duvalier dictatorship and prior eras (UNEP, 2010). Deforestation continues today because the wide majority of Haitians rely on \ufb01rewood and charcoal for energy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5affa6d-d35a-46b3-bf06-43a146dc0952": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5affa6d-d35a-46b3-bf06-43a146dc0952", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a0e61f3cbe7285bd0e09b777d8bff35641c72c34053fa5c340626fceb0ad774"}, "2": {"node_id": "343e5bfd-61df-443e-826f-a760092b20ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8bf6e6e2c9bfcb3eb50b5b2544e4556fb22bbf948f5ea6056a7ef6555318c0c4"}}, "hash": "6b9b98821e86548f92d4415ff3f149c51ed9e5a321d2498eb046b26e9ace12ef", "text": "Farmers faced with small land plots, steep terrain, and nutrient-deprived soil must rely on charcoal production from felled trees for their livelihoods (Dolisca, et al., 2007).

In the past decade, the record levels of damage and mortality rates were due to severe \ufb02ooding rather than high winds (SMTN & CHF International, 2010). Even in this challenging context, the reconstruction process offers an opportunity to build new linkages between how the country tackles climate change and women\u2019s empowerment. Haiti is one of the rare countries where there is an institutional structure addressing gender mainstreaming. In the national stakeholder workshop to develop the Program for Mainstreaming Gender in Climate Change Efforts in Haiti, women\u2019s representatives from all ten Departments of Haiti participated. Women\u2019s rights are the subject of much activism in the political sphere, but there is more work to be done in bringing gender equality into other arenas such as climate change. The reconstruction process has been painfully slow and plagued by political battles, which has allowed gender inequalities to fester (Oxfam International, 2012). Several prominent \ufb01gures that were pillars of the Haitian women\u2019s movement died in the quake, including the head of the Women\u2019s Ministry (Charles & R\u00e9gine, 2010). As of December 2011, one-third of the donor funds committed just after the quake to support women and children\u2019s needs had not yet been disbursed (Of\ufb01ce of the Special Envoy for Haiti, 2012). Gender-based violence was widespread before the quake, and has been measured at four per cent of women in displaced persons camps. International humanitarian organizations have called for a new country- owned reconstruction process that consults with Haitian women and targets informal economy and small-scale agriculture enterprises to women (Oxfam International, 2012). Haitian women are, on the one hand, disproportionately at risk in the face of natural disasters and other extreme events and, on the other hand, a \u201ccentre post\u201d of the country\u2019s recovery and reconstruction (Maguire, 2012). What is missing is a disaster risk reduction approach that fully acknowledges their viewpoints and contributions and support systems to empower their leadership in the crisis. International and Haitian women\u2019s organizations have come together to call for women\u2019s active participation in the design, implementation, and monitoring of relief programs, as well as support and capacity building for women who are positioned to contribute their time and resources to relief and reconstruction efforts (Haiti Equality Collective, 2010). 90 | the art of implementation Food security and women traders Sustainable agriculture and food security are at the core of Haiti\u2019s recovery. The country\u2019s informal economy is at least 85 per cent of its total economy, and women\u2019s activities constitute the majority of the informal and agricultural sectors. Women in Haiti drive much of the agricultural trade and are central actors in food security, seed biodiversity, and economic growth. The \u201cMadam Saras\u201d are traders and key intermediaries bringing rural produce and goods to urban Port-au-Prince markets. While some Madam Saras operate independently and travel by foot, others are backed by capital and are highly visible merchants. Madam Saras operating at a larger scale have signi\ufb01cant control of the market, maintain a client base, and offer informal credit to both suppliers and buyers. Madame Saras face a number of risks in travel and personal security moving between rural and urban areas (IRC, et al., 2010). The 2010 earthquake destroyed some of the housing and storage depots, so that their market share and mobility are more limited (USAID, 2010a). These women traders draw from their knowledge of local seed varieties and planting schedules, and sometimes are also farmers themselves. In general, women in Haiti are very active in seed selection at harvest, seed and food storage at the household level and through women\u2019s community groups, and marketing of agricultural products. Due to the central role they play in the Haitian agricultural market, providing support to Madam Saras could mean simultaneous advances for women\u2019s empowerment and food security, particularly in the face of climate change, natural disasters, and other shocks. Community \ufb01nance groups known as mutuelles de solidarit\u00e9 provide capital for post-disaster reconstruction or for stimulating agricultural activities. There are more than 3,000 mutuelles de solidarit\u00e9 in Haiti, and women traders and producers are well represented in these.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd2d43fb-47fb-4026-9f7f-bb139afe1ec4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd2d43fb-47fb-4026-9f7f-bb139afe1ec4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e514a0ddeb4ac8a0c6dfd284c142a26cc859fe0d1a4e0019138cf2c1eab01e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "76d9fbd2-19c6-43ca-a940-c880ec3a021d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fd249fed02ada62532ecf6ec70c23c425a89744cc0d83afc602df22eb545657"}}, "hash": "57de3292ac6a7fa45b7798eb0740303a6124f29be167da1b916a8946fd686fad", "text": "Scaling up mutuelles de solidarit\u00e9, as well as providing support and capital to agricultural women\u2019s groups and networks, would enhance locally owned food security and women\u2019s empowerment (USAID, 2010c).

LATIN AMERICA HAITI 2012 | 93 Gender and REDD+ Roadmaps The roadmaps are a unique effort to bring a gender perspective to REDD+ activities in Ghana, Uganda, and Cameroon. 2012 | 95 Gender and REDD+ REDD is an international mechanism involving policy approaches and incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries. REDD+ encompasses the additional potential of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks to reduce emissions. REDD+ initiatives have the potential to provide multiple bene\ufb01ts\u2014in the realms of conservation, poverty reduction and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. If REDD+ projects were to be designed and implemented with a gender perspective, they would be more effective and ef\ufb01cient, would improve governance signi\ufb01cantly, and could reduce the gender gap. In September 2011, IUCN\u2019s Pro-Poor REDD+ Project embarked on a new initiative to develop roadmaps for gender-sensitive REDD+ efforts in Ghana, Uganda, and Cameroon. Headed by the IUCN Global Gender Of\ufb01ce, funded by the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA) and in collaboration with Women\u2019s Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), these gender and REDD+ roadmaps were developed through multi-stakeholder workshops convening national policy makers, women\u2019s organizations, gender experts, and other actors. The workshops facilitated training on gender and REDD+, a dialogue about country-speci\ufb01c gender issues, and the proposal of actions leading to gender-sensitive national REDD+ processes. Across the developing world, women are both the primary users of forest resources and the main producers of food through agricultural activities, while also performing important roles in the conservation of natural resources. Women are active in the collection of forest products for various household and entrepreneurial uses. However, the central role of women as contributors to forest management and conservation has traditionally gone unrecognized. In many developing countries, women lack access to income-generating forest activities and land tenure rights, and bene\ufb01t sharing schemes are largely gender blind. REDD+ initiatives could pose signi\ufb01cant risks and bear harmful impacts on women and men at the community level. Women-speci\ufb01c risks include violation of women\u2019s rights, increased vulnerability of women, inequitable distribution of bene\ufb01ts, and invisibility of women\u2019s role as major stakeholders and agents of change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f67f26c-1b7f-400c-81a5-fe60f0fab44b": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f67f26c-1b7f-400c-81a5-fe60f0fab44b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ee1944b2b43523a91c40d5180f1e8182a534785ea549ac7146e3c5139ef90860"}, "2": {"node_id": "a593610a-e68f-437b-b900-40bf0fa36917", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad40eb62aa7701fc65d089b489c7a87f0ba81c51f33202dde789d0c8558142d3"}}, "hash": "7e6d05d80302af629be87d35f72c8593a8f7f4eb862402589866337cf0d14937", "text": "Unfortunately, global deliberations regarding the development of REDD+ have not fully considered the gender dimension, and only a few pilot projects have taken actions to incorporate gender perspectives.

Some of the immediate drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Ghana include timber harvesting, agricultural expansion and pastoralism, commercialization of non- timber forest products, rubber plantations, extraction of \ufb01rewood and charcoal for energy, mining, and bush \ufb01res (Agyarko, 2007; Adeleke, 2011). On top of this, population growth has expanded urban settlements; the policy landscape has not protected forests; and demand for Ghana\u2019s timber, cocoa, and minerals has increased domestically and internationally (Bogetec, 2007; Blackett & Gardette, 2008). In September 2011, IUCN along with partners WEDO and Participatory Development Associates organized a women\u2019s workshop entitled Mainstreaming Gender into REDD processes in Ghana, which contributed to the development of Ghana\u2019s gender and REDD+ roadmap. Participants found that men in Ghana were more likely to be involved in extracting timber for commercial purposes and galamsey (small-scale mining), while women typically gather forest products for fuel, food, fodder, and raw materials for natural medicines and charcoal burning (see Table 29). Women in Ghana usually have user rights, but traditional practices prevent them from inheriting land in the northern regions, despite constitutional law that guarantees equal rights to all. Women participate less in decision making because of lower levels of literacy, limited time due to household responsibilities, and economic dependency on their male counterparts. \u201c With the fundamentally important role that women play in farming and the bene\ufb01ts that they derive from this sector to substantively contribute to the upkeep of their families, forest policies need to be more \u2018gender-oriented.\u2019 Although this is gradually on the rise in Ghana, more action needs to be taken by the government, NGOs and other actors.\u201d Sherry Ayittey, Minister of Environment, Science and Technology, Ghana 98 | the art of implementation Opportunities Risk/Challenges \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd sharing, advocacy, and lobbying on use of forest resources \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd making and participation in forestry projects \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd information and communications technology, etc. \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd their husbands for livelihoods hence are not able to raise their own \ufb01nancial resources \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd participation in capacity programmes where English is the medium of communication.

GENDER AND REDD+ ROADMAPS GHANA 2012 | 101 \u201c There is a need to understand and to remedy the continued lack of involvement of women in forest management. Increasing global interconnectedness, international trade and climate change will likely add to the vulnerability of women\u2019s rights to resources in rural settings in developing countries such as Uganda.\u201d CIFOR Working Paper on Gender, tenure and community forests in Uganda Uganda GENDER AND REDD+ ROADMAPS UGANDA A bout 2.7 million Ugandans representing 15 per cent of the population depend directly on forest resources, and over 90 per cent of the population uses forest resources for their major source of energy. Forest law has not prevented harvesting timber from private lands, which makes up 70 per cent of Uganda\u2019s forest cover, and protected forests are being used by encroachers from other regions (Nsita, 2010; Republic of Uganda, 2011). The major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in Uganda consist of agricultural expansion in forested lands, charcoal production, \ufb01rewood harvesting, livestock grazing, timber production and human settlement and urbanization (Government of Uganda, 2011). Other factors include policy de\ufb01ciencies related to land tenure and access rights, market distortions and misinformation, and weak institutional oversight. Population growth and migration, livestock grazing, timber, and charcoal have increased the demand for agricultural land (Republic of Uganda 2001, 2011). The increased demand for industrial land in urban and peri-urban areas has led to the degazetting, or removal of of\ufb01cial protection status, of nearly 1,000 hectares of forest reserves. In October-November 2011, the Gender Mainstreaming and REDD+ Workshop was organized in Uganda to contribute to the country\u2019s gender and REDD+ roadmap. Workshop participants indicated that Ugandan women have limited access to forest resources, and even then, women can only access the edges of the forest while men can harvest resources deeper in the forests. While women collect forest resources for household needs, such as \ufb01rewood, herbal medicine, craft materials, and small-scale thatching materials, men collect timber, charcoal, and building poles. Women face constraints in their participation in forestry management committees due to cultural expectations and the burden of a heavy workload, and they also face land tenure challenges.",

Before entering into a Readiness Preparation Grant Agreement, Uganda is expected to strengthen some elements of its proposal, including the development of a strategy for participation and consultation. With these forthcoming changes to Uganda\u2019s REDD+ planning in mind, participants in IUCN\u2019s national workshop outlined the opportunities and risks for women and for gender equality (see below). 2012 | 103 GENDER AND REDD+ ROADMAPS UGANDA Uganda is one of the few countries in which gender considerations are included in the REDD+ planning process, which highlights the impact of deforestation and \ufb01rewood scarcity on the lives of women and children. Women have been included in regional consultations, and gender is listed alongside the crosscutting issues of HIV/AIDS, culture, and poverty. Uganda\u2019s Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development is named as a member of the national committees related to REDD+, and the Ministry has been given the mandate in the context of REDD+ implementation to usher policies on gender and community development and to provide data on culture and indigenous people. While these provisions are a good start, Uganda\u2019s REDD+ planning could more clearly articulate a comprehensive gender mainstreaming process, perhaps linking to the country\u2019s forest policy, which includes both gender and equity as guiding principles.

countries of Central Africa, home to the second largest forest in the world. This workshop in Cameroon is one of the \ufb01rst national processes in the world on the issue of gender in REDD. It\u2019s therefore a very important journey, and will ensure that this new initiative called REDD+ is gender sensitive. The Cameroon roadmap will structure actions so that participants can be brave ambassadors of gender in REDD.\u201d R\u00e9mi Jiagho, IUCN Cameroon Cameroon GENDER AND REDD+ ROADMAPS CAMEROON T he Congo Basin rainforest is the second largest in the world after the Amazon, as well as one of the most biologically diverse, with 10,000 plant species that provide a wealth of resources to the people of Cameroon and the adjacent countries of Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo Brazzaville, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Cameroon\u2019s forests have been diminished by fragmentation, landslides, volcanoes, \ufb01res, parasites, and changes in water level (Zongang, 2011). While agriculture is responsible for 80-95 per cent of deforestation in Cameroon, other human activities that affect these forests include legal and illegal logging, \ufb01rewood use, mining, creation of roads, and movement of rural populations towards urban centres (Dkamela,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c89102d-0d52-46ef-915c-45c55d3fbdf3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c89102d-0d52-46ef-915c-45c55d3fbdf3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The art of implementation : gender strategies transforming national and regional climate change decision making", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4779ad1c891cf6a9acc37cc0947db3afad8ebab2e8f236f9019db2c3eddd5f9f"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7a08440-7bfe-4ead-a67d-cea9cbc95ce2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/art-implementation-gender-strategies-transforming-national-and-regional", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18b60576e32c8291e756624c7aaec05cb16de30637d533c33104837d8d43aced"}}, "hash": "dac77fd0400690b7d2516b391c1cac39dac2f3bd54b2961b6e61dc5db93539b0", "text": "2011). In addition, large-scale banana, rubber, and palm oil (biofuels) plantations have been established, which is distinct from informal and industrial logging (Zongang, 2011). In September 2011, similar to the process in Ghana and Uganda, women\u2019s organizations and gender experts in Cameroon attended a workshop to receive training and develop priorities, followed by a national workshop to develop the country\u2019s gender and REDD+ roadmap in which policy makers joined the participants. During the women\u2019s workshop, it was found that women often dominate the collection and marketing of non-timber forest products but do not have secure access to these products or the land that contains them. Women mostly have access to the forest to facilitate collecting, harvesting and usage of mangroves, farming, and \ufb01shing, among other daily activities that are at the heart of household survival. Women do not have access to timber (see following page). 106 | the art of implementation Opportunities Risks Challenges \ufffd\ufffd

Facility in July 2008 and received a grant for elaboration of its R-PP in November 2010. Cameroon has developed proposals in relation to strengthening its participatory process to formulate a national REDD strategy and creating institutional arrangements to manage the national process. If accepted, Cameroon will be eligible for US$ 3.4 million for the implementation of its REDD plans (Dkamela, 2011). In anticipation of the launch of Cameroon\u2019s REDD initiative, participants in IUCN\u2019s national workshop outlined the opportunities, risks, and challenges for women and for gender equality (see

GENDER AND REDD+ ROADMAPS UGANDA 2012 | 111 T he ccGAPs and REDD+ roadmaps signal that countries value gender mainstreaming in a concrete manner\u2014but these strategies are just the beginning. Governments, civil society, international institutions, and other stakeholders have a considerable road to travel in order to ensure gender equality in climate change decision making. The ccGAPs inspire hope and action in a complex multilateral world of climate change far too often stuck in the inanimate universe of negotiating text. The national strategies create coherence and stimulate cooperation between different government departments and other stakeholders dealing with gender and climate change. Through the multi-stakeholder engagement process, the strategies increase public awareness of climate change and gender equality issues, to stimulate interest, participation, and consultations with different stakeholders in developing climate change policy, and to increase capacity of those national actors to continue their involvement. In essence, the ccGAPs are building a momentum for positive change.

Previous to that IUCN assembled its Members in General or Members\u2019 Assemblies. As IUCN\u2019s mission is to \u201cin\ufb02uence, encourage and assist society\u201d, its policy work is key to its ability to have an impact on world conservation. A signi\ufb01cant result of each of these 23 convenings of IUCN Members, the experts participating in IUCN\u2019s Commissions, and invited partner organizations, has been the policy recommendations from the Members, dealing with the most signi\ufb01cant policy measures as identi\ufb01ed and elaborated by them. Motions, draft decisions which the World Conservation Congress is requested to take, are presented by IUCN Members on a wide range of conservation issues and when adopted become either Resolutions or Recommendations. IUCN Congress \u201cResolutions\u201d are aimed primarily at IUCN itself and \u201cRecommendations\u201d are directed to other agencies or the world at large, though this distinction is sometimes a dif\ufb01cult one to draw. For ease of communication, these will both be called \u201cResolutions\u201d throughout this document. Over 1000 such Resolutions have been adopted to date; the full text of all can be found at: www.iucn.org/about/work/programmes/global_ policy/gpu_resources/gpu_res_recs. This paper brie\ufb02y highlights some of the major impacts and in\ufb02uences that these resolutions have had on conservation. It is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to focus attention on some of the most signi\ufb01cant issues that the IUCN Membership has addressed, working together with IUCN\u2019s six Commissions (on Species, Protected Areas, Environmental Law, Ecosystem Management, Communications and Education, and Environmental, Economic and Social Policy) and supported by IUCN\u2019s Secretariat.

They have helped set the international conservation agenda, for example through supporting the preparation of the World Conservation Strategy and contributing to environmental treaties such as CITES, Ramsar, World Heritage and the Convention on Biological Diversity. Through its resolutions, IUCN has been a steadfast supporter of indigenous peoples, gender issues and the recognition of conservation as part of human rights. It has also focused attention on conserving endangered species and protected areas, helping to design effective approaches that are now global standards.

It is the only environmental organization with Observer status at the United Nations General Assembly, enabling IUCN to deliver the policy perspectives of its Members at the highest international level of diplomacy. These policies are developed through an open consultative process involving the full IUCN Membership. Since IUCN\u2019s founding in 1948, its Members have convened every two to four years to debate and agree major policy issues and approve the organization\u2019s programme and budget for the subsequent several years. It held 19 General Assemblies between 1948 and 1994, typically with an accompanying Technical Meeting that addressed on-the-ground conservation issues. Beginning in 1996, the General Assembly and Technical Meeting components were combined and re-labeled as the World Conservation Congress. Four such congresses have now been held, in Montreal, Amman, Bangkok and Barcelona. The next Congress will be held in Jeju, Republic of Korea, from 6\u201315 September 2012. Impact of IUCN Resolutions 3 INTRODUCTION I UCN\u2019s Members are all independent agencies, well able to set their own agendas. But by working together toward a common global agenda, the Membership, Secretariat and Commissions can have a far greater impact than by working alone. As one outstanding example, the Members agreed at the 1978 General Assembly, in Ashkhabad, USSR, to proceed with producing what became the World Conservation Strategy (WCS). It was published in 1980 and given strong support by the \ufb01rst resolution of the 1981 General Assembly, in Christchurch, New Zealand. The World Conservation Strategy gave strong legitimacy to linking conservation with development, and was the \ufb01rst document to put the phrase \u201csustainable development\u201d into the international vocabulary. This phrase has now entered the mainstream of development thinking and has had a profound in\ufb02uence on the design and operation of conservation and development practice throughout the world. But the foundations for the WCS were built much earlier, including at the Edinburgh General Assembly in 1956, which called for landscape planning based on ecological research as the starting point for development projects, the call for environmental impact assessments in Athens in 1958, and the promotion of ecological principles for economic development in Banff in 1972. Following the adoption of the World Conservation Strategy, IUCN resolutions continued to encourage governments to direct their development assistance in more environmentally- friendly directions (for example, the 1984 Madrid General Assembly called for development assistance agencies to implement the World Conservation Strategy and provided guidelines for doing so, and in San Jos\u00e9 in 1988 Members called for the preparation of national conservation strategies, of which dozens were subsequently prepared, often with IUCN technical assistance). The impacts of these resolutions have helped to put conservation in the mainstream of development. Thanks at least partly to IUCN\u2019s early adoption of the principle of sustainable development, it is now widely recognized that people are essential partners and key bene\ufb01ciaries for all conservation action. But this has not always been the case. Indigenous peoples have especially felt that they have been ignored by the conservation community, and indeed have sometimes been forced off their land so that protected areas could be established. But IUCN has long been a champion for the concept of people as part of nature. As early as the 1952 General Assembly in Caracas, Members recognized the importance of cooperation among public agencies, rural people and the private sector. Other resolutions recognizing the importance of local communities and traditional ways of life were agreed in Athens in 1958, Kinshasa in 1975, Christchurch in 1981 (which called for heads of governments and others to \u201ctake into account the still existing very large reservoir of traditional knowledge and experience within local cultures which must provide a signi\ufb01cant basis for the evolution of future management policies and planning actions\u2026\u201d), Buenos Aires in 1994, when a resolution on IUCN action on indigenous people and sustainable use of natural resources led to the permanent inclusion of an indigenous representative on the IUCN Council, Montreal in 1996 (with resolutions on indigenous people, intellectual property rights and biodiversity; 4 Impact of IUCN Resolutions 1.

In 1991, Caring for the Earth: A Strategy for Sustainable Living, was published to expand on and emphasize the World Conservation Strategy. Oriented towards practical action, this document set out a world strategy for a kind of development that would provide real improvements in the quality of human life while simultaneously conserving the vitality and diversity of the Earth. These documents have been the foundation of conservation efforts since. development strategies, and in Bangkok (2004), resolutions covered poverty reduction, food security and conservation, conserving nature and reducing poverty by linking human rights and the environment, and the role of conservation organizations in poverty reduction and development. The 2008 Congress in Barcelona called for mainstreaming gender equity and equality within the Union and addressed conservation and poverty reduction. These issues are now standard operating procedure for IUCN, indicating a strong impact on the design and implementation of conservation interventions. They also form the basis for IUCN partnerships with various United Nations organizations and government agencies. IUCN resolutions have also led to the establishment and support of many international programmes and institutions, including support for the International Whaling Commission (Lucerne, 1966), calling for the establishment of conservation departments at the national level (New Delhi, 1969), supporting the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme (Banff, 1972), calling for the establishment of ICIMOD (International Center for Integrated Mountain Development) (Ashkhabad, 1977), the establishment of the Botanical Gardens Conservation Secretariat (San Jos\u00e9, 1988), the establishment of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (San Jos\u00e9, 1988), establishment and supporting of the Global Biodiversity Forum (Buenos Aires, 1994), and active participation in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (Amman, 2000 and Bangkok, 2004). Each of these initiatives has played an important role in spreading IUCN\u2019s mission across numerous sectors and all parts of the world.

The 2008 Barcelona Congress was a major breakthrough, with no less than 10 resolutions dealing with local and indigenous peoples, including on empowering local communities to conserve and manage natural resources in Africa, supporting indigenous conservation territories and other indigenous peoples\u2019 and community conserved areas, implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and integrating culture and cultural diversity into IUCN\u2019s policy and programme. All of this helped lead to a high-level dialogue, called \u201cSharing Power\u201d, held in Whakatane, New Zealand, in January 2011 and attended by the Chairs of IUCN\u2019s six Commissions and representatives of indigenous peoples. The dialogue called for renewed efforts to implement the Barcelona resolutions relevant to indigenous peoples. Through this effort of several decades, IUCN has made a major contribution to ensuring that the world\u2019s cultural diversity is included as part of the mainstream of conservation concerns. IUCN has also been a leader in applying conservation principles to address issues of poverty and gender. For example, in San Jos\u00e9 (1988), Members called for increased efforts to enhance and support women\u2019s participation in conservation and sustainable Impact of IUCN Resolutions 5 W hile law is the responsibility of governments, IUCN has performed a key function in developing much of the international legislation that today governs the relationships among governments in the \ufb01eld of conservation.

As early as 1954 (long before Rachel Carson\u2019s 1962 classic book, Silent Spring, popularized the concern), IUCN identi\ufb01ed the importance of dealing with the effects of pesticides on mammals, birds and insects, further strengthened in 1981 in Christchurch and in Buenos Aires in 1994; these ultimately led to the Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and governments throughout the world enacted national legislation on pollution control, often with the advice of the Environmental Law Centre.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3803ad8a-601c-4575-9365-9fbcea498bae": {"__data__": {"id_": "3803ad8a-601c-4575-9365-9fbcea498bae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of the impact of IUCN resolutions on international conservation efforts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e680b5d3dc3298eb095a45599fddcb50e064802173ee150c391959db5812f3c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "96535873-dbae-4d33-965d-5eb314056a79", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b1e4909aa8a9e8d87119c62597fd96940e26467f592c1eb1c912e712c9f8a21"}}, "hash": "f50ee85a5079ceb084cff83a8e1d524421e0a1f799a7329699ce1116c7a92d1e", "text": "The impact has been a signi\ufb01cant reduction in at least some forms of pollution.

The subsequent General Assembly, in Warsaw in 1960, built the foundations for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), another convention to which IUCN has made substantial and continuing contributions, drawing especially on the expertise of the Species Survival Commission. At the 1972 General Assembly, in Banff, Canada, the support to the World Heritage Convention was further strengthened, and the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (which IUCN helped to draft) was strongly supported through IUCN offering to host the Secretariat (an arrangement that has lasted until the present). The main elements of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) were identi\ufb01ed at the Christchurch General Assembly in 1981, which called for IUCN\u2019s Secretariat to analyze the technical, legal, and economic and \ufb01nancial matters relating to the conservation, accessibility and use of genetic 6 Impact of IUCN Resolutions 2.

Numerous subsequent resolutions added further support to the emerging Convention on Biological Diversity, which has become a heartland issue for many IUCN Members, and for the organization as a whole (for example, resolutions in Madrid on wild genetic resources and in San Jos\u00e9 on endangered species habitat protection and on development of international environmental law, both contain details on elements of what eventually evolved into the CBD). Once the CBD entered into force, IUCN Members also supported its Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (Bangkok, 2004), which IUCN helped to draft. The CBD is now the leading international instrument for addressing the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, promoting equitable sharing of the bene\ufb01ts from the utilization of genetic resources, and ensuring that any trade in genetically modi\ufb01ed organisms is subject to the appropriate oversight. Also at the Christchurch General Assembly, IUCN further promoted the Law of the Sea, with numerous other resolutions dealing with speci\ufb01c aspects of marine conservation. These included deep sea mining and establishment of protected areas of the deep sea, Antarctica Environment and the Southern Ocean, the environmental law of the sea, the Polar Bear Convention (Banff, 1972, and for which IUCN\u2019s Polar Impact of IUCN Resolutions 7 Bear Specialist Group is the technical advisor), and many others. The support for legal protection of the oceans has continued to grow, with the Barcelona Congress issuing several marine-related resolutions with legal implications, such as achieving conservation of marine biodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions. Back on land, IUCN supported the African Charter for Protection and Conservation of Nature (Nairobi, 1963), the World Charter for Nature (Kinshasa, 1975 and Madrid, 1984), the establishment of an international database on environmental law (Banff, 1972 and Barcelona, 2008), the ASEAN Agreement on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (Montreal, 1996), and the International Covenant on Environment and Development (Montreal, 1996 and Barcelona, 2008). IUCN\u2019s Environmental Law Centre contributed to the drafting of many of these, typically with support and inspiration from the Commission on Environmental Law. The actual impact of these initiatives has been mixed, but they remain available when the conditions are conducive to their full implementation. In summary, the impact of IUCN on establishing the international legal framework for conservation has been substantial, and this framework has helped establish IUCN\u2019s own priorities for action. C onservation is a constantly evolving \ufb01eld, and the IUCN meetings of Members provide an excellent opportunity to identify emerging issues that may not have yet appeared on the global conservation agenda, the consciousness of the public, or even the attention of governments.

These resolutions have helped place IUCN in the middle of the growing international effort to conserve the world\u2019s oceans and their biological riches. The actual impacts of these resolutions have varied, but many of them helped to mobilize broad support among the IUCN Membership for new approaches to conservation action (many of which are now in the mainstream) and emerging issues that required the greater attention they are now receiving.

In terms of impacts, many of these principles, such as sustainable use and standards for introduction and translocation, are now standard operating procedures for many countries. Numerous resolutions have also addressed individual species needing conservation action. These are too many to list, but examples, among many that could be cited, include: kouprey (Caracas, 1952); lowland gorillas (Warsaw, 1960); orangutans, spotted cats, marine turtles, birds of paradise, blue whales and red colobus monkeys, all at the Nairobi General Assembly in 1963; giant panda (San Jos\u00e9, 1988); and the Australian population of salt water crocodiles (Madrid, 1984, a population that has now strongly recovered). Tigers were singled out at the New Delhi General Assembly in 1969, which helped lead to India\u2019s Project Tiger, which was launched in 1972 and has been credited with saving the Bengal tiger. More recently, IUCN responded to the rapid die-off of vultures in South Asia (Bangkok, 2004) and was instrumental in calling the world\u2019s attention to the amphibian crisis and how to address it (Barcelona, 2008), making this a top global conservation priority. In the \ufb01eld of protected areas, it was early recognized by IUCN Members that international cooperation could provide essential support for the national agencies that were seeking to establish such areas. At the 1958 Athens General Assembly, Members agreed that IUCN should promote the establishment of a United Nations List of National Parks and Equivalent Reserves, and take responsibility for compiling the list: it is now known as the World Database on Protected Areas, and includes over 100,000 sites. IUCN\u2019s Protected Areas Programme works with UNEP\u2019s World Conservation Monitoring Centre in maintaining and promoting this list, which is freely available at www.wdpa.org. Many fundamental principles that are now broadly accepted in protected area management were brought to public attention by IUCN resolutions, including: n using ecological criteria for establishing boundaries of protected areas (Banff, 1972); n establishing categories of different types of protected areas (New Delhi, 1969, updated at Buenos Aires, 1994); n recognizing private protected area systems (San Jos\u00e9, 1988); n producing best practice protected area guidelines for ecological restoration (Barcelona, 2008); n recognizing the value of community conserved areas (Bangkok, 2004) and municipal protected areas (Barcelona, 2008); n promoting transboundary protected areas (Bangkok, 2004); and n recognizing and conserving sacred natural sites in protected areas (Barcelona, 2008). 10 Impact of IUCN Resolutions 4. MOBILIZING SPECIFIC ACTIONS ON SPECIES AND PROTECTED AREAS Among the many individual protected areas or protected area systems where IUCN resolutions have provided support are: Killarny National Park, Ireland (Edinburgh, 1956); Japan\u2019s national parks (Warsaw, 1960); the national parks of Ecuador, Indonesia, Jordan, Kenya, South Africa and Sabah (all at the 1963 General Assembly in Nairobi, which also passed resolutions on individual protected areas such as Abruzzo, Gran Paradiso and Gombe Stream); Kahuzi- Biega National Park (Lucerne, 1966, now a World Heritage Site); Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda (New Delhi, 1969); the Great Barrier Reef (now a World Heritage Site) and the Firth of Thames, New Zealand (now named a Ramsar Site \u2013 both from Christchurch, 1981); and tropical rainforest in Queensland (Madrid, 1984, now a World Heritage Site). Of particular interest was a resolution at the Banff General Assembly (1972) which proposed a transboundary protected area between the US and Canada, leading to the Kluane/Wrangell-St. Elias/Glacier Bay/Tatshenshin-Alsek transboundary World Heritage Site, the world\u2019s largest such protected area and an important example of connecting individual protected areas to create much larger contiguous areas that can support wide-ranging species and potentially adapt to changing climatic conditions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba2a7465-d348-4cf0-84d3-7276f10f3476": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba2a7465-d348-4cf0-84d3-7276f10f3476", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of the impact of IUCN resolutions on international conservation efforts", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18322f08b2649af83c74ca958e94b21ba2113e3d1052d7c08af420f82e74295d"}, "2": {"node_id": "05b81e93-0f25-4379-ace4-91881dce4161", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-impact-iucn-resolutions-international-conservation-efforts", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5beb60d0f895736cf4f3217008e9d534935238e45e00ce0c524c058c5df47677"}}, "hash": "a89edc4b985050973912a7cf77fc842626dc172c94280f532c24cfefd10ae31a", "text": "Many subsequent resolutions promoted transboundary protected areas and conservation corridors, with an outstanding example being the Barcelona resolution on the Great Ecological Connectivity Corridor that would include the Cantabric Range, the Pyrenees, the Massif Central and the Western Alps of western Europe.

L'id\u00e9e en \u00e9tait n\u00e9e depuis longtemps et je pense que nul ne me reprochera de citer ici le seul nom de Paul Sarasin, le grand pionnier suisse. Il a su d\u00e9velopper dans son pays un v\u00e9ritable mouvement pojm- laire en faveur de la protection des richesses et des beaut\u00e9s naturelles, et il r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 cr\u00e9er le Parc National Suisse. Penseur et savant, il s'\u00e9tait rendu compte de l'inutilit\u00e9 des efforts dis- pers\u00e9s, de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 de grouper les comp\u00e9tences, d'\u00e9tablir une entente internationale en vue d'unifier les l\u00e9gislations si diverses, de coordonner les mesures prises dans les diff\u00e9rentes parties du Globe, afin de conserver la flore et la faune menac\u00e9es par l'action \u00ab civilisatrice \u00bb de l'homme. Paul Sarasin r\u00e9ussit en 1913 \u00e0 forger un instrument diplo- matique, sign\u00e9 \u00e0 Berne par un certain nombre d'Etats, auquel adh\u00e9r\u00e8rent plus tard encore quelques Gouvernements. Malheureusement, la guerre de 1914 vint entraver l'activit\u00e9 de la \u00ab Commission consultative \u00bb ainsi cr\u00e9\u00e9e, de sorte que cette initiative resta sans lendemain. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s la fin des hostilit\u00e9s, en 1918, on essai/a bien de la faire revivre, mais d'autres pr\u00e9occupations, plus urgentes, retenaient alors l'attention des peuples. Cependant, la bonne semence \u00e9tait tomb\u00e9e sur un terrain favorable et il \u00e9tait permis d'esp\u00e9rer qu'elle finirait par germer. Je n'ai voulu citer que le seul nom de Sarasin, car s'il fallait mentionner tous ceux qui, par la suite, ont soutenu \u00ab l'id\u00e9e \u00bb, un registre volumineux ne suffirait pas. Des groupements se sont form\u00e9s dans tous les pays du monde; ils ont lutt\u00e9 de toutes leurs forces pour d\u00e9fendre l'id\u00e9al qui les inspirait; ils ont travaill\u00e9 avec des succ\u00e8s divers pour sauver d'une exploitation insens\u00e9e les richesses encore intactes de la Nature. Tous, pourtant, sentaient confus\u00e9ment qu'il leur serait impossible d'arriver \u00e0 un r\u00e9sultat concret s'ils ne parvenaient pas \u00e0 assurer une coordination mondiale des efforts, jusqu'alors souvent divergents. \u2014 4 \u2014 D\u00e9j\u00e0 en -1928, une premi\u00e8re tentative dans ce sens fut faite, correspondant \u00e0 la fondation de l'Office International pour la Protection de la Nature, qui fonctionne encore aujourd'hui \u00e0 Bruxelles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49729b5c-d770-42f7-a9f9-deb65de389d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "49729b5c-d770-42f7-a9f9-deb65de389d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Union internationale pour la protection de la nature cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 Fontainebleau, le 5 octobre 1948", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32beb7636cfbfbd2bbb798e218cf170b71f11ff7fa8c5e70ae7eb10e39ddb39c"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f444604-e78d-4e34-97ae-dcb66bb75092", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33b463558add7d12948baf2055c6b139b74ddb5b814387df86e0ecb0ced82451"}}, "hash": "a65f6c301b45ac3601e1f773c1999776901006a1a41e98977e64c1a0155727a0", "text": "Une premi\u00e8re conf\u00e9rence se r\u00e9unit en 1946 \u00e0 Brunnen, en Suisse.

Cette conf\u00e9rence, qui se d\u00e9roula dans vn esprit de collaboration amicale, jugea qu'il \u00e9tait urgent d'\u00e9tablir une Union Internationale pour la Protection de la Nature et sugg\u00e9ra que cette nouvelle organisa- tion, qui devait \u00eatre cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 Paris en 1948, le f\u00fbt sous les auspices de l'UNESCO. Elle d\u00e9cida, de m\u00eame, qu'une Union Provisoire serait imm\u00e9diatement fond\u00e9e et chargea la Ligue Suisse pour la Protection de la Nature d'en assurer la gestion.

Les assises furent tenues dans le cadre grandiose du Palais de Fontainebleau, sur l'initiative du Comit\u00e9 fran\u00e7ais. L'organi- sation mat\u00e9rielle de la Conf\u00e9rence fut parfaite, compte tenu surtout des difficult\u00e9s qui devaient fatalement entraver une r\u00e9alisation con\u00e7ue et entreprise simultan\u00e9ment par trois entit\u00e9s : le Comit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ais d'Organisation, l'Union Internationale Pro- visoire pour la Protection de la Nature et l'UNESCO.

Mais pour pr\u00e9parer cette conf\u00e9rence mondiale, il apparaissait n\u00e9cessaire de faire rassembler au plus t\u00f4t quelques ensembles de donn\u00e9es envisag\u00e9es \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle r\u00e9gionale. La \u00ab Conf\u00e9rence Inter-Am\u00e9ricaine pour la Conservation des Ressources Natu- relles Renouvelables \u00bb, qui s'est tenue du 7 au 20 septembre 1948 \u00e0 Denver, pouvait tout naturellement fournir des \u00e9l\u00e9ments pour le Continent Am\u00e9ricain. De m\u00eame, le 7me Congr\u00e8s Scien- tifique du Pacifique, convoqu\u00e9 pour le mois de f\u00e9vrier 1949 en Nouvelle-Z\u00e9lande, permettra de constituer une documenta- tion similaire pour le Bassin du Grand Oc\u00e9an. Mais il restait \u00e0 r\u00e9unir des sp\u00e9cialistes pour poser certains des probl\u00e8mes propres \u00e0 l'ancien continent. La Conf\u00e9rence de Fontainebleau, convoqu\u00e9e pour proc\u00e9der \u00e0 l'\u00e9tablissement de l'Union Internationale pour la Protection de la Nature, \u00e9tait tout indiqu\u00e9e pour constituer l'occasion favorable. Et c'est ainsi que fut organis\u00e9, pendant la Conf\u00e9rence, le \u00ab Symposium Technique pour l'Europe et l'Afrique \u00bb, dont le programme est reproduit ci-apr\u00e8s, de m\u00eame que le rapport d\u00e9pos\u00e9 par M.

Boger Heim, Membre de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences de France, Pr\u00e9sident du Symposium Technique pour l'Europe et l'Afrique. Malgr\u00e9 de grandes difficult\u00e9s mat\u00e9rielles qui ont tenu au peu de temps rest\u00e9 disponible pour nos propres d\u00e9bats, je crois pouvoir dire que les buts de ce Symposium Technique tels que le Dr HUXLEY, qui en a pris l'initiative, les avait pr\u00e9alablement esquiss\u00e9s, ont \u00e9t\u00e9 en bonne partie atteints. Le Symposium Technique, qui s'est r\u00e9uni en six s\u00e9ances successives, avait pour but, d'une part, un \u00e9change d'informa- tions, d'autre part, la r\u00e9daction d'un projet d'ordre du jour pour la Conf\u00e9rence Technique sur la Protection de la Nature, que l'UNESGO propose de convoquer du 7 au 15 juillet 1949. Cette Conf\u00e9rence Technique se tiendra au m\u00eame endroit en collaboration \u00e9troite avec la Conf\u00e9rence des Nations Unies sur la Conservation et l'Utilisation des Ressources Naturelles (UNSCCUR), actuellement pr\u00e9vue du 20 juin au 7 juillet 1949. Nous avons remu\u00e9 beaucoup d'id\u00e9es, et trop vite, mais nous avons aussi extrait de toutes ces vues et des arguments que chacun a apport\u00e9s \u00e0 leur appui, un certain nombre de v\u00e9rit\u00e9s et de propositions dont vous avez tent\u00e9 de dresser la hi\u00e9rarchie d'importance et la hi\u00e9rarchie d'urgence. Je crois, lorsque nous relirons \u00e0 t\u00eate repos\u00e9e les comptes rendus de nos d\u00e9bats, que nous verrons s'en d\u00e9gager de nettes tendances d'opinions qui serviront la politique m\u00eame de notre Union. Au cours des quatre derni\u00e8res r\u00e9unions que j'ai eu l'honneur de pr\u00e9sider, nous nous sommes efforc\u00e9s de tirer ensemble des discussions et des conclusions des rapporteurs le reflet de vos pr\u00e9occupations essentielles. Je me contenterai de vous livrer les principales conclusions de ces d\u00e9bats, conclusions mat\u00e9rialis\u00e9es dans quelques proposi- tions qui s'inspirent des chapitres dont sera fait en quelque sorte notre programme : l'\u00c9ducation, la Loi, le Contr\u00f4le, la", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcd7eb4f-4b62-45c3-a9cc-ff936013cb2d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcd7eb4f-4b62-45c3-a9cc-ff936013cb2d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Union internationale pour la protection de la nature cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 Fontainebleau, le 5 octobre 1948", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "85699c3ebfc4bde74e66606c6f8ee43785fa84824b57c3555d4a0b2e6929fc6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "a95abd4a-2f9b-46d6-8207-81426d70bceb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7970398753bea74086e308bd71ec386b2a59a3ade7cdcf507b56946f1f931c9"}}, "hash": "0a57c5be06b1496e584fb4d56f36b3ed1056f3329ec58d0764c148c84099debb", "text": "Science. , Un certain nombre de nos discussions trouveront leur prolon- gement et, nous l'esp\u00e9rons, leurs conclusions, au sein des commissions dont vous avez formul\u00e9 le principe et pour lesquelles le Conseil Ex\u00e9cutif nous proposera dans un instant la composition. \u2014 14 \u2014 Ainsi, la controverse fort int\u00e9ressante sur la Nomenclature et la Terminologie, soit latine, soit fran\u00e7aise, qui pourrait servir de langage international dans l'\u00e9tablissement de d\u00e9fi- nitions et de diagnoses d\u00e9finitives en cette mati\u00e8re, nous a conduit \u00e0 vous proposer d'\u00e9largir la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente Commission internationale.

PR\u00c9AMBULE. On peut entendre par \u00ab Protection de la Nature \u00bb la sauvegarde de l'ensemble du monde vivant, milieu naturel de l'homme. Cet ensemble renferme les ressources naturelles renouvelables de la terre, facteur primordial de toute civilisation. Les beaut\u00e9s naturelles constituent, en outre, l'une des meilleures sources d'inspiration de la vie spirituelle contemporaine. Le grand essor de la civilisation actuelle est d\u00fb \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte et \u00e0 la mise en \u0153uvre de moyens de plus en plus puissants d'exploiter ces ressources naturelles. Dans ces conditions, la protection du sol, des eaux, de la couverture v\u00e9g\u00e9tale, de la faune et d'\u00e9l\u00e9ments naturels encore intacts pr\u00e9sente une importance capitale des points de vue \u00e9conomique, social, \u00e9ducatif et culturel. L'appauvrissement progressif des ressources naturelles entra\u00eene d\u00e9j\u00e0 un abaissement des conditions de vie de l'humanit\u00e9. Leur renouvellement ne pouvant pas suivre la cadence des destruc- tions, le moment est venu de convaincre l'homme de l'\u00e9troite d\u00e9pen- dance dans laquelle il se trouve \u00e0 leur \u00e9gard. Si l'on veut arr\u00eater cette \u00e9volution redoutable, il faut que l'homme se p\u00e9n\u00e8tre de la n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 \u2014 17 \u2014 de prot\u00e9ger et m\u00eame de r\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9rer ces ressources et de ne les consommer qu'avec m\u00e9nagement, de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 garantir la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 du monde et sa paix future. La Protection de la Nature appara\u00eet d\u00e9sormais d'une importance vitale pour tous les peuples, et cependant aucune organisation inter- nationale ne se consacre encore essentiellement \u00e0 cette t\u00e2che. Une organisation internationale pour la Protection de la Nature apporterait donc une aide efficace aux diff\u00e9rents gouvernements, aux Nations Unies et \u00e0 leurs institutions sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es, ainsi qu'aux autres organisations int\u00e9ress\u00e9es.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72217b28-b6ae-49bf-85fb-306a078a6623": {"__data__": {"id_": "72217b28-b6ae-49bf-85fb-306a078a6623", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Union internationale pour la protection de la nature cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 Fontainebleau, le 5 octobre 1948", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12813c94d36c40980e813c5fd2ea3b9ed062c5b73554e588801c663addd1d004"}, "2": {"node_id": "38f38458-3db3-41b7-b7b8-1eb9add88df1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f53d3b7479fd02d122e1c06472be5067e16e613fb4f3105ce34f45efa3e88510"}}, "hash": "7d1c2511c3a78c2c9688c57d9766a7ddbb8025b5ce78cfabb2a4fb971fe69e37", "text": "En cons\u00e9quence, les gouvernements, administrations, organisations, institutions et associations sp\u00e9cialis\u00e9es dans ces questions, r\u00e9unis \u00e0 Fontainebleau, cr\u00e9ent, par les pr\u00e9sentes, une Union d\u00e9sign\u00e9e sous le nom de a Union Internationale pour la Protection de la Nature \u00bb appel\u00e9e ci-apr\u00e8s \u00ab Union \u00bb, et d\u00e9cident ce qui suit : ARTICLE I.

Ce probl\u00e8me fut l'un des plus d\u00e9licats et des plus ardus qu'eurent \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre les participants au Congr\u00e8s de Fontaine- bleau. En effet, deux n\u00e9cessit\u00e9s \u00e9galement imp\u00e9rieuses s'affron- taient, conduisant invariablement les n\u00e9gociateurs \u00e0 l'impasse. D'une part, il \u00e9tait indispensable, afin de permettre \u00e0 l'Union d'entrer dans la voie des r\u00e9alisations, de lui voter imm\u00e9diate- ment un budget de d\u00e9penses pour l'exercice 1948-1949. Mais en regard de ces d\u00e9penses devaient s'aligner des pr\u00e9visions de recettes, lesquelles constituaient une inconnue doublement imp\u00e9n\u00e9trable, d'abord parce que le nombre des membres de l'Union qui allaient payer une cotisation \u00e9tait ind\u00e9termin\u00e9, et ensuite parce que aucun des d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s pr\u00e9sents ne voulait ni ne pouvait engager son mandant, gouvernement ou organisation, \u00e0 payer une cotisation dont le chiffre ne lui e\u00fbt pas \u00e9t\u00e9 pr\u00e9ala- blement soumis. Apr\u00e8s de longs \u00e9changes de vue, la solution fut con\u00e7ue sous la forme suivante : Ainsi que le pr\u00e9cise l'article IX de la Constitution, le budget de l'Union se subdivise en un budget administratif et un budget d'ex\u00e9cution. \u2014 30 \u2014 Le budget administratif est fix\u00e9 par l'Assembl\u00e9e. En prin- cipe, son maximum est \u00e9tabli avec prudence et parcimonie, de telle mani\u00e8re que m\u00eame dans une conjoncture financi\u00e8re tr\u00e8s d\u00e9favorable, l'institution puisse \u00eatre assur\u00e9e que le fonctionne- ment de ses services administratifs ne sera pas entrav\u00e9 par insuffisance de ressources. Le budget d'ex\u00e9cution, \u00e0 rencontre du pr\u00e9c\u00e9dent, ne peut ni ne doit \u00eatre fix\u00e9 d'avance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b59a2e1-0e29-462c-a2bd-5504aa1052c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b59a2e1-0e29-462c-a2bd-5504aa1052c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Union internationale pour la protection de la nature cr\u00e9\u00e9e \u00e0 Fontainebleau, le 5 octobre 1948", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b7230d996b312d28205fb1232b56211e5ce1f868e039bb4851c607279b16443"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a805579-f001-4a18-8265-bddca18b9b3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/fr/resources/litterature-grise/union-internationale-pour-la-protection-de-la-nature-creee", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b418d0ce33867a851a1a2f10f089dcbd3293d7734fbae44c2c2ed14d2dfda211"}}, "hash": "d9d5e8aade0be07d0346e60eba088149bb508041b591cacd1e5be1ec96b65fe6", "text": "C'est l'abondance des cotisations pay\u00e9es qui, apr\u00e8s d\u00e9duction du montant des d\u00e9penses corres- pondant au budget administratif, en d\u00e9termine a -posteriori le chiffre. Inform\u00e9 de la masse de man\u0153uvre qui se constitue ainsi \u00e0 sa disposition, le Comit\u00e9 Ex\u00e9cutif a qualit\u00e9 (art.

La r\u00e9ponse est simple : chacun fixe librement le montant de sa contribution. L'Union fait confiance \u00e0 ceux qui ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui donner la vie. Des suggestions ont \u00e9t\u00e9 formul\u00e9es par le Comit\u00e9 Financier, car il \u00e9tait n\u00e9cessaire d'indiquer un ordre de grandeur si l'on voulait, d'une part, guider les participants en fixant quelque peu leurs id\u00e9es, et, d'autre part, se figurer une approximation, m\u00eame tr\u00e8s lointaine, d'une pr\u00e9vision de recettes. Voici ces suggestions, primitivement formul\u00e9es en francs suisses, mais converties ici en dollars des \u00c9tats-Unis (en for\u00e7ant pour arrondir les chiffres), conform\u00e9ment au v\u0153u exprim\u00e9 par l'Assembl\u00e9e G\u00e9n\u00e9rale au cours de sa derni\u00e8re r\u00e9union : A. \u2014 Gouvernements (gradation pr\u00e9vue en fonction de la population du pays consid\u00e9r\u00e9). 1'.

Attention : Le libell\u00e9 de la Constitution de l'Union ne permet pas en Belgique l'octroi de la personnalit\u00e9 civile \u00e0 l'institution par simple arr\u00eat\u00e9 royal. Il faut un acte l\u00e9gislatif dont la pr\u00e9pa- ration, d\u00e9j\u00e0 engag\u00e9e, et la promulgation prendront plusieurs mois. En attendant cette promulgation, un ch\u00e8que ou un transfert de fonds effectu\u00e9 au seul nom de l'U.I.P.N. ne peut \u00eatre encaiss\u00e9 par le Secr\u00e9tariat. De m\u00eame, une lettre recom- mand\u00e9e adress\u00e9e \u00e0 1' \u00ab Union Internationale pour la Protection de la Nature, 42, rue Montoyer \u00bb, n'est pas d\u00e9livr\u00e9e par l'Administration des Postes, aucun mandataire de l'Union ne pouvant, jusqu'\u00e0 nouvel ordre, \u00eatre valablement d\u00e9sign\u00e9.

Para alcanzar este amplio objetivo, eI programa MAB ha adoptado un m\u00e9todo ecol\u00f3gico integrado para el an\u00e1Iisis de tas interacciones del hombre con los diferentes tipos de ecosistemas o sistema de utilizaci\u00f3n humana. EI m\u00e9todo destaca Ia importancia del estudio de Ia estructura y funcionamiento de los sistemas ecol\u00f3g\u00edcos y su n\u00a1dalidad de reacci\u00f3n cuando se exponen a la intervenci\u00f3n humana; resalta Ia inftuencia del hombre sobre el- medio' pero tarnbi\u00e9n la influencia del medio sobre el hornbre. El MAB es fundamentalmente un programa de investigaci\u00f3n y capacitaci\u00f3n. No es un programa de gesti\u00f3n, sino que m\u00e1s bien trata de proporcionar Ia informaci\u00f3n cient\u00edfica objetiva - desde dentro de las ciencias na\u00c8urales y sociales - en que puede basarse una gesti\u00f3n racional. Se orienta hacia la soluci\u00f3n de problemas pr\u00e1cticos concretos de direcci\u00f3n y de conservaci\u00f3n de los recursos naturales renovables.

La conservaci\u00f3n de los recursos naturales, es decir, la capacidad de autorrenovaci\u00f3n del aire y del agua puros, de Ia fertilidad del suelo y de los conjuntos de genes, constituye la verdadera base del programa de 1as reservas de Ia biosfera.

Si bien en novienbre de 1978 se hab\u00edan establecido 144 reservas de la biosfera, a\u00fan gueda mucho por hacer para completar esta red. EI problema de Ia selecci\u00f3n puede enfocarse de dos maneras : una ser\u00eda Ia distribuci\u00f3n de especies de plantas y animales, que conducen a Ia definici\u00f3n de regiones gue son distintas biogeogr\u00e1ficamente; Ia otra, se apoyar\u00eda en las formaciones estructurales de vegetaci\u00f3n y en los animales asociados biomas. Ambas son v\u00e1Iidas. 1- Research Park e Envi ronmen Great Snoky llountain National Park Carolirre du Nord L2. euienes conceden Ia m\u00e1xina importancia a la conservaci\u00f3n del mayor n\u00famero de especies y a ]a diversidad g\u00e9netica, tienen mayor inter\u00e9s \u00a1rcr eI primer enfoque. Los que se interesan especialmente al an\u00e1lisis comparado de los ecosisistemas, tienden a destacar el segundo. De hechor para crcmpletar la red de reservas de Ia biosfera deben tomarse en cuenta a\u00a1nbos enfoques y realmente no es muy importan\u00c8e cual de ellos se considere primero. Es posible observar cada provincia biogeogr\u00e1fica *, identificar los principales ecosistemas que en ella aparecen y seleccionar en cada una, una reserva de Ia biosfera. Igualmente puede considerarse uno de los principales tipos de formaci\u00f3n de vegetaci\u00f3n y seleccionar una muestra co\u00cd\u00eco reserva de la biosfera en cada lugar en que sea biogeogr\u00e1ficamente distinta. En eI Seminario regionat de Ia Unesco sobre t\u00e9cnicas para selecci\u00f3n de reservas de Ia biosfera, celebrado en Australia y Nueva Zelandiar en octubre - noviembre de L977, se recomendaron los siguientes procedimientos : a) Establecimiento de un equipo de trabajo interdisciplinario nacional o regional encargado de preparar un sistema apropiado de clasificaci\u00f3n de ecosistemas adecuados para los proyectos dentro del MAB I (se sugiri\u00f3 que ello mejorar\u00eda Ia clasificaci\u00f3n de Udvardy para uso local y que definir\u00eda los principales ecosistemas en cada pa\u00eds).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f1cfd59-6609-4782-87e7-8219440cdfd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f1cfd59-6609-4782-87e7-8219440cdfd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/la-reserva-de-la-biosfera-y-su-relacion-con-otras-areas-protegidas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "La Reserva de la biosfera y su relaci\u00f3n con otras \u00e1reas protegidas", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/la-reserva-de-la-biosfera-y-su-relacion-con-otras-areas-protegidas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b071b135bb9675b4b323c5c140a1da46a22da5dcd92b326593f2cb466e82eb36"}, "3": {"node_id": "f0be8580-5d00-443e-ac0c-ff950d6ea83e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/es/resources/literatura-gris/la-reserva-de-la-biosfera-y-su-relacion-con-otras-areas-protegidas", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21fdb0d3d62ac4cfda34d891d27e97fca9f87b40e4540d830f00248d1876e3f1"}}, "hash": "d8ffaff3377c433870a515ea23dd4bf38905a27a2e7f487b7b0c8481fc1bd845", "text": "b) Aplicaci\u00f3n de este sistema de clasificaci\u00f3n de los principales ecosistemas a los recursos de terreno del territorio nacional para hacer mapas y descripciones de Ios ecosistemas principales. c) Evaluaci\u00f3n de los recursos existentes para determinar las lagunas actuales en el alcance de los principales ecosistemas, para a\u00f1adir nuevas reservas o suplementar las ya existentes para satisfacer los criterios de reservas de la biosfera. d) Designaci\u00f3n de reservas de la biosfera para abarcar la diversidad de ecosistemas principales dentro del territorio naciona\u00cc, teniendo en cuenta los programas de los paises cplindantes con ecosistemas semejant.es. De lo anterior se deduce que el establecimiento de una red ideal de reservas de Ia biosfera requiere que cada naci\u00f3n evalue sus principales ecosistemas, as\u00ed como Ia medida en que estos est\u00e1n o no conservados. Tambi\u00e9n requiere un grado considerable de cooperaci\u00f3n regional para conseguir que las naciones vecinas complenenten sus esfuerzos y que asi se complete la extensi\u00f3n de los ecosistemas principales. * La clasificaci\u00f3n de las provincias biogeogr\u00e1ficas (Udvardy, 1975) la realiz\u00f3 Ia UICN, con asistencia de la Unesco, para contribuir a la selecci\u00f3n de reservas de la biosfera. 13. Como es natural, no podr\u00e1 completarse inmediatamente y de manera satisfactoria esa red de reservas de Ia biosfera. Sin embargor la finalidad constante de las organizaciones nacionales apropiadas, incluyendo los comit\u00e9s del MAB es conseguir ese ideal, tanto a trav\u00e9s de sus reservas nacionales cofl\u00eco en la contribuci\u00f3n que a\u00a1rcrten a la red internacional.

Por consiguiente' es esencial que Ia legislaci\u00f3n de cada pa\u00eds les conceda protecci\u00f3n adecuada y a largo plazo, asi cono los fondos y personal necesarios para su gesti\u00f3n. Es posible c-onceder protecci\u00f3n jur\u00eddica en virtud de la legislaci\u00f3n existente sobre las \u00e1reas protegidas. En realidad, ser\u00eda qu\u00edz\u00e1 mejor que no exista una nueva legistaci\u00f3n espec\u00edfica para las reservas de Ia biosfera' ya que es dif\u00edcil establecer la definici\u00f3n del t\u00e9rmino'rreserva de la biosfera\" y porque puede asumir distintas formas en diferentes paises, cada una de ellas amparadas en Ia exactitud de la tey.

RESUMET! Y CONCLUSION a) La reserva de la biosfera se establece para una combinaci\u00f3n especial de fines que no constituyen duplicaci\u00f3n con ninguna otra categor\u00eda de \u00e1reas protegidas. b) Parte o Ia totalidad de las \u00e1reas protegidas de otras categor\u00cdas pueden incluirse en una reserva de Ia biosfera a condici\u00f3n de gue satisfagan los criterios para su inclusi\u00f3n, (por ejemplo, en los Estados Unidos incluyen partes de los parques nacionales, bosques nacionales, reservas ecol\u00f3gicas experimentalesr cuencas experimentales, etc. i y en el Reino Unido, las reservas nacionales existentes). c) Esto no c-onducir\u00e1 a ning\u00fan cambio en la situaci\u00f3n jur\u00edaica de esas \u00e1reas. Por ejemplo, si se encuentran dentro c1e un parque nacional o de una reserva natural estricta pueden continuar est\u00e1ndolo. d) Por otra parte, se piensa que el programa de reservas de la biosfera aportar\u00e1 una contribuci\u00f3n complementaria importante a los progra\u00a1nas nacionales e internacionales de conservaci\u00f3n y de investigaci\u00f3n de ecos is temas . e) No se espera que la red de reservas de la biosfera, incluso cuando est\u00e9 completa, d\u00e9 satisfacci\u00f3n a todas las necesidades de conservaci\u00f3n biol\u00f3gica, nacional, regional o internacional. Deber\u00e1 complementarse con o\u00c8ros programas m\u00e1s detallados. El intento de crear una red nundial de reservas de Ia biosfera constituye una inicia\u00c8iva nueva e importante en nuestros esfuerzos para asegurar eI porvenir de la humanidad. El programa insiste en Ia relaci\u00f3n entre el hombre y la naturaleza. Para que tenga \u00e9xito deber\u00e1 preservar zonas inalteradas de la naturaleza co\u00a1rp dep\u00f3sitos gen\u00e9ticos y corric patrones frente a los se puedan medir y juzgar los cambios exteriores. fgualmente deben incluir aI honbre y sus actividades. Si se maneja con imaginaci\u00f3n podr\u00e1 aportar una excelente oportunidad de mejorar Ia conprensi\u00f3n de los problemas de la biosfera y de que la poblaci\u00f3n, especialmente local, in\u00c8ervenga en Ia c\u00fenservaci\u00f3n e investigaci\u00f3n que tiene una relaci\u00f3n vital con su propio futuro. 20.
