This is uniquely the case in India, where members of the municipal bodies may be appointed because they have special knowledge or experience of municipal management.

While the need to co-opt \u201cresource persons\u201d onto Municipal Councils is not disputed, questions need to be raised about the democratic legitimacy of such appointments. \u25cf Council voting issues. One discussion surrounding appointed councillors is the extent to which they are voting or non-voting. In this respect, countries have opted for different solutions. 2.2 Underlying electoral systems Key contrasts No electoral system is perfect; certain systems address better some policy goals, others better serve other goals. But clearly the electoral system has important implications for the way in which local councils will conduct their political affairs and the roles and functions that they can perform. This is particularly true for decisions with respect to plurality-majoritarian versus proportional representation/PR, which can produce very different outcomes with respect to representation. The type of electoral system design can have a significant impact on a range of issues. One of the most important issues to consider is the balance between representation and accountability. Representation ensures that those who are elected reflect the choice of the electorate, in terms of who will speak for it and the extent to which they actually do so. Concerns for representation focus on proportionality \u2013 that is, ensuring that political, gender, minority, regional, population and other concentrations are equitably represented. Accountability, on the other hand, ensures that voters can call their representatives to account for decisions made in their name. In a democratic society, representation would normally be inclusive and accountability vertical and horizontal; however, the type of electoral system in place usually means some kind of tradeoff between these (and other) considerations. It is generally thought that PR electoral systems favour representation because they tend to produce electoral results more reflective of actual voting patterns, whereas plurality-majority systems are thought to enhance accountability because they give voters a representative with whom to identify. This may not always be true, however, as proportional systems can concentrate power in parties\u2019 rather than voters\u2019 hands \u2013 and having an identifiable representative in a plurality-majority system may not necessarily translate into greater accountability from this person to the electorate. As shown in Table 2, there are three major \u201cfamilies\u201d of electoral systems: Plurality-Majority; PR; and Mixed. Plurality-Majority systems focus on the person or persons who win the most votes \u2013 if the margin of victory is 50 percent + 1, it is an absolute majority, and if the victory is simply based on the most votes but not a majority, it is a plurality (for example, if Candidate A wins 30 percent of the vote, Candidate B 30 percent and Candidate C 40 percent, Candidate C wins despite not securing an absolute majority of the votes). Plurality-majority systems tend to be candidate-focused and often geographically specific, which perhaps explains their apparent dominance in LG systems. PR systems tend to be more party-focused and normally establish a threshold of some kind under which parties or candidates cannot be elected. They are designed to reflect in the composition of elected institutions, to the extent possible, the percentages in which the electorate voted. 22 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Mixed systems are a combination of plurality-majority with PR, usually with the intention of correcting some of the disproportionality that can result from plurality-majority systems.

It should be noted that different models of electoral representation can be used for different types of election in the same LG system. In Indonesia, for example, current electoral arrangements for LG use: \u25cf A PR system as the basis for the election of provincial, regional and city DPRDs (or councils) \u25cf A two-round,or runoff, majoritarian system for the election of the heads of LGs. These types of election were provided for under laws enacted in 2004. In Sri Lanka and Cambodia, on the other hand, where councils are also elected on a PR basis, council leaders are selected from parties that dominate local councils. Table 3 summarizes the underlying principles in local electoral systems in the countries covered by this Guide. Ward-based plurality-majoritarian systems People identify closely with the area in which they live and feel common interests with others sharing their part of the LG jurisdiction (village, neighbourhood and so forth.). For this reason, many local electoral systems feature a ward (small district), neighbourhood or sub-municipal system of electoral boundary delimitation, with a specific councillor or set of councillors representing the ward. For the most part, such ward-based systems are associated with majoritarian electoral processes, such as FPTP. A number of issues, both positive and negative, need to be considered when looking at LG electoral systems formulated on ward-based, majoritarian principles. The ward-based system is usually seen as a powerful way of ensuring clear lines of accountability to constituents. Each ward has its representative(s), and voters know to whom they can turn to on local governance issues. In the countries covered by this Guide, ward-based representation in LG is used in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Fiji, India, Nepal, Timor-Leste, PNG, Solomon Islands and Viet Nam. It is also used in Pakistan, but for relatively large wards (unions) that are multi-member jurisdictions. Ward-based, plurality-majority systems such as FPTP, or single-member district races where the person with the most votes wins, also have the virtue of being relatively simple. They usually involve quite simple ballots and choices by voters and lend themselves to quick, easy tabulation of results. In that respect, such local electoral systems are relatively well-suited to countries where literacy amongst voters is limited and administrative resources for electoral management are scarce.",

Source: Adapted from Larsen, Roome and Shotton (2004) and Ellis (2004). While ward-based electoral systems can be beneficial in terms of ensuring accountability and being relatively simple, they can also be problematic when minorities or politically weak groups within ward or sub-municipal boundaries are not fully represented. Clearly, the extent to which this is problematic depends largely on the definition of electoral districts; where they correspond closely to geographic concentrations of otherwise minority or disadvantaged groups, then the ward system allows for their representation. However, this is not always the case \u2013 and it is perhaps not surprising, then, that many ward-based systems (Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam) also include some form of affirmative action policies to ensure representation of minorities or disadvantaged. 24 Table 3: Summary of local electoral systems for councils in the Asia-Pacific region DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Notes: P-M = Plurality-Majoritarian; FPTP = First-Past-The-Post; TRS = Two-Round System; SNTV = Single Non-Transferable Vote; PR = Proportional Representation; BV = Block Vote Electoral system Country Directly elected lower-tier LG Councils Directly elected upper-tier LG Councils Afghanistan District Councils: Mixed \u2013 SNTV Mixed \u2013 SNTV Bangladesh UPs: P-M, FPTP, single-member ward constituencies N/A Bhutan GYTs: P-M, FPTP N/A Cambodia Commune Councils: PR-List N/A China Villagers\u2019 Committees: P-M, elements of TRS and Block Vote N/A Fiji All Municipal and City Councils: P-M, FPTP, multi-member ward constituencies India All LG Councils (rural and urban, all tiers): P-M, FPTP, single-member ward constituencies Indonesia All DPRDs (provincial, regency and city): PR Open List Iran Village Cuncils: P-M, multi- member ward constituency N/A Malaysia No local elections N/A Maldives IDCs: P-M, Block Vote N/A Mongolia Citizens\u2019 Representatives Hurals (aimag and N/A soum): P-M, FPTP in single-member districts Nepal Village Councils: P-M, FPTP, multi-member N/A ward constituencies Pakistan UCs: P-M, FPTP, using the entire UC as a multi-member N/A constituency Papua LLG Councils: P-M, FPTP, single-member N/A New Guinea ward constituencies Philippines Barangay Councils: P-M, Block Vote Municipal and City Councils, Provincial Boards: P-M, FPTP, single-member district constituencies Republic of Lower-level Councils: P-M, FPTP Upper-level Councils: 9 of 10 by P-M, FPTP; Korea 10th by PR Solomon All Councils (provincial, city, town): P-M, FPTP, single- member ward constituencies Islands Sri Lanka Pradeshi Sabhas, Urban and Municipal Councils: PR-List N/A Thailand TAO: Multi-member ward constituency, P-M, FPTP PAO: Single-member ward constituency, FPTP Timor-Leste Suco Councils: P-M, FPTP, single member aldeia (ward) N/A constituencies for aldeia representatives and multi-member suco constituency for other members Viet Nam All People\u2019s Councils (commune, district and province): P-M, FPTP using multi-member electoral units 25 On the other hand, whereas the PR system is often held to promote representation of women, evidence exists that local elections based on ward representation may improve women\u2019s chances of being elected, given that women candidates are more likely to be known to voters in their local communities than in an at-large election across a much larger district. Wards can also enable more women to stand for election because campaigning costs are not as high as in a district or citywide election.

A high number of wasted votes matters not only because it means that elected representatives may actually represent very few voters, but also because it can discourage voters from feeling their vote counts and thus reducing popular participation and confidence in the local electoral process.

Finally, plurality-majoritarian systems are often thought to favour fewer and larger political parties, which are able to deploy more resources to mobilize votes for their candidates. Whether this is a \u201cgood\u201d or a \u201cbad\u201d outcome depends on one\u2019s perspective. At the same time, because P-M systems (especially FPTP) tend to be candidate-focused, they are also thought to favour independent or non-partisan candidates; again, how far this is desirable depends on circumstances and somewhat ideological considerations. PR systems PR systems, in contrast, offer the chance of greater plurality in representation, by assigning council seats to parties on the basis of the proportion of the vote they obtain. In many respects, PR systems seem intrinsically more \u201cdemocratic.\u201d They are also better able to handle the issue of minority and politically weaker groups than are FPTP systems; women and other disadvantaged groups can, however modestly, usually ensure some representation through PR. Not surprisingly, then, PR systems (such as Indonesia, Cambodia and Sri Lanka) tend toward few or weak affirmative action provisions intended to safeguard the interests of such groups. PR systems, significantly, lead to many fewer wasted votes. Beyond a certain threshold, all parties that contest an election will end up being represented on local councils. This \u2013 in theory \u2013 means that almost every vote really does \u201ccount\u201d and thus increases the likelihood of popular participation and confidence in the local electoral process. Representational arrangements and electoral systems 26 However, PR-type systems (such as those used in Sri Lanka, Cambodia and Indonesia) tend to have several drawbacks: \u25cf A limitation on the ability of councillors to represent the specific interests and needs of their constituent geographic communities to government at higher levels, and to communicate planning outcomes and other information to the community level, in a balanced and consistent fashion \u25cf A somewhat diluted accountability on the part of individual councillors, since each councillor will not represent a specific village or cluster of villages, and since individual citizens do not and cannot know who \u201ctheir\u201d representative is \u25cf The need for PR constituencies to be relatively large (in order for proportionality to have any meaning), which further reduces the links between those who are elected and their constituents \u25cf In party list systems, individual councillors may feel greater loyalty to their central or local party organization, to whom they are beholden for their place on the list, than to the locality they supposedly represent \u25cf A tendency not to accommodate independent candidates, given the need to submit electoral lists rather than stand as individual candidates \u25cf A potential for gridlock in decision making, especially when large numbers of parties are able to ensure only limited representation These drawbacks of PR-based systems can be partly remedied in a number of ways: \u25cf It can be stipulated that all listed candidates must be longstanding local residents and be locally vetted, and that council members be replaced or sanctioned if there are citizen complaints regarding failure to fulfil their representational duties, etc. \u25cf Lists can be made open (as in Indonesia), thus allowing local voters to express particular preference for specific candidates on party lists.

This is illustrated for Cambodia in the inset below. Representational arrangements and electoral systems Taking into account the local dimension in Cambodia One feature of the commune-level governance system in Cambodia is the emergence of complementary forms of \u201cterritorial representation\u201d and their articulation with the formal political/party-based, representation system embodied by the Commune Councils. Each commune consists of a number of villages, but the local electoral system does not ensure that every village in a commune will have a representative in the Commune Council. This highlights the risk that the attention and resources of the Council may be biased in favour of only those villages where elected councillors live, or from which they originate. Village-based representative structures, playing both an extension and advisory role vis-\u00e0-vis the formal Councils, are essential to address the above risk and improve local governance overall. One such structure, whose establishment is mandated by the commune planning regulations, is the Commune Planning and Budgeting Committee (PBC). This advisory body has a critical function in local public expenditures management; each village is represented by two persons (one man and one woman). These representatives may be able to voice the concerns of their villages, learn about and assess higher-order, commune-level priorities as well as influence commune-level resource allocations and impart political education back in their own communities. Overall, however, the articulation of village-based structures with elected Commune Councils remains a critical and controversial point in the effort to foster community representation and participation in local-level governance. Such articulation should be clarified and strengthened, once the selection \u2013 hopefully, the election \u2013 of village chiefs and village chief assistants has been regulated by the Ministry of Interior. This is one of the important outstanding regulations of the Law on Commune/Sangkhat Administrative Management (the \u201cCommune Law\u201d).

The coherence of their programmes, ideologies and leadership has a major impact on local democratic development. Political parties play an important role in enabling and limiting representation at the local level and have important implications for centre-local relations. This section of the Guide will synthesize what little is known about the dynamics of political parties at the local level. 3.1 The logic of political parties The growth in political parties over the last century has coincided with the increase in elections. The prevailing theory is that with elections there arise a number of needs beyond what traditional executive and legislature structures can provide and which must be met to make elective democracy work. The functions that political parties typically serve in a democratic system, albeit to varying degrees at the national versus local level, are: \u25cf The aggregation of interests: A fundamental goal of political parties is to win power, and to do so, they must persuade voters to support them on a variety of issues. This is one way in which political parties differ from both civil society organizations, which do not compete for power, and lobbying groups, which represent a single issue. \u25cf Structuring the vote: This entails giving coherence to voter choices beyond the selection of individual candidates per se. \u25cf Integration and mobilization of the mass public: This includes the organization of election campaigns but also spills over into fostering non-election-related civic engagement and participation. \u25cf Fostering future political leaders: Political parties serve as a training ground for future political leaders, both within the party and in future governments. \u25cf Organization of government: This refers to when a party wins executive power and its expectation that the party representatives in the legislature will support its policies. \u25cf Influence or formation of public policy: Akin to civil society organizations, parties can serve as a significant source of new policy ideas that then become or influence government policy. 31 Role of political parties As noted above, political parties in a democratic system typically serve these functions. The roles and functions of a political party in a non-democratic system (or of a group acting like a political party in a non-party or one-party system) might touch on some of the above functions, but will not cover all.

At a local level, parties are far more likely to aggregate interests, foster future political leaders, mobilize voters and public opinion, and influence the formation of local policy, than they are to affect the national agenda or influence formation of a government. 3.2 Where there are no parties Political parties also raise distinct issues at the local level vis-\u00e0-vis the national level. First is the question of whether political parties are needed or add value to local governance, or whether other forms of aggregating and expressing political interests \u2013 direct democracy or town hall-style meetings \u2013 would serve small communities just as well, if not better. This issue has emerged in one-party or no-party states where local governance is perhaps more dynamic than at the national level (e.g., Viet Nam). This embodies the idea that contestability can take many forms (e.g., local contestability in China or Viet Nam can exist without national contestability). At the same time, if one accepts the premise outlined above that political parties do more than aggregate society\u2019s interests and also seek and exercise power on the people\u2019s behalf, then they should also play a crucial role in the formation and running of LGs. In one-party States, such as Viet Nam, local elections do indeed take place \u2013 and do provide a framework for political competition. However, they do so in mitigated ways, and thus provide the local electorate with a necessarily limited choice. As can be seen from the Viet Nam case study, independent, non-party candidates can stand for local (and national) elections. But all candidates (whether party on non-party) must initially be screened by a range of institutions, such as the Fatherland Front, closely linked to the Communist Party of Viet Nam. This effectively ensures that all candidates speak more or less the same \u201cpolitical language\u201d (that of the Party) and thus implies limited variations in the political programmes of candidates. 3.3 Party politics and local elections \u2013 tensions? At the same time, in several multi-party democracies there have been attempts to \u201cde-politicize\u201d LG by formally proscribing party candidacies at the local level. This is the case in Philippines, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Table 4 provides baseline information on whether political parties are allowed to contest local elections, for each country covered in this Guide. The experience suggests that this formal exclusion of partisan candidacies in reality does not \u201cdisconnect\u201d local politics from national political parties \u2013 and it is also debatable whether such disconnection is healthy anyway. In some countries, understandable concern exists that parties can override local accountabilities and thus break the link between citizens and their representatives at the local level, although this is much more pronounced in countries with electoral systems based on PR principles. This was apparently one reason for recent changes in the Indonesian electoral system at both national and local levels \u2013 from a Closed to an Open List form of PR, providing voters with the opportunity to make their preferences for individual candidates clearer. Moving toward an Open List PR system in Indonesia was about trying to reduce the power of party executives to select candidates and providing local citizens with more say in which individuals (as opposed to which parties) represent them in DPRDs at national, provincial, regency and city levels. 32 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Table 4: Provisions for political parties When political parties are Political parties allowed/ allowed \u2013 independent Country not allowed candidates allowed/not allowed Special provisions Afghanistan Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election Bangladesh Political parties are not N/A allowed Bhutan Political parties are N/A not allowed Cambodia Political parties are allowed Candidates must be included on the electoral list of a political party in order to stand for election China Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election Fiji Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election India Regulations on political Regulations on political parties parties provided under provided under state legislation state legislation Indonesia Political parties are allowed Independent candidates are not Parties standing for allowed election are required to be established in at least half of the provinces Iran Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election Malaysia No local election N/A Maldives Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election 33 Role of political parties Table 4: Provisions for political parties (continued) When political", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8770d7e2-8e23-4f98-b8e0-2e06ccbaa073": {"__data__": {"id_": "8770d7e2-8e23-4f98-b8e0-2e06ccbaa073", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d235dce34677316fa4da8986b66941b523dbcee89e95fc2102aa1f5d45226d05"}}, "hash": "d235dce34677316fa4da8986b66941b523dbcee89e95fc2102aa1f5d45226d05", "text": "parties are Political parties allowed/ allowed \u2013 independent Country not allowed candidates allowed/not allowed Special provisions Mongolia Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand Independent for election candidates who collect more then 151 citizens\u2019 signatures for aimag/capital hural and more then 75 for soum/district hural can be nominated for election Nepal Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election Pakistan Political parties are not N/A allowed Papua Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand New Guinea for election Philippines Political parties are not Independent candidates may stand allowed in barangay for election elections but are allowed at all other levels of LG Republic of Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand Korea for election Solomon Islands Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election Sri Lanka Political parties are allowed Independent groups may stand for election provided that they submit a list of candidates Thailand Political parties are allowed Independent candidates may stand for election Timor-Leste Political parties are allowed Legislation does not specify whether or not independent candidates may stand for election Viet Nam Candidates for political Independent candidates may stand Candidates are in organizations may stand for election effect subject to a for election selection/election process prior to the actual election 34 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Zilla Panchayat meeting, Bangladesh In other cases, it can be argued that de-politicizing LG elections reduces the potential for tensions between different LG tiers. However, in the case of upper-tier LG Councils being largely elected indirectly by lower-tier Councils (e.g., Pakistan, partly in Philippines), this should not be as much of an issue as when upper tiers are directly elected (e.g., Indonesia). In countries where national political contests are open to parties, the de-politicization of LG elections can be particularly controversial. In Pakistan, for example, the Local Government Ordinance does not allow political parties to contest local elections \u2013 even though political parties are a vibrant component of national political life. In practice, however, local elections in Pakistan have clearly been contested by the parties. In the 2005 local elections, for example, the Commonwealth Expert Team noted that although the local bodies\u2019 elections were, by law, held on a non-party basis, in reality political parties were at the heart of the process \u2013 candidates were openly supported by political parties, and the media reported extensive party involvement. The issue in Pakistan, moreover, is one of the extent to which certain parties (i.e., those dominant at the national level) are able to exploit this situation, by tacitly providing substantial support to \u201ctheir\u201d candidates, through the machinery of government, while also decrying any involvement/support by other parties. This does not amount to a level playing field \u2013 and certainly does little to foster independent candidacies. In the case of Pakistan, reasonable grounds exist for recommending (as did the Commonwealth Expert Team) that the law be amended to permit the involvement of political parties in local elections, while taking measures to ensure full protection of the rights of independent candidates to stand unhindered (see Commonwealth Expert Team 2005). In general, the evidence from Asia seems to be that in countries where there are political parties, they should be allowed to contest local elections. Excluding them from LG loses more than it gains and is usually unrealistic anyway. In particular, the possibilities of regulating the processes for political party engagement are lost. Perhaps more important, then, is the need to ensure political space for independent local candidates, thus avoiding excessive party influence in the local electoral process. 35 Role of political parties 3.4 National, regional, local and \u201cspecial-interest\u201d parties? In countries will long local democratic traditions, such as India, some parties may be particularly strong at regional and local levels but may not be represented well \u2013 or at all \u2013 at national level. This situation is more likely to prevail in a highly decentralized state where local governance is well rooted. The spectrum of regionally significant but not nationally represented (or weakly represented) parties can be much richer in these contexts, and this will affect the range of policies and ideologies brought to bear in local governance. In some countries, however, the legislative framework more or less proscribes the emergence of regional or local parties. This is, for example, the case in Indonesia, where political parties must be registered in at least half the country\u2019s provinces. This legal provision, clearly motivated by the perceived need to counter regionalism, effectively means that local parties cannot develop in Indonesia. By the same token, in countries where the legal framework does not allow for official party", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ae52e63-959c-4189-a0cf-b88992fbc9c1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ae52e63-959c-4189-a0cf-b88992fbc9c1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fc0d4fa0073b2f1231120549f83945f724dc2b460c29dd562054b4bf00b2de1"}}, "hash": "1fc0d4fa0073b2f1231120549f83945f724dc2b460c29dd562054b4bf00b2de1", "text": "involvement in local elections (see above), the emergence of local parties is effectively forestalled. On the other hand, the legal framework in other countries offers few obstacles to the development of local or regional parties. This is the case in India and in Sri Lanka; it is also de facto the case in those countries that allow independent candidates to stand in local elections on the same basis as parties. A final issue worth noting concerns the ability of special-interest groups (such as farmers or other occupational groups) to contest local elections. In theory, this is not precluded by any electoral system. In practice, however, there appears to be little evidence of this kind of \u201cparty\u201d contesting local elections in most of the country case studies included in Part II of this Guide. 3.5 Strong national parties On the flip side of the above, parties that are very dominant at the national level -pparticularly those in new democracies where the party in power benefits from State resources and machinery \u2013 also typically have strong local cells. It is not uncommon in such contexts to see, for example, that the one or two big national parties have local offices in the regions, while the other \u201cnational\u201d parties, even if represented in the national legislature, are unable to do the same \u2013 either because of genuine lack of support or familiarity among potential constituents, or because of lack of resources. This phenomenon can result in a replication, in miniature, of national policies and ideologies at the local level. This would certainly appear to be the case in Cambodia, where the three major national parties thoroughly dominated the 2002 commune elections \u2013 with the party in power, the Cambodia People\u2019s Party (CPP), winning 61.2 percent of votes and 68.4 percent of all Commune Council seats, thus extending its dominance in national politics to local level as well. The second question that arises is what expression political parties take at the local level \u2013 their dynamism, their variation, their ability to perform their role \u2013 and how this affects local governance. Given that an increase in elections can help catalyze the development of political parties, local party structures of national parties or parties with local appeal might not have benefited from opportunities provided by LG elections to solidify their bases, develop their ideologies and learn how to govern. Local elections are typically the last priority of transitioning countries, and this is particularly true in post-conflict societies, where local elections took place many years after general elections (e.g., Cambodia) or have still not taken place (e.g., Timor-Leste and village- and district-level elections in Afghanistan). DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 3.6 Electoral systems and political parties at the local level The extent to which party machines can translate their dominance at national level into hegemony at local levels seems, however, to be influenced by the type of electoral system. In PR systems, political parties appear to exercise greater local influence than majoritarian systems; the latter, in principle, provide greater opportunities for smaller, more local parties to successfully contest elections, especially where multi-party political systems have recently emerged. Assuming there are competitive, multi-partisan elections, the type of electoral system used will directly affect the relative importance afforded to the party. For example, in FPTP systems regulations tend to involve individual candidates for office rather than political parties per se. This is because elections take the form of a set of contests in single-member electoral districts. FPTP systems thus tend to attach greater importance to the candidate, his/her interaction with and responsibility to constituents, and his/her competition with the other candidates. Nonetheless, FPTP does influence the nature of contesting political parties, which usually need fairly wide appeal in order to get elected. In general, then, FPTP favours fewer parties and often gives rise to a limited number of strong parties, rather than a larger number of small parties. Under PR, on the other hand, elections are primarily a contest between parties. Hence, parties need to be registered, and their central and regional organizations have greater influence over the selection of candidates (see discussion above on Open vs. Closed Lists). PR is generally thought to be the prototypical electoral system for encouraging the formation of political parties. In its List variety, PR encourages parties to think through their ideology and strategy in contesting elections, given that it is the party on which the voter is passing judgment (unless the lists are entirely open). At the same time, PR can minimize the party \u201cpenalty\u201d for poor performance, in that poorly performing parties can be returned to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c99c0d8-859b-48e4-bce2-1a91c5e76955": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c99c0d8-859b-48e4-bce2-1a91c5e76955", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6dd74d1f186a93e99c384e07ccb15ba3364e6794fb9280f6c911e1664773e307"}, "3": {"node_id": "b36df1b2-c0fa-4ed2-b95c-969e8746a5ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbd4504a81f11b7ebcdceaaf8e29a4359350db2eb04821bda2feba3804dde458"}}, "hash": "13a4f2a49d367fbf32a8b87745ea777e905ae2bf436ebfd6697b95ef04c36d3a", "text": "office time and again because they achieve the threshold of representation. PR can therefore artificially sustain poorly performing or otherwise fringe parties that would disappear under a more ruthless electoral system, and lead to a plethora of small parties. To try and ensure that parties are \u201cnational,\u201d some countries have minimum requirements to contest elections; for example, Indonesian parties must have offices in at least nine provinces to contest local and national elections. Beyond FPTP and PR, other models of representation include collective committee-based systems and systems where LGs or their leaders are selected by a higher level of government rather than directly elected at local level. Finally, there has been a rise in the popularity of alternative measures that can also spill over to the local level. This is partly a response to the poor performance and perception of political parties and their failure in many countries to play a constructive role in democracy. Such measures include allowing independent candidates for office, forming special-interest parties and anti-party movements, or focusing more on direct democracy by use of referenda, citizen initiatives and recall options. 36 youth, minorities and 4 Representation of women, the most disadvantaged 38 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Underlying the main types of representational system discussed in previous sections of this Guide is the fundamental democratic principle of ensuring fair and adequate representation for all social groups. Different systems try to do this in different ways. How far they succeed in providing for fair representation for all categories of citizens varies, however, depending on a range of circumstances. The two most common methods for ensuring the representation of various groups are (i) through putting in place electoral and political party systems that ensure better representation or (ii) through the introduction of quota systems and reserved seats. These options will be analyzed in this section. 4.1 Adaptation of systems to improve representation Firstly, the election system plays an important role in structuring representation. Majoritarian systems generally try to ensure representation on the basis of relatively small, ward-based constituencies, while PR systems, on the basis of larger constituencies, seek to ensure representation of as many parties (or the interest groups that they represent) as possible. It is generally assumed that PR (as opposed to majoritarian) systems yield outcomes that allow for more equitable representation, especially for women. However, evidence for this is equivocal \u2013 and a great deal depends on political parties and how they establish their electoral lists, as well as on the ways in which society at large views women. In Indonesia, under the pre-2004 electoral system, Closed List PR did remarkably little to ensure adequate or equitable representation for women, as the inset below shows. Clearly, PR as an electoral system is no guarantee of adequate representation for minorities, or women in societies where their position is such that political parties remain elite-dominated and/or patriarchal. Pre-2004 Indonesia, PR and women\u2019s representation Although Indonesia had a PR-based electoral system, the percentage of women members of the then-DPR (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, House of Representatives), MPR (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat, Consultative People\u2019s Assembly) or Regional Councils (DPRDs) was extremely low. About 9 percent of members of the DPR were women, with an even lower percentage in the DPRD I (province) and DPRD II (district or regency). In several provinces, there were no women members in some DPRD II. No woman held the position of provincial governor, and only 1.5 percent of regents/mayors, or six individuals, were women.

While indirect systems may provide for better geographic representation, direct systems are probably better equipped to ensure a more equitable socio-political representation.

At the same time, the inevitably higher costs of political campaigning in larger constituencies probably inhibit the successful involvement of poorer candidates. However, direct elections unequivocally increase the chances of non-elite representation. In sum, although elections to LG are intended to lead to a fair representation of constituents, this may not be the case. Minorities, indigenous peoples and disadvantaged groups often do not receive adequate representation or are unable to translate their demographic \u201cvoice\u201d into electoral representation. Local elites can project their power and resources into disproportionate levels of political representation. In order to address this issue, countries may introduce specific mechanisms to ensure the representation of these groups in various LG bodies. Third, many countries of the region have reviewed electoral systems and related provisions from the point of view of facilitating representation and influence of indigenous peoples and minorities. The United Nations Declaration on Indigenous Peoples (September 20075) emphasizes the political participation of indigenous peoples: Indigenous peoples have the right to participate in decision making in matters which would affect their rights, through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own indigenous decision-making institutions (Article 18). Where minorities are territorially concentrated, single-member electoral districts can increase the chances that those minorities will be represented. This requires careful \u201cdistricting\u201d which, in itself, assumes a sound knowledge about where minorities are concentrated. This is likely to be a successful strategy only if socio-political inequalities translate into parallel spatial differences, which is often \u2013 but not inevitably \u2013 the case for ethnic minorities or poorer urban classes. However, it may not be the situation for other disenfranchised or marginal groups, such as some low-caste groups in multi-caste villages in India and Nepal. PR systems can increase representation if minorities or disadvantaged groups are able to vote for \u201ctheir\u201d parties. However, in this case political parties must either be specifically minority-based or clearly committed to upholding minority interests. Preference voting, where voters can express preferences with regard to individuals on party lists, also may enable minority or disadvantaged voters to select candidates who they deem representative. Two drawbacks to this system are that it generally requires voter literacy (to be able to distinguish between the names of candidates) and is a relatively costly (especially if photos of candidates are used instead of names). In Asia-Pacific countries, minority or disadvantaged groups may be disproportionately illiterate, thus making preferential voting problematic for them; in addition, the costs may be too high for poorer countries, particularly for local elections. 5 http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23794 40 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS In addition, lower numerical thresholds for representation in the elected body may not necessarily advantage minorities or disadvantaged groups. Again, this depends on the existence of parties that uphold minority interests or are clearly identified with them. Despite these caveats, these measures nonetheless increase the likelihood of minorities, indigenous peoples or disadvantaged groups being represented. 4.2 Affirmative action through quotas and other mechanisms Of the countries covered in this Guide, most have adopted some provision for affirmative action of one kind or another. However, such provisions may vary between the different tiers and types of LG in a country. The exceptions to affirmative action measures are Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Fiji, Thailand and Solomon Islands. In countries where provisions have been made for the inclusion of minorities, indigenous peoples and disadvantaged groups, quotas and reserved seats appear preferred. In general, the systems for filling reserved seats fall into a number of categories \u2013 direct or indirect elections of different types (with quotas or reservations in one form or another), appointments and so forth. Some systems focus on candidates, others on seats. The following sections explore some of the ways of handling direct affirmative action in local electoral systems.

Reserved seats \u2013 elected representatives Several countries have used reserved seats as the basis for quotas in LG elections. India is one where far-reaching provisions for affirmative action have been made and are enshrined in the Constitution. Seats in LG bodies at all levels are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Tribes according to their proportion of the population, and at least one-third of seats are reserved for women. Similar quotas apply to local council leadership positions. 48 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS In some countries the number or composition of reserved seats is not predetermined. In Philippines a decision has to be made before the elections on which segments of society are to fill the three reserved seats at each level, one of which is always reserved for a woman. A further example is Timor-Leste where two women, two young people of each gender and one elder are to be directly elected to the Suco Council. Sri Lanka also makes provisions for seats to be reserved for the young, in addition to rather vague and weak constitutional provisions for promoting women\u2019s representation. Nepal, meanwhile, is an example where varying systems are applied at different levels of LG. At the lowest level, the ward, one out of five directly elected seats is reserved for women. A similar system is in place in Pakistan, although the number of reserved seats is considerably higher, in particular with regard to women. In contrast to the Nepali case, however, in Pakistan women are either directly elected (to Union Councils) or indirectly elected by the entire electoral college of the upper-level LG unit in question (tehsil, town, district). Pakistan\u2019s local electoral system also ensures that minority religious groups are represented. Before 2005, this was done by having a separate electoral roll for such groups, who then elected their representatives. Since 2005, however, minority and majority electoral rolls have been unified, even as reserved seats have been maintained. Viet Nam also presents an interesting case, in that no provisions are made for reservation of seats. However, when establishing the composition of the People\u2019s Councils and the list of candidates to stand for election, consideration is given to ensuring that women are represented, and that ethnic minorities are represented when part of the population is made up of ethnic minorities.In some cases, special provisions are made for the representation of peasants and workers in local representative bodies. In Pakistan, reserved seats ensure the inclusion of peasants (in rural areas), workers (in urban areas) and minorities at all levels of LG. Interestingly, however, no criterion in the Pakistan Local Government Ordinance 2001 specifies who qualifies as a candidate for the peasant/ worker seats. Party-based quotas for women in Namibian local government elections On the basis of constitutional provisions, Namibia\u2019s parliament adopted an affirmative action provision in the Local Authorities Act of 1992, which stipulated that the first local authority elections were to be conducted using a party list system and that party lists had to include at least two women for local authority councils with 10 or fewer members, and at least three women for councils with 11 or more members. This contributed to the fact that 37 percent of the local councillors elected in 1992 were women. In 1997 the Local Authorities Act was amended to allow for a second round of local authority elections to take place in 1998, using the party list system instead of changing to a ward-based system as stipulated by the Act. At this time the affirmative action measures were further strengthened, specifying that party lists had to include a minimum of three women on councils with 10 or fewer members, and at least five women on larger councils. This resulted in an increase of women\u2019s representation in LG up to 41 percent. More women have since entered office through by-elections, such that Namibia currently has 45 percent women at the local authority level, while 40 percent of mayors are women. The current president of the Association of Local Authorities in Namibia is a woman; two other female presidents preceded her.

Seats are reserved for the Hill Tribes in relation to their proportion of the population in the Hill Tracts. Non-indigenous people are, however, also elected to the Parishads.

Several examples of this can be cited. In Nepal, at village, municipal and district levels, seats are reserved for the poor, tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous peoples, of which a certain number must be women. These seats, however, are not filled by direct election. Instead, the ordinary members of the respective LG body (most of whom are indirectly elected by lower-level electoral colleges) elect representatives to fill these reserved seats. In PNG, women representatives are appointed to both the provincial assemblies and Local-Level Government (LLG) Councils. Interestingly, two women are appointed to rural LLG Councils, but only one to urban LLG Councils. This would appear to be in recognition of the reduced likelihood of women being directly elected to Councils in rural areas. In Philippines, steps have been taken beyond merely reserving seats for the young in that a separate LG body (the Youth Council) has been established; only those older than 15 but younger than 21 may stand for election as well as vote. A member of these bodies also serves in the other LG units. In addition, municipal and provincial councils in Philippines are required to appoint three \u201csectoral\u201d members, representing women, workers and other disadvantaged groups as necessary. 50 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS While such appointments do ensure some kind of representation for marginalized or socially disadvantaged groups, they are probably less satisfactory than direct elections with quotas. The legitimacy of appointees is likely to be considerably less than that enjoyed by elected members. In addition, the representativity of appointees may also be an issue, as well as the manner of their appointment. Outcomes of affirmative action How far do such affirmative action procedures lead to intended outcomes? In this section, this issue is briefly looked at, first with regard to women\u2019s representation (for which there is considerable documentation) and then with regard to other marginalized groups (for which there is less documented evidence). Women and affirmative action A number of countries provide striking examples of representational outcomes in the absence of strong affirmative action measures. In China, according to Article 8 of the Organic Law on Villagers\u2019 Elections, the Village Committees should include \u201can appropriate number of women,\u201d but apart from laws in some provinces to include at least one woman, the provisions in the Organic Law have not been operationalized. Statistics show that Village Committees on average have 16 percent women members but only 1 percent of Village Committee chairpersons are women \u2013 and in many places the number of women is declining. In Sri Lanka, a very small percentage of seats are occupied by women, in marked contrast to other South Asian countries (especially given the relatively high rates of schooling enjoyed by women in Sri Lanka). This low level of women\u2019s representation appears to be a direct function of the electoral system and of there being no reserved seats for women. In addition, the electoral system for LG in Sri Lanka is not ward-based but at-large. It is interesting to note that while quotas for women have so far been rejected in the country, wards have been recommended instead \u2013 to help more women get elected (Drage 2001). The same can be said of Cambodia, where no formal provisions exist for ensuring women\u2019s representation in Commune Councils. Cambodian women clearly are under-represented in relation to their electoral or demographic importance. Similarly, in Thailand the representation of women in the majority of councils can be measured in single-digit figures, with leadership roles far less frequent. Where affirmative action measures are in place, the outcomes are generally much better. In Nepal, where legal provisions ensure women\u2019s representation, some 24 percent of all elected members were women in the previously elected local bodies. In Bangladesh and Pakistan, roughly a third of all seats in LG are occupied by women, though some seats are not filled (see further below). The case of India is perhaps most striking in terms of the absolute outcomes of affirmative action in favour of women\u2019s representation in LG (33.3 percent), with more than 1 million women serving as councillors in LG. However, such aggregate outcomes should not be allowed to disguise the limits to affirmative action. To begin with, reserved seats for women may not actually be filled, through a lack of candidates or voter antipathy to affirmative action. Local elections in Pakistan\u2019s North West Frontier Province offer an example of this. 51 Representation of women, youth, minorities and the most disadvantaged In addition, provisions for the representation of women in councils do not necessarily translate into adequate representation in upper", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f42e9a88-7a60-42de-831d-f54ad510053e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f42e9a88-7a60-42de-831d-f54ad510053e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31c40477574e12307545f68815919c8d08b2445fbe27ecb7b83736ed789bc5ad"}}, "hash": "31c40477574e12307545f68815919c8d08b2445fbe27ecb7b83736ed789bc5ad", "text": "levels of the LG system (see previous chapter) or into executive or leadership positions. In Nepal in 1997, for example, more than 100,000 women participated in VDC elections and 36,000 were elected. However, in other branches of LG women were only marginally represented. For example, only 289 women were elected ward chairpersons out of about 36,000 wards. Of the 26 women who ran for membership in the District Development Committees, only eight were elected, and only one woman was elected vice chairperson. The same pattern emerges in Pakistan. As a result of the reservation system, a large number of women are now members of LG institutions (Union, Tehsil and District Councils). However, such relatively high levels of women\u2019s representation on LG councils are not replicated in an examination of locally elected leadership. Thus, while affirmative action procedures in local electoral systems go a long way toward ensuring representation, still more needs to be done to ensure representation at high levels \u2013 and to translate representation into influence and political voice. Finally, it is also worth looking at how affirmative action procedures can have unhelpful consequences. Special electoral arrangements often needed to ensure women\u2019s representation may create particular problems for women, as is made clear from Bangladesh. In Union Parishads (made up of nine wards), the 1997 legislation provided for affirmative action for women representatives. Under these affirmative action arrangements, three wards are reserved for one female member, but each is also the constituency of the general ward member (almost inevitably male). This means that elected women have three elected, usually male counterparts. This situation has created a problem on the Councils, as the men often do not want to recognize the women as legitimate representatives of their wards. Women\u2019s much larger constituencies than their male counterparts also pose problems \u2013 for example, the difficulty of meeting the expectations of such a large group. It is also harder for women to visit their wards and to meet transportation costs for such visits. These constraints compound all the other difficulties women face in a predominantly male preserve. Yet even so, elected women members have much greater legitimacy and acceptance than the pre-1997 nominated women members, beholden to the chairperson for his patronage. Moreover, there are signs that these women members are being given more specific responsibilities as chairpersons of specific parishad standing committees. In addition, with training, they are gradually assuming a greater role in UP affairs in general. Another case in point is in India, where Article 243D of the Constitution clearly directs that the reserved seats, for women as well as SC and ST, should be allotted by rotation to different constituencies in a panchayat. This has generally been interpreted to mean that such rotation should take place every five years. However, in that case no woman, SC or ST member is likely to occupy a seat for a second term, because it is improbable that these persons would be allowed to contest from the same constituency when the reservation is removed. Given that most women members in the panchayats have no prior experience and will therefore find it initially difficult to occupy positions of power, some find it unfair that a second term is prohibited. Because the provision of rotation applies to the SC/ST/woman chairpersons as well, local bureaucrats may obtain an upper hand in some places, given that they can be fairly certain that the chairperson has no chance of re-election. 52 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Finally, affirmative action in the form of reserved seats may have perverse consequences for minority or socially disadvantaged candidates for non-reserved seats. The 2005 elections for Bougainville\u2019s Autonomous Government (a more autonomous form of the usual Papuan Provincial Assembly) are a case in point. In Bougainville, while three of the 39 seats in the Assembly were reserved for women and were contested by 25 women candidates, there were apparently no women candidates for the 33 regular constituency seats \u2013 for which they were also entitled to stand. Commonwealth observers of the Bougainville elections had the impression that because of the reserved seats for women, many women felt that they were not \u201csupposed\u201d to contest the regular seats. Reserved seats, then, may actually discourage minority or socially disadvantaged candidates from contesting open seats. Maldives represents a similar example, where the existence of Women Development Committees at island level has led to regular Island Development Committees being considered as \u201cmen\u2019s committees.\u201d Disadvantaged groups Under the Indian Constitution, seats and the offices of chairpersons in all the three tiers of panchayats are reserved for SC and ST members in proportion", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bf4e3eb-e95a-4eee-820a-2fb3c0c41cd0": {"__data__": {"id_": "0bf4e3eb-e95a-4eee-820a-2fb3c0c41cd0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57e4d9de31368f417ec181aa01b33d2ecf760eec09ae371dd4a18832f64c67b6"}}, "hash": "57e4d9de31368f417ec181aa01b33d2ecf760eec09ae371dd4a18832f64c67b6", "text": "to their population. In addition, provisions are in place for state legislatures to make reservations for people of other backward castes (OBC). In accordance with this provision, at least 10 states have made reservation provisions for OBCs. However, despite statutory and administrative efforts to provide political space to such communities, panchayats have not been able to take effective measures to compensate for economic and social deprivation of marginalized people. In places where the grip of the dominant caste over the social system is very strong, many elected officials from weaker communities feel powerless, and the position of women belonging to SC/ST communities is even worse. In Nepal, none of the members in the previously elected District Development Committees were dalits. Evidence indicates that while reserved seats may translate into impressive quantitative outcomes, they cannot be a \u201cquick fix\u201d to the problem of deeply engrained hierarchy in much of Indian society. Notwithstanding such examples, reservation provisions have clearly contributed toward the inclusion of marginalized communities in the power structure of LG institutions. However, before perceptible changes can occur in such communities\u2019 effective involvement in local decision-making, much needs to be done. Youth Ensuring representation of youth \u2013 an often neglected group of the potentially disempowered \u2013 is also a feature of some electoral systems in the Asia-Pacific region. A key concern here is the prescribed minimum age of both voters and candidates; where the age of candidates is relatively high, youth are unlikely to be represented. In Afghanistan, the relatively high minimum age for councillors (who should be 35 or older) effectively eliminates the likelihood of the youth being represented. Philippines has arguably the most outwardly \u201cpro-youth\u201d local representational system in the world. There, the Local Government Code provides for the organization of Youth Councils in every village and barangay, whose members are elected by those aged 15 to 21. At every level of Philippines\u2019 LG system, these Youth Councils and their federations are represented, thus ensuring that LG decision making is at least partly attuned to the needs of the younger part of the electorate. 53 Representation of women, youth, minorities and the most disadvantaged 4.3 Special electoral and representational arrangements In a number of Asia-Pacific countries, special arrangements have been made to deal with highly specific local issues \u2013 e.g., demands for greater autonomy (often linked to conflict or post-conflict situations), or problems of social and cultural identity for indigenous peoples. Such arrangements are generally an exception to the wider representational systems in which they have been developed, and have usually combined enhanced devolution (more widespread powers at local level) with special arrangements for political representation. Here, a few examples will be explored. These examples illustrate the principle that one size does not necessarily fit all, and that LG systems and their accompanying representational arrangements do not have to be uniform. They can be, so to speak, \u201casymmetric\u201d and thus able to sensitively deal with very particular circumstances. Tribal panchayats in India In addition to quotas for Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population in all tiers of regular panchayat institutions, special provisions were considered necessary for the panchayats of certain tribal enclaves within nine states, in addition to the northeastern states of India. These are known as the Schedule V areas. The 73rd Amendment to the Indian Constitution specifically stated that its provisions will not be directly applicable to these areas. The panchayats in tribal areas of these nine states have been given a special legal dispensation, called the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Area) Act 1996 (commonly referred to as the PESA Act). The PESA Act recognizes the specific rights of tribal communities over natural resources, respects their traditional institutions and gives them substantial powers of self-governance. The PESA Act is also the first law to empower people to redefine their own administrative boundaries. The powers vested in the Village Assembly \u2013 the Gram Sabha \u2013 authorize it to approve all development plans; control all functionaries and institutions in social sectors; manage water bodies and other natural resources; have ownership of minor forest produce; prevent alienation of land; manage village markets; and resolve disputes. The Village Assembly and panchayat are required to be consulted before any move to acquire land or grant mineral concessions. In electoral terms, the PESA Act provides that at least 50 percent of members in these Schedule V Panchayats are tribals and that the chairperson is always a tribal. As such, PESA gives STs the necessary level of political representation to ensure that any and all decisions taken in the panchayats take into account their traditions and customs.

The Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), a 13,295 km2 area of southeastern Bangladesh bordering India and Myanmar, is the traditional homeland of 11 indigenous peoples of Sino-Tibetan origin, collectively known as the Jumma peoples. The Jumma are different from Bangladesh\u2019s Bengali majority with respect to language, religion, social system and economic practices. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, the CHT became increasingly tense as Bengali migrants arrived; communal violence rose dramatically. By the 1990s, the Jumma were a minority in the CHT; armed conflict escalated. 54 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS A December 1997 settlement sought to accommodate local Jumma grievances and to bring an end to armed conflict. Key provisions included: \u25cf Granting self-government to the CHT through the establishment of District and Regional Councils \u25cf Recognition of the socio-cultural identity of the indigenous peoples and their laws and customs The centrepiece of the accord was the establishment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council (the only one of its kind in Bangladesh) as an apex body. It has 22 elected members with a tenure of five years. The chairperson is to be an indigenous person with the status of a state Minister. Fourteen other members are to be tribal, including two women, thus ensuring Jumma control over a range of local public affairs. The objective of having such a Regional Council is to make the CHT a single political and administrative unit. It has powers of supervision and coordination on law and order, general administration, development, traditional laws and social justice. However, although the Regional Council Act has been enacted, delays have occurred in the formulation of its rules and regulations and the holding of elections. Currently an interim appointed Regional Council is in place. Special autonomy for Aceh in Indonesia Aceh, located on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, has been demanding greater autonomy from Indonesia since the 1950s. These demands are founded on Aceh\u2019s strong Islamic traditions (in a constitutionally secular Indonesia) and on a sense of being discriminated against in terms of its share of natural resource revenues. Violent conflict and unrest have been the norm in Aceh for almost five decades. In an effort to bring an end to the conflict, Aceh was granted special autonomy and the Law on Governing Aceh (2006) assigns powers to the province on a much broader level than those enjoyed by other Indonesian provinces. This includes the retention of a greater share of royalties from the exploitation of its natural resources. Under the law Central Government retains authority over Aceh\u2019s foreign political relations, external defence and monetary affairs, while all other responsibilities fall within the sphere of the provincial government. The special autonomy agreement also provides Aceh with more freedom to run its internal affairs and to redesign LG in line with local traditions. This includes possibilities for local electoral reforms, for example a provision for independent candidates to register for local elections whereas only candidates of national political parties can stand for election in accordance with national laws in Indonesia (see section on political parties in Part 1 and overview of the representational arrangement in Indonesia in Part 2 for more details). Special autonomy for Bougainville in Papua New Guinea From 1988 until 1997-98, the island and province of Bougainville in PNG experienced serious armed conflict between separatists and Government forces, during which an estimated 20,000 people died. At the heart of the conflict were issues linked to traditional land tenure arrangements, the environment and control over the use of natural resources, most notably, the Panguna mine. 55 Representation of women, youth, minorities and the most disadvantaged A cease-fire between the PNG Government and the rebels was signed in April 1998, and a full peace agreement in August 2001. Under the eyes of a regional peace monitoring force and a United Nations observer mission, the Government and provincial leaders established an interim administration and made significant progress toward complete surrender/destruction of weapons. The agreement provided for greater legal autonomy for Bougainville (as an autonomous region within PNG), with a locally elected administration having the power to establish a police force, judiciary, taxation system, commercial bank and courts. Port Moresby retains control over defense and foreign affairs, although the PNG military will be largely excluded from the island.

It touches upon them insofar as they have implications for representational and accountability issues. 5.1 Population, representation and related issues The size of LG units in the Asia-Pacific region varies enormously. When considered in conjunction with electoral arrangements (direct/indirect elections, majoritarian/PR systems, etc.) and the size of representational bodies, the size of a jurisdiction\u2019s population may have considerable implications in terms of \u201cproximity\u201d and accountability. Tier 1 LG units vary considerably in size from country to country, with those in Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Timor-Leste generally being the smallest (average populations of 2,500-3,500). By far the largest Tier 1 LGs are those in Sri Lanka, although if one classifies Indonesian regencies as being Tier 1, then they are considerably larger. Tier 1 LGs in India, Cambodia and Viet Nam occupy the middle ground, while Bangladeshi UPs, Pakistani Unions and PNG\u2019s Local-Level Governments tend to be relatively large. Tier 2 LG units are also highly variable in size \u2013 the largest (on average) being Indonesian regencies and Afghan provinces, and the smallest (on average) being Bhutanese dzongkhags. Nepali districts, although relatively small on average, vary greatly amongst themselves in terms of population. Vietnamese districts, with an average population of 125,000, occupy the middle ground. Tier 3 LG units also vary greatly in demographic size. Indonesian provinces are, on average, bigger than some Asian countries (e.g., Bhutan, Timor-Leste). The smallest Tier 3 LGs are, somewhat surprisingly, Indian Zilla Panchayats. Once again, Viet Nam\u2019s provinces occupy the middle ground. Of the three countries that operate PR systems for local elections, Cambodia is exceptional in that its LG units are relatively small. In Sri Lanka and especially Indonesia, jurisdictions/constituencies tend to be large. In contrast, where majoritarian systems are in place (i.e., in most countries), the size of commensurate LG units tends to be smaller. Levels of representation vary from country to country. Among Tier 1 LGs, Nepali Village Councils appear to be the most highly representative in this respect; on average, each member of the Village Council represents 70 people (and even fewer voters). In contrast, UP members in Bangladesh and Union councillors in Pakistan on average represent some 2,000 people. linkages to local administrations 5 Organizational structure and 59 Not surprisingly, and as can also be seen from Table 6, levels of representation decline as one goes up the tiers; in India, by far the easiest case to interpret, there are about 1,000 people for every councillor at the Gram Panchayat (Tier 1) level, but roughly 25,000 people per councillor at the Zilla Panchayat (Tier 3) level. The pattern is repeated for all countries with multi-tier systems, but to different degrees. In that sense, then, the \u201chigher\u201d up the LG, the less its council is \u201crepresentative\u201d of its citizens. This reflects the inevitable tradeoff between representation and efficiency; a Zilla Panchayat that had, for example, one councillor for every 1,000 people in the district would, in most cases, constitute an entirely unwieldy and oversized body.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4380d932-594d-4f60-a12c-3d1877d114bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4380d932-594d-4f60-a12c-3d1877d114bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dac2199f67d5474cd685619f0f79376396f86ec5d6ef96986ed7d1990651c461"}, "2": {"node_id": "df1403a6-fef6-4789-9198-6d682b50b658", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b3b0b8ba8e4bbf07614a530eec78d4261fd3cd9a4637806e4b49cb441106ec63"}}, "hash": "4b4b8b7003a33e1e84cf24f861b40ae874b3d5ed7b8f5390257b207f4073004b", "text": "It is worth noting that in order for LGs to be significant and efficient providers of services, they generally need to be of a certain size.

As such, they are usually not paid regular salaries. Nonetheless, being a council member is not without its costs: Council members must dedicate time, travel to meetings, arrange meetings with their constituents and the like. The following examples shows how some countries help meet these costs: \u25cf In many cases (e.g., Nepal), council members are provided with sitting fees for the days that they are in council \u25cf In Philippines, Barangay Council members receive allowances (defined by ordinance) as well as a number of other benefits, such as insurance, free medical care and exemptions from tuition fees. Members of Municipal Councils and Provincial Boards are provided monthly allowances \u25cf For the more \u201cexecutive\u201d arms of councils, special provisions are often made for members\u2019 remuneration. Thus, in Viet Nam, members of the People\u2019s Councils\u2019 Standing Committees are considered to have full-time jobs and remunerated accordingly. In Timor-Leste, suco chiefs are paid a regular monthly allowance by central Government, intended to cover transport and other costs. The payment of sitting fees and the like has implications for representation. Where no remuneration is provided, poorer citizens may either be deterred from standing for election (in the knowledge that they will be ill-placed to participate in council deliberations) or, in the event that they are elected, may find it difficult to afford the costs of being a representative. Wealthier citizens do not face the same constraints under such circumstances. The frequency of council meetings varies both between countries and between tiers. Lower-tier councils can \u201cafford\u201d to meet on a relatively frequent basis, whilst upper-tier councils meet less frequently, largely because of the higher organizational and transaction costs involved in bringing together members from a larger political catchment. Organizational structure and linkages to local administrations 60 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Municipal council meeting in Qum, Iran This again evokes the frequent tradeoff between representation and service delivery functions. Village Councils can \u201cafford\u201d to meet more regularly than District Councils, although the latter exercise oversight authority over a much wider range of services and considerably bigger budgets. However, in all cases, committees need to meet more regularly in order to oversee implementation of the policies and budgets endorsed and approved by their respective councils. In Nepal, this is clearly recognized in legal provisions. Given that such committees do meet more frequently and effectively manage day-to-day LG business, it is important to carefully craft the ways in which they are constituted (membership) and the extent to which their members are remunerated. 5.3 Councils and local administrations Election and appointment of administrative executives as members of local councils An important issue that merits attention is related to the occupational backgrounds of the councillors. Whether permanent government staff is allowed to stand for election varies from country to country in Asia-Pacific. In some countries, the majority of elected representatives are from the ranks of the government staff, which influences both representation and accountability. For example, in Mongolia up to 70 to 90 percent of Aimag and Soum Hural members are government officials. The key concern with this trend is the limited representation available for the orinary citizens and herders/peasants in the local hurals. A 2007 amendment to the law imposes some restrictions: Whereas civil servants can still stand for election, they must resign from their post in the administration if elected. 61 India \u2013 are local bureaucrats accountable to elected representatives? The Government of Madhya Pradesh characterized the relationship between the Zilla Panchayat (ZP) CEO (Chief Executive Officer, appointed by the state government) and the elected ZP president as similar to the relationship between the chief minister and the chief secretary of the state. However, this was not the relationship observed in the field. The ZP CEO is accountable to the collector, not to the ZP chairperson. The situation was similar in Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Only in Kerala was the situation different. There, due to specific legislation, the ZP president was fully in charge \u2013 but, as a result, the government of Kerala had a great deal of difficulty keeping the slots filled with Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a3bcace-ea3f-402e-9535-6317b2f55058": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a3bcace-ea3f-402e-9535-6317b2f55058", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "629294a9b256e3283bc5e02d42dcdfcea5a21d66d57cff89b89ee1cb4b9b3cfe"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce0127ba-3b55-481a-8420-12433c4ee927", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6555c26e5a475426bb2a4d2e5a50e067e1a04db744c9161ba8ba3a2632478730"}}, "hash": "ed528ca52b51822d0bdbc4274d21559da469459e39eb68898ec3b940f8715c52", "text": "Source: Adapted from World Bank (2000).

For example, in both Pakistan and Thailand, legislation rules out civil servants from seeking a nomination or standing for election. In somewhat extreme cases, appointed executives can be heads or members of the councils. Thus, in Maldives, the Island Development Committees and Atoll Development Committees are chaired by centrally appointed island/atoll chiefs. In Nepal during the Maoist conflict, although admittedly under rather specific circumstances, VDCs and DDCs are chaired by officials appointed by central Government \u2013 respectively, the VDC secretary and the local development officer. In some cases, LGs include appointed executives, with varying degrees of power with regard to elected councils. Sri Lankan provinces, for example, have governors who are appointed by the President; they are responsible for executing the policies of their respective Provincial Councils through a Board of Ministers headed by a chief minister and no more than four other ministers. The governor appoints the chief minister, and the other ministers on the advice of the chief minister. In India, the chief executives of upper-tier LGs are usually senior civil servants of their respective states (see also the previous section on appointment in local councils). In such cases, where local executives are appointed by institutions other than the LG they are expected to serve, the issue is almost always one of accountability and the relative power of elected representatives. The inset below provides some insight into the overall problem in Indian rural LG. The practice of central or state governments appointing the chief executives for LGs often creates divided loyalties among LG personnel and potentially dilutes local political control. In many formerly colonized countries, the practice appears to have been inherited from the deep-rooted colonial mistrust of local native administrations and the resulting wish to install a colonial functionary to guard against possible misuse of power and wasteful expenditure. Accordingly, most locally elected officials in Asia-Pacific countries see the practice as undermining the principle of local democracy and empowered local bodies. In Indonesia, on the other hand, LG executive branches are nominated locally; the regional secretary is nominated by the (elected) regional head (at provincial, regency or city levels) and appointed by the President, while the regional secretariat is appointed by the regional head with approval from the DPRD (or Regional Council). The Indonesian model, although it clearly runs risks of \u201cpolitical\u201d appointments, does allow for a much greater degree of control over executives by locally elected representatives. 62 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Local councils and staffing of local administrations LG councils usually have some kind of \u201cdedicated\u201d local administration to manage the day-to-day affairs of their jurisdictions, even when elected mayors or council leaders assume more executive powers. The issue of LG council control over staffing is often a thorny one \u2013 and, in many countries, mirrors many of the tensions inherent in systems where central Government appoints local executives. Three basic options exist for LG staffing arrangements: \u25cf Separate, meaning that each LG body appoints and controls its own staff. This is, in theory, the case for a large proportion of civil servants in Indonesia since reforms beginning in 2000. Immediately after January 2001, it is estimated that some 2.3 million Indonesian civil servants were administratively transferred to the regions. In practice, given the recentness of reforms, regional authority over civil service management remains somewhat blurred. \u25cf Unified, in the sense that the senior management posts are filled from a central cadre of service for local authorities. This has historically been the case in Nepal, where VDC and DDC secretaries are appointed by the Ministry of Local Development, working alongside more junior, locally recruited and locally paid village/district employees. In addition, line agency staff in Nepal continue to be largely accountable to their parent Ministries, rather than to local bodies. This is also the case in India. \u25cf Integrated, meaning that the staff of central and LG agencies form a common cadre, and are exchanged freely between levels of government and localities according to central posting policies. This would appear to be the case in Bangladesh, where virtually all service delivery staff at local levels are directly employed by central Government Ministries. How far local councils are effectively the employers of locally posted staff is an important determinant of their ability to shape service delivery \u2013 and thus, of their ability to translate popular representation into accountable LG. Supervision of councils While local councils enjoy varying degrees of autonomy, they are generally subject to some kind of upward accountability \u2013 to higher-tier councils/LGs or to central Government. The degree to which LG councils are subject to supervision is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "23db9c75-6ef5-4fba-aa6b-9fce0fab04dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "23db9c75-6ef5-4fba-aa6b-9fce0fab04dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "510528c84edae178fdc240afad65c3a0527a59002f0070b7d2a9ebc3c41e0c07"}, "3": {"node_id": "540b5612-8e44-432e-a88d-839ea845c3bc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c931c52aed7151ee51baf81bcaa5664b3371ff0cbc03d562713e0aea25e553fd"}}, "hash": "0a0961f0108d87340fbed71a6dbd3f0df8aa4001b408d7e2a94333ea0632158d", "text": "important in two fundamental respects. First, too much external control or supervision effectively disenfranchises locally elected bodies, turning their \u201crepresentative\u201d role into one that can be denuded of accountability \u2013 simply because they have little authority to make binding decisions. Second, too little external control/supervision means that locally elected bodies are not held upwardly accountable for a range of public sector responsibilities (such as service delivery standards or the management of financial resources transferred from central or upper-tier LGs). Finding the right balance is challenging. In Asia-Pacific, the situation varies from country to country. In Viet Nam, where lower tiers of LG are generally subordinate to substantial ex-ante and ex-post controls by upper tiers, supervision over lower levels is very much the norm. The decisions and actions of Commune People\u2019s Councils and Committees are thus closely supervised by District People\u2019s Councils/Committees, while the latter are in turn beholden to the authority of Provincial People\u2019s Councils/Committees. Similarly, with the Amendment of the Constitution in 1987, monitoring and supervision of the elected local governments was devolved to the Provincial Councils. 63 Organizational structure and linkages to local administrations In Indonesia, by contrast, regional governments by law enjoy considerable autonomy from upper tiers; indeed, elected regency and city authorities have argued that they are in no way subject to provincial authorities. However, they (as well as the provinces) are subject to national supervision, in two ways: \u25cf \u201cRepressive\u201d supervision, which amounts to supervision over regional regulations and decrees, promulgated by DPRDs. This is the responsibility of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). MoHA has the responsibility to review regional regulations and declare void those that are contrary to \u201cpublic interest, higher regulations, and/or other regulations.\u201d The Minister of Home Affairs has formed several teams to review regional regulations, including financial regulations, organizational regulations, and regulations related to election of heads of region. The national government review teams have found numerous irregularities in the regulations examined, generally concerned with regional finances or organization. As a result, the Government has refused to confirm the election of several heads of region, or postponed confirmation, and has issued many written requests to the regions to amend regulations on taxation, charges and organizational structure to comply with national legislation. \u25cf \u201cFunctional\u201d supervision, which according to Government Regulation 20/2001 is carried out by line Ministries and by BPKP (the financial comptroller). However, detailed regulation of functional supervision awaits the development of minimum service standards (MSS) for each of the 11 obligatory service sectors that are managed by regional governments. In theory, the national Government is responsible for preparing guidelines for the standards; provincial governments set the actual standards to be applied in each locality; and the national Government then supervises the district governments\u2019 performance. local governance and 6 Traditional systems of the process of change 66 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 6.1 Traditional governance It is probably self-evident that LG systems of formally elected representatives did not emerge in a vacuum, and that in many countries such systems continue to function alongside \u2013 and have even emerged from \u2013 \u201ctraditional\u201d local governance arrangements. How do the two systems interact? What do we know about how their interaction shapes representational issues? Building on traditional structures Many LG systems in South and Southeast Asia have been built quite explicitly on the basis of traditional governance structures, usually at their lowest levels. In Philippines, for example, the smallest unit of LG is the barangay, which has its origins in the pre- colonial era; the term actually traces its origins to balangay, a type of Malay boat used by seafaring settlers. The barangay, then, refers to a historical community, to which local citizens are attached and with which they identify. The legitimacy of the barangay as a traditional community structure thus serves to complement the more \u201cmodern\u201d legitimacy of electoral representation. In Timor-Leste, it seems clear that any LG system will be based on the foundation provided by the sucos. The suco, a traditional community, is the only institution that has remained more or less intact during the history of the territory. The suco and its legitimacy provide an opportunity for a base unit of local governance and representation that reflects local identity. It also constitutes the only level of \u201clocal power\u201d as provided for in the Constitution.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "540b5612-8e44-432e-a88d-839ea845c3bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "540b5612-8e44-432e-a88d-839ea845c3bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "510528c84edae178fdc240afad65c3a0527a59002f0070b7d2a9ebc3c41e0c07"}, "2": {"node_id": "23db9c75-6ef5-4fba-aa6b-9fce0fab04dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a0961f0108d87340fbed71a6dbd3f0df8aa4001b408d7e2a94333ea0632158d"}}, "hash": "c931c52aed7151ee51baf81bcaa5664b3371ff0cbc03d562713e0aea25e553fd", "text": "Recent laws have clearly signalled a \u201cmodernization\u201d of the suco, through the holding of direct elections for the position of suco chief and for the members of the Suco Council, as well as through legal provisions ensuring that women, youth and elders are represented.

Building on traditional structures therefore can provide the basis for units of local representation with which citizens readily identify themselves. This implies that modern LG systems are not based on entirely imagined political communities. Returning to traditional structures Indonesia provides one interesting, if unique, example of reconstructing a system of LG that is based on traditional structures, of bringing \u201cmodern\u201d administrative units into line with more \u201ctraditional\u201d ones, and thus perhaps contributing to a more legitimate basis for representation (in the eyes of local citizens). local governance and 6 Traditional systems of the process of change 67 Traditional systems of local governance and the process of change In the province of West Sumatra, the process of decentralization has been particularly dynamic and idiosyncratic. Along with the general decentralization of central political authority and economic resources to the regencies, a fundamental restructuring of local village government has been initiated. The policy of regional autonomy has been taken up \u201cto return to the nagari,\u201d the traditional, pre- colonial political units of Minangkabau political organization. Despite all changes and transformations during the colonial period and since independence, the nagari and nagari government have remained firmly associated with Minangkabau political identity. This changed rather dramatically when the Law on Local Government of 1979 introduced the uniform model of the desa as the lowest level of LG. The former nagari were split into several desa, administered by desa heads embedded in the strictly hierarchical administrative system. When decentralization became a major issue in Indonesia under the orde reformasi, this was taken up in West Sumatra to abolish the desa system and \u201cgo back to the nagari.\u201d Draft legislation has been prepared to re-establish the nagari as the lowest level of LG, with nagari councils made up of desa representatives as well as representatives of traditional Minangkabau institutions (the elders of matrilineages, clerics, and the like). Cohabitation, co-option or competition? In many countries, both developed and developing, traditional governance institutions manage to coexist alongside their more \u201cmodern\u201d counterparts. At the national level, the remaining monarchies in Europe are good examples of this. At the local level, some of the most poignant examples of cohabitation between traditional and modern systems of governance are to be found in sub-Saharan Africa. There, traditional chiefs (and sometimes monarchs) retain considerable powers over, for example, customary land tenure regimes and often continue to play an important role in dispute resolution as well as in the organization of ritual activities. For that reason, they have often needed to be brought into local governance, as the institutions that \u201crepresent\u201d important functions at the local level. Several examples of this type of cohabitation between tradition and modernity can be briefly cited: \u25cf In post-apartheid South Africa, customary chiefs have continued to play an important role in a variety of areas, most importantly in dispute settlement. In recognition of the importance of traditional chiefs, the Government of South Africa passed a piece of landmark legislation in 2003 \u2013 the Traditional Leadership and Governance Framework Bill (Ministry of Provincial and Local Government, Pretoria) \u2013 recognizing and codifying the functions of traditional chiefs, \u201cmodernizing\u201d them (women can now become chiefs), and formally defining their relations with LGs through traditional councils that the LG must consult on a range of issues. \u25cf During the late 1990s, as Mali undertook major decentralization reforms, it was early on recognised that new communes would need to take into account traditional village and \u201cfraction\u201d (nomadic) chiefs. Such chiefs not only exercised considerable political authority over their communities, but were also key players in land tenure arrangements. As a result, the Local Government Code that was eventually enacted stipulated that Commune Councils had to consult all traditional village chiefs before voting on development plans, annual budgets and other LG actions. \u25cf In Ghana, traditional chiefs enjoy considerable political and juridical authority and play a vital role in the management of customary land tenure arrangements. Ever since the colonial period, traditional Ghanaian chiefs have been organised into regional and national Houses of Chiefs. These institutions are necessarily consulted by Ghanaian LGs about a range of issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e3ec11b-46eb-4b6a-950b-0a08909da03b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e3ec11b-46eb-4b6a-950b-0a08909da03b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbb2857a56f46bc461bd77c7a82507030522512877f3f1f86d4aee3d1d328161"}, "2": {"node_id": "f3b8f0a8-df61-4cd6-b9be-be98f7eb13f8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3db97717abe211faa8d5a1baf06354e4bfde8016255d152e5d5020c40af8385"}}, "hash": "8c1c7e8233218cce08986768e010d4a67e2f106f8b6e7909a1dfd13a46927e3b", "text": "These institutions are necessarily consulted by Ghanaian LGs about a range of issues. 68 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Village council elders, Afghanistan In such African cases, traditional chiefs \u201crepresent\u201d custom \u2013 and custom is considered to be of importance, hence the need for elected LGs to cohabit with them in a constructive way.

According to the law (Section 10), Provincial Assemblies include \u201cwhere the chieftaincy system is in existence and is accepted in a province, paramount chiefs from the province not exceeding three in number or their duly appointed nominees, who shall be appointed by the Minister responsible for provincial government and local-level government matters on the recommendation of the Provincial Executive Council.\u201d Chiefly representatives in PNG\u2019s Provincial Assemblies enjoy full voting rights. \u25cf In Fiji, customary institutions continue to play a significant role in local administration. Outside of the municipal system of government, most rural areas are administered through a combination of modern and traditional arrangements. Rotuma Island, which enjoys a special constitutional status in Fiji, is administered by its own council, made up of 14 voting members \u2013 seven of whom are the traditional chiefs of the island\u2019s seven districts, chosen according to customary principles. For South and Southeast Asia, there are fewer cases of this kind of officially and legally sanctioned cohabitation between traditional authorities and modern LGs. There are, however, a few examples (although they are not necessarily \u201clocal\u201d): \u25cf In Bhutan, of the 150 members of the National Assembly, 10 are representatives of the monastic body, nominated by the Central Monastic Body in Thimphu and the eight district monastic bodies. This representation of the Buddhist clergy reflects the importance of religion in Bhutan. 69 Traditional systems of local governance and the process of change \u25cf In Malaysia, 9 of the 13 constituent states of the federation are headed by hereditary monarchs or sultans \u2013 one of whom, on a rotating five-year basis, acts as head of the federation. Although these are clearly constitutional monarchies, they do demonstrate how the traditional and modern can cohabit. Customary Panchayats (CPs) continue to thrive in many parts of rural India. CPs have a number of important local functions, inter alia: \u25cf To maintain law and order in the villages and to act as custodians of traditional norms and rules defining the social order \u25cf To arbitrate disputes in the village, perhaps the most important CP function \u25cf To act as support structures in specific situations \u25cf To play a significant role in informal resource mobilization, which may be used for village development activities CPs are village-based, male-dominated, and usually led by the leaders of the different castes that make up the village. The CP is an extension of caste, albeit one of the more inclusive forms. CPs are not recognized in any legislation on LG and are thus entirely informal \u2013 despite their obvious importance in local governance. Moreover, recent research in Karnataka6 indicates that CPs exert a powerful influence over Gram Panchayats, formal LG institutions. This influence manifests itself in a number of ways: \u25cf Deciding the choice of candidates. CPs decide on who should contest elections or influence the type of members that are represented in the Gram Panchayat. \u25cf Unanimous elections. At times CPs may exercise influence to the extent of ensuring that the candidates of their choice are elected unopposed \u2013 in other words, cause \u201cunanimous\u201d elections. \u25cf Overlap of leadership. Often CP leaders and/or members themselves contest GP elections. This leads to an overlap of leadership between the customary and statutory institutions. There is thus a high degree to which a traditional structure of governance, dominated by very customary\u201d interests, interfaces with its modern, \u201cdemocratic\u201d counterpart \u2013 and clearly exerts a powerful influence over the latter. In such circumstance, \u201crepresentation\u201d must be qualified, given that CPs have such a large role in determining who are to be the representatives. 6.2 Evolutions In many new or emerging countries, particularly those that have experienced serious conflict (e.g., Cambodia, Timor-Leste, Afghanistan), LG and local elections may well be low on the list of national political priorities. But if and when those countries do begin to establish locally elected councils and LG systems, can we see any pattern to that process? How far do newly implanted systems of local electoral representation build on tradition, if at all? 6 See \u201cInterfaces in Local Governance \u2013 A Study in Karnataka,\u201d Kripa AnanthPur, May 2004, Working Paper No. 187, Madras Institute of Development Studies, Chennai.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3df39a01-6d74-48e9-9d32-20947f44b1f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "3df39a01-6d74-48e9-9d32-20947f44b1f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2dde1cda3f3777471eeb8cb78352b77c47098d2dcb8979b2645f864432386003"}, "2": {"node_id": "ea277a64-f48b-47af-8431-aafaee2b5ca3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "320c69f5a5e13eeb085d62777ffbc7633f6d30e81bd41dcf0ec4b012db55ae66"}}, "hash": "e3ea7b7227adc05efa987eb5a0f8902ddeb32128c0250fc06e6d9540a8702716", "text": "187, Madras Institute of Development Studies, Chennai.

Big bangs or incremental reforms? Two of the countries covered by this Guide \u2013 Indonesia and Pakistan \u2013 have recently undertaken major overhauls of their LG systems. In both cases, reforms have included major changes to electoral processes and representational arrangements, as well as a significant devolution of powers and responsibilities to LGs (especially in the case of Indonesia). These have been bold reforms, but it is still too early to know how far their \u201crepresentational\u201d ambitions have succeeded. Other countries, notably Bangladesh, appear to have taken a much more incremental approach to reforms. The lowest tier, the Union Parishad, is still the only level at which elected bodies operate, although it is conceivable, depending on political considerations, that the system will \u201cgrow\u201d upward to encompass Upazilas. Nepal, for its part, has taken significant steps backward as a result of military conflict and political crisis. In 2002, elected local bodies were dissolved and have yet to be replaced through elections. 70 72 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS This Guide makes no pretence at being exhaustive. In addition, it cannot encompass all of the latest permutation of the rapidly evolving arrangements for electoral representation at local level in the Asia-Pacific region. That said, it is hoped that this Guide does provide practitioners in the local governance field with food for thought by: \u25cf Bringing into the foreground (in Section 2) some of the basic electoral principles that underlie the diversity of electoral systems and how they may affect representational outcomes. The Guide has also tried to look at the fundamental options available, and to hint at some of the tradeoffs inherent to each. No electoral system is perfect, and each has its advantages and disadvantages \u2013 but it is important to try to understand how they \u201cwork\u201d and to then \u201cmatch\u201d them to specific socio-political realities.

The 2004 Constitution does provide for the establishment of Provincial, District and Village Councils, as well as municipal bodies, although the roles of such representative bodies appear largely consultative rather than deliberative. The 2004 Law on Provincial Councils (PC) clearly assigns an advisory role to the Provincial Councils; as yet, no specific legislation has been enacted defining the precise roles of District and Village Councils. In March 2007, the law on Provincial Councils was changed to give an increased monitoring role to PC members. Provinces Provincial Councils comprise members directly elected through secret ballot for four years. Councillors elect a chairperson from amongst themselves. Each Provincial Council elects one member as a member of the Afghanistan Senate (Meshrano Jirga, or House of Elders) for four years as well. 8 representation in Asia Systems of local council and the Pacific 79 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Districts District Councils also are to be comprised entirely of directly elected members, elected for three years through secret ballot. So far, however, there are no elected councils at district level. District Councils in each province also are to elect one member to sit in the Afghanistan Senate (Meshrano Jirga) for three years. In the absence of District Councils, this portion of the Senate remains selected from Provincial Councils. Villages Village Councils likewise are to be made up of members directly elected by secret ballot for three years. As with District Councils, however, so far no Village Councils have been elected. In some districts a Community Development Council has been elected, but these do not have the same mandate as the envisioned Village Councils. Municipalities The mayor and members of Municipal Councils are to be directly elected by secret ballot. It is worth noting that mayors are the only local council leaders in Afghanistan to be directly elected. However, none have been elected so far, and the short-term prospects for this to happen are low. A civil registry is needed first to identify citizens in constituencies.

Organization of elections The Electoral Law 2004 sets out a Single Non-Transferable Vote (SNTV) system for elections of all local councils in Afghanistan. No ward system was foreseen, and elections are direct. The electoral system at national level also is classified as SNTV. The Electoral Law includes a provision for the allocation of seats to the two women candidates with the highest number of votes in the District and Provincial Councils (Articles 31 and 36). However, the law is not specific with respect to the procedures/requirements for nominating women, and contains no additional elements aimed at ensuring gender balance in the councils. The minimum age for candidates to be appointed to the Meshrano Jirga is 35. Political parties are allowed to contest local elections, although the SNTV electoral system \u2013 as compared to PR-List, for example - appears to dilute their importance and influence. 80 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS BANGLADESH Table 7: Summary structure and features of LG system in Bangladesh Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 64 districts or zilas No direct political 6 City Direct political representation Avg. pop.: representation Corporations Directly elected mayor and 1.9 million A Zila Parishad consists of a ZP commissioners (includes 3 special secretary, accountant and, in Hill Districts) some districts, an LGED engineer District Development Coordination Committee consists of DC and line department heads 469 sub-districts or No direct political upazilas representation Avg. pop.: 250,000 Upazila District Coordination Committee (UDCC) comprising: UP chairpersons, UNO (secretary), MP (special adviser), line department officers (non-voting) 4,500 Union 13 elected members 278 Pourashavas Direct political representation Parishads (UPs) (1 chairperson and 1 member or municipalities Directly elected chairperson Avg. pop.: 27,000 for each of 9 villages/wards, and commissioners plus 3 women members, each representing 3 villages/wards).

A Zila Parishad should consist of a chairperson, 15 general members and five members of reserved seats for women. The chairperson and the members are supposed to be elected by an electoral college. However, elections to this level have never been held, both because of legal complications as well as the fact that many Bangladeshis believe this is not an appropriate level for such bodies. Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) District parishads In addition to LG levels mentioned above, three CHT District Parishads are provided for under separate acts for each Hill District. The Hill District Parishads have been established to give representation to tribes in the Hill District Areas. Each has a designated number of tribal members as well as a chairperson and non-tribal members. Tribal seats are further divided according to the number and proportion of tribes in the Hill District. Members are elected by the general population of the Hill Districts, while the chairperson is elected from amongst tribal members. Electoral procedures for the Hill District Parishads are determined by the Government. Urban local government Urban local government consists of Pourashavas for smaller municipalities and City Corporations for the six largest cities. The heads of City Corporations are mayors and of Pourashavas are chairpersons; members are commissioners. Mayors and chairpersons are directly elected every five years, as are commissioners (representing their respective urban wards). Specific numbers of seats are reserved for women, who also are elected directly.

A number of other members act as observers, without voting rights. The chairperson is elected through secret ballot by the voting members of the DYT. The election of ex officio members is governed by relevant Chathrims, i.e., the GYT Chathrim for gups and mangmis and the Chathrim for Election of National Assembly Members for chimis. Representatives from the municipalities and towns are elected through secret ballot amongst all eligible voters of municipalities and towns in the district. Gewogs Under Article 3 of the GYT Chathrim, the GYT is made up of the gup, mangmi and tshogpas (representatives of villages or clusters of villages). Chimis, gewog clerks and representatives of sectors within the gewogs attend as observers. The gup may invite representatives of various sectors and any other observers as needed. GYT members are to be elected in accordance with an Election Act that has yet to be adopted. Elections are currently regulated by the GYT Chathrim, which states that all members are to be elected by secret ballot. In the event that more than one candidate stands for election, the candidate securing the highest number of votes that is elected. If there is only one candidate, votes of \u201cyes\u201d and \u201cno\u201d are cast. Only if the candidate receives more than 50 percent \u201cyes\u201d votes out of the total ballots cast can s/he be elected; otherwise, the gewog must nominate another candidate. For the election of the gup, a minimum of two officers appointed by the dzongkhag oversee the election (Article 5). Municipalities Following National Assembly endorsement of the Thromde Act on 26 June 2007, which repealed the Municipal Act 1999, the Government can establish a certain geographic or economic areas as thromde or throm (town). There can be three types: gyelyong thromde (national city or municipality), dzongkhag thromde (district town), and yenlag throm (satellite town) or gewog throm (gewog town). Establishment of the thromde is to be based on the population, area, revenue generated for maintenance of services, percentage of employment in non-primary activities and agricultural activities, and trade and commercial significance. Gyelyong thromde and dzongkhag thromde governance structures will consist of a Thromde Tshogdu (council) and a Thromde Dagchong (administration). The Thromde Tshodgu will be the highest decision-making body, consisting of a thrompon (mayor) \u2013 the executive head of the Municipal Corporation \u2013 elected by the people of that throm; a total of seven to 10 Thromde Thuemis elected from the constituencies; and the executive secretary of the thromde, a civil servant appointed by the Government. The Thromde Tshogdu have the powers to formulate policies and develop priorities for functions of the thromde. They also will frame and adopt rules and guidelines to enable the thromde to carry out its functions, and review and approve the annual budget. The Thromde Tshogdu also will approve land use and development plans, provide infrastructure, services and public amenities, and preserve and promote cultural, architectural and aesthetic aspects of the thromde.

The sub-national governance system is thus organized at three levels. At the level of commune/ sangkhat, democratically elected local authorities have been established. At the srok/khan and province/municipality levels, de-concentrated units of the central administration, coordinated by the representative of the central Government in the territory (provincial or district governor), are operating. Chapter XIII, Article 146, of the Constitution stipulates that \u201cprovinces, municipalities, districts, khan, khum and sangkhat shall be governed in accordance with an Organic Law.\u201d An Organic Law that reflects the national strategy for decentralization and de-concentration adopted in 2005, is being prepared. While the national strategy has not yet been officially adopted, its first draft (made public by the Government in April 2005) calls for the creation of two additional levels of elected authorities at district and provincial levels. However, direct elections would continue to apply only to the commune/sangkhat level. Districts and provinces would be established as second- and third-tier local authorities, with Councils most likely elected from amongst members of lower-level Councils. The composition of the District and Provincial Councils would then reproduce the overall balance of seats obtained by different parties in the commune/sangkhat elections of the district or province. Communes The number of members of each Commune Council is determined by sub-decree within months before the election date (Article 6, Law No. ChS/0301/04) and depends on the population of the jurisdiction. 86 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS The electoral system for allocating seats in the Commune Councils is the same as at the national level, i.e., List-PR. In accordance with Article 19 of Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04, only those who are registered for the Commune Council elections are eligible to vote. In order to register, they must be citizens, at least 18 years old and resident in the commune where s/he intends to register. Those who are convicts or are \u201cinsane or under guardianship\u201d may not register (Article 20, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04). Article 45 of Law No. Chs/R-Krm/0301/04 provides that in order to be eligible to stand for election, a candidate must be a citizen by birth, able to read and write Khmer, have a document to prove identity during polling, be a registered voter in the commune where s/he intends to stand for election, and be at least age 25. Article 46 further provides that the holding of various offices or positions \u2013 being a member of an Election Commission, a civil servant or monk or priest \u2013 prohibit an individual from standing for election. The holder of several of the positions listed in Article 95 may, however, apply for permission to stand for election, and should s/he be successful, must submit an application to the body concerned requesting leave of absence to take up office (Article 47). A person who intends to stand as a candidate for election should have his/her name included in the list of candidates of a political party (Article 49, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04). A candidate may only have his name on the list of one party (Article 50, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04). In order to participate in the election for the Commune Council, each political party is required to file an application for registration of the list of candidates with the Commune Election Commission (CEC) 90 days before the election (Article 51, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04). Each party list must contain at least twice as many candidates as there are seats in the Commune Council (Article 52, Law No. ChS/R-Krm/0301/04).

Journal of Contemporary China (2006). China consists of 34 province-level divisions (shengji); 23 provinces (sheng), including the disputed province of Taiwan; five autonomous regions (zizhiqu); four centrally administered municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing); and two special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau). Below the province level, there are three functional levels of LG, although great regional variations exist: prefecture level (diqu), county level (xian), and township level (xiang). The village level (cun) is not formally part of the government structure; rather, self-governance is envisaged at this level. Representative bodies exist in the form of Village Committees (cunmin weiyuanhui) in rural areas and Urban Residents Committees (chengshi jumin weiyuanhui) in cities. Village Committees The National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) passed the experimental Organic Law on Village Committees in November 1987, with effect from June 1988. In November 1998, after a decade of nationwide experimentation, the NPC passed the law to make the committee system permanent and competitive and direct elections of village chairpersons and village committees mandatory for all villages. All villagers aged 18 or older, except those deprived of their political rights by law, are eligible to participate. According to the law, the Village Committee, consisting of either all adult members of the village or of one representative per family, is the supreme decision-making body at village level, voting on all major village affairs. However, because villages range from 500 to 4,000 people, these bodies are often replaced by Village Representative Committees. Enormous variation exists as to who makes up the Village Representative Committee. Although in theory members are elected by everyone in the village, they are often chosen/selected, and include senior male figures or younger, more entrepreneurial ones, as well as members of the Village Committee and delegates from other organizations (local Women\u2019s Federation and the Youth League).9 The Village Representative Committee essentially functions as the forum for most major decisions, while the Village Committee is responsible for executing the decisions of the representative body.10 88 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS For election of the Village Committee, the law stipulates the use of secret ballots, open counting, publicly announced election results, and more candidates for election than the number of positions available.

They too are not considered a part of formal government, but rather as urban dwellers\u2019 self-government. Committees are generally established on the basis of 100 to 700 households. They comprise five to nine members, including the chairperson, vice chairperson(s), and members. As with Village Committees, they are directly elected by all residents with the right to vote or by a representative from every household. Elections take place every three years, and candidates can stand for re-election. Candidates stand as individuals and are not part of a party or group list. However, for both historical and practical reasons, Urban Residents Committees remain less relevant to residents\u2019 lives. Traditionally, urban dwellers belonged to a work unit (danwei) that looked after almost all aspects of life. Furthermore \u2013 and of more relevance today as the work unit system is increasingly dismantled \u2013 the lowest level of urban government, the urban district, has branches at lower levels (jiedao banshi chu), making Urban Residents Committees less powerful because they do not control the local budgets. 11 Ibid. 89 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Representation of women and minorities Women are numerically underrepresented both in national and local politics in China. According to Article 8 of the Organic Law on Villager Elections, the Village Committees should include \u201can appropriate number of women.\u201d However, statistics show that Village Committees on average have 16 percent women members, and only 1 percent of Village Committee chairpersons are women. In many places, the number of women representatives is declining. In addition, women are often assigned portfolios associated with their gender, such as family planning and health, as opposed to tasks like economic and infrastructure development. No provisions exist in the Organic Law to ensure fixed representation of women, but some provinces have passed a law that all Village Committees have to include at least one woman. The problem is that this in effect acts as a \u201cbamboo ceiling,\u201d since it tends to be taken as \u201conly\u201d one woman \u2013 and this woman is then more often than not put in charge of family planning matters.12 Both the Organic Law on Village Elections and the Organic Law on Urban Residents Committees make provisions for the representation of minorities. In villages/urban areas where more than one ethnic group lives, Village Committees/Urban Resident Committees are to include a member or members from the minority group. In such an area, Village Committees/Urban Residents Committees also are tasked to promote mutual assistance, respect and unity between ethnic groups. 12 Ibid. 90 FIJI Table 11: Summary structure and features of the municipal structure in Fiji Levels Representative bodies 2 cities City Council \u2013 made up of 16 to 20 councillors, Suva, pop.: 77,000 elected on FPTP basis from multi-member wards Lautoka, pop.: 36,000 (3-5 councillors per ward) 10 towns Town Council \u2013 made up of 8 to 21 councillors, Largest (Nasinu): 80,000 elected on FPTP basis from multi-member wards Smallest (Levuka): 1,100 (3-5 councillors per ward) Fiji has a highly individual system of LG and administration: First, an orthodox urban LG system comprises 12 Municipal Councils in two cities and 10 towns.

The basic unit in the system of Fijian administration is the village (koro), headed by a turaga-ni-koro elected or appointed by the villagers. Several koros form an administrative sub-unit of a province (tikina). A province consists of a number of tikinas. Third, the Council of Rotuma Island enjoys a special dependency status within Fiji. Because of the unique status of Rotuma, the powers of this Council are greater than those of other municipal bodies in Fiji, and in some ways it approximates a legislative body. The Council consists of 14 full members and three advisory members. Each of Rotuma\u2019s seven districts elects one representative to the Council; the traditional chief of each district is also a Council member ex officio. The advisory members, who have speaking but not voting rights, are the district officer, the most senior medical officer, and the most senior agricultural officer, all of whom serve ex officio. The seven chiefs are chosen according to custom. The election is usually for life, although the Fijian cabinet minister responsible for Rotuma may, at his/ her discretion, dismiss a chief and order the election of a new one. The seven elected representatives are elected for three-year terms by resident Rotuman Islanders aged 21 and over. Candidacy is restricted to persons who are eligible to vote. The full members of the Council elect a chairperson from amongst themselves. Municipalities The Local Government Act 1985 (Cap 125), amended in 1997, is the principal statute governing municipalities in Fiji. The Minister for Local Government is responsible for its administration. DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 91 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Municipal Councils are single-tier authorities in urban areas. Councils may be designated as City or Town Councils. All have the same responsibilities. There are currently two City and 10 Town Councils. Local elections are conducted under the system of FPTP. Unlike national elections, voting is not compulsory. Councillors serve a term of four years and are eligible for re-election. The system is based on wards, with between three and five councillors per ward. The Electoral Commission determines the number of councillors that constitute a Council, and the number of councillors per ward. The national Electoral Commission divides each city and town into wards such that each ward has the same number of adult inhabitants, but this criterion may be varied to take into account geographic features, means of communication, and density and mobility of the population. The Electoral Commission also conducts municipal elections. Every citizen aged 21 or older and who is the occupier or owner of land or a house within the municipality is eligible to be enrolled as a voter. Voters are eligible to stand for election as councillors on condition that they are literate in one or more of Fiji\u2019s official languages (Fijian, English, Hindi). A number of legal clauses bar certain voters from being able to stand in municipal elections (e.g., those of \u201cunsound mind,\u201d those who occupy public office). A part-time mayor, who is the leader of the Council, is elected annually by the councillors and may be re-elected for further one-year terms. The Council recommends a mayoral allowance, which must be approved by the Minister. The mayor\u2019s primary functions are to chair meetings of the Council and to represent the Council at civic functions. In meetings of the Council, the mayor does not have veto power but can vote. S/he is not involved in the day-to-day administration of the Council\u2019s operations, which are the responsibility of the clerk appointed by the Council. The one-year term of the mayor is not considered a drawback since the Council\u2019s overall policy and development programme are formulated by all members. In addition to the elected councillors, the Minister may nominate advisers to assist the Municipal Council. Such advisers are entitled to attend meetings of the Council but they do not have a right to vote. 92 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS INDIA Table 11: Summary structure and features of LG system in India Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 459 Zilla Council/Panchayat Municipal Council Panchayats Corporations Largest: 800,000 Avg. pop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2812b467-9f58-4185-a738-11d9d3fd0217": {"__data__": {"id_": "2812b467-9f58-4185-a738-11d9d3fd0217", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29d0cb35bb255a479df96a50d3be29098296e67b9d008e09010aadee449d79fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "c81bbc2d-8ab6-4223-bb65-d83db9b4e641", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a404aee11b21493fa05f2709354eda4ff8f6e8f18de470474c8d124558e1166"}}, "hash": "8327e8c6190d3082f2b24f186b88be25bd75a377c4b849968551d240104a540d", "text": "pop.: Smallest: 100,000 1,000,000 Largest: 14,000,000 Smallest: 200,000 5,930 Panchayat Council/Panchayat Municipal Councils Council Samitis Avg. pop.: 350,000 Largest: 330,000 Largest: 500,000 Smallest: 3,000 Smallest: 50,000 240,000 Gram Council/Panchayat Nagar Panchayats Council Panchayats Avg. pop.: 25,000 Largest: 20,000 Largest: 50,000 Smallest: 670 Smallest: 5,000 Section 243B of the Constitution provides for Panchayats in every state, at the village, intermediate and district levels.

Each of India\u2019s 28 states thus has its own LG legislation, although laws are very similar in each state. Amendments are infrequent, and the legislative environment is currently stable. In principle and practice, the involvement of political parties in LG elections varies from state to state. Panchayats The Panchayats are situated in the rural areas of India. In 22 states there are three tiers in the Panchayati system, in one (Goa) there are two tiers, and in five (Jammu and Kashmir, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland) there is one. States with populations of less than 2 million are not required to adopt the three-tiered system. They are not strictly hierarchically organized; rather, duties are divided between them. There is a limited coordination role for higher levels of Panchayati authorities. Rural councillors are elected for five-year terms. The elections for council leader can be direct or indirect, depending on state law. 93 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific All councillors are directly elected by an FPTP system. All seats in a Panchayat are to be filled by persons chosen by direct election from territorial constituencies in the Panchayat area. For this purpose, each Panchayat area is divided into territorial constituencies such that the ratio between the population of each constituency and the number of seats allotted to it is, as noted above, the same throughout the Panchayat area. The state legislature may, by law, provide for the representation of certain individuals to different levels of Panchayats. All members of a Panchayat, whether chosen through elections or not, have the right to vote in Panchayat meetings. The chairperson of a Panchayat at village level is to be elected in the way prescribed by each state legislature, whereas a chairperson at the intermediate or district level is elected by, and from amongst, the elected members of the Panchayat (Article 243C). One-third of all seats are reserved for women. There also are reserved places for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, determined by their proportion of the local population. One-third of the places reserved for Scheduled Castes and Tribes must be allocated to women. Provisions also are made for the offices of the chairperson to be reserved for these groups (Article 243D). In both rural and urban areas, women members elected under the reserved places represent a ward like any other member. Six months before local elections, one-third of the wards are earmarked for women representatives. In the following election these wards lose their women-only status, and a further third of the municipality\u2019s or Panchayat\u2019s wards are designated for women candidates only. Direction and control of the preparation of electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to the Panchayats are the responsibility of the State Election Commissions. Subject to the provisions of the federal Constitution, a state legislature may by law make provision for all matters relating to elections to the Panchayats (Article 243K). Municipalities Article 243Q of the Constitution provides for the establishment of municipalities in every state. Municipal governance structures include: (i) a Nagar Panchayat (by whatever name it is called locally) for an area in transition from rural to urban; (ii) a Municipal Council for a smaller urban area; and (iii) a Municipal Corporation for a larger urban area. All seats in a municipality are filled by persons directly elected from territorial constituencies, with the exception of such members as the state legislature may provide for representation by law, such as persons having special knowledge or experience of municipal administration. It is the state legislature that decides how the chairperson of the municipality is to be elected (Article 243R). Within the territorial area of a municipality with a population of 300,000 or more, Ward Committees, consisting of one or more wards, are constituted.

Article 19(2) of Law No. 32/2004 provides that it is the regional administration, together with the Regional House of Representatives (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, or DPRD), which are responsible for governing the regions. The LG units are provinces, which in turn are made up of districts (or regencies) and cities. Each of these units has a legislative body, the DPRD), and an executive body in the form of a regional government (Article 3[1], Law No. 32/2004). In addition, the districts and cities are further divided into sub-districts, which in turn are made up of village units (Article 120, Law No. 32/2004). Regional elections are held at these cascading levels, providing a chance for local citizens to elect their representatives directly. All Indonesians citizens who are at least 17 years old or married have the right to vote. They must, however, register to vote, be \u201cmentally and spiritually healthy\u201d and may not have had their voting rights annulled by a court decision with permanent legal effect (Articles 68 and 69, Law No. 32/2004). 95 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific DPRDs \u2013 provincial, district (regency) and city levels In accordance with Article 46 of Law No. 32/2004, the DPRD is to consist of a speaker, commissions and committees. The law does not, however, provide for how the members of the DPRD are elected. This is prescribed in the DPRD Regulations (Article 46[2], Law No. 32/2004). DPRD members at the provincial, regency and city levels are elected through a form of PR-Open List. PR-Open List systems give voters control over both the number of seats each party wins in the representative body and the candidates from those parties who will represent voters by filling these seats. However, details of the system as adopted in Indonesia have placed relatively strong restrictions on how much influence the voters have on which candidates from the party of their choice will be elected. For provinces, regencies and cities, there are regional elections (pilkada), while the village head is directly elected on residents\u2019 initiative.

These include that the candidate must at least have graduated from senior high school (or equivalent); be at least 30 years old; submit a declaration of wealth and agree to make this declaration public; and believe in God. The elections of heads and deputy heads are administered by the Regional General Election Commission (KPUD) (Article 57[1], Law No. 32/2004). In accordance with Article 107 of Law No. 32/2004, the pair of candidates that receive more then 50 percent of votes are declared winners. However, should no candidates receive more then 50 percent, the pair that have the most votes \u2013 if more then 25 percent of the total votes cast \u2013 are declared the winners. Should no pair receive more then 25 percent of votes, a second-round election is called, with the first and second pair of candidates standing for election; the winners are the pair who receive the highest number of votes. The system used is thus a Majority Runoff Two-Round System (TRS). In addition to the head and deputy head, the government structure in the regions is to consist of the Regional Secretariat, headed by the regional secretary (appointed from amongst the civil servants and terminated by the President on the recommendation of the governor [Article 122, Law No. 32/2004]); the DPRD Secretariat, headed by the DPRD secretary (appointed and terminated by the regional heads with the approval of the DPRD [Article 123, Law No. 32/2004]); the regional services or executing agencies, each of which is headed by the head of services (appointed by the regional heads upon the recommendation of the regional secretary [Article 124, Law No. 32/2004]); and the technical institutions, the heads of which are appointed from amongst the cifil servants by the regional heads upon the recommendation of the regional secretary (Article 125, Law No. 32/2004). 96 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Sub-districts and villages In the districts and cities it also is provided that there should be sub-districts and village units (Article 120, Law No. 32/2004). The sub-districts are led by the sub-district head, appointed by the district head or mayor upon the recommendation of the regional secretary of the respective district or city. The sub-district head is to be appointed from amongst existing civil servants based on technical knowledge of government affairs as well as meeting requirements as prescribed by law (Article 126, Law No. 32/2004). Village units are headed by village chiefs elected among the population of the respective villages. At the village level, an administration may be established consisting of the village administration and the Village Consultative Council (Article 200, Law No. 32/2004). The village administration is headed by the village unit chief, who is directly elected. Eligible voters are Indonesian citizens residing in the village. The village unit chief who receives the highest number of votes wins (Article 203, Law No. 32/ 2004). The system for electing village unit chiefs is FPTP. The members of the Village Consultative Council are to be selected in accordance with the relevant regional regulations. The chairperson of the Council is to be elected from amongst its members (Article 210, Law No. 32/2004). Papua and Aceh Separate arrangements are made for LG as well as regional elections in the Special Autonomy Regions of Papua and Aceh. Regional elections in Aceh are run by an independent body, the Electoral Independent Commission, known as KIP (Komisi Independen Pemilihan). Not only party-nominated candidate but also independent candidates are allowed to be elected. In a province with a special status, there are significant variations with regard to decentralization and election issues. Organization of elections The General Elections Commission (KPU), with its structure cascading from the Centre to the district level, is responsible for conducting national, provincial and regency/city elections. Village elections are run by residents on their own risk and responsibility. Each participant or political party presents a list of candidates for an electoral district, voters vote for a party, and parties receive seats in proportion to their overall share of the vote (Electoral System Design \u2013 An Overview of the New International IDEA Handbook, 2005-2006).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6356a9f7-75f8-471a-a22c-2178e16694b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "6356a9f7-75f8-471a-a22c-2178e16694b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b81c3855ccbb11b4f442d4e937ad4db85ac715b272a15c48d4617487424056d"}, "2": {"node_id": "fa2f5086-e15d-4768-9531-9d57c2177237", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e454801ef59bf22c626f0647df96a0d7107b7651165cca113c7e04035dd85fe"}}, "hash": "3297f60a17b9ca18a452596067cfed36b2cc10a86d3e241458aef77a19e81609", "text": "97 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific IRAN Table 13: Summary structure and features of LG system in Iran Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies Rural District Indirect election; i.e., majority High Provincial In the second term of local Councils: 82413 votes of elected councillors Council (1) councils in Iran, each Provincial from village and legal urban Council selected one member residential complexes (at least", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fffdf41-7d46-4efe-9c49-9987eca07b5d": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fffdf41-7d46-4efe-9c49-9987eca07b5d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db60fa6d858f6c278f7562d0334e4ac4e0b6009d25368cad8f628484494fb56f"}}, "hash": "db60fa6d858f6c278f7562d0334e4ac4e0b6009d25368cad8f628484494fb56f", "text": "by majority vote.

Cities more than 1,000,000: 11 members and 5 standbys. Tehran: 15 members and 6 standbys. Total city councillors in the third local election: 5,400 13 For various reasons such as population growth of villages, the number of cities, rural districts and urban districts changes constantly. 14 In the third term of local council elections, unlike previous elections, legal residential complexes were regarded as cities. At the same time, council elections in new towns where construction is not finalized \u2013 and thus they are still managed by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning \u2013 constituted another locality apart from villages and cities. 98 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Article 7 and Articles 100 to 106 of the Constitution provide for the LG system in Iran. This system consists of six levels of local councils, two of which are formed by direct election for a four-year mandate. Each of Iran\u2019s provinces has an appointed governor-general and is divided into urban districts. Each urban district in turn is divided into a number of cities and rural districts. Again, each rural district is divided into a number of villages, independent farms and, in a few provinces, nomads. The latest modification of Local Councils Legislation, approved by Parliament in 2003, altered the number of village and city councillors but otherwise kept 1996 council legislation intact. It remains unclear, however, whether the number of councillors for rural, urban or provincial districts and the Supreme Council of Provinces will be likewise changed. Overall, the Local Councils Legislation attempts to prevent overrepresentation by any one locality in all tiers of local councils. In other words, attempts have been made to create a well-balanced organization without discriminating against small cities, towns and villages. Village and city councils are the most important \u2013 and in a sense, the only \u2013 institutions of local government in Iran directly elected by the people. According to Article 17 of the Local Councils Legislation, Village and City Council elections are direct, universal and by secret ballot. If the numbers of votes for two candidates are equal, one who has served in the Iraq-Iran war or has disabilities from participating in the Islamic Revolution is given priority. If neither is a war veteran nor has a disability caused by war or revolution, the one with a higher education is preferred and thereby elected. If the characteristics of those with equal votes are the same, the issue will be resolved through a draw. Rural District Councils As stipulated in the Local Councils Legislation, Rural District Councils are to be established by representatives of elected councillors from villages and legal residential complexes. Rural District Councils should have at least five councillors, with the maximum determined by the number of villages in the rural district. Urban District Councils The same method applies to the election of councillors for the Urban District Councils, Provincial Councils and Supreme Council of Provinces. Councils of urban districts, and those of the provinces, should have at least five councillors, with the maximum determined by the number of rural districts and cities in an urban district, or the number of urban districts in a province, or the number of Provincial Councils as well as the population of each province. According to the same legislation, the election of councillors for the higher tiers of the local council system first requires an absolute majority vote; otherwise, those who receive a relative majority are elected. Article 2 of the Local Councils Legislation states that if there are fewer than five urban districts in a province, preventing five councillors from serving in the Provincial Council, the remaining members should be elected", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0ff777e-02dc-431d-bfee-a93270342b1f": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0ff777e-02dc-431d-bfee-a93270342b1f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b633a15109f2eaa6c6294425a551a4461bb8decee4eb469e05d3c7076c62f67"}}, "hash": "9b633a15109f2eaa6c6294425a551a4461bb8decee4eb469e05d3c7076c62f67", "text": "from the councillors of larger cities in the province. In any case, however, no city can have more than two councillors present in the Provincial Councils. 99 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Municipality According to legislation, municipalities are regarded as public institutions or NGOs based on Government mandates; thus, the people\u2019s role in their formation and management has so far been negligible. Mayors are appointed by the City Councils, and decisions made by the municipalities must be reviewed and approved by the councils. This includes each municipality programme, plan of action and financial transaction. In the same manner, the Ministry of Interior must approve mayors after they are chosen. Organization of elections Chapter 2 Section B of the Local Councils Legislation stipulates the conditions for holding elections or being elected. Article 25 states that all citizens aged 15 years and older can vote in local council elections. In addition to the requirements of age and citizenship, a one-year residency also is necessary for those living in cities with populations of less than 100,000. All who work outside the locality where they wish to vote must prove that their dependents have been residing in that locality for at least one year. Article 26 stipulates conditions for those who wish to run as candidates for councillor. Individuals should register and announce their candidacy, and political parties endorse candidates only after the list of candidates is made public by the Ministry of Interior, which is responsible for administrative affairs of elections. No affiliation to political parties is required. Candidates should be at least 25 years old, residents of the locality where they desire to run and practicing Muslims or members of one of the other religions recognized by the Constitution. Candidates running for Village Councils should be literate and those for City Council (cities of up to 1 million) should have a high school diploma. For cities of more than 1 million, candidates should have at least two years of university education. City Council elections are monitored by an Urban District Election Executive Board consisting of Farmandar (city governor), head of the Office of Sabte Ahval (personal documentation office) head of the Department of Education, and eight members of the general public. Village Council elections are monitored by a Rural District Election Executive Board consisting of Bakhshdar (governor of rural district), head of the Office of Sabte Ahval, head of rural district Office of Education, head or deputy of the Office of Jihad of Agriculture, and seven citizens. 100 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS MALAYSIA Table 14: Summary structure and features of LG system in Malaysia15: Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 101 District President appointed by the 9 City Councils Mayor appointed by the state Councils state government Between 8 (pop. 100,000 and government Between 8 and (pop.: <100,000) and 24 councillors appointed above; rapid 24 councillors appointed by by the state government development) the state government Other employees of the Council 34 Municipal President appointed by the are employed directly by the Councils (pop. state government Between 8 local authority concerned 100,000 and and 24 councillors appointed above) by the state government Municipalities can be upgraded to cities through an application to the federal Government Special Forms Examples of No councillors Special Authorities: Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu and Kuching North, the capital of the state of Sarawak and the new administrative enclave Putrajaya 15 It should be noted that the table depicts a general description of the local governance structure in Malaysia. The dichotomy into rural and urban areas is not entirely appropriate for the country because almost all District Councils (except those of Sarawak and Sabah) incorporate urban areas and towns. Moreover, the jurisdiction of the Municipal Councils may also include large tracts of rural areas. For instance, the entire state of Perlis is under the Kangar Municipal Council and the entire Seberang Perai (Wellesley Province) is under the Seberang Perai Municipal Council. Three levels of government exist in Malaysia, namely, federal, state and local. Except for the few authorities created under special enactments by the Parliament, local councils in Peninsular Malaysia derive their power from the Local Government Act of 1976. The East Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak have their own legislation. Almost all are created by the state governments, with consent of the federal Government. There are 144 local authorities in Malaysia, made up of nine City Councils, 34 Municipal Councils and 101 District Councils. A total of eight Special Authorities have been created to administer selected areas such as Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfad510d-b4b6-47ba-9c95-ace94e165e52": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfad510d-b4b6-47ba-9c95-ace94e165e52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fe51ab93d0d6f33c0bcbe63d3a2c8eb111cf64ecd703720fcb2e95bb910261d"}, "3": {"node_id": "ce11280e-8ea8-44d9-babf-2c621200d756", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aaa72b20468d42059180e30ecd6983f7372f1f14b8d5aa9e48e4db429d8c6909"}}, "hash": "a0c43ac49f0b1cdb59eb59ec88f461e3c79d5cd924536e5325de906a787d41bc", "text": "in the state of Sabah, and Kuching North, covering the northern parts of Kuching, capital of Sarawak state, and the new administrative enclave Putrajaya. An example of a Special Authority is the Putrajaya Corporation, established under the Putrajaya Corporation Act 536, 1995. It was founded to develop, administer and manage Putrajaya and is entrusted with the functions of a local authority and local planning authority by various orders and notifications under the Local Government Act. 101 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Councils Malaysian local councils cover very large areas, with many having jurisdiction over more than 500 sq. km. They invariably incorporate several towns and large rural areas. Generally, Municipal Councils administer the bigger towns and more urbanized areas than District Councils. Elevation from Municipal Councils to City Councils requires the consent of the King with support of the federal Government and fulfilment of certain conditions, although this has not been strictly followed. Representation The main decision-making body of the councils is the Full Council, which consists of the president or mayor as chairperson and 24 councillors. All major decisions, including annual budgets, bylaws and permits to undertake land development, must be approved by the Full Council. The Special Authorities do not have councillors. For instance, Kuala Lumpur City Hall has only advisors, whose advice need not be followed. As such, its mayor is very powerful vis-\u00e0-vis his counterparts in most other councils. No local government elections are held in Malaysia; they were suspended in 1965 and subsequently abolished in 1976. The president or mayor and councillors are appointed by the respective state governments. The current practice is to appoint presidents or mayors from the ranks of the civil service. Councillors are appointed from nominees recommended by the ruling political parties of the state governments. Some senior state government officers are usually appointed as councillors. Opposition parties in the state governments do not have representation in the local councils. The tenure of appointment is from one to three years, but the law allows for reappointment. Some councilors have served for 20 years or more. Since presidents or mayors are full-time jobs, their salaries and benefits are the same as those of senior government officers. Councillors are given monthly allowances ranging from RM600 to RM 1,200. Opposition parties and civic groups have particularly called for bringing back LG elections. Women and marginalized groups As a whole, women are underrepresented in LG. Although some political parties have said that they would have 30 percent female councillors, this is usually not implemented. All major ethnic groups are represented in most local councils.

They encompass the island leaders, i.e., the assistant island chief(s) as well as the island chief in cases where the head of the local administration is a senior island chief. A direct reporting line is established to the atoll level by making the atoll chief (or officer-in-charge) the chairperson. The president of the IDC is the person in charge of the island office, or the island chief; therefore, s/he is the appointed head of public administration on the island, while the members elect the deputy president from amongst themselves. The number of members in an IDC varies according to the population of the island, namely: Population Elected members Appointed by Atoll Chief Below 1,000 5 2 1,000 - 3,000 6 3 Above 3,000 10 5 However, in practice, appointed members of the IDC are often the majority, since actual composition of IDCs often differs from that stipulated in the guidelines. No requirement exists to ensure representation of women amongst elected members of the IDC. Elections for elected members of the IDC are to be conducted through a secret ballot that presents a list of candidates. The voter (all persons registered on the island who are 18 or older) can mark his/her preferences, but has only as many choices as there are seats to be filled (using a Block Voting electoral system). Candidates with the most votes win. The administration of elections at island level is by an Election Committee appointed by the atoll chief in consultation with the Island Office. It comprises \u201csenior local government officials and persons other than those competing for membership,\u201d as per the IDC regulations. In cases where the number of candidates does not meet the required number of posts, all candidates who applied are granted membership and additional posts are filled by persons appointed by the atoll chief, in consultation with the Island Office. If a member of the committee resigns or is removed, a new member can be admitted to the IDC without an election. In practice, however, elections for the elected members to the IDC have been fairly inconsistent. In some islands, the island chief and atoll chief hand-picked representatives to the committee, while other islands run elections for the spots. However, these elections may include only the exact number of candidates as seats to be filled, and/or an Election Committee partially composed of candidates or individuals appointed as Council members. No explicit guidance is available on how candidates can compete for seats in the IDCs as members of political parties or groups. Atoll Development Committees The regulation governing ADCs stipulates that an ADC will include 10 to 20 appointed members (the exact number is determined on the basis of atoll population), who are named by the Ministry of Atolls Development on the advice of the atoll chief. There also exists a requirement that women be at least one-quarter of the members of every ADC, although this seems rarely followed. In most cases, the majority of the members are selected from among the IDC presidents (i.e., the island chiefs). The committee is chaired by the atoll chief (or officer-in-charge) and is a consultative body for the atoll chief. 104 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Interestingly, there was a brief experiment with directly electing ADCs and atoll chiefs during the late 1960s and 1970s. This was done through the same Block Vote electoral system, using the atoll as the unit of measure. Every eligible voter in the atoll was given the same list of candidates from which to select the required number of members; the atoll chief was the person winning the most votes. Women Development Committees In 1992 the National Women Committee established Island Women Development Committees (WDC) for each inhabited island. WDCs are expected to undertake a wide range of relevant activities considered of specific relevance to women. In reality, the WDCs tend mainly to provide cleaning services, prepare for receiving guests to the islands, and run training courses in tailoring and similar activities. The president of the WDC is represented in the IDC. 105 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific MONGOLIA Table 16: Summary structure and features of LG system in Mongolia Rural

Aimags in turn are divided into soums, soums into bags, the capital city into districts, and districts into horoos. There are three tiers of local governments. Each level consists of both the local self-governing body and the central Government representation According to the 1992 Constitution, \u201cgovernance of administrative and territorial units of Mongolia shall be organized on the basis of combination of the principles of both self-government and central Government\u201d (Article 59, Provision 1). 106 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Citizens of Mongolia residing in the administrative territorial units who are aged 18 and older have the right to vote. The exceptions are \u201cpersons who have been proved insane by the medical expertise and/ or court decisions,\u201d and those who are incarcerated. Hurals Residents of each administrative and territorial unit form the local self-governing organizations that represent them, Citizens\u2019 Representative Hurals (CRH), a form of democratic representation at aimag, capital city, soum and district levels; and Citizens\u2019 Common Hurals (CCH), a form of direct democracy at bag and horoo levels. During the intermission of these hurals, presidiums operate. Hurals have no executive powers; they formally discuss and approve the local budget, and governors implement it. Governors at all levels, except at bag and horoo level, have a relatively bigger office then hurals, operating daily. Several central Government agencies operate at aimag level. Almost all ministries, such as the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, have their own representative office in local governments. State administration responsibilities are to be implemented by the governors. Local self-governance functions are implemented through the CRHs. Each administrative and territorial unit has a governor nominated by the hural and appointed by a higher-level governor. Aimag/capital city governors are nominated by aimag/ capital city CRH and appointed by the Prime Minister as the head of central government. Aimag and soum governors appoint a lower-level governor by the same procedure as above. Most large national political parties and coalitions have their own sub-committees at aimag and soum levels. No independent local political party is registered. All parties define policies at both national and local level. For instance, the MPRP (Mongolian People\u2019s Revolutionary Party) and Democratic Party have sub-committees in aimags and soums. About 70-100 committee members are at the aimag level. In practice, local governors head their own local party committees. If the party wins the local election, a chairperson of the committee could be appointed as governor. The main interest of political parties in elections is to get a governor\u2019s position, and local governments\u2019 executive power. In order to achieve this, they must be a majority in CRHs. Local committees elaborate their own local election campaign programme within the framework of the national policy programme defined by the parties\u2019 headquarters.

Representation of ordinary citizens and herders in local hurals is limited. Hural decisions are usually influenced by the governor and his office, which can lead to difficulties. For instance, public officials in hurals make decisions and implement them on their own, which leads to a lack of accountability and control mechanisms between the hural and the governor. 107 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Organization of elections The Law of Local Election was adopted in1993 and amended in 2000 and 2007. Local election is based on free, direct, secret principles. Election sub-committees at aimag/capital and soum/district levels are responsible for all organizational issues. The election sub-committee\u2019s members, chairperson and secretary are appointed by their aimag or soum hural. Aimag/capital and soum/district hural elections are conducted on the same date. Article 5.1 of the Local Election Law declares that a single mandate should be allocated for one election constituency. A constituency should depend on population size. Aimag, capital city, soum and district CRHs decide the set-up of constituencies in their respective territories. For example, if an aimag CRH has 35 seats, the aimag territory is divided into 35 constituencies. Each mandate can nominate candidates from political parties; coalitions are officially registered at the Prime Court of Mongolia. Nomination is also open for independent candidates who collect more than 200 citizens\u2019 signatures for aimag/capital hurals and more than 75 for soum/district hurals. Elections are conducted by Election Commissions at national, aimag/capital and soum/district levels. Candidates are nominated by a sub-organization of the national political parties and coalitions working at LG levels. Registration of candidates is decided by local election sub-committee within three days after completing the official submission. A person nominates his/her candidacy in one constituency, or the nomination is recognized only in one constituency. Candidates have the right to refuse a nomination. Parties and coalitions also have the right to withdraw their candidates and replace them with others. The candidates, parties and coalitions should immediately inform the Election Commission of these decisions, and the Election Commission announces the polling day, hours and places 10 days before Election Day.

The following section outlines the arrangement as intended under the Local Self-Governance Act (LSGA) 1999. 110 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Districts The highest level of LG is the District Council which, in accordance with Section 172 of the LSGA, consists of the chairperson and vice chairperson of each Village Development Committee in the district; the mayor and deputy mayor of each municipality in the district; the members of the District Development Committee; the district members of the House of Representatives and the National Assembly as ex officio members; and six persons, including one woman, nominated by the District Council from amongst the poor and tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous peoples (Section 8).17 The District Development Committee is an executive body of the District Council and in accordance with Section 176 is made up of members elected by the elected members of the Village Council and Municipal Council in each area, at the rate of one member from each area; a president and vice president elected by the elected members of each Village Council and Municipal Council in the district from amongst themselves; district members of the House of Representatives and National Assembly as ex officio members; and two members, including one woman, nominated by the District Development Committee on the same principles as in the case of the District Council. Municipalities Section 72 of the LSGA provides that any area with a population of at least 20,000 and with electricity, roads, drinking water and communications facilities may be designated as a municipal area. Each municipal area should be further divided into no fewer than nine wards (Section 73). Each ward is to have a Ward Committee constituting one ward chairperson, one woman ward member, and three ward members elected by eligible voters in each district (Section 75). Each municipal area is to have a Municipal Council consisting of the mayor and deputy mayor of the municipality; the ward chairperson, woman ward member and ward members of each Ward Committee; and six to 20 persons, including women, nominated by the Municipal Council from amongst the poor and tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous peoples. At least 40 percent of those selected in this way must be women (Section 76). Section 80 provides that a municipality is to be constituted as an executive of the Municipal Council in a municipal area. Villages Each Ward Committee is to consist of one ward chairperson, one woman ward member and three ward members elected by eligible voters in the ward (Section 7). The Village Council, constituted in each village development area, consists of the Village Development Committee chairperson and vice chairperson, the members of the Ward Committees within the village development area, and six persons, including one woman, nominated by the Village Council from amongst the poor and tribes, ethnic communities and indigenous peoples. The Village Development Committee acts as an executive of the Village Council. The Committee is headed by a chairperson and vice chairperson directly elected by eligible voters in the village development area; the chairpersons of the Ward Committees; and two members, including one woman, nominated by the Village Development Committee, on the same principles as in the case of the Village Council (Section 12). Organization of elections The Constitution empowers the Election Commission to conduct, supervise, direct and control elections to local bodies at the village, town and district levels. The electoral rolls of voters for the above purposes also are to be prepared by the Election Commission. At the local level, both independent candidates and political parties can contest elections. 17 This is the terminology used in the legislation. 111 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific PAKISTAN Table 18: Summary structure and features of LG system in Pakistan Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 102 districts District Councils \u2013 composed of 8 city districts City District Councils \u2013 UC nazims and others (district Largest = > composed of UC nazims and nazim and district naib nazim + 9,000,000 others (district nazim and others) elected by all U Smallest = 565,000 district naib nazim + others) councillors in the district elected by all UC councillors in the city district 332 tehsils Tehsil Councils \u2013 composed of 62 city towns City Town Councils \u2013 UC naib nazims and other composed of UC naib nazims members (tehsil nazim and tehsil and other members (tehsil naib nazim, and others) elected nazim and tehsil naib", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "070e8508-540d-45e3-bbb3-bf34f4e8604b": {"__data__": {"id_": "070e8508-540d-45e3-bbb3-bf34f4e8604b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f6735748299e3aa4494492184dee44c9d8a5ed0e380dbcad653c4a83a2868cd"}, "3": {"node_id": "5e8861ab-1c8e-4610-8d05-26ec105d53dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61b308b63b243868b55acd405ee970316accd81f08f58412ab56a6367a2de498"}}, "hash": "31d001e1e6b9b86cd55a4ac639ec0958b92fcea44b1f0c88fc58333a2e2aea14", "text": "nazim, by all UC councillors in the tehsil and others) elected by all UC councillors in the city town 6,125 unions Union Councils \u2013 13 elected Unions Union Councils \u2013 13 elected Avg. pop:. 25,000 members, headed by nazim members, headed by nazim and naib nazim and naib nazim The LG of Pakistan is divided into several levels with district/city district as the highest level, together with tehsil and town administration. Below this level come the Union, Village and Neighbourhood Councils. LG elections are held on a non-party basis. The electorate for the Union Councils is made up of all registered voters who are citizens aged 18 and older. Union Councils The foundation of the electoral structure for the three tiers of LG is the Union Council. The union is a multi-member ward for the election of members of the Union Council (each constituency is on average 25,000 people, which is large). Each Union Council comprises 13 directly elected members;18 before a 2005 amendment of the Local Government Ordinance (LGO), there were 21 directly elected members. The nazim and naib nazim (mayor and deputy mayor) are elected on a joint ticket. The remaining 11 seats on the Union Council are allocated as follows: \u25cf Six Muslim members elected to general seats (including two reserved for women) \u25cf Four members elected from peasant and worker classes (including one seat reserved for women) \u25cf One member elected to a seat reserved for minority communities19 18 Councillors must be at least age 25, a citizen residing in the relevant ward, of \u201cgood Muslim character\u201d (except for non-Muslims), and must not have been convicted of various crimes, nor be an employee of federal, provincial or LGs. Nazims and naib nazims must have a matriculation or secondary school certificate. 19 Where minorities exceed 10 percent of the union\u2019s population, there is provision for the number of minority community seats to be increased by reallocating Muslim general or peasant/worker seats. 112 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 20 The term of office was changed from three years through an amendment in 2002. The arithmetic of local government elections Assume a district with 60 Union Councils (UCs), grouped in three tehsils of the same size (20 UCs per tehsil) Direct elections: Union Councils \u25cf There are direct elections for all 13 UC councillors. Eleven are elected individually, but the UC nazim and naib nazim are elected on a joint ticket. In this example, there are therefore 780 UC councillors overall. Indirect elections: Tehsil Councils \u25cf Each UC naib nazim is automatically a member of the Tehsil Council \u25cf In addition to the 20 UC naib nazim, each of the three Tehsil Councils has a tehsil nazim and naib nazim, plus nine additional members: seven women councillors, one peasant/worker councillor and one minority councillor \u25cf The tehsil nazim and the additional nine councillors are elected by the 260 UC councillors (20 UCs in the tehsil x 13 UC councillors per UC) \u25cf The tehsil naib nazim is elected from amongst themselves by Tehsil Council members at their first meeting District Councils \u25cf Each UC nazim is automatically a member of the District Council \u25cf In addition to the 60 UC nazim, the District Council has a district nazim and naib nazim, and 26 additional members: 20 women councillors, three peasants/workers and three minority councillors \u25cf The district nazim and the additional 26 councillors are elected by the 780 UC councillors \u25cf The district naib nazim is elected from amongst themselves by District Council members at their first meeting Tehsil and District Councils The nazim of the Union Council then becomes ex officio a member of the District Council. The naib nazim of the Union Council becomes ex officio a member of the Tehsil Council The union councillors constitute the electoral college for the district/tehsil councillors at large and for the district and tehsil nazim (who cannot be a union councillor).

This emphasis on women\u2019s participation in politics is a dramatic break from the past. In addition, 5 percent of district and tehsil seats have been reserved for peasants (in rural constituencies) or workers (in urban areas), and 5 percent for minorities. Thus, overall District Councils and Tehsil Councils are made up of about two-thirds directly elected members and one-third indirectly elected, including the nazim and naib nazim. The inset on the facing page illustrates how the electoral system operates. Municipal arrangements As provided by Section 93 the tehsil municipal administration or town municipal administration respectively may provide for the creation of a Neighbourhood or Village Council consisting of five to 11 members each, provided that for each Council one seat is reserved for women and one seat for peasants and workers. A Council is headed by a chairperson who shall be the person securing the highest number of votes in the election of the Council. Section 9 provides that the tehsil municipal administration and town municipal administration conduct the elections of Councils. Organization of elections In accordance with the Local Government Elections Order 2000, LG elections are conducted by the chief election commissioner (Section 150). It is also the chief election commissioner who prepares the electoral rolls for local elections (Subsection 157[2]). As prescribed by Section 153, LG elections are to be held on non-party basis. 114 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS PAPUA NEW GUINEA Table 19: Summary structure and features of LG system in PNG Provincial Government Rural areas Urban areas 19 provinces + 1 national capital district Provincial Assembly made up of: (Port Moresby) \u25cf Members of the (National) House of Assembly Avg. pop.: 270,000 from that province \u25cf Heads of rural LGs \u25cf A representative of the urban LGs \u25cf 1 woman representative \u25cf 3 chieftaincy representatives (in those provinces where it is appropriate) \u25cf Up to 3 further nominees Local-level Government Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 273 LLGs Local Councils made up of 26 LLGs Local Councils made up of Avg. pop.: 16,000 elected (single-member) ward Avg. pop.: 16,000 elected (single-member) ward representatives and up to representatives and up to 3 additional members 3 additional members appointed to represent various appointed to represent various interest groups: interest groups: \u25cf 1 nominated by the PNG \u25cf 1 nominated by the PNG Trade Union Congress Trade Union Congress \u25cf 1 nominated by the \u25cf 1 nominated by the Employers\u2019 Federation Employers\u2019 Federation \u25cf 1 to represent women\u2019s \u25cf 1 to represent women\u2019s organizations.

The chairperson of the Provincial Assembly and head of the provincial government, known as the provincial governor, is normally the member of the national Parliament representing the provincial electorate. A total of 20 members of PNG\u2019s Parliament are elected from the 19 provinces and the national capital district of Port Moresby. These regional (at-large) Members of Parliament become provincial governors while retaining their national seats in Parliament. The provincial governor may be dismissed, however, by a two-thirds majority of the Provincial Assembly, in which case another person must be elected from amongst the other national MPs in the Provincial Assembly. The governor may not be in an executive position in government, or speaker or deputy speaker of the house, or leader or deputy leader of the opposition. If the provincial MP accepts such a position (which thus disqualifies him/her from being provincial governor), or is otherwise removed, s/he is to be replaced by another MP from the province. The governor is constitutionally responsible to the Minister for Provincial and Local-Level Governments.The deputy governor, meanwhile, is elected from amongst and by the representatives of the local-level governments. The Provincial Executive Council comprises the governor and deputy governor, as well as the chairpersons of the permanent committees (not exceeding one-third of the membership of the Assembly). Because the governor appoints the committee chairpersons, this provision gives the governor considerable authority. LLG Councils LLG councillors are directly elected by the FPTP system.21 For LLG Councils PNG has a ward system, each electing a single member to the Council. Each LLG has four to 40 wards, each represented by an elected councillor. Each Council may also have up to three additional members appointed to represent various interest groups: \u25cf One nominated by the PNG Trade Union Congress \u25cf One nominated by the Employers\u2019 Federation \u25cf One to represent women\u2019s organizations. In rural areas, two women are nominated. This has ensured the inclusion of at least one woman appointed councillor in each of the 299 LLGs. Ten percent of all councillors are women. 116 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS All council members, whether elected or appointed, have voting powers. Council elections are held at the same time as national elections. In 2002 these elected 6,003 councilors. A further 424 members were appointed to represent women, workers\u2019 unions and employers\u2019 federations. Political parties are fully entitled to contest local elections in PNG. Candidates for LLG elections must be able to demonstrate strong local affiliations (birth, residence, descent, local-language fluency). Conditions for ineligibility include insanity, insolvency and a prior criminal record; in addition, LLG employees are not allowed to stand for election. Local councils operate a leader-in-council system. The whole council represents the executive body as well as the legislative body in LG. The leader of the authority may be elected by the councillors or, if there is a proclamation by the head of State, directly elected by the electorate. The term of office is five years. All leaders are full-time and are paid monthly determined by the Salaries Remuneration Commission. The Organic Law provides for participative structures, including a committee system that involves reporting from community meetings to ward development committees to the local council assemblies. Each ward committee comprises the elected member for the ward (who is the chairperson) and a maximum of five community representatives (of whom two must be women) as associate members. The function of the ward committee is to serve as a consultative and advisory committee to the LG council.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

provides for the territorial and political subdivisions of the Philippines (Section 1). The Constitution further provides that the Congress is to enact an LG code providing for, amongst other things, the qualification, election, appointment and removal, term, salaries, powers, and functions and duties of local officials (Section 3). Congress has duly enacted the Local Government Code 1991 (LGC). As provided by Book III of the LGC, the Local Government Units (LGU) of the Philippines are: \u25cf Barangay (the basic political unit) \u25cf Municipalities \u25cf Cities \u25cf Provinces 118 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Cities can be either Component or Highly Urbanized, with the distinction being that Highly Urbanized Cities do not belong to a province (and consequently, those entitled to vote in elections for the government of the Highly Urbanized Cities may not vote in provincial elections [Omnibus Election Code (OEC), Article IV, Section 30]). Barangay The chief executive of the barangay government is the punong barangay or barangay captain (LGC, Section 389). The barangay captain is elected by all qualified voters in the barangay, voting as one constituency (LGC, Section 41[a]) and applying the FPTP system. The legislative body of the barangay is the Sangguniang Barangay or Barangay Council. The Barangay Council comprises: \u25cf Barangay captain \u25cf Seven regular members. The same principle is applied when electing the regular members of the Barangay Council as when electing the barangay captain (LGC, Section 41[b]), with the difference that each voter casts the same number of votes as there are seats to be filled; i.e., a candidate-centred Block Vote system \u25cf Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) chairperson (LGC, Section 390). In addition to the elected members of the Barangay Council, there also exists a barangay secretary and a barangay treasurer, both of whom are appointed by the barangay captain with the concurrence of all Sangguniang Barangay members (LGC, Sections 394 and 395). In accordance with Section 393 of the LGC, members of the Barangay Council (including the secretary and treasurer) receive honoraria and allowances in accordance with the relevant law or local ordinance (the LGC provides for a minimum level of monthly remuneration), as well as a number of other benefits such as insurance and free medical care. As provided for in Article VI, Section 38, of the OEC, barangay elections should be non-partisan, meaning that: \u201cNo person who files a certificate of candidacy shall represent or allow himself to be represented as a candidate of any political party or any other organization; and no political party, political group, political committee, civic, religious, professional or other organization or organized group of whatever nature shall intervene in his nomination or in the filing of his certificate of candidacy or give aid or support, directly or indirectly, material or otherwise favourable to or against his campaign for election [\u2026].\u201d In practice, however, candidates are typically affiliated with \u2013 as well as supported and funded by \u2013 political parties. In addition to the Barangay Council there is also a Sangguniang Kabataan or Youth Council in each barangay comprising chairperson, seven members, a secretary and a treasurer. The chairperson and the members are elected by the members of the Katipunanng Kabataan, which consists of all citizens residing in the barangay for at least six months and who are aged 15 to 21 (LGC, Sections 41[a] and 424). The secretary and treasurer are appointed by the chairperson from amongst, and with the concurrence of, the members (LGC, Section 430[d]). As noted above, the chairperson of the Youth Council also acts as an ex officio member of the Barangay Council and as such also enjoys the same privileges as other members of the Barangay Council. All members of the Barangay Council are exempt from payment of tuition fees (LGC, Section 434). Candidates for the Youth Council must be aged 15 to 21(LGC, Section 39[f]).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5686c74-d29e-453e-86e3-1eff5cfd10ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5686c74-d29e-453e-86e3-1eff5cfd10ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c20ee7d67015246750b140735371af19f5f062c8ed4afd096ef57a29b658b047"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c4c36b7-4bdc-4093-92cd-94fcc73e4e24", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c348bfcf1244d38b387371c10cbd4dacb4251de1a9106ea63c3f2100151b4588"}}, "hash": "02360ad0da51411005b532df2af18a21f21082f0e5d12f380c38c9418eed09ba", "text": "119 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific Municipalities The chief executive of the municipal government is the municipal mayor (LGC, Section, 446[a]), assisted by a municipal vice mayor (LGC, Section 445).

If a political party is to take part in elections for PR Si/Do Council members, it has to submit a list of candidates to the Electoral Commission. To encourage women\u2019s political participation, each party must allocate women\u2019s seats in its PR council members; more than half of the candidates endorsed should be female, and every second candidate should be a female in order of the ranking of candidates in the list. If a political party does not observe the rule, its candidate registration is invalid. At the same time, neither affirmative nor discriminative action measures for specific ethnic or occupational groups have been adopted. Chairperson of the Si/Do Council must be elected by local council representatives, and a majority party takes the post. The Autonomous Gu, Si/Gun Council Autonomous Gu, Si/Gun Council members are elected on the basis of dong/eup, myeon, which are administrative \u2013 not local autonomy \u2013 districts; they total 2,888. A candidate of the Gu, Si/Gun Council can be endorsed by political parties. Thus, there is a proportional member from the election of Gu, Si/ Gun Council members just as with the Si/Do Council; independent candidates are also encouraged to register. A majority party takes the chair of the Autonomous Gu, Si/Gun Council, and should be elected by the council representatives. There also exists affirmative action to encourage women\u2019s political participation, which stipulates that each party must allocate women\u2019s seats in its PR council members. There is no affirmative/discriminative action measure in line with a candidate\u2019s ethnicity and/or other background. A myeon with fewer than 1,000 people or a dong with fewer than 6,000 is combined with a dong/eup, myeon adjacent to a district that elects only one local council member. A eup with a population of more than 30,000 or a dong with a population of more than 50,000 has one more local council member. If the number of council members calculated is fewer than seven, the full number will be seven. Thus, some dong/eup, myeon elect two or more members. In 2003, Seongnam-si has the largest number, at 41, and numerous Si/Guns, such as Ulleung-gun, have the smallest number, seven members. Organization of elections The elections of Si/Do Councils adopt single-member plurality system, while Gu, Si/Gun Councils adopt a multi-member plurality system. The delimitation of electoral districts in the Republic of Korea is with the full consideration of administrative districts, population, living districts, transportation, geographical features, and various other political, economic, geographic and social elements. The election district for a Si/Do Council member is delimited by dividing the Autonomous Gu, Si/Gun in consideration of various social, economic, political and geographic conditions. If an Autonomous Gu, Si/Gun consists of two or more election districts for National Assembly members, its borders are determined by the election district for the National Assembly member. The election district for an Autonomous Gu, Si/Gun Council member is delimited in the dong/eup, myeon as a unit. A myeon with a population of fewer than 1,000 or a dong with a population of fewer than 6,000 is unified with the adjacent dong/eup, myeon into one election district. A eup with a population of more than 30,000 or dong with more than 50,000 is divided into two election districts. 124 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SOLOMON ISLANDS Table 23: Summary structure and features of LG system in the Solomon Islands Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 9 provinces Provincial Councils made up of Honiara City City Council made up of Avg. pop.: 51,000 9 to 30 Councillors elected for Pop.: 70,000 councillors elected for 4 years Smallest: 5,250 4 years from wards on from wards on FPTP basis Largest: 157,000 FPTP basis Noro Town Town Council made up of Pop.: 5,000 councillors elected for 4 years from wards on FPTP basis The system of LG is made up of nine provinces, the city of Honiara (the capital) and the town of Noro.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7dc236f-75b4-435e-bff0-5376e585672f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7dc236f-75b4-435e-bff0-5376e585672f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b677b89cc0e07e7553d72ffd271b6ead44196bce2fcbe5ce54c1bc1977eb2d84"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fdbd766-aaa3-45b8-be6d-8ed68c3886b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1a25873182a32608e5836fc6cbb7b9f5669c424c1d384328604d3c680877157"}}, "hash": "ed127694b3564280c75c387b5a20be8dcb5b1502c452f95163ed61b5e3ea3e8e", "text": "The main legislation governing LG is: \u25cf Provincial Government Act \u25cf Honiara City Council Act, currently under review Provincial governments are envisaged in the Solomon Islands Constitution and were established in law through the 1981 Provincial Government Act, re-enacted in 1997 legislation.

The Provincial Executive is led by the Premier, who is elected (for a four-year term) by an absolute majority of Provincial Assembly members. The Provincial Premier is a full-time position. Once elected, the Premier appoints a Deputy Premier and Ministers with portfolio responsibilities, even where the sectoral responsibilities of the province for services delivery are minimal. The provincial secretary is accountable to the Premier and the Executive, in the same way as national permanent secretaries are accountable to their Ministers. Urban mayors also are elected by their councillors for four years. Unlike Provincial Premiers, mayors are part-time. Their remuneration is set by the Minister. Very few women hold elected office, and the one leader who is a woman is the chairperson of the appointed authority currently administering Honiara City Council. 125 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific The Constitution allows for traditional leadership to be incorporated formally into provincial structures, although this has never been achieved. Traditional leaders or chiefs are widely seen as a credible source of village governance; however, integration into the formal political system has never been successfully completed. The role of traditional leaders is most commonly associated with questions of land use, and the legal system allows for Local Courts to adjudicate land disputes to avoid bringing cases to court. Great variation of customary leadership roles exists within Solomon Islands and such roles are not always seen as relevant to administrative functions, but some Provinces, notably Isabel, are considering more formal systems to facilitate advisory roles for traditional leaders at both province and village level. The question of how to integrate traditional leadership into formal governance structures has been a focus of discussions of how to reform provincial government since the 1970s and remains a priority for Solomon Islanders. Organization of elections The Department of Provincial Government and Rural Development is responsible for overseeing provincial and other local elections. Current election arrangements date to May 2003, when LPV supplanted FPTP; the first general election to use LPV was scheduled to be held in 2007. At the national level, the FPTP system was used during national general elections of April 2006, with a single ballot box for casting votes. At the provincial level, elections conducted in late 2006 and early 2007 have used the FPTP system and multiple ballot boxes. 126 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS SRI LANKA Table 24: Summary structure and features of LG system in Sri Lanka Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 9 provinces (only Provincial Councils: number of 7 are functional members determined by the as LGs) President.

The present electoral system is regulated by the Local Authorities Election Act of 1989 and successive amendments. The Act changed dramatically the pre-existing arrangements by abolishing the ward system and establishing the local authority area as a single electorate, so that each elected councillor represents the entire population of the local authority, not a specific ward. Political parties and Independent Candidates (IC) Groups (a provision that restricts the rights of individuals wishing to run without affiliation) submit lists of candidates, each including as many candidates as the total number of councillors to be elected, plus three more. Nomination lists are submitted under the signature of the political parties\u2019 secretaries or the IC Groups\u2019 leaders. Such lists must include 40 percent of candidates younger than age 35, in compliance with the constitutional mandate to promote the youth. Since the local elections of 1997, each voter has been able to give all three preference votes to the same candidate. The number of councillors elected from each party or IC Group is determined by the proportion of votes received by that party or Group. The party or IC Group that gets the highest share of votes also gets a \u201cbonus\u201d of two additional seats. Any party or IC Group that gets less than one-eighth of the total votes will not be represented in the Council. The parties and IC Groups that receive the highest number of votes nominate Council members elected in their lists for mayor/deputy mayor or chairperson/vice chairperson. These are then appointed by the National Commissioner of Elections, who also ratifies the election results and number of seats accruing to each political party or IC Group. The term of office is four years. The Minister in charge has the power to extend this term for an additional year. Municipalities As provided for by Part I of the Municipal Councils Ordinance, areas may be declared as municipalities by the Minister. For each municipality a Municipal Council is constituted, consisting of a mayor and deputy mayor as well as the number of councillors prescribed by order of the Minister. As provided for by Sections 8 and 14, councillors and the mayor and deputy mayor, who also are councillors, are to be elected in general elections in accordance with the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. Under Part I of the Urban Councils Ordinance, in urban areas the Minister may define the jurisdiction for which an Urban Council is constituted. This consists of a chairperson and vice chairperson as well as the number of members prescribed by order of the Minister. All members of the Urban Councils are to be elected by general election (Section 7). 128 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Pradeshiya Sabhas Part I of the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act, No. 15 of 1987, states that the Minister may provide for the delimitation and establishment of a Pradeshiya Sabha consisting of a chairperson and vice chairperson as well as the number of members as prescribed by order of the Minister, to be elected by general election. Organization of elections Elections are organized under the overall responsibility of the National Commission of Elections. District secretaries, the central Government agents in the districts, act as election officers and are responsible for voter registration and the conduct of the polls. 129 Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific THAILAND Table 25: Summary structure and features of LG system in Thailand Provincial Administrative Organization Levels Representative bodies 75 Provincial Administrative Organizations (PAO) PAO Council (24-48 elected members)/ Avg. pop.: a single-member ward Large: 2,500,000 Directly elected head of PAO Small: 186,000 Rural areas Urban areas Levels Representative bodies Levels Representative bodies 6,620 Tambon Council (numbers depend on Municipality Council (12 members for town/ Administrative numbers of village/ two elected Pop.: 12,379,635 18 for city and 24 for Organizations members per village) metropolitan municipalities)/ (TAO) Avg. pop.: Directed elected TAO executive A six-member ward Large: 25,000 Directly elected mayor Small: 2,000 Special Forms Bangkok BMA Council (100,000 Metropolitan residents a councillor/ around Administration 60 elected members) and (BMA)- Pop.: District Council (6-7 elected 5,705,855 members per district)/ (registered a single-member ward numbers) Directly elected BMA governor Pattaya City- Council (24 elected members)/ Specific Form a six-member ward Pop.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "473399a9-ce0f-456e-a7b7-6bb78390a2a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "473399a9-ce0f-456e-a7b7-6bb78390a2a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2639d00f12cb0ae1f8b563d931af452bc830e1fadd17f653aac82d07847a914"}, "2": {"node_id": "5583875a-d3a8-46e8-94ae-79aff962ecfc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "10412fb7ed63cad5349f8161c6c935036782be652f96406d6117dd9c85bec4c7"}}, "hash": "c6548768e103a70af74d7f22401016df0c47698831dfc4cfd90af43d639124f3", "text": ": 101,465 Directly elected mayor In Thailand exist 7,855 units of local authorities, which are classified into five forms, including three general and two specific.

The other two special forms of local authorities are self-governing bodies of special areas, including Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and Pattaya City. Each local entity is governed by a local council and local chief executive, both of which are directly elected from local residents for four-year terms. Local elections apply the FPTP rule. The electorate for local elections is made up of voters who are Thai citizens aged 18 or older. 130 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS Provincial Administrative Organizations (PAO) As provided by the Provincial Administrative Organization Act of 1997, a PAO is established in every province but Bangkok. Each PAO is legally regarded as a \u201csupra-local authority,\u201d as its territory covers the whole province, under which municipalities and sub-district administrative organizations are located. The council and head of the PAO are directly elected by people for a four-year term; a province is considered as one constituency. The council comprises 24-48 elected members, depending on the numbers of citizens in the province. A single-member ward constituency and FPTP rule are applied for the election of the PAO council. A candidate for head of PAO must be at least 30 years old and hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree or equivalent. The head of PAOs has a two-term limit. Municipalities According to the Municipal Government Act of 1953, amended in 2003, municipalities can be classified into three categories: metropolitan (tessaban na-korn), city (tessaban muang), and town (tessaban tambon). The classification principally reflects community sizes. In principle, municipal territories occupy urban areas. However, municipal sizes are relatively small and do not cover all urbanized areas. Similar to PAOs, both municipal mayors and councillors are directly elected by the people for a four-year term. The number of councillors varies according to municipal category, 12 for town, 18 for city and 24 for metropolitan. The election of councils is an FPTP system and a multi-member ward constituency; each ward has six members. The municipal mayor is elected at large, considering a municipal area as one constituency. Candidates for mayor must be at least 30 years old and hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree. The two-term limit is also applied. Sub-District/Tambon Administrative Organizations (TAO) TAOs were established under the Tambon Administrative Organization Act of 1994 when the Government aimed at decentralizing national administration to rural areas. TAOs can be classified into three categories (small, medium, large) according to their local incomes. Most TAOs are small, rural, and less developed communities. Both the TAO council and the executive are directly elected by the people under the FPTP system. The election of TAO councils is a two-member ward constituency, regarding a village as a ward. The TAO executive is elected at large, regarding a sub-district as a constituency. A candidate must be 30 years old and hold at least a secondary school certificate. Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), a special form of local authority, governs Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. Under the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration Act of 1985, the BMA governor and the council are directly elected by BMA residents for a four-year term. The BMA council comprises around 60 members and functions as the legislative body. The election of the BMA council is a single-member ward (one member per 100,000 residents), and FPTP is applied. The BMA governor is elected at large, regarding Bangkok as one constituency. Candidates for BMA governor must be at least 25 years old but have no educational requirement. BMA also has 50 territorial administrations, the so-called \u201cdistricts.\u201d Each district has a District Council, the members of which are elected by local residents. The election is a multi-member ward, and each ward has six or seven members. The district chief executives are appointed by the governor. The District Council is not a legislative but a consultative body of district administration. 131 Pattaya City Pattaya City, founded by the Pattaya City Act of 1978, is another special form of local authority.

Section 65 of the Constitution further prescribes that LG shall be chosen through election. No permanent system for administrative divisions and LG has yet been established in Timor-Leste. Pending a final decision, Timor-Leste has adopted legislation \u2013 Law 2/2004 and Decree-Law 5/2004 \u2013 in order to recognize existing organizations at the suco (village) level and to allow for their legitimization through the holding of local elections. Suco councils are, however, seen more as formalized community bodies than LGs per se, and the purpose of electing councils to re-establish the legitimacy of the suco leadership had been eroded in many areas. A draft policy has been formulated to create elected local councils at district level. Timor-Leste is divided into districts, sub-districts, sucos and aldeias (sub-villages/hamlets). No elections are held for the two higher levels. The national Government has appointed district coordinators and district offices of the main Ministries, and sub-district coordinators at the sub-district level, which is the lowest level of government administration. Sucos At the suco level there is a Suco Council, comprising the suco chief, who heads the Council; the chiefs of the aldeias that make up the suco; two women; two young persons of each gender; and one village elder. A young person is aged 17 to 35, and an elder is older than age 50 (Article 3, Law 2/2004). In accordance with Article 2 of Law 2/2004, the suco chief, as well as the other members of the Suco Council, is to be elected by direct ballot. Timorese citizens are eligible to vote in local elections if they are at least 17, have resided in the suco during the previous six months and are registered in the suco\u2019s electoral roll. To be eligible to vote for the village heads, a voter also must reside in the respective village (Article 7, Law 2/2004). A person is disqualified from voting if s/he is barred by an irrevocable sentence or \u201cclearly and publicly known to be insane\u201d (Article 8, Law 2/2004). All eligible to vote are also eligible to stand for election, provided that the candidate has resided in the suco in which the candidate intends to stand for at least one year before the polling day (Article 9, Law 2/2004). Article 10 of Law 2/2004 provides for different groups that are prohibited from standing for election, including Members of Parliament as well as public servants, with the exception health workers and teachers. 133 Candidates may submit their candidature on their own behalf or may be nominated by a political party or a coalition of political parties.

At the provincial level the administrative units are provinces and cities under direct central rule. Provinces are further divided into districts, provincial cities and towns, and cities under direct central rule are divided into urban districts, rural districts and towns. Districts and provincial cities are further subdivided into wards, towns into townships, and districts and rural districts into communes. In each administrative unit is a People\u2019s Council, a supervisory body for which deputies are elected by \u201cuniversal suffrage, equality, directness and secret ballot\u201d (Article 1, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN), and a People\u2019s Committee \u2013 the LG executive body \u2013 elected by the People\u2019s Council (Article 123 of the Constitution). At the provincial level the People\u2019s Committees have nine to 11 members, except in the cases of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where they have 13 members; at the district level seven to nine members; and at the commune level three to five members. The People\u2019s Committees are headed by a chairperson who is nominated by the corresponding People\u2019s Council. A Commune People\u2019s Council has a Standing Committee consisting of the chairperson and vice chairperson. At provincial and district levels the Standing Committee also has several additional permanent members. Members of the Standing Committees are elected by and from the deputies of the respective People\u2019s Council. Usually they are heads of commissions, e.g., for economics and budget; legal; culture-social; or ethnic minority issues. People\u2019s Councils The number of deputies in the People\u2019s Councils depends on the number of inhabitants of the respective administrative units. At the commune level, the People\u2019s Councils are to consist of 25 to 35 deputies \u2013 the exception being mountainous and island communes and townships with populations of 1,000 to 2,000, for which there are 19 deputies. Those with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants have 15 deputies. At the district level, the People\u2019s Councils consist of 30 to 40 deputies, the exception being People\u2019s Councils in districts that have more than 30 dependent administrative units, for which there are more than 40 deputies as decided by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. At the provincial level, the People\u2019s Councils consist of 50 to 85 deputies. The exceptions here are the capital of Hanoi and cities under central direct rule with more than 3 million inhabitants, which have up to 95 deputies (Article 9, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). 135 Relationship Between People\u2019s Councils (PCs) and People\u2019s Committees (PCom) Formally, PCs are supposed to be the most powerful and the only decision-making authority at a respective level of the administrative system. As such, PCs direct the work of the PComs. The latter are formally considered as executive arms of the PCs; thus, PComs are expected to prepare and submit major plans, projects and decisions relating to socioeconomic development for review and approval by PCs. Once decisions are made in the form of PC resolutions, PComs are responsible for their implementation. PCs then monitor and oversee to ensure that their resolutions are realized in practice. In reality, the situation looks quite different \u2013 and more complicated. Under normal circumstances, the Communist Party has a decisive and overwhelming influence in all decision-making processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "760118a3-7d5f-442b-8150-1b069a29a059": {"__data__": {"id_": "760118a3-7d5f-442b-8150-1b069a29a059", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a76d72f37ca845adf3e7f0ac33c73c00ac60e14f74d55701d7ff077a550d25dd"}, "2": {"node_id": "50236e45-8a49-4061-8c16-304668f91a96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "536e62bb6a59230748cc63fab8160b7f45b8866edc0928bd11ac5c17087cf053"}}, "hash": "61783f6eba549949a7c4c0f5386eacd3a0a9ffc04d5fd9b8839d9da45aa00f17", "text": "Usually, PComs first present key draft documents for the Party Committee\u2019s information and review.

The above situation partly results from the extremely weak capacity of the PCs. Thus, ensuring effective checks and balances is a time-consuming and very challenging process, which requires substantial development in terms of legal, institutional and personal capacities. Organization of elections All citizens aged 18 and older are eligible to vote (Article 2, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). A voter must be registered in the voter list. Those who are deprived of their voting right under legally effective judgments or decisions of courts, serve prison terms, are temporarily detained or have lost their civil act capacity may not be included in the voter list (Article 25[1], Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). In order to stand for election, a person must be at least 21 years old as well as be loyal to the \u201csocialist Vietnamese fatherland;\u201d possess \u201cgood moral qualities\u201d; be qualified for and capable of performing the tasks of a People\u2019s Council deputy; be close to and interact with the voters; and have the ability to participate in the work of the People\u2019s Councils (Article 3, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Candidates must reside and work in the administrative unit in which they intend to stand for election (Article 30, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Article 31 further provides that those who may not be registered as voters, as well as those who have criminal records or are serving decisions on administrative handling (e.g., in medical establishments), may not stand for election. Candidates may stand for election and be elected to People\u2019s Councils at two levels, except deputies of the National Assembly, who may stand for election at only one level (Article 4, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Nominated and independent candidates must submit their application for candidacy with the Election Council (Article 29, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). The decision on which candidates will be allowed to stand for election goes through a series of consultations. Initially, the standing board of the Viet Nam Fatherland Front, in consultation with representatives of the Election Council, standing body of the People\u2019s Council and the People\u2019s Committee at each administrative level meets to decide on the proportion, composition and number of independent candidates and nominees of political, social or economic organizations, the armed forces, and state agencies in the same level. At the province and district levels, nominees from the lower administrative units also are considered. At the commune level, candidates nominated by village and population groups are also considered (Article 32, Order No. 22/ 2003/L-CTN). Based on agreed-upon proportions, organizations and units nominate candidates after first seeking the comments of voters\u2019 conferences held for each organization or unit. Systems of local council representation in Asia and the Pacific 136 DESIGNING INCLUSIVE AND ACCOUNTABLE LOCAL DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS A second consultation, with the same participants as in the first, is then held to make a preliminary list of nominees to stand for election (Article 35, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). For nominated candidates, comments are sought from voters\u2019 conferences in the various organizations and units on their suitability (Article 36, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). The exception is at the commune level, where conferences of voters are to be held. At these conferences, voters cast secret ballots or use a show of hands to express their confidence in nominated as well as independent candidates (Article 37, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Based on the result of these consultations, a third consultative conference is held with the same composition as the previous, in order to select the candidates and subsequently complete the official list of candidates (Article 40, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN). Each list must contain at least two more candidates than the total number of deputies to be elected (Article 41, Order No. 22/2003/L-CTN).24 It should be noted that this three-stage process of consultations over the selection of candidates effectively amounts to a pre-election or selection before any direct elections.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a2a49a5b-a89c-49b6-9eba-173e027d1370": {"__data__": {"id_": "a2a49a5b-a89c-49b6-9eba-173e027d1370", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Practitioner's Guide to Designing Inclusive and Accountable Local Democratic Institutions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c84d3868a7b58c8769de92a78d1a1685c20aaa3cab80ac4bb8ceb0a5baebd99d"}, "2": {"node_id": "7be5586d-4f2d-43ec-86bf-f2500355678d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/practitioners-guide-designing-inclusive-and-accountable-local-democratic-institutions", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c39a83169547c8c8da29b0d9808cda05e28954fae04ec3d33c870c88cd232b0a"}}, "hash": "39099eda53c27f0ee48fcd7a44f6ee5f7719eb004d04c21d02300b0214f091fe", "text": "It should be noted that when considering the proportion, composition and number of candidates, in consultation with People\u2019s Councils, the Standing Board of the Viet Nam Fatherland Front and the People\u2019s Committees at all levels must recommend an \u201cappropriate\u201d number of deputies to be women, as well as an \u201cappropriate\u201d number of ethnic minorities in administrative units with many ethnic groups.

In view of the increasing relevance of non state actors and the private sector in the region, not only in terms of economic growth, but also in sustainable development; the KICG, in collaboration with national and local governments, civil society organisations and the private sector; has been engaged in the development of policy, partnership and capacities for PPPs, with a particular focus on service delivery. This booklet presents the context of PPP for sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific with illustrative good practice examples from three countries: Bhutan, Nepal, and Maldives. We hope that it will help strengthen the policy advocacy efforts on the issue and facilitate South- South learning.

As reflected in the outcome document of the Summit, The Future We Want, there is increasing political consensus among world leaders that sustainable development is not just about poverty reduction and closing the gap between the developed and developing countries; but achieving all-round progress that addresses the economic, social and environmental concerns of communities and nations. The debates around the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as the post-2015 development agenda also reflect this need for an integrated and multi-sectoral approach to sustainable development, which requires concerted efforts not just by national governments, but also by several other stakeholders including the private sector. Additionally, achievements of sustainable development goals and the MDGs, are best measured and are the most relevant at local levels as national averages conceal the development-mismatch between different regions of the country and slower progress in certain parts of a country. In Asia and the Pacific, efforts towards sustainable development, including progress on the MDGs, face complex challenges from rapid urbanisation: by 2026, half of the region\u2019s population will live in urban areas2 and within the region, East Asia will witness the fastest rate of urbanisation, followed by South Asia and the Pacific.3 Urban poor, service-delivery and inadequate capacity The demographic transition and unequal economic growth in the countries of the region have outpaced the supply and access of millions of urban poor to adequate housing, water and sanitation, environmental services, and social infrastructure.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16466519-af98-41f9-8ba4-2d21dcae1386": {"__data__": {"id_": "16466519-af98-41f9-8ba4-2d21dcae1386", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa5e7414ccce26eeaf1862304320281ef2ec3566338b22d0578b28a7af7881c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "396efac5-6ee9-4439-b69e-ad45dd0f218b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7c8fdc10de97d988a1d3176a64f45d909a5b9d64ec63e2c607eda30bd373e21"}}, "hash": "570f7a5c5ee4285e26746e28517bc6857b29e7b243e3792907bd0c5e12ce278c", "text": "Nearly half of the world\u2019s population that lives in informal settlements, an estimated 500 million people, are from the Asia-Pacific region.4 High rates of urban poverty, deprivation and poor service-delivery prevailing in the region may retard the progress towards the MDG target of improving the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers by 2020, among others.5 In recognition of these challenges, capacity building is a key component to improve development outcomes.

Harnessing these capacities requires partnerships among various stakeholders, including public, private,the NGO sectors and the informal sector, in which participants agree to work together to achieve a common purpose while sharing responsibilities, risks, resources and benefits. Such a collaborative interface is broadly referred to as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). In simple terms, PPPs are multi-stakeholder approaches that bring together partners from different sectors with strong interest in sustainable development for common public goods. PPPs also enable partners to take up different roles, responsibilities, and joint arrangements. PPPs have proven to be remarkably successful in accelerating progress in areas such as service delivery, environmental management, inclusive business and value chain programming.8 They also open up avenues for further learning, innovation, knowledge diffusion and scaling up. The private sector has been acknowledged for its key role in the economic growth in some of the least developed countries in the Asia-Pacific region, therefore directly contributing to poverty reduction and expanding access to services and commodities. However, it is under increasing pressure to internalize social and environmental externalities and to operate in ways that will protect the environment and communities. At the same time, the sustainability of business operations is increasingly under pressure due of factors such as political instability, regulatory uncertainty, decreasing access to natural resources that possibly resulted from unsustainable management, inadequate labour skill- pools and social unrest. In part, these business risks arise from the notion that private sector does not contribute sufficiently to producing public goods and common benefits beyond the interests of the shareholders and the management. In addition, they are also often accused of appropriating public resources. These dynamics not only create challenges to sustainable business operations, but also create a dichotomy between \u2018development- minded\u2019 and \u2018business-minded\u2019 views. The polarization of these viewpoints in turn hinders possible dialogues and exploration of collaboration among the private and public sectors, and civil society. Inclusive business practices and corporate social responsibility (CSR) are some the strategies used to better address external risks, become more resource efficient and fulfill environmental and social obligations and regulations. Many large companies and well-known brands already recognize the strategic relevance of integrating sustainable development into their core business strategies and across their business practices. These business strategies also aim Business representative presenting innovative mobile technology * A disclaimer: Capacity Development for Sustainable development is not simply a function of collaborative capacities. Successful management of the Sustainable Development regime will rely on a number of other management changes e.g. managing risk through strengthening country systems such as procurement or cultivating change champions through leadership development. Some of these have been covered in UNDP CDG\u2019s Issue Brief: Implementing Rio+20: The Unfinished Capacity Agenda. This paper focuses more readily the issue of collaborative capacities as a pathway into the supporting SD. With reference to the internal draft submission to the RIO+20 taskforce on Collaborative Capacities as a pathway to Capacity Development for Sustainable Development by Nils Boesen, Niloy Banerjee & Diana Brandes, Capacity Development Group, UNDP, 2012. 3 Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific | to ensure that the private sector contributes to achieving longer-term development goals in an inclusive and equitable manner without compromising environmental sustainability. However, to date most of the engagement between the development sector and business on sustainable development have been limited to specific projects, which are relatively limited in scope and scale. PPPs and service delivery \u2013 pathways to sustainable development PPPs often emerge as possible solutions to crises in service delivery and create the necessary impetus for appropriate action. Political support, appropriate incentives and social acceptance of private sector involvement are vital since successful PPPs depend on the actual performance and quality of services delivered at reasonable cost. Therefore, mechanisms need to be developed for accountability of service delivery to the customers with partnerships that build on, and build up, equity, transparency and mutual benefits. Conversely, private interests had expected to see the role of public investments as essentially catalyzing forces to enhance the reach and value proposition of their investments. Not all private sector interests are necessarily for profit. Private sector stakeholders will frequently join social initiatives for enhancing brand equity, goodwill and the ability to attract better talent.

Locally piloted PPP approaches have demonstrated that specific efforts are required to align with the realities of the poor and the existing capacities of the local governments, municipalities and communities. Such local situations often call for a strategic focus on small-scale private partners including the informal sector. Partnerships and collaborative relationships often deliver critical benefits to women. For example, majority of the beneficiaries of two PPP initiatives that UNDP facilitated in Pakistan - in garments and livestock/dairy sector - were women. In the first phase of a training programme for garment workers implemented in partnership with the private sector since 2006, 70 per cent of the 14,000 beneficiaries were women.9 The second phase of the programme will see more women participants. In another project, implemented in partnership with the private sector and a university, about 5000 rural women have been trained not only in modern livestock and dairy development, but also in basic veterinary techniques.10 The project saw women in many lead roles \u2013 some as village milk collection agents and some delivering veterinary services. Developing capacities for implementing PPPs can therefore contribute to a number of objectives and provide a powerful pathway to sustainable development. UNDP\u2019s Knowledge Innovation and Capacity Group (KICG) is a practical solution provider. KICG develops practical approaches on how development challenges and opportunities can be tackled. Key activities of the KICG team include: research to find out what works and what do not; technical support to UNDP country offices and national and provincial governments; facilitating partnerships between government and non- government actors; and contribution to global debates and South-South learning. The UNDP KICG team also designs ways on how development challenges and opportunities can be tackled through knowledge, capacity development, innovation and partnerships. The team works with national and local governments and a wide range of state and non-state partners. Fostering PPP for sustainable development and improving service delivery is one of the priorities of KICG. Fostering PPP: Objectives Support alternative service delivery approaches to complement state efforts Harness comparative advantage of both state and non-state actors (including the informal sector) Enhance economic efficiency, social equity and environmental concerns Accelerate MDGs and sustainable development Develop national capacities for PPP Meeting with Cambodian private sector stakeholders 4 \u201c \u201c Modes of partnerships PPPs can include a broad range of partnership engagements (based on a written agreement which may involve the exchange of resources) and collaborative relationships (based on an informal agreement without involving transfer of resources), both of which evolve over time. Some relationships start as or develop into formal partnerships while others remain informal. Even when partnerships and collaborative contractual arrangements are commercial, there can be an eff ective delivery of services or provision of goods under appropriate policy and regulatory frameworks. Partnerships facilitate to connect across actors: national governments, scientifi c and research communities, urban authorities, local governments, private sector and civil society, and various combinations of these to harness synergies. UNDP as a facilitator of PPP UNDP\u2019s approach has a strong emphasis on Sustainability: we look closely at how the role of private sector and civil society is refl ected in, and contributes to national strategies. UNDP supports alternative service delivery approaches, across sectors and themes that complement the eff orts of governments by harnessing the comparative advantages of both state and non-state actors including the informal sector. The overall focus is to advance MDGs and bring about sustainable development results with particular focus on improving service delivery, local economic development, women\u2019s empowerment, environmental management, inclusive business and value chain programming. UNDP supports development of collaborative capacities through providing advice on policies, regulatiory frameworks, contractual arranagments, and governance mechanisms for PPPs; strengthening institutional arrangements and leadership capacity; organisational development; fostering innovation; and facilitating knowledge-sharing through for example, community of practices. UNDP\u2019s role in this space is often that of an independent broker/facilitator and trainer for collaboration, change management and capacity development.

Implemented by the Thimphu Thromde, the project has converted the challenge of garbage disposal that the city faced into multiple sustainable business enterprises. Through segregation of waste at source, composting of bio-waste, recycling, appropriate transportation and bare essential land filling, the PPP initiative has perfected a replicable model. The city is now managing about 50 tonnes of waste a day. Instead of \u201coutsourcing\u201d the garbage to private companies, the partnership has been able to generate resources for running the project from the garbage itself (see Case Study A). The initiative to provide self-funding public toilets at strategic locations is an excellent example of PPP facilitated by UNDP in Nepal. These facilities are run by young people from disadvantaged communities and women. The experience in Nepal showed the transformation of the government\u2019s role from that of a direct service provider to a regulator, which facilitates the support of the private sector in delivering local services. It has also led to the emergence of a tripartite partnership between the government, the private sector (including both formal and informal sectors) and civil society (see Case Study B). In Samoa, the UNDP-government-private sector partnership has helped expansion of the tourism industry through strengthening capacity. Given the primacy of tourism in the island\u2019s economy, the focus has been to expand market access across the world, thereby improving UNDP helps the private sector leverage its financial and professional resources to move beyond philanthropy towards a more sustainable approach to reaching out to the poor, and to support sustainable development. It is one of the key mechanisms to translate the UN Global Compact,12 a framework for businesses that are committed to aligning their operations and strategies with ten universally accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, the environment and anti- corruption, into concrete actions. By partnering with a highly-networked, partnership-based, and globally trusted organization such as the UNDP, with its extensive knowledge and experience in addressing development challenges around the world, the private sector can ensure that its commitment to sustainable development is translated into effective and appropriate action. employment opportunities at home. In Pakistan, UNDP has supported a PPP initiative that employed about 5000 women in livestock and dairy development in partnership with DFID, NESTLE and ANGRO. In Maldives, UNDP supports the government in strengthening partnerships that focus on women\u2019s empowerment through a programme called \u201cPartnering for Development.\u201d The efforts are to create a policy framework and develop avenues for PPP (see Case Study C). In Indonesia, UNDP is helping the local governments to identify areas of collaboration and partners, and provide technical support. It is also involved in the development of new guidelines for PPP, particularly in service delivery. Recently, countries such as Afghanistan, Fiji, Mongolia, Iran, Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar and Viet Nam, Cambodia and several Pacific Island States have also formulated projects related to urban development, climate change and (women\u2019s) economic empowerment all of which include strong partnership components.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccef2aa5-837c-4582-a23b-0cd4ae63e87c": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccef2aa5-837c-4582-a23b-0cd4ae63e87c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef8777e947529548ad5a18a04695c61d2aba1dcbc89899b7ba168636089b419b"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e2a6ff3-7d74-4a2a-8e3c-4455f3848798", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "695cf0f82ae874d16cc24a9f3d6a74f2de7f6253762f740a81dbcd264ec5d59a"}}, "hash": "e379fb1b82230d8af4c7a46a3ec6df6f2d4d40acd40abca02bd5fab479202493", "text": "Mechanisms for accountability and inclusion Successful PPPs depend on the actual performance and quality of services delivered at reasonable cost.

Conversely, private interests see the role of public investments as essentially catalyzing forces to enhance the reach and value proposition of private capital.

Services delivered through partnerships need to be based on an adequate understanding of how service delivery (improvements) can be designed to not only increase business efficiency and effectiveness but (in addition) to benefit the poor and to ensure gender equity. Partnerships using, for example, demand-led or community-driven service delivery, with community participation in planning, implementation and management of services and infrastructure is advantageous for increasing service sustainability and user benefits. It also promotes transparency and mutual accountability, and builds social capital by empowering individuals and groups to participate and to eventually lead their own development. 6 UNDP and partnerships Technical support to governments on legislation, policies, regulation and governance mechanisms Strengthening institutional arrangements and organisational capacities Strengthening leadership Knowledge-sharing, Community of Practice, Innovation & multi-stakeholder dialogues Such a community inclusive approach also creates a stable social environment for operation of the partnership and business, which in turn lowers business risks and potentially increases profit margins and share values. UNDP\u2019s comparative advantage UNDP and their partners can bring to this agenda practical concepts,tools and methodologies for partnerships across governments, business, NGOs, academia and communities for service delivery; participatory processes to shift focus from symptoms to systems; identification of needs/goals, design interventions; and embedding action, learning and thinking into these approaches. Over the past decade, globally, UNDP have developed a systematic approach towards capacity development for pro-poor PPP policing, programming and implementation. It has been and will continue to be constantly improved upon using user feedback and emerging knowledge and experiences, often through regional learning events and South South exchanges.. While the overall institutional framework for sustainable development and PPP is somewhat in place in most Asia Pacific countries, institutional strengthening and organisational development will remain a continuous process as development circumstances and needs evolve, and new methodologies and practices emerge. Institutional development and the management of inclusive innovation processes with the private sector will have to be pursued at all levels with particular emphasis on local government institutions, and their partners, to enable them to bring about direct social, economic and environmental benefits to the grassroots. This will augment the progress of strengthening local governments and decentralization processes initiated in many countries of Asia and the Pacific. 7 Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific | Case study a Waste to wealth: PPP in solid waste management Thimphu, Bhutan Two years ago, garbage was one of the biggest civic challenges of the Thimphu Thromde11 in Bhutan. Lack of a sustainable municipal sustainable waste management strategy, poor civic sense among people, inadequate legal tools, and inefficient service delivery had left the civic authorities with the most primitive form of garbage disposal - collect, transport and dump. The Thimphu Thromde had to collect about 50 tonnes of solid waste from different parts of the city every day and dump it at Thimphu\u2019s only landfill at Memelakha, which was overflowing and polluting its surroundings. Unable to find any more space at Memelakha, the Thimphu Thromde was desperate to identify another landfill to dump the mounting waste. Since there was no practice of segregation of biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials from the garbage before it is dumped, informal scrap dealers scavenged the landfill everyday and recovered some part of the waste that could be recycled. The city\u2019s open spaces, areas near the landfill and even some water bodies had been littered with garbage. One of the biggest pollutants of the valley was pet bottles, which were seen clogging the drainage system and scattered on the streets. The problem was that there was no integrated system for sustainable solid waste management. But that is not any more. Thimphu Thromde, with its partners is moving towards an integrated sustainable waste management (ISWM) system. With the enforcement of the waste prevention and management regulations (2012), the city\u2019s streets are cleaner and Thimphu Thromde is on its way to modern garbage management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b23cec79-9387-4a01-a68d-a2577eed37f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b23cec79-9387-4a01-a68d-a2577eed37f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "abe339eac0da49e043c36dda5af78c66d61eaa4f405fe3e2196ddabbcf9bf4d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a43b462-5053-4ce4-a506-2f991e5bf7b9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5657fbf781dcd08d7f11d9cfc3e7209ca5f85949b4c7d7d4696a02652ba4a438"}}, "hash": "075951becb11949635cebffa729ccd304ba30e659ce90b86a82131501841d50c", "text": "It is not the collect-transport-and- dump routine any more.

The TT is now on its way to achieve a waste management model that pays for itself. Pet bottles, which were considered to be of no value till a few years ago, have become a real money-spinner. This dramatic transformation, that is vital to an ecologically sensitive Thimphu of about 120,000 people, has been brought about by a Public Private Partnership (PPP) initiative of UNDP, the Dutch NGO WASTE Advisers on Urban Environment, Thimphu Thromde, Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN, local environmental NGO) and local private companies, often young entrepreneurs. Launched in 2010 with financial support from the Dutch government, the initiative aimed to stimulate improved cooperation between public, private and civil society actors that contributed to sustainable solid waste management; minimise the impact of waste on poor communities; and improve the lives and livelihoods of people and enterprises. The lessons learned - how did it work? Fundamental to the success to the project was its integrated approach and partnerships. The groundwork was raising awareness among the people on the environmental hazards of improper waste management and the need to segregate at source and recycle. It was followed up with putting in place systems that adopted right methods and processes for collection, transport and treatment of both biodegradable and non-bio degradable materials. UNDP facilitated the process, supported a municipal wide capacity assessment and designed a capacity development roadmap that brought partners (including other development partners) together: technical support came from WASTE and private companies while the TT provided the overall municipal infrastructure and its personnel. The project was implemented on a daily basis by TT with day-day to backstopping from UNDP\u2019s country office as well its regional office. Today, the buildings in the four pilot areas of the city are given two types of garbage bins at subsidised rates: green for biodegradable waste and grey, for non-bio degradable waste. Thanks to the continuous awareness programmes in partnership in local NGOs and door-to-door communications, the residents know how to segregate the waste. The municipal trucks collect the segregated garbage door-to-door and send the biodegradable waste to a facility for composting and producing manure. The non-biodegradable materials are sold to local private companies for recycling. The aim of the project is to send only 20 per cent of the city\u2019s waste into the landfill and recycle everything else once the project is scaled up across the entire city. 8 About 49 percent of the total waste of the city is organic that can be composted. Out of the rest, 25.3 percent is paper, 13.7 percent plastics, and 3.6 percent glasses \u2013 all of which can be recycled. The most interesting turn-around has been the management of PET bottles. In the past, they littered the entire valley and the local scrap dealers were not interested to collect them since they were considered a low value waste. With very little investment (about Rs. 1 million), an innovative PPP arrangement between TT and Greener Way, a local private company, has dramatically transformed the PET bottle management. Today, PET bottle waste is a source of revenue for the private company as well as source of livelihood for many poor sections of society. The Thimphu Thromde is also earning some income through the lease of land. Through this initiative, Greener Way has been able to collect and sell significant quantities of recyclable materials every month: about a million PET bottles, weighing 20-22 tonnes; 18-20 tonnes of mixed-waste; and 40-45 tonnes of paper-waste. Although the project has been implemented with grant support from UNDP (with TT co-financing), authorities are optimistic that it will pay for itself in future while keeping Thimphu and its environment clean and its people healthy.

Lack of resources and low capacities to designing Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) regulatory frameworks and developing viable partnership arrangements with non-state actors constrain municipalities to respond adequately to the rising demand for services. In 2001, The Government of Nepal with the support of UNDP, embarqued on exploring alternative municipal service delivery, and identified pro-poor PPP have proven to be effective and innovative approach in addressing the capacity challenges of municipalities and to enable them to use pro-poor PPP to improve access to urban services. Over the last few years, PPPs have begun to slowly transform the landscape. Starting with five out of the 58 municipalities in 2002, PPPs for service delivery has spread to 15 municipalities now. Increasing awareness of the concept and tangible results are taking the idea to other municipalities as well. Today, there are several examples of PPP in service delivery that was previously perceived as challenging to implement. PPP initiatives in Biratnagar, Dhulikhel, Pokhara, Bharatpur, Siddarthanagar, Mechinagar (Jhapa), Dhulikhel, Kathmandu and Hetauda today cover several aspects of basic urban services - water, sanitation, waste management, renewable energy and urban transport. Sustainable public toilets that are financing themselves; solid waste management using modern segregation and recycling techniques; and turned dumping sites into nurseries and composting sites were created through business support to community, and women groups. Siddarthanagar and Kathmandu engaged with local waste collectors to set up collection points for higher quantities of waste generated from fruit and vegetable markets to allow compost conversion by small entrepreneurs and sales to rural farmers. Also, in both municipal areas the collection of local taxes was improved and; management of hazardous hospital waste and street lighting using solar panels are among the bright spots of Nepal\u2019s emerging PPP success stories. Sanitation has been a major challenge in Nepal that the PPP initiatives are set to change. Sanitation services such as mobile and public toilets have improved in Biratnagar, Case study b PPPs transforming the service delivery landscape Nepal Dhulikhel, Bharatpur and Hetauda, where partnerships between the municipality, local private sector and local community organizations improved the bus terminals and park\u2019s facilities, raising the park\u2019s daily revenues in Hetauda fourfold while producing bio slurry through a biogas plant that supplies gas to neighboring restaurants. In Hetauda three young persons from a disadvantaged community in the area are employed and the modest fee that the users pay keeps the facility running. Two similar toilets at city service centres in Kathmandu offer even more services. Set up by two private companies on a \u201cdevelop, operate and transfer\u201d plan, they also have shower rooms, newsstands and hairdressers for additional revenue. Biogas generated from the toilets is fed to a restaurant. The facility employs 16 women. In Birgunj and a Butwal women from a disadvantaged community operate a mobile toilet - again in partnership with the private sector and sustained by user fees. In waste management, through the global Public Private Partnership for Sustainable Waste Management project funded by the Dutch DGIS and implemented by UNDP with support of a Dutch NGO called WASTE, Biratnagar municipality significantly improved services to approx. 39,000 households in the town with increased coverage of solid waste collection, sweeping services and ensured more effective waste disposal through better managed landfill, improved transportation systems, recycling and composting. Around 4,200 customers (including households and businesses) now use the door-to-door services for a fee, progressively increasing income generation. Aside from households, the effort has also benefited 65 Tole Lane Organisations (neighourhood organisations). In addition, over one hundred people disadvantaged backgrounds are receiving employment. Similarly in Birgunj, biogas generated from 25 households in a low income disadvantaged community, is providing essential fuel. This project, operated by the users themselves has created over 100 jobs for disadvantaged groups, especially women. In Kathmandu, youth groups improved access to safe drinking water by creating businesses to supply affordable pet water bottles, benefiting approximately 4,000 marginalized people in communities in Kathmandu and Hetauda that were previously excluded from the water supply network.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8013f82c-7857-400a-9307-1ef5970d928d": {"__data__": {"id_": "8013f82c-7857-400a-9307-1ef5970d928d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc386002d8e1e1c1c9774838077fb938e49d8396bf79a2175a51eed1228cbea5"}, "2": {"node_id": "72068e6a-0159-4538-bd5a-b7bec310a1df", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1f0b6f6e8987b42adff7d8f2c9352f9064abb3f5fff5008a5678ccf5b0ba848"}}, "hash": "b5719d86729a4eac109fc5639046c55a0408996b5d59079762479bfac4670947", "text": "10 In Butwal, local shop keepers and commercial establishments have escaped the drudgery of 12-hour long power cuts and loss of business using electricity from solar panels established under a PPP arrangement.

Furthermore, a number of inter-municipality visits were undertaken to encourage in-country learning and exchanges and international visits to other countries implementing PPP in municipal service provision and to encourage South-South learning. Lessons learned - Why Scaling-up Local Development Innovations is Important for Transformational Change The fundamental reason is the increasing realisation that if utilized appropriately, PPPs can deliver services and mean better value for money while reducing the burden on governments. At a macro level, they can manage complex development challenges and accelerate the progress towards MDGs and Sustainable Development at the longer term. The genesis of change can be traced to 2002 when UNDP in partnership with the Ministry of Local Development (now called the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development) established the Public-Private Partnerships for Urban Environment Project (PPPUE) and began to bring the municipalities, private sector and other stakeholders together. The initial years saw continuous awareness on the nascent concept until they were convinced of the idea followed by capacity building of government and non- government partners, both on policy and implementation, which included designing and running pilots. Considerable progress has been achieved in creating an enabling environment to increase community and private sector participation in providing urban services. The project\u2019s on-going support to the government to improve the policy, legal and regulatory environment has seen the government adopting PPPs as an alternative way of building local infrastructure and providing services. Several key policy documents today acknowledge the role of PPPs. The project\u2019s advocacy and support has led to the FNCCI (Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry), MuAN (Municipal Association of Nepal), the partner municipalities and local chambers of commerce setting up PPP units. Following on this, FNCCI and MuAN have spearheaded many new PPPUE interventions in non- project areas. It has been a systematic process of awareness generation, followed by capacity development on both policy and practice, and design and implementation of pilot projects that led to the present transformation. In the initial years, both government and non-government actors needed considerable persuasion to adopt PPP for service delivery in the face of severe resource-crunch. Once a considerable consensus was achieved, the next stage was capacity development. More training on PPP areas ranging from development of policy and legal frameworks to implementation of projects was delivered. Along with the efficiency of the PPP in providing services, the new role of governments also played a critical role. From an overburdened service provider, the governments became enablers and regulators. It didn\u2019t completely withdraw from service delivery; but it partnered with non-government and the private sector organisations and pursued new pathways. Over the last few years, 91 PPP initiatives have been implemented across the 15 municipalities in different aspects of service delivery ranging from sanitation to sustainable energy. All of them have proven how effective and sustainable public private partnerships could be, in terms of addressing local issues, increasing efficiency and catalyzing social service entrepreneurship in resource-poor settings. There is still significant scope to expand PPPs across more local areas and other sectors such as health, education, tourism etc. Hence, scaling up can be seen as an effective and necessary step in the process of moving from project or programme results to transformational change. Scaling up is emphasizing the strategy of ensuring sustainable, effective and efficient national and local structures through expansion of services, increase in capabilities of local organizations and agencies to deliver agencies, and improvement of policies and institutional frameworks. Transformational change focuses on the process of ensuring that these results are institutionally sustainable, as well as consistent or sustained over time (at least 10-20 years). In order for transformational change to occur, the positive development results achieved through successful scaling up must lead to \u201creal and sustained improvements in the lives of people, households and communities\u201d that are measured not only by MDG targets but also \u201cprocess freedoms and enabling factors\u201d such as human rights, democratic governance, and participatory and inclusive processes. In short, transformational change occurs when the positive developments results of a scaled up initiative are sustained over time, and ultimately empower lives and build resilient nations. Examples of such innovation are the cases illustrated above from Nepal\u2019s UNDP Public-Private Partnership for Urban Environment Programme. 11 Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific | In the Maldives every fourth employee works for the government, making it the largest employer.

While some advocate against the economy\u2019s heavy reliance on tourism, one can also advocate for increasing the benefits of tourism to the wider population. As the Maldives marks forty years of tourism in 2012, tourist arrival is expected to reach a million and the industry is valued at more than a billion dollars. For a population of 300,000, this would seem to bring only prosperity. The reality is however very different. Unemployment stood at a staggering 28% in 2011, income inequality is increasing and disparities between the capital Male\u2019 and the outer lying 200 inhabited islands have only widened. More than 90 percent of \u2018Maldivian\u2019 souvenirs sold to tourists are imported from East Asia, causing a major decline in local artisanal industry. Tourism operates almost in an economy of its own, a parallel economy in the Maldives, completely disconnected from the local livelihoods of the islanders. With a recent shift in policy such as these that allow for Public Private (Community) Case study C Collaborative Capacities: Bringing about Sustainable Development Results through Public Private Dialogue, Connecting and Brokering Knowledge, Experiences and People Maldives Partnerships, efforts are now being made to expand the benefits of tourism to the larger population and to make the industry pro-poor. Actions to reverse the dichotomous nature of tourism sector and the local economies involved supporting livelihood projects on handicrafts making and innovative agriculture targeting the tourism sector. Besides supply and logistical difficulties faced to overcome the geographical isolation, there was a major information and communication gap at the local levels resulting from years of isolation. The resorts were dependent on imports, unaware of what the locals produce or could produce and unwilling to change the direction of their sourcing. At the same time the local communities did not trust the resorts and were not willing to adapt to the needs of resorts, be more organized and bring scale and quality to meet the market requirements. Achievement of national development goals is dependent upon a variety of state and non-state actors, coming together on issues of the day and pursuing a common agenda. As major development issues become more complex and erase traditional boundaries, of sector, geography etc; the importance of collaboration becomes ever more important. Partnering for Development Forum 12 In the coming years, Public Private Partnership (PPP) mechanisms will drive this change of \u201ccollaboration\u201d not only in Tourism but also in Climate Resilient Initiatives. That the dominant part of the economy, i.e. tourism, is self suffi cient, confi ned to exclusive spaces and minimum dependence on the state or communities, often limits the PPP options but expansion of the economy in other sectors such as fi sheries and agriculture, retail, telecom, trade, and small and medium industries will open up the opportunities and contribute to the much-needed diversifi cation. Privatization is a politically sensitive issue in Maldives but it does off er lessons and opportunities for partnerships in which the private sector, the government and the people can come together. The country is in the initial stages of developing its PPP agenda but there is increased acknowledgement of the concept for overall socio- economic empowerment, particularly to strengthening community participation in the remote atolls. In 2010-2011 discussions with the Government and their partners such as with the Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) illuminated that since 2009, CSR is promoted through UN Global Compact. The UN Global Compact is still relatively new and evolving, and requires strategic direction and development and they are interested to play a role in such redirection. MNNCI believes CSR has a real potential to contribute to development in the Maldives but is practiced in an ad-hoc manner and is understood by the business community as fi nancial support for social activities. Eff orts are being made by the Maldives National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MNCCI) and the Capital Market Development Authority (CMDA) and NGOs to integrate CSR in corporate strategies, to promote it as benefi cial to the private sector growth. The government policies also aim to facilitate expansion of CSR in the Maldives. The discussions evolved around various aspects and areas of concerns from MNCCI part including: - Lack of formal PPP dialogue forum and mechanism and the need for regional knowledge sharing (PPP Dialogue). - Need to be more involved in policy making on private sector participation and mainly PPP in development. - Need for focused training on PPP concepts/models to follow up on the Presidency Offi ce workshops (particularly at the sub-national and local levels). - Scope for a comprehensive", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daf86bf1-c18d-4406-ada2-a56a1c7ef5fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "daf86bf1-c18d-4406-ada2-a56a1c7ef5fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Private Sector Collaboration in Sustainable Development: Experiences from Asia and the Pacific", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f253e67f1a9ffd3b4884f3e0b5f8b1c5e18c905e943d5dab4bb43018283ed9a"}, "3": {"node_id": "e269e8c9-831b-49f4-8378-463786601b51", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/private-sector-collaboration-sustainable-development-experiences-asia-and-pacific", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "308053fe29655649a30f561d9c0b93824fc5efb76bb15f967463c91af7a226da"}}, "hash": "7054e3dbde43e07a4c1283c04b85fd79c97aa226b95ff94c36c8017abd361c5d", "text": "capacity assessment of the MNCCI to defi ne strategic PPP capacity development interventions and enable it to have an improved engagement with government on PPP in development.

UNDP also promoted the event as a pilot through partnership with the National (Youth) Chamber of Commerce not because it was an experimental eff ort, but to support the enhancement of the image of resorts to become part of something new and historical. UNDP supported for example to establish the incentives so that resorts would not only be able to network with locals, but also with other resorts in the same region, as well as with their potential competitors. To organize Public Private Dialogue and Community dialogue events, UNDP supported the establishment of an interministerial committee and strategically engaged the Ministry of Tourism to encourage the resort managements to attend the forum. UNDP also lobbied actively by approaching the head offi ces of the respective resorts based in the Capital, Male\u2019 and in some cases by writing directly to the hotel owners. These interactions provided more insights on the arguments that the resorts wanted to put forward at dialogue forums. Most arguments illuminated related to the lack of reliability of local suppliers in terms of quality and consistency. UNDP therefore identifi ed and invited producers with whom both UNDP and Government had already experience in other (livelihoods and service delivery) programmes. Named now as the \u201cPartnering for Development (P4D)\u201d initiative managers from fi ve resorts and about 25 producers in the Northern region have been interacting. During meetings producers are supported to showcase their products and to conduct \u201cbusiness meetings\u201d (such as by preparing their profi le and contact details, and by THE 7TH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN EMPHASIZES ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE 8TH NATIONAL FRAMEWORK PLAN (STRATEGIC ACTION PLAN 2009- 2013) STRENGTHENED THE NEED FOR PRIVATIZATION, INTRODUCED THE PPP CONCEPT, AND A PRIVATIZATION COMMITTEE WAS ESTABLISHED. \u201c THE 7TH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT \u201c THE 7TH NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN EMPHASIZES ECONOMIC \u201c PLAN EMPHASIZES ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE 8TH \u201c DIVERSIFICATION, AND THE 8TH \u201c 14 documenting supply capacity and pricing schedules). Such documentation was often prepared for the first time. The business \u201coptions\u201d presented by local communities and entrepreneurs focused on various farm products, handicraft and artisanal work and services that resorts could outsource to local communities including laundry, tailoring, maintenance and carpentry, gardening and excursions to local villages. Specific efforts were made to promote local businesses that women were involved in. The entire messaging of the presentation of producers and business options focused on how resorts would benefit from local sourcing so that for example fruits and vegetables can be made available in fresh conditions resulting in lower carbon foot prints compared to imports. Further, approaches to source local products and services would add value to tourism especially because today\u2019s travelers are more conscious and are seeking authentic, local and meaningful travel experiences. Today, the Government is committed to: \u2022\ufffd \u2022\ufffd Reducing\ufffdthe\ufffdrole\ufffdof\ufffdGovernment\ufffdas\ufffda\ufffdprovider\ufffdof\ufffd goods and services that could be better delivered by non-state actors including the private sector. \u2022\ufffd Promoting private sector participation in investing and delivering good quality infrastructure facilities and services. \u2022\ufffd Strengthening the capacity and role of Government in monitoring performance of private providers of services in achieving economic and social objectives. \u2022\ufffd Promoting competition and regulating efficiently sectors where an element of competition is absent and providing targeted support to poor households that will not be able to afford essential goods and services delivered through the partnerships arrangements. As this case shows, institutionalized Public Private Dialogue forums have already enhanced the confidence of the government and the local producers to seek collaboration and to continue dialogues, and the forums also contributed to pave the way for the government to submit the Small and Medium Sized Enterprise (SME) bill to the parliament. It is evident that there is a great potential to further harness Corporate Social Responsibility and Public Private (Community) Partnerships opportunities in the Maldives to boost job creation through business opportunities.

One-time President of the International Commission of Jurists The Hon Justice Michael Kirby AC CMG* I like this book. It aims to help officials, aid agencies, civil society organizations and judges and lawyers to fulfil the true purposes of law. The book has grown out of the fine objectives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). I honour UNDP and the officers who work within it. Truly,they participate in an agency that takes seriously the fundamental purposes of the United Nations organization,declared in the Charter. From the start,the United Nations has been founded on the tripartite principles of attaining peace and security; upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms;and promoting economic equity and justice. The subjects of this book are important for the promotion of these objectives. Attaining them is essential to building a better, safer and more equitable world. I have seen UNDP at work in the post-conflict situation in Cambodia; in the changeover to multi-party democracy in Malawi; and in a myriad of programmes in many other lands. The people of the world thirst for real justice and not just words and shibboleths. This book is aimed at responding to that thirst. It has taken a practical, simple and hands-on approach. At the threshold there is a fundamental challenge in preparing a book such as this. It must be capable of being used in many lands, specially in the Asia-Pacific region. Yet the diversity of legal systems, the sharply differing institutions and rules of law,the disparate cultures,religions and values and the divergent traditions of the respective judiciaries and legal professions to whom the book is addressed make it difficult to state general rules. Hence, I like the fact that the book is based on the concept of lessons, not prescriptive rules. For instance, in the opening of the book, reference is made to a hierarchy in which constitutional and international law are placed above the ordinary rules of national and local law and the common law. Yet in many countries, including within the Asia-Pacific region, international law remains a poor cousin of the established national legal systems. The dualist theory still tends to banish international law to the periphery of practical concerns. Even where there is a fundamental conflict between national (including constitutional) law and the international law of human rights, it may be the duty of local judges and lawyers to uphold the national law. This problem arose recently in my own court in Australia. It appeared fairly clear that a federal law that required automatic detention of infant aliens who arrived or stayed in Australia without proper visas, was in conflict with international law,including provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Yet because the national law was held to be clear and within the constitutional powers of the Australian Federal Parliament,it was upheld. It had to be obeyed within Australia. The most that the court could do was to call attention to the disparity between Australian law and the country\u2019s international obligations under international law. Nowadays, communications about such disparities can often be taken by those affected to regional or international human rights courts or other bodies. National courts will commonly try to avoid, or reduce, such disparities. The influence of international law upon national law is increasing all the time. Even in the sphere of constitutional law, the Supreme Court of the United States, in a legal culture traditionally isolationist, has been looking closely and beneficially at the international law of human rights to cast light on the meaning of the American Constitution. So this is an age of transition in the law. But the tension between the two worlds cannot be brushed aside by judges and lawyers. The rule of law means that judges and lawyers must uphold the governing law, once it is ascertained. iv I like the fact that this book inserts in its text practical examples from many countries to illustrate its themes. Thus, there are notes on pertinent developments in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Nepal, the Philippines, India, Timor Leste and Viet Nam. Concrete illustrations will help readers and users of this book to view their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ff6f8348-3ad7-40b7-ad96-1e93ae2e1eaf": {"__data__": {"id_": "ff6f8348-3ad7-40b7-ad96-1e93ae2e1eaf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "783fc910d528c7be1087c32423b6fcfee0abe8e6c8920500067ba00e2b4386fe"}}, "hash": "783fc910d528c7be1087c32423b6fcfee0abe8e6c8920500067ba00e2b4386fe", "text": "problems in context and to take heart from instances where the justice system has been improved. I also like the fact that the book is strong on practical measures for translating the aspirations of international human rights law into practical means of assuring access to justice for all people. Thus,there are useful notes on expanding alternative dispute resolution; on promoting the use of information technology in court registries; on coordinating the initiatives of donor agencies; on helping in judicial training in ways that respect the independence of the judges from propaganda; on tackling corruption; on promoting public interest litigation; and on teaching people about their rights and how they can use the courts to repair violations and to promote the entitlements of the vulnerable. There are also useful chapters on particular groups who need added help to turn the legal system into an instrument of justice. These include women;indigenous peoples;immigrants and displaced persons;people living with HIV and AIDS; and people with physical and mental disabilities. Yet these groups do not exhaust the classifications of human beings who often miss out in protection of their rights within the legal order. Other such groups include illiterate persons; religious minorities; injecting drug users; prisoners and detainees; homosexuals and other sexual minorities; and commercial sex workers. The principle of \u201cequal justice under law\u201d, carved into stone over many a courthouse, needs to be translated into action in our world. And we have to realize that gaining real access for all to the justice system is only the beginning of the attainment of justice. Thus, many people who, after a struggle, obtain access to courts, find indifference to their concerns; lack of sympathy for their vulnerability; antagonism to their claim of rights. Or they find that the law is completely out of date, with no reform mechanism to improve it and no real interest to repair its injustices and inefficiencies. Sadly,it is in such circumstances that corruption breeds; because corruption is all too often the solution that economics provides to remedy outdated, unjust and inefficient laws. We do not cure corruption only by imposing big punishments. We must tackle the inflexibilities of the justice system with precisely the same energy with which we endeavour to promote access to it. I welcome the instruction of this book to its readers never to lose sight of the big picture; always to encourage participation of affected groups; to attend to minorities; and to promote institutional change. Sixty years ago,a great Australian Chief Justice,Sir John Latham,said that it was comparatively easy for legal systems to uphold the rights of majorities and the powerful. The real test comes when they are asked to protect the vulnerable, minorities and the weak. This remains true today. This practical book suggests ways in which judges and other actors can rise to the challenge. Doing so,they will bring to bear that happy blend of idealism and practicality that is the hallmark of a justice system worthy of that noble name. Michael Kirby 18 March 2005 High Court of Australia Canberra v The linkages between human rights and development have been highlighted by a growing amount of literature over the past few years. However, handbooks that provide practical guidance on how to link the two are still rare.In this context this Practitioner\u2019s Guide, Programming for Justice: Access for All, provides an excellent and long overdue contribution in highlighting practical linkages between the different components of the justice sector and the normative framework of human rights. This Guidebook primarily addresses UNDP staff who have the responsibility of supporting programmes to secure the human rights of people afflicted by poverty and other disadvantages in developing countries. It would be useful also to their counterparts in governments and civil society organisations. The Guide has been produced by UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative. UNDP embarked on this endeavor in August 2002 to engage in systematic knowledge sharing with one of the intended end results to produce a handbook with practical suggestions for implementing access to justice programmes. Since then, facilitated by the Bangkok and Kathmandu SURFs, half a dozen regional workshops have been held, hundreds of projects have been screened and \u201cdeconstructed\u201d to codify useful lessons and a multitude of ideas have been exchanged on the access to justice knowledge network. Meanwhile, the Initiative has continued to grow, with 16 UNDP country offices and more than 30 UNDP country office practitioners now involved in the Initiative, sharing their knowledge and experience with each other. Two aspects of the Initiative need to be highlighted because they were instrumental in preparing this Guide: First, a UNDP community of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ea0861ae-ea16-4ed3-90b9-4fc9d3cb7c3a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ea0861ae-ea16-4ed3-90b9-4fc9d3cb7c3a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b7aa86416aae49194ed4a9284f266864a14b405d41bb4ca5d8956720f509d99"}}, "hash": "6b7aa86416aae49194ed4a9284f266864a14b405d41bb4ca5d8956720f509d99", "text": "practice was at the heart of the undertaking, meaning that the generation, codification and dissemination of knowledge happened primarily through practitioners rather than theoreticians.We believe that the practical orientation and the focus on translating concepts into action are reflected in the structure and content of this guide. Second, the Initiative applied a human rights-based approach to development by advocating (a) the use of relevant human rights standards as a roadmap for policy change; (b) the voice of disadvantaged people; (c) the establishment of a clear framework for accountability in development; and (c) the analysis of conflict risks and power inequalities in development efforts. Drawing on experiences and lessons learned from different access to justice interventions within the Asia-Pacific and sometimes beyond, this Practitioner\u2019s Guide discusses a wide range of obstacles and capacity development strategies to enhance access to justice. The formal and informal systems of justice, legal aid and empowerment as well as specific obstacles facing disadvantaged groups and those in conflict situations in terms of their ability to access justice are all examined in the different sections of the Guide. The various entry points suggested in the Guide should not be seen as prescriptive,since strategies will need to be tailored to specific development problems or obstacles. Instead, the Guide offers a methodology to assess problems in access to justice and design tailored responses. The suggestions made in the Guide are already being pilot tested by UNDP, at both the country and regional levels. This exercise is being supported by the regional governance portfolio of programmes implemented by the Regional Center in Bangkok, in collaborative partnership with the Bureau for Development Policy. Donors, as well as national and regional institutional partners have all contributed to this product, and are expected to be critical actors in furthering this exercise. We welcome their continued involvement in the future and fruition of this initiative. As more lessons are learned from the application of the manual, we will update the Guide to ensure that it remains dynamic and applicable to a variety of development contexts. PREFACE Hafiz Pasha Assistant Administrator and Director Bureau for Asia and the Pacific Shoji Nishimoto Assistant Administrator and Director Bureau for Development Policy vi The overall aim of the Practitioner\u2019s Guide is to facilitate programming in access to justice. To this end the Guide takes the approach that the combination of a clear model in line with UNDP precepts, an assessment methodology and a mapping of highly distilled lessons will help the programmer to come to the strategic decisions. This guide has been broken down into seven chapters. It is recommended to first read Chapters 1 and 2, while the other chapters can be consulted as and when needed. Chapter 1 starts by describing the goals and scope of the justice sector in line with human development and human rights-based approaches. The core concept of the chapter is a model of access to justice that divides the scope of access to justice into three conceptual building blocks: (a) normative protection, (b) capacity to provide justice remedies,(c) capacity to demand justice remedies.These building blocks are later revisited in much greater detail in Chapters 3-5. Chapter 2 provides a 10-step plan for practitioners to develop access to justice programmes. Hence, after scope and goals (the \u201cwhat\u201daccess to justice comprises) has been clarified in the previous chapter, Chapter 2 is a \u201cHow-To\u201dGuide to assess access to justice problems and to identify effective strategies. Chapters 3-7 map typical obstacles in access to justice and strategies that can be applied to address such obstacles.These Chapters consist of a myriad of possible strategies and entry points. None of them is per se more or less valid or feasible than others, hence we have not prioritized them. Rather, their validity and feasibility needs to be assessed on a case by case basis (by means of the methodology outlined in Chapters 1 and 2). This is a reflection of the fact that there is of course no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution to access to justice. It may be sufficient to skim the information on the various obstacles and strategies in the beginning; details can be referred to once a certain entry point is selected and a response to a development problem is designed. The chapters have the following content: Chapter 3 discusses capacity development strategies with regard to the normative frameworks that need to be in place to ensure that disadvantaged groups are protected and access to justice is ensured. Chapter 4 examines the role and ability of institutions that are tasked with providing access to justice. This chapter is divided into five sections", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "974b95f6-f5ce-41a7-a48f-6e738c581b77": {"__data__": {"id_": "974b95f6-f5ce-41a7-a48f-6e738c581b77", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90c1c4cbd61cef34df5aa9b9863e46b4c9212b354f5068a8a2eb69a38c249539"}, "3": {"node_id": "97f598ce-5464-403f-9111-c83d9786a3a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a25efbd935a3cec92bd248ae4105c675a00abc69781e4f29993cf468ea152db4"}}, "hash": "d24e02ef354fa6b77d041d9963e21bbec5289e6dc08c495379d5fa4f60580c9d", "text": "\u2013 The Ministry of Justice,The Court System,Informal Justice Systems, Oversight and Enforcement. Chapter 4 will rarely need to be read as a whole, and readers may want to go directly to the section most relevant to their work. Chapter 5 explores legal empowerment, legal awareness and legal aid. It examines the different actors and types of interventions that can facilitate people\u2019s ability to demand a response and accountability from the justice system. Chapter 6 focuses more specifically on the justice needs of disadvantaged groups. The first part of the chapter provides a general overview and highlights the main challenges to successful implementation of access to justice programmes focused on disadvantaged groups. It also suggests capacity development strategies that can be used in response to these challenges. The remaining sections discuss the specific impediments faced by particular disadvantaged groups. Finally, Chapter 7 focuses on the unique challenges faced by countries recovering from conflict.

This first chapter discusses the role of the justice system in ensuring access for all, and clarifies some of the key concepts underpinning the Access to Justice Practitioner\u2019s Guide. The first section focuses on the links between access to justice, human development and poverty reduction, and explains the human rights-based rationale of the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP) framework for action in this field. The second section presents the basic concepts underpinning access to justice, and gives details on UNDP\u2019s efforts to develop key capacities in the application of, and access to, justice. 3 Chapter 1: Introduction to Access to Justice 1.1 ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT The Link Between Access to Justice and Poverty Reduction Access to justice is essential for poverty eradication and human development for the following reasons: Firstly, groups such as the poor and disadvantaged who suffer from discrimination, also often fall victim to criminal and illegal acts,including human rights violations.Because of their vulnerability,they are more likely to be victims of fraud, theft, sexual or economic exploitation,violence,torture or murder. Secondly, crime and illegality are likely to have a greater impact on poor and disadvantaged people\u2019s lives, as it is harder for them to obtain redress. As a result, they may fall further into poverty. Justice systems can provide remedies which will minimize or redress the impact of this \u2013 e.g., by clarifying agreements and titles, determining financial compensation, and enforcing penal measures. Thirdly, justice mechanisms can be used as tools to overcome deprivation by ensuring, for instance, access to education by girls and minorities, or by developing jurisprudence on access to food,health or other economic, cultural or social human rights. Lastly,fair and effective justice systems are the best way to reduce the risks associated with violent conflict. The elimination of impunity can deter people from committing further injustices, or from taking justice into their own hands through illegal or violent means. In many countries, the reduction of violence is critical for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).2 Access to Justice and a Human Rights Approach to Development The focus on access to justice by all is a recent approach in development cooperation.It supports, and is supported by, a human rights approach to development: access to justice is a fundamental right,as well as a key means to defend other rights. A human rights approach provides a necessary framework for action on human development. The focus on human rights brings two important values to development work: firstly, it provides a framework for policies and programmes.3 Secondly, the attainment of human rights enhances a key capacity needed by the poor to overcome poverty - the capacity to demand accountability. \ufffdHuman rights help to clarify the scope of development objectives while paying special attention to those who may suffer discrimination. The value of using human rights as a framework for development is that human rights protect the basic well-being of all persons, including those who are disadvantaged, and/or are excluded from participating in the development process. \ufffdThe capacity to make claims and to demand accountability is an important capacity for most people. This is especially important when inequalities invpower are present. Power imbalances can result in unfair health or trade policies that protect the interests of one group over another, or lead to abuses of power (e.g., corruption, trafficking of children or domestic violence). This can affect people\u2019s vulnerability to poverty. A human rights approach seeks to develop people\u2019s capacity to demand accountability in two ways: by defining a minimum scope of legitimate claims (human rights); and by enhancing the accountabil- ity mechanisms and processes through which they protect these claims (e.g., the justice system). Defining a scope for accountability through legitimate claims and obligations From the national level to the household, issues such as imbalances in power relations,or control or abuse of power may affect people\u2019s financial capital (e.g. income), physical capital (e.g. infrastructure), natural capital (e.g.water and forests),human capital (e.g. education and health) and social capital (e.g. institutions such as households and communities). Unfortunately, often it is the people who are least able to influence decision-making that are also the ones most at risk. As a consequence, they are likely to fall further into poverty. This can have ramifications not only on themselves, but may also affect the stability of their communities. Human rights define a minimum basis for legitimate demands and obligations in regards to people\u2019s well-being. This basis aims to empower the poor and other disadvantaged people, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3eb28f8-2c1d-4624-910f-1d65f0138da4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3eb28f8-2c1d-4624-910f-1d65f0138da4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2392dd90e4c48351a31f80651424f3b73c57b5fd8a0757a4be19a2377603569a"}, "3": {"node_id": "03b1a672-db38-4ec5-9a55-d8b9355a72d8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40959c0b83b7c3ded419211013b3140cdbf5614dd9ab4229e5d72dcd5d7e1275"}}, "hash": "95c8877d0e8126ff91f2cf13055e3359aa47f2e09549e0ade39eb6bd8d466bc1", "text": "to strengthen democratic governance. As most states are bound by human rights obligations, people can use them as a mechanism for accountability. The State has an obligation to respect human rights through its actions, but also an obligation to protect people from abuses by others and to promote a policy environment that favours respect for human rights. Although human rights deal mainly with state-citizen relationships, they can guide state action in transforming other situations that contribute to poverty.The State can also strengthen the accountability of non-state actors under its jurisdiction. 3 2 The MDGs are a set of concrete development goals that have emerged out of the Millennium Summit held in 2000. See the UNDP website for UNDP\u2019s role in promoting the MDGs.[http://www.undp.org/mdg/]. 3 UN.2002.\u201cUN Common Understanding on a Human Rights Approach to Development.\u201dStamford,Connecticut. Programming for Justice Access for All 4 UNDP programmes can prioritize access to justice by poor and disadvantaged people since poverty and discrimination (e.g., on the grounds of gender, ethnicity or caste) can disadvantage those seeking judicial remedies through existing institutions. Some groups are considered \u201cdisadvantaged\u201d because their inability to pursue justice remedies through existing systems increases their vulnerability to poverty or to other problems (e.g., conflict, crime or sexual exploitation). In turn, their vulnerability to those problems makes them less able to use existing justice systems.Disadvantaged groups vary depending on the situation.They may be women suffering domestic violence,indigenous peoples illegally evicted from their homes, or prisoners facing torture for example. Strengthening accountability mechanisms A human rights approach calls for strengthening and expanding the mechanisms that people can use to demand accountability. These mechanisms may include internal disciplinary procedures, special parliamentary commissions,the media,and other legitimate means of demanding responsibility or obtaining redress. Accountability of non-state actors (e.g. private institutions and individuals) should also be strengthened. The choice of the most effective mechanisms to demand accountability depends on the context. In recognition of this,UNDP focuses on strengthening other critical pillars of accountability as well, such as anti-corruption, parliamentary reform and access to information. This Practitioner\u2019s Guide focuses on accountability channels that engage the justice system. 1.2 BASIC CONCEPTS ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE What is \u201cAccess to Justice\u201d? People need remedies to protect themselves from possible harm caused by others when involved in disputes or conflicts of interests. Remedies are measures that redress this harm, for instance through restitution or compensation. When remedies are guaranteed by law or by customary norms, they are called legal remedies. Justice remedies are legal remedies that typically involve a third party (the justice institution or mechanism), whose functioning is also regulated by norms, in settling the dispute.For instance,when an employer gives compensation to an employee in case of inappropriate dismissal,though he or she is giving a legal remedy, it is an economic remedy and not ajustice one. However, if the decision to compensate was taken by a justice institution or as a result of its mediation,it becomes a justice remedy. Justice systems serve to recognize people\u2019s entitlement to remedies when these are in dispute. For this reason, they are particularly important in the context of power inequalities, when people\u2019s inability to claim remedies through other means may put their well-being at risk. Human rights can empower people and strengthen democratic governance. People can use human rights as a minimum basis for legitimate demands for accountability, as most states are bound by them. On the other hand, compliance with human rights obligations legitimates the use of power, and this is key to democratic sustainability. The meaning of access to justice is interpretative and contextual: When people think of \u201caccess to justice\u201d, they are not necessarily thinking of the justice system. For example, a UNDP participatory survey on people\u2019s perceptions of justice in India found that slum dwellers prioritized access to justice with regard to economic issues,whereas members of marginalized castes highlighted the social dimensions of access, and indigenous minorities highlighted the political dimension. Therefore, the potential of formal and informal mechanisms to provide people with a sense of \u201cjustice\u201d in a particular situation depends on the context, and is just one part of a bigger picture. 5 Chapter 1: Introduction to Access to Justice UNDP defines \u201caccess to justice\u201das: The ability of people to seek and obtain a remedy through formal or informal institutions of justice, and in conformity with human rights standards.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03b1a672-db38-4ec5-9a55-d8b9355a72d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "03b1a672-db38-4ec5-9a55-d8b9355a72d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2392dd90e4c48351a31f80651424f3b73c57b5fd8a0757a4be19a2377603569a"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3eb28f8-2c1d-4624-910f-1d65f0138da4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95c8877d0e8126ff91f2cf13055e3359aa47f2e09549e0ade39eb6bd8d466bc1"}}, "hash": "40959c0b83b7c3ded419211013b3140cdbf5614dd9ab4229e5d72dcd5d7e1275", "text": "When approaching access to justice programming, it is important to bear in mind that: \ufffd Access to justice is a process that needs to be adapted to a particular context.

The justice system asreferred to in this Guide encompasses not only formal institutions, such as courts and police, but also traditional or customary ones, such as village-level dispute resolution, and coordination mechanisms among the different components in the system. \ufffd Justice systems are based on a normative hierarchy in which constitutional and international law takes precedence. This creates the opportunity to strengthen human rights at other levels if rights recognized at one level (e.g., the Constitution) are denied because of norms operating at another level (e.g., legislation or customary norms). However, justice institutions alone are insufficient to produce the social change necessary to transform norms operating at informal levels. \ufffd The justice process requires different capacities at different stages. These capacities may vary between formal and informal justice systems. UNDP\u2019s Framework for Action on Access to Justice UNDP\u2019s framework for action on access to justice is based on two goals: human rights and capacity development. Human rights as qualitative parameters for access to justice programmes Human rights serve to set qualitative parameters for both the type of justice outcomes that UNDP activities promote, and on the process undertaken to reach such outcomes. Programme outcomes should be respectful of human rights standards. Human rights standards relevant to access to justice may include, but are not limited to,independency,due process,freedom from torture, and guarantees on arrest and detention. This Guide contains an annotated summary of some human rights standards, which are further explained within the relevant chapters. The UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights also keeps updated information on international human rights standards. International standards provide general guidance; the specific standards that define programme outcomes need to be localized taking into consideration social, economic, political and cultural factors. 5 UN Standards Related to Access to Justice: \ufffd Universal Declaration of Human Rights \ufffd International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \ufffd Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \ufffd Convention on the Rights of the Child \ufffd International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination \ufffd Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women \ufffd Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials \ufffd Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials \ufffd Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment \ufffd Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power \ufffd Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance \ufffd Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal,Arbitrary and Summary Executions \ufffd Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors \ufffd Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women \ufffd United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures (The Tokyo Rules) \ufffd United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules) \ufffd United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty \ufffd Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice 4 Fukuda-Parr,S.,C.Lopes and K.Malik,Ed.2002.\u201cCapacity for Development: New Solutions to Old Problems.\u201dUNDP. 5 See UNDP\u2019s practice note on \u201c Access to Justice Practice Note\u201d.

Being from a disadvantaged group makes people more vulnerable and less able to use justice remedies, in turn reinforcing their vulnerability. Access to justice can be divided into different stages; starting from the moment a grievance occurs (causing a dispute) to the moment redress is provided.Full access is ensured when the process is completed. The process of justice requires different skills at different stages, as depicted by Figure 1.These key capacities form the basis of UNDP support on access to justice. Their content is explained in the following chapters in this Guide. The three major dimensions of capacity development are: \ufffdNormative protection \u2013 Normative protection refers to individual, institutional and collective capacities to ensure that justice remedies to disadvantaged people are legally recognized, either by formal laws or by customary norms. \ufffdSupply of remedies \u2013 Includes capacities enabling adjudication of decisions,enforcement of remedies and accountability of the process through civil society and parliamentary oversight. \ufffdDemand for remedies \u2013 This relates to the key skills people need to seek remedies through formal and informal systems, including legal awareness, legal aid, and other legal empowerment capacities. Together with insufficient capacities, risk is a major obstacle to effective access to justice. The process of seeking or delivering justice often brings risks with it \u2013 risks of economic loss, physical threats, social ostracism, etc. Therefore, even when people and institutions have sufficient capacities in terms of awareness, expertise, or resources, they may not be willing to pursue the justice remedies due to the inherent risks they entail. The role of risk is particularly important for poor and marginalized groups, as they often live in situations of high insecurity (economic, social, environmental, etc). Institutional actors may also face substantial risks when trying to provide remedies to people. Similarly, conflict situations increase insecurity and therefore exacerbate risks. Strategies on access to justice should examine the risks and attempt to minimize them. Development activities in other areas (e.g. livelihoods or environmental protection) can help to reduce some of the risks faced by disadvantaged people. Table 1 on the next page provides a brief explanation of each of UNDP\u2019s access to justice support areas and details the type of institutional actors involved. 7 Chapter 1: Introduction to Access to Justice 7 TABLE 1: UNDP PRINCIPAL AREAS OF SUPPORT ON ACCESS TO JUSTICE AND KEY ACTORS AREA LEGAL PROTECTION Provision of legal standing in formal or in traditional law, or both.

A human rights approach focuses not only on the intended goal of a programme or project, but also on the process of its design and implementation.Therefore, when adopting a human rights-based approach, UNDP programme officers also need to make sure that initiatives to ensure access to justice are present. This chapter provides a guide on how to develop programmes that ensure access to justice using a human rights-based perspective.The approach of this chapter is based on the UN Common Understanding on the Implementation of a Human Rights Approach to Development reached by UN agencies in 2002. The guide is presented in ten steps, each of which has specific objectives. The different sections within the chapter provide tips and recommendations on how to attain the objectives, as well as illustrative examples. Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 11 11 11 Key Features of Rights-based Programming for Access to Justice Rights-based programming is different from conventional tools and methods in that it: \ufffd Situates access to justice in the context of a human rights/legal framework \ufffd Analyzes different degrees of vulnerability with regard to a particular problem, and selects those groups who may be more seriously impacted as priority beneficiaries of the project \ufffd Divides relevant stakeholders into claim holders and duty bearers \ufffd Focuses on enhancing empowerment of people with legitimate claims, and accountability of those who are mandated or able to respond \ufffd Assesses the capacity of both the claim holders and the duty bearers to address the problem and aims to ensure there are capacity development strategies for both sides \ufffd Attempts to establish participatory processes where those who are impacted on as a result of the problem are freely and meaningfully involved 2.1 HUMAN RIGHTS-BASED PROGRAMMING FOR ACCESS TO JUSTICE Human rights-based programming,or rights-based programming (RBP) is a methodology to develop programmes and projects that include the key elements of so-called \u201cgood\u201d programming. It is based on a human rights framework. The rationale for using human rights-based programming is two-fold: firstly, to promote empowering development processes, and secondly, to enhance the accountability and effectiveness of development initiatives. As explained in Chapter 1, human rights help to define a scope for individual and state accountability. They also help to determine the claims people can make when holding others accountable for the achievement of their rights. The ability to make claims is especially important for poor people. Poor people can use this ability to protect their personal, physical, political, economic and social capital, and thus enhance their well-being. Human rights contribute to empowerment by defining a minimum basis for claims. Human rights standards set the overall direction a programme should take. The twin principles of accountability (of duty bearers) and empowerment (of claim holders) provide an objective for capacity development strategies. Non-discrimination implies a particular focus on disadvantaged groups and paying attention to the impact of the programme on those who are not the focus of other development interventions. Participation is a key principle underlying all stages of the programming process. Key Considerations in the Programming Process \ufffdBe respectful of whoever is leading the process, but ensure basic standards: Projects and programmes supporting access to justice may be initiated following a request from a government, civil society or any other development partner,or as a result of UNDP\u2019s own will", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06e00497-9bb3-40ad-86ce-f8e9a30fde67": {"__data__": {"id_": "06e00497-9bb3-40ad-86ce-f8e9a30fde67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f334553ac5052269cab939f1887456a458fd0d6a8a3b69b36ab74f05eb6cffc"}}, "hash": "0f334553ac5052269cab939f1887456a458fd0d6a8a3b69b36ab74f05eb6cffc", "text": "to address a particular issue. UNDP\u2019s involvement in the programming process varies according to the situation. Sometimes political situations can limit UNDP\u2019s ability to ensure participation or to address critical access to justice issues. However, while guidance should always be given allowing flexibility, UNDP should continue to strive for accountability and non-discrimination in all its activities. \ufffdDo not lose sight of the big picture: All UNDP access to justice initiatives should be geared towards one ultimate goal: to empower poor and disadvantaged people to access fair justice remedies that can help them to enhance their well-being. This goal should guide all analysis and strategy formulation. However, it is important not to idealize logical frameworks or programming steps. Encouraging access to justice by vulnerable people implies a process of social change,and such a process cannot be captured in project documents. Development results require creative and dynamic development processes. The following section sets out ten steps to a human rights approach in programming.Annex 1 presents a table with key parameters in rights-based programming, their programming implications and examples from UNDP programmes. The key components of rights-based access to justice programming are summarized below. Flexibility should not compromise accountability and non-discrimination. Programming for Justice: Access for All 12 2.2 PROGRAMMING STEPS The process of developing an access to justice programme can be summarized in ten steps: STEP 1: Familiarization with the programming context Understand UNDP\u2019s policy on access to justice, and the type of access to justice issues influencing poverty and/or violent conflict in the country STEP 2: Selection of a development problem Determine the scope for analysis and programming STEP 3: Securing adequate capacities Determine what time, financial and technical capacities are needed to complete the process STEP 4: Ensuring participation Establish mechanisms to incorporate participation into all stages of the programme cycle STEP 5: Analyzing the problem and its causes and effects Understand the causes and effects of the problem, its human rights dimensions, and what capacities exist to find and implement solutions STEP 6: Setting objectives and selecting outcomes Define the expected changes in the lives of people the programme will contribute to STEP 7: Defining and prioritizing strategies Define what needs to be done, in what way, with whom and when, to produce pro-poor results on access to justice and promote equity STEP 8: Setting outputs and a partnership strategy Define the tangible results of the programme and how key partners will be mobilized to ensure that the results impact on the final goal STEP 9: Establishing an implementation framework Define what type of activities are needed to produce programme outputs, determine roles and responsibilities, and ensure accountability and non-discrimination in programme implementation STEP 10: Designing a monitoring and evaluation system Define what to measure, how to measure, who will do it, with what frequency and with what purpose Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 13 Before starting the programming process, it is important to understand how empowering poor and other vulnerable groups to access justice may impact on poverty reduction and other development goals. Chapter 1 provides an overview of UNDP\u2019s policy on access to justice. Key documents on access to justice by UNDP and other authors are included in the annotated bibliography at the end of this Guide. Further information on UNDP policy and experiences on access to justice can be accessed through: \ufffdUNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok \ufffdUNDP Oslo Governance Centre \ufffdUNDP Bureau for Development Policy \ufffdUNDP global and regional knowledge networks (e.g., the AP-A2J network, the Democratic Governance network, Human Rights Policy network) Programme officers should start by gathering an overview of the major access to justice-related issues in the country. Information should be gathered not only on legal and judicial issues, but also on other issues related to the overall capacity of poor and vulnerable people to seek and obtain remedies. UNDP is sometimes asked to formulate programmes on a particular issue such as women\u2019s empowerment or police reform. In these cases, programme officers need to gather country- specific information on that particular issue and seek lessons learned from other countries and projects. Information should be gathered through national and international sources.

Rapid mapping exercises through in-depth interviews can provide a wealth of information, although they are intensive in terms of staff time. However,they may produce valuable results for the country office (for instance by establishing detailed profiles of relevant actors in both government and civil society). Annex 2 provides sample interview guidelines for NGO mapping prior to an access to justice assessment. OBJECTIVES To gain an understanding of: (a) The rationale for UNDP\u2019s policy on access to justice,and (b)The type of access to justice issues in the country that are impacting on poverty and/or violent conflict 1 Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights - www.ohchr.org The relevant scope of information on access to justice includes not only legal and judicial issues, but also other issues related to the situation of poor and other vulnerable people in the country. People are a critical source of information: listening to informed perceptions will enhance understanding PROGRAMMING STEP 1: FAMILIARIZATION WITH THE PROGRAMMING CONTEXT Programming for Justice: Access for All 14 Selection of what to address is a critical step. Experience shows that programming often deals with general capacity development of institutions without focusing on addressing specific development problems. When selecting a particular issue as the basis for programming, programme officers should avoid assumptions and define problems as specifically as possible. Access to justice issues that need UNDP\u2019s action arise whenever a development problem (e.g., violent conflict, poverty or environmental degradation) is exacerbated by people\u2019s inability to claim and obtain remedies through the justice system. To assess whether a particular problem requires UNDP\u2019s action on access to justice,you may want to ask the following questions: \ufffdTo what extent is harm being done without appropriate redress? \ufffdHow is lack of redress causing or sustaining people\u2019s poverty? Selection of a specific problem may be based on different factors such as linkages to UNDP\u2019s activities at the country level or that of other donors. UNDP may also be requested by government or national partners to programme on a specific issue. Make sure that challenges to access to justice are defined in clear terms, regardless of whether the challenge is dealt with by UNDP or by its partners. The clearer the problem, the more systematic the analysis will be. Concrete problems also facilitate setting clear strategies and targets. Access to justice can be approached in two distinct and complementary ways: \ufffdWithin the context of the justice system Sector-based justice initiatives seek to develop the country\u2019s capacities for democratic governance by improving accountability and resolution systems. These types of initiatives reflect a human rights approach to democratic governance and are a necessary component of development strategies,although their impact is often only evident in the long-term. \ufffdWithin the context of a particular development problem \u2013 Cross-cutting initiatives seek to address the access to justice dimensions of specific development problems. Such an approach aims to enhance the human rights aspect of development strategies, and can be linked to livelihoods initiatives such as micro-credit schemes or expansion of health services. Cross-cutting strategies on access to justice can provide meaningful results in the short- to medium-term, although they usually require sector-wide strategies for sustainability. The choice of one starting point over another,or of a combination of both, depends on the programme focus. For instance, programmes can focus on the justice system as a whole or on one or more of its components (e.g.,courts),on the access to justice dimensions of a general development problem or on the situation of specific vulnerable groups (e.g., their health), or on a combination of both (e.g.,situation of indigenous peoples involved in court processes).It is important to state what the specific problem is, for example, insufficient independence of the courts,increasing poverty and marginalization of indigenous peoples, or disproportionate number of indigenous peoples incarcerated.

The Asia-Pacific Regional Environmental Governance Programme supports pilot projects in the region that seek to build access to justice components into environmental management initiatives. COUNTRY EXAMPLES OPPORTUNITIES/CHALLENGES Programming for Justice: Access for All 16 The programming process requires different capacities at different stages. Key capacities include funding, time and technical skills (such as analysis, planning, budgeting). Programme officers need to assess the minimum capacities required to complete the task, including capacities to conduct participatory processes. UNDP country offices can enhance their technical capacities by bringing together people from different programme areas within the office (such as local governance, gender, poverty or conflict), or through the UNDP electronic networks and regional offices. Obtaining a broad overview of an access to justice issue through networking and conversations can be a useful way to find out what available local capacities for programming exist. In this regard, mapping local partners in government and civil society may be a necessary first step. OBJECTIVES To find and secure time,financial and technical capacities prior to designing a project or programme PROGRAMMING STEP 3: SECURE ADEQUATE CAPACITIES FOR PROGRAMME DESIGN UNDP country offices can maximize their programming capacities through internal coordination and external outreach. Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 17 17 Participation is a means to improve development programmes, and a vehicle for empowerment. From a technical point of view, the value of participation is in enhancing the knowledge base of access to justice programmes, thereby increasing the relevance and effectiveness of development initiatives. Participatory methods can vary from consultation to decision-making. Access to justice programmes need to build on participatory processes primarily for two reasons: \ufffdThe most knowledgeable people about a particular problem are generally those experiencing it. Both users and providers of the justice system know what specific obstacles they face, and what type of strategies they use to deal with them.This type of information is necessary for capacity development strategies that build on existing strengths and solutions. \ufffdApart from objective indicators, access to justice,or the lack thereof,is often based on personal perceptions. Therefore, it is neces sary to draw together people's perceptions on the meaning of access to justice in a particular context to fully understand the problem (see next point on \u201canalyzing the access to justice problem\u201d). The UNDP Asia Pacific Rights and Justice Network has developed Guidelines for Participatory Consultations on Access to Justice. This is a tool which can be used in consultative processes for programming purposes. As a vehicle for empowerment, however, not every participatory process is equal. Empowerment requires meaningful participation \u2013 that is, one that involves a degree of decision-making and control over the final outcomes. In a truly participatory process, participants make all key decisions on goals and activities; UNDP\u2019s role is limited to that of a facilitator. Similarly, the process should enhance participants\u2019 capacities to analyze access to justice problems and seek solutions. Participatory approaches have contributed to the conceptualization of a rights-based approach to development. A human rights perspective brings two added values to participatory development: \ufffdThe meaningful participation of those being affected by a problem is considered as a right in itself. \ufffdA human rights perspective helps to recognize that power imbalances influence participatory processes. For instance participatory processes may be vulnerable to corruption and control by one group at the expense of another. Vulnerable and marginalized groups are likely to be the ones with the least control, and therefore the least able to influence decision-making. Therefore, a human rights approach requires the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d56b920c-b2c1-4d15-8f52-dd1091dca7f0": {"__data__": {"id_": "d56b920c-b2c1-4d15-8f52-dd1091dca7f0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a358307947f7d6a8c8f1e155d353593c2018e44b26c557b1266243a533b9dbdb"}}, "hash": "a358307947f7d6a8c8f1e155d353593c2018e44b26c557b1266243a533b9dbdb", "text": "participation of those who are most excluded. Although participation is a right, meaningful participation is not always feasible, particularly if it involves poor and marginalized groups. Meaningful participation requires capacities such as information gathering, organization, and analytical skills to assess the problem and possible solutions.Political constraints to ensure participation of certain groups may exist too. Consequently, when only some groups can participate meaningfully, while others are left out, participatory processes can result in discrimination. Although meaningful participation may not always be feasible, participation is a fundamental right, which requires as a minimum, that access to justice programmes: \ufffdUndertake, where possible, capacity building activities with disadvantaged groups as part of a preparatory phase to programmes. \ufffdAdopt a medium-term perspective to enhance the capacity for participation of those who are most disadvantaged in influencing decision-making.

When only some groups can participate meaningfully, while others are left out, participatory processes may result in discrimination. Programming for Justice: Access for All 18 It is necessary to assess the obstacles that marginalized groups encounter to meaningful participation. Programme Activities need to address these obstacles. For instance, by strengthening organizational capacities and access to information, future initiatives on access to justice (by government, UNDP or other development actors) can benefit from the participation of those who are now being excluded. These types of activities should ensure follow-up to assess whether these capacities have an impact in the medium-term. \ufffdReview how programme decision-making takes place so as to ensure non-discrimination. This should be done even when participatory processes are possible, but it becomes particularly critical in their absence (see Step 9: Establishing an Implementation Framework). \ufffdWhere political considerations may not allow participation of all groups at the same time, parallel capacity building initiatives may need to be considered. The following box provides some tips on how to establish a strategy for participation.These strategies can be developed prior to designing a programme, within the context of the implementation of the programme, or for monitoring and evaluation purposes. Designing a Participation Plan 1) Identify level and means of participation of those affected by the problem The scope of participation depends on a number of factors, including political constraints, and time or financial resources. For instance, participation may be politically feasible in analyzing the problem, but not in deciding the type of solutions to deal with it. Similarly, financial and time resources may limit the number of stakeholders that can participate, or the extent of their participation. Different groups of stakeholders need to be involved in different ways. For example, policy-makers and NGO representatives may be part of consultative or steering committees, while poor and marginalized people may be more effectively involved by using community networks and organizations. It is important to identify what existing channels of participation can be used, prior to establishing new ones. 2) Identify obstacles and incentives to participation Once the potential scope and channels of participation have been identified, a participation plan analyzes (a) what type of obstacles inhibit stakeholders\u2019engagement in the process,and (b) what type of incentives would ensure their sustained commitment to the task. The assumption that everybody would like to participate in a programming process if given the opportunity is not necessarily true. Participation requires stakeholders' commitment of time and resources, and the difficulty of making such commitments should not be underestimated. Obstacles to participation may include elite capture of key positions, intimidation, geographical distance, and lack of time, information, skills or organization capacities. When providing incentives, UNDP programme officers should make sure not to promote a culture of nepotism and corruption, particularly among policy-makers. Lastly, programme officers need to be aware that participation may create conflict, particularly when there are contradictory perspectives on the same issue.Conflict is natural and should not be avoided,but its potential scope should be clearly identified so conflict-management strategies can be prepared in advance. 3) Develop strategies to strengthen capacities for participation Strategies should be put in place to address any critical capacity gaps in stakeholders. For instance, training sessions, assurances of confidentiality, outreach to community-based organizations, etc. can serve to overcome problems of lack of skills, intimidation or lack of organization. 4) Establish mechanisms to incorporate participation into all stages of the programming cycle Mechanisms for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "852d0261-3b83-4559-8db0-4c8e80efb6dd": {"__data__": {"id_": "852d0261-3b83-4559-8db0-4c8e80efb6dd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f6e73cd038aae3298a4c28cf568dd9cfa81566a5cbb9beb690fcdb5fa2caa9e"}}, "hash": "0f6e73cd038aae3298a4c28cf568dd9cfa81566a5cbb9beb690fcdb5fa2caa9e", "text": "participation vary depending on the context.

Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 19 19 The main objective of programme analysis is to provide a clear understanding of the access to justice problem that can then be used as a basis for action. This requires identifying cause-effect relationships and assessing capacity gaps. Sound analysis requires adequate data, and gathering these data is time-consuming and costly. There is also a need for technical skills and participatory processes, as desk research or secondary data are insufficient to bring out all key dimensions of access to justice problems. Some tips regarding assessment and analysis: \ufffdThink in terms of issues, not institutions. The entry point is the issue or problem, the question is who is entitled to the solution for this problem (claim holders) and who is obliged to solve the problem (duty bearers). Don\u2019t be confined by the boundaries of individual institutions. Instead, see justice as a sector with an array of institutions, whose functions complement each other. Problems are usually interrelated and may need interventions or strategies that target a number of players. \ufffdUse baseline data when available. To specify the access to justice problem it is important that assessments identify quantitative and qualitative baseline data that can be cost-effectively monitored to assess impact (see section on Monitoring and Evaluation \u2013 Step 10). \ufffdUse participation to complement analysis of secondary data. The problem assessment needs to be conducted through a participatory process, using appropriate techniques for involving poor and disadvantaged groups (for guidance on using a rights-based approach to participation refer to the Guidelines on Participatory Consultations). \ufffdIdentify the most disadvantaged groups at an early stage. The most disadvantaged groups should be identified in relation to the goal.From a rights-based perspective this step is essential in order to keep a clear focus on the groups who will gain the most from the achievement of the goal. Without this step there is a risk that programmes and projects will lose sight of the most disadvantaged people and instead concentrate on groups that are easier to work with. \ufffdThink in terms of the duality of rights and responsibility. Where there is a right, there is also a responsibility. Correspondingly, where there are claim holders, there are also duty bearers. Both capacities need to be strengthened if an effective solution is to be found. \ufffdAvoid analysis deadlock. A comprehensive rights-based analysis can be very time consuming and complex. To avoid analysis deadlock keep the analysis simple and focused on the important issues and the bigger picture. Do not try to solve all aspects of the analysis right at the beginning. Instead, do a preliminary analysis and then improve on it. This following section explains the major objectives when analyzing an access to justice problem. In addition, Annex 3 provides a sample mapping framework on access to justice with general information on each stage of the justice process. OBJECTIVES To gather an understanding of: (a) How the access to justice problem contributes to poverty (b) Political, economic, social and cultural factors reinforcing the problem (c) Human rights dimensions of the problem (d) Capacity of key stakeholders to find and implement solutions PROGRAMMING STEP 5: ANALYZE THE PROBLEM AND ITS CAUSES AND EFFECTS Programming for Justice: Access for All 20 Consider ways in which the problem is contributing to poverty Major Objectives in Analyzing an Access to Justice Problem In what ways does the absence of justice remedies increase a person\u2019s vulnerability to poverty? The justice system is a means to ensure accountability, but it is not the only one.Sometimes justice remedies are not adequate or sufficient to bring people the sense of \u201cjustice\u201d they demand. Other remedies \u2013 administrative, political, or social \u2013 may be necessary. Further, different groups may have different perceptions on the role of formal and informal justice systems; perceptions may also be different for users and providers of justice services. Political,economic,social and cultural factors can reinforce the problem What factors contribute to the problem? This step seeks to identify the direct causes and effects of the access to justice problem. Remember that development problems are complex; they are not trees with distinctive root causes, but rather, they resemble webs of factors that impact on and reinforce each other. Access to justice programmes need to adopt a multidisciplinary approach to explore these factors.

Look beyond the legal and institutional reasons underlying the problem.Those who are experiencing the problem are in the best position to identify the main causes. Situate the problem in a human rights/legal context What human rights are at stake and what type of remedies are needed? Once the access to justice problem has been broadly identified, it needs to be interpreted in terms of human rights.To do this, compare the actual situation to how it should ideally be according to international human rights conventions and treaties and the national legal framework. The reason for situating the problem in a human rights context is to determine a basis of accountability that people can claim, and which institutions and other actors should strive to comply with. The human rights framework relevant for UNDP\u2019s action in a particular country is based on the Universal Declaration on Human Rights2. It also includes human rights recognized by international conventions ratified by the State, by the Constitution and by national legislation,or supported by the State in UN bodies or conferences (such as the UN Guiding Principles on the Treatment of Prisoners). 2 UN.2002.\u201cUN Common Understanding on a Human Rights Approach to Development.\u201dStamford,Connecticut. Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 21 The human rights framework provides guidance on access to justice problems in at least three ways: \ufffdIt provides a broad roadmap for development goals (e.g.,equality before the law). \ufffdIt provides detailed guidance on specific obligations for selected duty-bearers (such as the police and prisons). \ufffdIt helps to define the scope of remedies (e.g., there is a right to free speech; hence there should be a remedy when that right is not respected). Human rights are interrelated.Therefore, there will be a number of rights at stake in any particular situation that demand accountability. In line with the access to justice framework, the focus should be on those to which the justice system is best positioned to provide a remedy to.This will depend on the type of right, and on the situation. For instance, the justice system is likely to be the most appropriate mechanism for human rights claims related to the process of justice (e.g.,fair trial),but it can also play a key role in other rights (e.g., the right to remedies for medical malpractice or discrimination which restricts access to health). Sample questions: \ufffdWho are the duty bearers that need to fulfil their obligations in order for the claim-holders to effectively secure their rights? \ufffdWho are the duty bearers most able to provide a solution to the root causes? \ufffdWho are the duty bearers that are absolutely necessary to achieve a solution? \ufffdWhat specific duties are the duty bearers responsible for? The analysis should bear in mind that legal pluralism of societies implies that rights recognized at one level may be denied because of norms operating at another level3. For instance, judges may have contradicting duties to refuse bribes under national law and an unwritten right to accept them under bureaucratic \u201cliving law\u201d. Women may have the right to reproductive health under customary norms, but it may be denied by legislation, etc. Thus the analysis needs to identify whether and where contradictions exist, and whether justice systems can play a role in resolving such contradictions to ensure respect for human rights. Sample questions: \ufffdHow does the situation compare to the international human rights framework? \ufffdIs the national legal framework in line with international human rights? Is a legal framework in place at all? \ufffdIf no legal framework is in place, is there political support for establishing a legal framework or is there a need for prior constituency/coalition building for legal reform? \ufffdHow do regulations, customary laws or other informal cultural norms promote or hinder respect for legally recognized human rights? 3 Moser,C.and A.Norton.2001.\u201cTo Claim Our Rights: Livelihood security,human rights and sustainable development.\u201dOverseas Development Institute, United Kingdom. Dealing with sensitive human rights language In some countries reference to international human rights can be very sensitive. Don\u2019t get overly constrained about human rights language \u2013 you can carry out a rights-based analysis without necessarily referring to international human rights.

A human rights approach views programme stakeholders as bearers of claims and duties. Rights-based analysis establishes a distinction between claim holders (those who hold a right), and duty bearers (those who have a corresponding obligation to act in defending such a right).Human rights claim holders are always people, individually or collectively. The major duty bearer of human rights is the State, including national as well as local government in all the branches of state power (executive, legislative and judicial). UNDP access to justice programmes prioritize as claim holders the poor and other disadvantaged people. Poverty and discrimination (e.g., on the grounds of gender, ethnicity or caste) can disadvantage those seeking justice remedies through existing institutions. Duty bearers in access to justice programmes include state and non-state actors at national and local levels. Non-state duty bearers are key actors that may affect people\u2019s capacity to access justice (e.g., universities, civil society organizations, religious leaders and the media). Programming for Justice: Access for All 22 Example \u2013 rights at stake and key actors: RIGHTS AT STAKE JUSTICE REMEDIES KEY ACTORS Rights of detainees Release on legal limits Access to a lawyer Freedom from torture (E.g) Police, judiciary, lawyers, prosecutors and national human rights institutions, NGOs and religious groups Indigenous people\u2019s right to land Recognition of ancestral domians (E.g) Legislative commission, local government and courts, and mining companies. Identification of key stakeholders in the problem Who are the actors mandated to respond through the justice process, and in what ways? The next step is to identify what type of remedies justice institutions could provide for the situation. This requires the assessment of which specific actors could be involved in the solution and what specific role they should play.Table 1 in Chapter 1 can be used as a guide to the key actors in each of UNDP\u2019s access to justice support areas. Most actors will have a duty to provide a solution according to human rights,others may have a duty under other locally accepted frameworks (e.g., customary norms or legislation).Those that critically impact on people\u2019s capacity to access justice (e.g., universities) also have a duty to contribute to the realization of this right. Sample questions: \ufffdWho are the duty bearers that need to fulfil their obligations in order for the claim-holders to effectively secure their rights? \ufffdWho are the duty bearers most able to provide a solution to the root causes? \ufffdWho are the duty bearers that are absolutely necessary to achieve a solution? Key duty bearers with regard to access to justice problems are identified in Chapter 4. Duty bearers in relation to legal protection are mapped in Chapter 3 and those in relation to legal literacy and legal aid are detailed in Chapter 5. Each section explains the typical obstacles and capacity development strategies facing duty bearers and claim holders. Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 23 What persons are least able to claim their rights when they need them? Rights are fundamental interests protected by law (e.g., education, work, freedom of religion and opinion), therefore all human beings are claim-holders of human rights. Not everybody needs to use legal claims to defend their interests. Some people are able to use for instance their financial, human or social capital instead. Others, however, may have no other means than invoking their rights. Programme analysis should identify the people who are least able to claim their rights in a particular situation. They may be referred to as \u201cdisadvantaged groups\u201d in a particular context. Groups may suffer disadvantage as a result of different causes. Therefore, disadvantaged groups need to be disaggregated (see Chapter 6 for relevant obstacles and capacity development strategies for some disadvantaged groups). Discrimination can also result in some people being unable to claim their rights. For this reason, disadvantaged groups are likely to include the poor and other groups who are discriminated against in a particular context. Sample questions: \ufffdWho among the claim holders are most affected or unable to obtain remedy? \ufffdWho are least able to rectify the situation without assistance?

They may be physical, legal, institutional, political, cultural, technical, social, economic, etc. For instance, if the problem is that a disproportionate number of women are incarcerated, obstacles to disadvantaged people (e.g., poor women or commercial sex workers) may include illiteracy or social stigma, whereas obstacles to the duty bearers (e.g., prison administration) may include de-motivation, lack of awareness of human rights standards. It is important to distinguish lack of capacity from lack of willingness. While development strategies can help to develop capacities, lack of willingness should be considered as a risk for programme success \u2013 if unwillingness is too strong, advocacy efforts and other strategies to promote willingness should be attempted first.4 What strengths/ opportunities do disadvantaged people have to overcome such obstacles?

Outcomes of UNDP programmes should focus especially on positive changes for disadvantaged groups. \u201cPositive changes\u201d in access to justice are those that reflect a greater ability to obtain the type of justice remedies disadvantaged people need to improve their well-being. The following questions may be asked to assess whether the programme outcome is consistently formulated: \ufffdDoes the outcome describe a change in people\u2019s lives? \ufffdWill the change be in accordance with human rights standards? \ufffdHow does the outcome reflect a greater capacity to obtain justice remedies by people who could not previously obtain them? \ufffdDoes the outcome lessen people\u2019s vulnerability to poverty? \ufffdWill the outcome enable a baseline to be established against which improvements can be measured?

If the outcome does not take a human rights-based approach, such as: Prison system significantly strengthened. It will not (a) reflect a change in people\u2019s lives,(b) specify in what direction the change will take and (c) is difficult to measure. Alternatively,an access to justice programme that applies a rights-based approach and seeks to address this problem may have as its outcome: All women prisoners are able to secure their release after completing a reasonable prison term that is in accordance with international and national human rights standards and principles. Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 27 Accountability strengthens legitimacy and it is critical for good governance. It also helps to reduce poverty and violent conflict. Access to justice is basically about accountability and redress. Programmes should attempt to strike a balance between enhancing the capacities of claim holders to seek a remedy, and the capacities of duty bearers to provide such remedies; an exclusive focus on either the supply or the demand side risks ineffectiveness and frustration. At the same time, justice systems cannot adequately ensure accountability if they are not accountable themselves. OBJECTIVE To define what needs to be done, how, in partnership with whom and when, to produce results on access to justice that are pro-poor and promote equity PROGRAMMING STEP 7: DEFINE AND PRIORITIZE STRATEGIES Outcomes are general objectives, which development programmes can contribute to achieving. While there may be more than one strategy to achieve the desired result,prioritization of strategies requires the selection of the strategy likely to be the most effective. UNDP defines \u201cdevelopment effectiveness\u201d as a process that produces results that are pro-poor and promote equity5. This following section provides some tips to assist in prioritization. It is necessary to keep in mind however that many other important factors many prevail at the country level, which need to be considered. Identify would-be \u201cspoilers\u201dand potential \u201cchampions\u201d Assess the political space for action Who is interested in solving the problem and has the capacity to act? Is there anybody with the capacity to act who is interested in sustaining the status quo? Develop mechanisms that enable accountability Come up with a number of potential strategies Think in terms of issues, not institutions Define outcomes as concretely as possible. Access to justice is a process in which an array of institutions are involved, and whose functions complement each other. Generally problems will require simultaneous strategies, and from the analysis it should be possible to identify more than one strategy. Focus on accountability 5 UNDP.2003.UNDP Development Effectiveness Report. Programming for Justice: Access for All 28 Adopt multiple timeframes Adopt a short-, medium- and long-term perspective Programme analysis should enable the identification of a number of short,medium and long-term strategies to address the problem. Thinking of how these strategies can reinforce each other can provide a useful basis for selection. Seek immediate benefits for poor and disadvantaged people Think of ways to produce immediate benefits to disadvantaged people One of the major obstacles that disadvantaged people face when trying to access justice is the insecurity in which they live. Access to justice is often an urgent matter to them. Medium- and long-term strategies are not cost-effective if they are not also able to be responsive in the short-term. Without immediate results there may be further human rights violations. At the same time, even small, but tangible, benefits can have a significant impact on poverty (e.g., the release of one", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93b1a586-0822-4d86-95ab-6477b5ecf347": {"__data__": {"id_": "93b1a586-0822-4d86-95ab-6477b5ecf347", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d7c7b8ad07c90a68e34ce40d07eee8761dbf07d754a402a35d2aa3d4981767f"}}, "hash": "2d7c7b8ad07c90a68e34ce40d07eee8761dbf07d754a402a35d2aa3d4981767f", "text": "hundred poor women prisoners can affect thousands of people because of their income-generating and/or care- giving role in their families). Equally, cross-cutting activities on access to justice can produce an immediate impact on people\u2019s livelihoods. After identifying potential strategies, the following questions may be posed to assess whether a particular strategy is suitable for UNDP\u2019s action: \ufffdCan the strategy help to enhance accountability and produce immediate benefits for disadvantaged groups? \ufffdDoes the strategy build on existing strengths and solutions? \ufffdCan the strategy make a significant and measurable contribution to potential UNDP strategies in the medium-term? \ufffdIs there sufficient space for action \u2013 in terms of existence of champions, political will, ownership, etc.? \ufffdDoes the strategy build on UNDP\u2019s comparative advantage \u2013 including in-house capacity, involvement of other donors in this field, etc.? \ufffdIs the strategy realistic for the timeframe and the resources available? \ufffdIs there potential for mobilizing resources for more expanded support? Ways to enhance accountability through access to justice strategies \ufffdThrough internal mechanisms (e.g., putting internal oversight mechanisms in place; complementing these mechanisms with incentives such as performance-based promotion, etc.) \ufffdThrough external oversight mechanisms (such as building NGO coalitions to monitor performance, strengthened media, complaint mechanisms, etc.) \ufffdThrough enhancing the capacity of the user side to demand accountability \ufffdEnhancing accountability of the development programme/project itself (see section on M&E for this) Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 29 Access to justice programmes make a contribution to their stated goals through a combination of outputs and partnerships. These may not be sufficient on their own to make a change in people\u2019s lives (outcome), but they can contribute to change. Defining outputs Outputs should be directly connected to the outcome being pursued by the programme. Generally the factors that influence the problem that the output is hoping to address connects it to the outcome. For instance, an outcome that seeks to \u201celiminate the incidence of torture\u201d, may include a project output such as \u201cdrafting penal code provisions on the prohibition of torture\u201d. When establishing programme outputs the following questions may be asked: \ufffdDo the outputs make a critical contribution to the achievement of the outcome? \ufffdAre there outputs that could increase the accountability of justice providers? \ufffdAre there outputs that could strengthen the ability of disadvantaged groups to seek justice? \ufffdWill the achievement of certain outputs in the absence of others increase the vulnerability of disadvantaged groups? If so, can the project ensure all outputs will be achieved? Designing a partnership strategy A partnership strategy identifies how key partners will be mobilized and what results they are expected to contribute to the programme outcome. While the outputs are to a large extent under the programme\u2019s control,the results of the partnership strategy are less certain. When establishing partnerships, adopt a capacity development orientation.For example,who are the actors that have already attempted to solve the problem? Try to involve such actors to build on their efforts. Ideally, partnership strategies should include all partners that are in a position to ensure that outputs have an impact on people\u2019s lives\u2013 as well as all actors who are in the position to limit such an impact. Partnership strategies should be results-oriented. They should ask, what is expected to result from a specific partnership? As with outputs, the development of partnerships should be monitored. Partnerships can be established at the programme design stage, or they can occur as the programme develops. Partnerships can be pursued formally, such as in joint committees or in formal networks or they may occur informally \u2013 e.g., as a result of personal contact with counterparts, or within the context of other projects. To the extent possible however, UNDP should attempt to institutionalize such partnerships since access to justice initiatives may outlast the involvement of these particular individuals. To define: (a) The tangible results of the programme (b) How key partners will be mobilized to ensure that programme results impact on the goal PROGRAMMING STEP 8: DEVELOP OUTPUTS AND A PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY OBJECTIVES Outputs indicate the tangible results of development strategies at the end of the project period.

Programming for Justice: Access for All 30 Outputs \u2013 an example During the problem assessment and analysis it was concluded that the main reasons female offenders were disproportionately incarcerated for long periods for minor offences was because of (a) their own legal illiteracy, (b) the ambiguity in the law, and (c) because institutions charged with protecting their legal rights lack the administrative capacity to do so.

Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 31 31 Activities transform programme inputs into outputs. An implementation framework establishes what key activities (including actions and decisions) need to be performed during programme implementation, who will perform them, when and on what basis. For instance, a survey may need to be conducted to decide how to select participants, or to determine the specific contents of an advocacy campaign. (a)To define what type of activities are required to produce programme outputs (b)To determine roles and responsibilities (c) To ensure accountability and non-discrimination in programme implementation PROGRAMMING STEP 9: ESTABLISH AN IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK OBJECTIVES Define a timeframe for key activities and decisions Prepare an indicative work plan Think of the sequence of activities that are necessary to contribute to a particular output (e.g., legal aid services made available to women prisoners), and set a realistic timeframe to pursue the sequence, e.g., initial discussions with bar associations, Supreme Court and prison officials; establishment of baselines on trial sessions postponed for lack of a lawyer (design of study, conduct of study, recruitment of study team), etc. The process of preparing an indicative work plan will help you to assess whether the outputs set are realistic. Define roles and responsibilities and establish decision-making systems Who will be responsible? Who will be responsible for each task? How will collective decisions be taken? Programme stakeholders need to agree on roles and responsibilities during implementation. Committees and other mechanisms can be established for decision-making \u2013 there may be consultative committees, steering committees, etc. Make sure they are representative of the different perspectives that are relevant to the problem in question. Try to use existing mechanisms when available to avoid overburdening national and local administrations, and to ensure sustainability of coordination. Programming for Justice: Access for All 32 Ensure non-discrimination How will decisions affect the most disadvantaged people? Non-discrimination does not necessarily mean treating everybody equally. When deep inequalities exist (e.g., in human and financial capacities, or capacities for organization and representation) equal treatment may sustain and reinforce inequalities. It is important to make additional efforts to ensure those who are in a disadvantaged position are put at the centre of decision-making. Non-discrimination may require reviewing recruitment, funding and other operational criteria.Ensuring non-discrimination is especially necessary in the case of disadvantaged groups who are not able to participate in the programme process, or who are not within the focus of the programme. Non-discrimination calls for assessing how key decisions impact on affected groups who have not been involved in decision- making. For instance, in the case of the illustrative outcome on women prisoners mentioned before, it would be important to ensure that the programme does not result in longer periods of incarceration for men as a consequence of the prioritisation of women. Establish mechanisms to demand accountability How will responsibility be ensured? For accountability to occur,it needs to be demanded. Establish ways in which actors responsible for particular tasks (e.g., procurement, recruitment, provision of data, preparation of technical reports) can be asked to report on their activities to other programme stakeholders and to the public at large (e.g., through focal points for information and requests, peer review systems, involvement of NGOs and independent parties in monitoring activities, public hearings, etc.). Mechanisms to demand responsibility from UNDP should also be made clear. Determine what mechanisms will be used to deal with potential complaints about the process and the results of the programme (e.g., on recruitment, corruption, lack of transparency, etc.). Make sure the mechanisms to demand accountability are known to their potential users throughout the implementation of the programme. Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 33 33 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) consists of tracking and assessing the actual results of the programme as compared to the ones that were planned or expected.This is essential to determine the results-orientation and effectiveness of development initiatives.

Monitoring is a continuous process that lasts for the whole implementation of the project. This section explains the major components of a M&E system, and provides some tips on how to introduce M&E into programme design. A sound Monitoring and Evaluation system is a fundamental pillar of UNDP\u2019s accountability. For this reason, M&E systems should be transparent and accessible, and be explicit about the reasons for restricting the timing and scope of information they provide (e.g., confidentiality of sources, etc). Once the programme strategy is clear, and goals, outputs and partnerships have been defined, you can come up with an M&E system by answering some key questions: What to measure? \ufffd Outcomes \u2013 what are the expected changes to people\u2019s lives (see Step 6)? \ufffd Outputs \u2013 what are the tangible results of the programme (see Step 8)? \ufffd Partnership Strategy - how key partners will be mobilized to ensure outputs have an impact (see Step 8)? \ufffd Participation Plan - how will stakeholders be involved (see Step 4)? \ufffd Implementation Framework \u2013 is implementation taking place in a non-discriminatory and accountable manner (see Step 9)? Establish general parameters for assessment The first step towards establishing an M&E system is to define what parameters in each of these areas will be measured.When the expected result in each area (outcome, process, etc.) is adequately defined, the parameters to measure it will be few and simple. Parameters may describe a situation, a condition, the level of knowledge, an attitude, or a behaviour, etc. For example, \u201cAll women prisoners able to secure their release after completing a reasonable prison sentence and in conformity with human rights principles and standards\u201d. In this outcome there are two key parameters: (1) reasonability of the period of incarceration for female offenders, and (2) conditions under which the prison sentence and release are conducted. To define, with respect to process and the results of a development strategy: (a) What to measure? (b) How to measure? (c) Who will do it? (d) With what frequency? (e) With what purpose? PROGRAMMING STEP 10: DESIGN A MONITORING AND EVALUATION SYSTEM OBJECTIVES Parameters are general categories that clarify where change should occur Characteristics of a programme indicator: Direct: Measures as closely as possible the type of results the parameter describes. Objective: Has no ambiguity about what is being measured and it is operationally precise. Adequate: Groups of indicators should be able to measure a given parameter. Avoid using too many indicators. Quantitative: They facilitate comparison through time and projects where possible. Disaggregated: May be necessary to assess whether the results of the project impact differently on different groups of people. Practical: An indicator is practical if data can be obtained in a timely way and at reasonable costs. Reliable: Can sufficiently reliable data for confident decision-making be obtained? Programming for Justice: Access for All 34 Parameters should relate directly to what is being measured.For instance,in the case of a partnership strategy with a parliamentary body to ensure feedback on the legislative process, the parameter should relate to the occurrence of such a feedback. When the outcome or result is defined concisely, parameters would be stated similarly and there may be only one or two. General statements of outcomes, outputs or partnership strategies (such as \u201cstrengthened administration of justice\u201d or \u201cpartnership with the Supreme Court\u201d) make the establishment of parameters difficult, or require too many parameters. Set indicators Indicators define the data that measures a given parameter. Indicators only indicate, they do not explain. They can be seen as snapshots of a small part of the reality that the parameter is referring to. A parameter will generally require more than one indicator. Try to be strategic in setting indicators: some indicators can serve to measure more than one parameter. Where possible, choose those indicators that have more than one purpose.

For instance,\u201cpublic confidence in the justice system\u201d is a proxy indicator of a \u201cfair administration of justice\u201d. Indicators may be qualitative or quantitative. Quantitative indicators facilitate comparisons, but they are insufficient on their own to assess parameters, which will normally include important qualitative dimensions. Define means of verification The means of verification are the sources of data and the methodology used to obtain that data.For instance, if the indicator is \u201creduction in the prison sentence period for minor female offenders\u201d, the source of data may include prison and court records, and the method of collecting data may be conducting a survey of 150 cases in five regional courts. The accessibility, cost and reliability of data are central criterions in selecting one type of indicator rather than another. However, as access to justice problems are new to development and often invisible, secondary data may not always be available or may be insufficient. On occasions, access to justice programmes will need to invest a certain amount of time and resources in data gathering. The use of rapid appraisal methods, which are quick, low-cost ways to gather data systematically, should be taken into consideration. On the other hand, using participatory processes may take more time but be more cost-effective, as these processes can also serve to expand capacities in critical groups (see Step 3 to develop a participation plan). Finding accessible and reliable sources may be difficult, often the programme will need to invest in data gathering. Participatory processes may be cost-effective means of doing this as they can also serve to expand capacities 35 Chapter 2:Ten Steps to Developing an Access to Justice Programme 35 TABLE 4: SETTING PARAMETERS AND INDICATORS \u2013 AN EXAMPLE WHAT TO MEASURE OUTCOME: ALL WOMEN PRISONERS ABLE TO SECURE THEIR RELEASE AFTER COMPLETING A REASONABLE PRISON SENTENCE AND IN CONFORMITY WITH HUMAN RIGHTS PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS (1) Reasonability of the period of incarceration (1) Percentage of minor female offenders granted alternative prison sentence or conditional release Target: 30% increase in alternative prison sentencing/conditional release for female offenders for minor offences in 3 years.

Participatory processes may risk being captured by more educated or better positioned groups or individuals.To counter the risk of elite capture, efforts should be made to involve those who are in a disadvantaged position as well. Participatory monitoring can become a learning process and a process of social negotiation if done well. This can produce additional capacity results for the project. It is useful to involve independent actors (e.g., NGOs, agencies not related to the programme, other donors) in monitoring activities, as this usually increases the reliability of findings. What will be the frequency of the assessment? Set a timeframe for Monitoring and Evaluation.Will data be collected monthly, every six months, or annually? With what frequency will reports be prepared? A specific timeframe responds to the purposes and the nature of what is being measured. Certain information may be needed regularly to ensure programme adjustments; especially data related to the process such as data on participation or non-discrimination (see Step 10). Secure funding and time to collect and analyze data, even if collection happens after completion of the project, such as in evaluations. What are the purposes of the data? How will the information gathered in Monitoring and Evaluation be used? It is easier to set parameters and indicators that are relevant by being explicit about what specific decisions M&E data aims to support, during and after programme implementation. For instance, will particular sets of data help to design a training course in the later stages of the project? What type of data will serve to conduct a mid-term programme adjustment? Which data can be used for advocacy purposes? Monitoring processes that facilitate learning and social negotiation can produce additional results to the project in terms of capacities. Targets and benchmarks should be realistic, and they should be agreed to by all programme partners. Some methods of data collection Commonly used methods include: \ufffdDesk research. Involves collecting secondary data (from previous surveys, reports, etc.). \ufffdKey informant interviews. Involves interviews with15 to 35 individuals selected for their first-hand knowledge about a topic of interest. Interviews are qualitative, in-depth and semi-structured. Interview guides and listing topics can be used. \ufffdFocus groups interviews. Involves several groups of 8 to 12 participants. Each group discusses issues and experience among themselves. A moderator introduces the topic, stimulates and focuses the discussion, and prevents domination of discussion by a few. \ufffdCommunity interviews. These usually take place at public meetings. Interaction is between the participants and the interviewer, who presides over the meeting and asks questions following a carefully prepared interview guide. \ufffdDirect observation. Teams of observers record what they see and hear at a programme site, using detailed observation forms. Observations may be of physical surroundings, ongoing activities, discussions, etc. \ufffdMini-surveys. Involves interviews with 25 to 50 individuals, usually selected using sampling techniques. Structured questionnaires that focus on a limited number of closed-ended questions are used. 3 NORMATIVE PROTECTION C H A P T E R Overview of the Chapter 3.1 Normative Protection and Access to Justice 3.2 National and International Framework of Normative Protection 3.3 Challenges to Achieving the Full Benefits of Normative Protection 3.4 Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Normative Protection CHAPTER 3 OVERVIEW INTRODUCTION This chapter examines the normative framework that is in place at the national and international levels and the areas of intervention that protect the rights of the disadvantaged. In certain cases, the legal framework within the country does not take into consideration the particular barriers faced by disadvantaged people nor does it address their needs. As a result, the justice system becomes an entity that is often inaccessible to them, thus perpetuating exclusion and sometimes displaying gross discrimination. Normative protection in access to justice encompasses formal and informal sets of norms, addressing both substantive and procedural aspects of protection. Normative protection provides us with standards in rela- tion to access to justice within a human rights framework. It also provides us with remedies to pursue when those standards are violated. The presence of both standards and remedies are critical to normative protection. Chapter 3: Normative Protection 39 39 39 3.1 NORMATIVE PROTECTION AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE Norms are socially generated and as such reflect the conflicts/tensions of a society.Thus, norms can be positive or negative and the repercussion of the norms can be either good or bad. While norms have the capacity to provide protection, it is first necessary to evaluate whether certain norms perpetuate injustice rather than justice.

Thus,they can be referred as formal or informal law. Formal law are those promulgated by designated state organs, such as the legislature. In many cases, this evolves in response to social demand. Informal law on the other hand,\u201cevolved through social interaction and are either internalized or enforced informally\u201d primarily by non-state actors. Informal institutions govern social groups from village communities to networks, among others.1 In a discussion on normative protection, the elements of legal systems include: \ufffdThe existence of rules, which can be international or domestic, constitutional or \u2018ordinary\u2019, procedural or substantive, formal or informal in nature; \ufffdProcesses through which rules are made, applied, interpreted and enforced in practice (i.e. rule-making, rule-enforcing and rule-changing); and \ufffdRelevant actors and institutions involved in them2. Whatever the nature of these elements, the impact of legal systems depends largely on how disadvantaged groups interact with the law, and whether institutions operate according to what the rules establish (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 5). Normative protection and behavioural change Legal norms and institutions are socially generated and are always evolving. They are instrumental in generating and stimulating change where there is underlying social consensus. Whilst fostering access to justice, the law can either lead or follow. Therefore, interventions aiming to bring justice to disadvantaged groups by influencing the normative framework must go beyond simply creating the right conditions for the disadvantaged groups to channel their demands (reactive normative setting) and also work towards influencing the normative framework by setting progressive norms that will lead to changes in society (pro-active normative setting). For instance the development of rules to induce or discourage certain types of behaviour \u2013 e.g., provision of incentives to encourage environmental protection, criminalization of child pornography or sexual harassment, or the setting of minimum quotas for women in parliament. Human rights and normative protection The concept of human rights is based on the recognition of specific fundamental and inalienable rights essential to the human being.To the extent that these inherent rights of each human being are recognized and formalized within the normative framework, whether national or international, they offer normative protection of disadvantaged groups. However, formal recognition within the normative framework alone may not be sufficient for the protection and enjoyment of rights of the most disadvantaged groups. In some cases additional or more specific laws need to be enacted to flesh out the contents of the right, claim holders and duty bearers. Complementing norms (legislation) to enhance the normative framework for the protection of disadvantaged groups may be developed/ enacted either within the national or international legal system. For instance, even though non-discrimination against women is embodied in all human rights related instruments pertaining to the international legal system, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was drafted to specifically deal with the issue of women\u2019s rights and to ensure that they are protected under all circumstances. Likewise, even though there are a number of laws to generally protect the population against violence, specific laws, such as anti-sexual harassment laws, anti-domestic violence laws and anti-rape laws, are necessary to ensure that women are protected from violence based on their own experiences of it. (Also see Chapter 6). Stigmatization of disadvantaged groups It is also through the normative framework that we define what is and is not a crime within a given society or legal system.Often,disadvantaged groups are marginalized or stigmatized by the law when it does not recognize their legal status or practices (e.g., indigenous peoples\u2019 usage of land and natural resources), or even worse, their behaviour can be criminalized due to lack of understanding or sensitivity (e.g., women victims of trafficking and forced prostitution are treated as offenders and provided with limited access to justice). 1 The Evolution of Legal Institutions and Economic Regime Change.

The enactment of statutes protecting judicial independence, the establishment of judicial oversight bodies and watchdogs such as \u2018Councils of Magistrates\u2019, or the development of additional systems such as Ombudsmen, Human Rights Commissions, etc., are additional tools provided by the law to ensure proper application of the law and professionalism within the judiciary (see Chapter 4). 3.2 NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORKS OF NORMATIVE PROTECTION In general, normative protection may either derive from a State\u2019s legal system or the international normative framework. Usually, both complement each other, i.e. the international framework spells out principles of normative protection to be incorporated into the national normative framework. Moreover, there is an increasing tendency for the international normative framework to surpass its inter-State conception and to address specific areas of normative protection within a State, such as human rights. National Framework of Normative Protection The Constitution The Constitution is the basic law of the State. It provides the general framework and principles by which a state is run and on the basis of which its organs are entitled to act.It also prescribes how the State should be organized by specifying the duties and linkages between the different functional units within the State. In almost all cases, the Constitution is the supreme and most sovereign law of the land from which no other national law can depart. As a consequence, it is the standard by which other national legal instruments and governmental actions or omissions within the country are measured. As the Constitution is the highest norm of the State, it is important for human rights (and as a consequence access to justice principles) to be incorporated within the Constitution to provide a basic framework with which the State and its citizens are required to comply. Provisions relevant to access to justice generally present in Constitutions include: \ufffdBill of Rights3 \ufffdDirective Principles (also known as Basic Principles or State Principles) \ufffdSeparation of power between the executive, legislature and judiciary \ufffdEstablishment of monitoring bodies such as the National Human Rights Commissions Constitutional reform is a difficult process. Under rare circumstances, for example due to changes in government or as part of a peace agreement, an entirely new Constitution may be drafted. However, any change to the Constitution, no matter how small, provides an opportunity to improve the normative standards on access to justice. Due to the sovereign position of the Constitution within the legal system,it is of strategic importance to have rights recognized and protected through the Constitution. Thus, whenever possible, when advocating for the protection of a right, a formal constitutional provision should be sought. Another way of ensuring a constitutional guarantee in cases where an amendment of the actual constitutional text is impractical is to obtain a favourable judicial reading of the Constitutional text. This can be particularly useful when the constitutional text is ambiguous or outdated. (see discussions below on legislation and court decisions). In such cases, there is also an added value of the international normative human rights framework since this is a classic case where the 40 Programming for Justice: Access for All Challenges to Constitutional Reform Often, constitutional reform and amendments are a difficult process. For example: \ufffd In Japan,amendments can only be initiated by a vote of two-thirds or more of all the members of each of its parliamentary organs (House of Representatives and House of Councillors) and the amendments must be submitted to the people for ratification in a referendum (The Constitution of Japan, Art. 96). \ufffd In Vanuatu, an amendment may be introduced either by the Prime Minister or any other Member of Parliament.It will come into effect if supported by two-thirds of all the members of Parliament at a special sitting of Parliament at which three-quarters of the members are present. If there is no such quorum at the first sitting,Parliament may meet and make a decision by the same majority a week later, however, two-thirds of the members must be present. Certain parliamentary amendments such as to the electoral system or to the parliamentary system require a national referendum. (Vanuatu Constitution, Arts. 84-86) 3 In some countries the bill of rights is limited to a listing of civil and political rights but increasingly,countries are expanding this list to include economic,social and cultural rights. high courts may refer to international \u201cprecedents\u201d, such as the jurisprudence of international and/ or regional human rights courts, as well as charter-based and treaty-based bodies. However, there are also risks involved in pushing for constitutional reform.

Additionally, it may be important to evaluate the role and jurisprudence of the Constitutional/ High/Supreme Court on human rights before moving ahead with constitutional reforms, which may otherwise override valuable precedents. Legislation Legislation is generally statutory law that has been enacted by the legislature (i.e., the Parliament or National Assembly). Legislation can be referred to as legislation, statutes, codes, acts or legislative decree. In some cases,the term law is used to refer to legislation.4 Legislation serves to elaborate on the general framework and principles of the Constitution and must comply at all times with the Constitution. In exceptional cases, the President or the Executive branch can be given the power to enact legislation in certain circumstances, such as in emergency situations or in situations of transition. \ufffdLaw reform through legislation for the enhancement of the normative framework. The process of creating and reforming legislation varies from country to country,depending on the mechanisms provided within the Constitution and legislative practice.However, there are many over factors beyond the Constitution, and the processes it mandates, that can lead to law reform. It is critical to ensure that both legal and extra-legal methods are pursued and that both the capacity to provide remedies and the capacity to seek remedies are targeted. Formulating specific legislation to address the needs of a particular (generally disadvantaged) group is often seen as unnecessary and as \u201ccatering to minority interests\u201d. For example, in Costa Rica (see box on page 43), efforts to provide specific legislative protections and incentives to support women\u2019s political participation were initially met with questions of why it was necessary to legislate for women in particular when a law already existed providing no distinction between men and women running for political office. This type of attitude reflects a lack of conceptual clarity about substantive equality. It fails to recognize that the existence of a gender-neutral law does not necessarily mean that equality is achieved. \ufffdNeutrality leads to discrimination. In Zambia, for example, under the government land policy 10 per cent of all advertised land should be given to women. However, the effectiveness of this policy is undermined by the requirement of a collateral of ZMK 100,000 (about US $21) which is non refundable and is required upfront. As women are generally poorer than men, many women cannot afford this amount and therefore are precluded from benefiting from the policy. The law thus discriminates against women by failing to ensure their equal access to and enjoyment of the land policy.5 In cases such as this, a gender specific standard is necessary to ensure that women have the same rights to access and enjoy the same opportunities provide to men. One way to counter de facto discrimination is to have an explicit provision and legal guarantee in favour of disadvantaged groups. \ufffdImplementation of legislation through administrative rules and regulations. Secondary rules and regulations are written by the executive branch to implement primary legislation. They reflect the institutional interpretation of legislation by executive branch as well as specification of measures to be undertaken in the implementation of the primary legislation. The executive branch decides how it will implement the policies forged into law. In some cases, such rules and regulations are also promulgated by a functional unit of government to govern its own functioning. In these instances they may be called guidelines, circulars or secondary laws. Administrative rules and regulations or by-laws are of critical importance to the implementation of laws, while also being common causes of non-implementation. Excessive rules and regulations may in fact limit remedies established by law to the point of making them ineffective. However, they can also be used to fill legal gaps and respond to urgent needs while primary norms are being developed. 41 Chapter 3: Normative Protection Indirect Discrimination An aquaculture project in Bangladesh was found to discriminate against women because it required that all those aspiring to participate had to own ponds. Since women did not inherit their parent\u2019s property or those who did, did not have access to the pond because they had moved to their husbands\u2019village, they could not participate in the project.

Enactment of rules and regulations aims to remove the arbitrariness from the process, ensure predictability and consistency and to avoid discriminatory practices. By supporting the process of development of regulatory frameworks, largely by working closely with line ministries, rights enshrined in law can be expanded by detailing the duties and responsibilities of different actors. Changes at this level are generally easier to obtain as interventions can be made by working only with specific governmental units, yet the effects can be as far reaching as primary legislation in some cases. Unlike legislation however, rules and regulations can be challenged as being unlawful (against the law) or unconstitutional (against the Constitution). Further, the process to enact administrative and secondary norms can lack transparency and does not usually benefit from the involvement of disadvantaged groups. Court Decisions (Jurisprudence) Acting as the link between the normative framework and the individual, the decisions of courts and tribunals form part of the framework of normative protection. Court decisions can provide protection through the application of national and \u2013 depending on the legal system in relation to the international legal framework - international human rights standards. They can also develop further or elaborate on existing human rights standards. In cases where the national statutory framework is lacking basic standards for rights protection, a progressive judiciary can expand domestic normative protection to protect disadvantaged groups. Some examples of creative judiciary in action include: \ufffdPaschim Banga Khet Majoor Samity v. State of West Bengal (India). This case involved a petition based on the right to life of an agricultural labourer who suffered severe head injuries and was taken to seven different government hospitals,all of which refused him treatment on the grounds that there was no vacant bed.The Indian Supreme Court \u201ccarved out\u201d the right to emergency medical care for accident victims as forming a core component of the right to health, which in turn was recognized as forming an integral part of the right to life, a right guaranteed under the Indian Constitution. Following this decision, the State was required to formulate a blue print for primary health care with particular reference to treatment of patients in an emergency.6 \ufffdGrootboom Case (South Africa). In 1999, the Grootboom community was forcibly evicted from private land and was forced to move to a nearby shanty town outside Cape Town on the perimeter of a sports field with no sanitation, electricity and water. In response, the community travelled daily to the High Court to seek a remedy to their forcible eviction. The Constitutional Court held that Article 26 of the Constitution (right of access to adequate housing) imposes an obligation on the State to formulate and affect a coherent, coordinated housing programme. The Court felt that, by failing to provide for the vulnerable members of society, the Government had failed to take \u201creasonable measures, within available resources.\u201dThe Court ordered the Government to \u201cdevise, fund, implement and supervise measures to provide relief to those in desperate need.\u201d7 \ufffdPeople\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties v. Union of India (India). In April 2001, despite of the tons of food stocks in the country\u2019s warehouses, there was a food scarcity in states affected by drought. The People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties applied for relief from the shortage in the courts based on the right to food derived from the right to life,the latter a right guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court upheld this right by specifically stating that food must be provided to the aged, infirmed, disabled, destitute women, men and children and pregnant and lactating women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97c33fc9-f910-440f-b6d5-08303e641480": {"__data__": {"id_": "97c33fc9-f910-440f-b6d5-08303e641480", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8796742c95ceb29527771840647ae217ae0004ccd11540859b8826b4f6ca6ff"}, "2": {"node_id": "d585bd7e-4fac-4fdc-94b4-005c5b8fd66a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f382601877e2003ee7e257b3c0a22a1a1d54e6ac857acec2225f7aba0586d4e6"}}, "hash": "64f068fdc26a6efab1e26c180c1e6cba5d2c927d7a2656231e07b627e26fd7d2", "text": "Several other orders were made by the court including: (a) ration shops must remain open and give grains to families below the poverty line; (b) the Government should publicize the right of the families below the poverty line to grain; (c) grain allocation for the Food for Work programme must be doubled; (d) all individuals without means of support (including older persons,widows,persons with disabilities) are to be granted a ration card;and (e) implementation of the mid-day meal scheme in schools.8 42 Programming for Justice: Access for All In the Philippines, the Supreme Court in 2000 promulgated rules governing the treatment of child witnesses in court proceedings to guide lawyers, law enforcers, judges and other relevant", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1956a533-dfc7-43b1-a327-39bd5b9c0c84": {"__data__": {"id_": "1956a533-dfc7-43b1-a327-39bd5b9c0c84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cd3f2f37993235866692d09cfd5ada93725dbed573fad57a5db67f0c3c3e44b"}, "3": {"node_id": "c5a382ad-8576-479c-b929-75091a9a51b1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cfeb5caec0a7b69d89976bdb8afa101d60bf623b8bc4ee657224ee9f6a2506e"}}, "hash": "fa26c20808e2d4b2c6e6c8bb5a0761e74dbfd42088150473559d45e0f8003d27", "text": "actors.

He went on to win the elections and announced on taking up office that he would give a very high priority to women\u2019s issues. The women who had supported Aria\u2019s campaign, and those who now held positions in Government, moved quickly to ensure that the Arias and his government kept its promises.They drafted legislation to implement Costa Rica\u2019s commitments under CEDAW, initially focusing on political participation, proposing that political parties should nominate male and female candidates in proportion to the percentage of male and female voters in the electorate.They also proposed that 25 per cent of the public funds parties received must be spent on improving women\u2019s political participation. A broad coalition of women\u2019s groups began work on a multi-dimensional strategy for the passage of the bill. Among the various activities employed were: \ufffd Town hall meetings convened on the need for and contents of the bill; \ufffd Awareness raising \u201ccultural fairs\u201ddirected at women and children; \ufffd Media lobbying by politically prominent women; \ufffd A public demonstration and march; \ufffd A meeting with over 300 priests to discuss the bill and gain their support for it, convened with the permission of the Archbishop of the Catholic Church; \ufffd Conducting of a public opinion survey at the close of the campaign. The results of this last activity found that 63 per cent of the public was aware of the bill and that 73 per cent approved of measures for male and female representation in the nominations for government elections. It became obvious then to the legislators that direct opposition to the bill would be highly unpopular.Those who had been critical of the bill were forced to refocus their energies on amending some of its provisions. At the same time,those who supported the bill made some changes to it based on their consultations over the course of the campaign with a wide range of women\u2019s groups.Two new sections were added: \ufffd An introductory section on State obligations to guarantee real equality in political, economic, social and cultural life and to remove obstacles to real equality; and \ufffd Reforms required in relation to Costa Rica\u2019s civil penal, procedural, labour and family laws.

However, court decisions should be used with caution as the judicial introduction of norms may also divert the community from a more open and democratic process of norm making through Constitutional or statutory amendments.9 Courts,however,can serve to clarify legal ambiguity and can prompt legislative bodies to review or enact adequate legislation. Customary Practices (Informal Laws) In addition to the formal legal frameworks, informal law also provide normative protection. This is often referred to as customary law or traditional law. Both formal and informal legal frameworks have positive aspects and their effectiveness varies depending on the nature of the dispute and the relationship of parties.In many developing countries, traditional and customary legal systems account for an estimated 80 per cent of total cases.10 Customary law can be either written or unwritten law (see Informal Justice Systems in Chapter 4 and Indigenous Peoples and Minority Groups in Chapter 6). In many instances,customary norms and practices are the main sources of customary law. Informal law is in some cases also called traditional law. It is not a body of precepts that remains static over time, but the result of long historical processes of interpretation and adaptation to changing environments, thus reflecting the values of a given society. Wherever traditional law is compatible with international human rights and basic considerations of justice, \u201callowing diversity and customary practices to flourish is a way to improve the quality of governance and to democratise both the form and the content of legal regulation\u201d.11 Therefore,in order to work through complementary normative frameworks (formal and informal), careful consideration should be given to whether or not to institutionalize or formalize informal set of norms and justice systems depending on country specificities. However, before making this decision it is necessary to examine whether existing customary norms are in conformity with human rights standards and are inclusive of disadvantaged groups as well as the disadvantaged sectors within disadvantaged groups (see discussions below under Duality of Norms). In countries such as the Philippines and Rwanda, traditional justice systems have been formalized through the enactment of legislation. While in countries such as South Africa, the traditional justice systems have remained within the informal realm, which is characterized by its flexibility, community focus, accessibility to the poor, and rapid response to dispute settlement. Interventions to increase access to justice should work with informal structures, as well as with the formal sector. Informal and tradition institutions should not be seen as a substitute or replacement of formal justice institutions but rather viewed as a complementary system to reinforce the provision of justice to the majority of citizens. In some countries, mechanisms to link the formal and informal justice systems include:12 \ufffdApplicability of traditional law by the courts. This is usually applicable within certain limits such as only in civil cases or consistency with other existing written laws. \ufffdCreation of bodies of traditional leaders. Such bodies (e.g., councils) can have an advisory role on matters related to traditional laws. These bodies may be complemented by judiciary committees with powers of adjudication on matters affecting traditional institutions (for an example of how this works, see Ghana). \ufffdVerdicts from traditional courts can be appealed to higher courts.

This difference in process creates certain incompatibilities in the relief or remedy requested. Some countries (e.g., Papua New Guinea) have tried to address this difference by allowing for traditional processes of mediation and compromises rather than the enactment of binding judgments. International Framework of Normative Protection The international legal framework operates on top of the national framework. Initially conceived as a means to govern the relations between (sovereign) States, it provides for rights and obligations of States vis-\u00e0-vis each other. These rights and obligations derive from the sources of international law the main sources being: international treaties, customary international law,and general principles of law. However, with the growing understanding for the need to ensure the respect, protection and enjoyment of human rights, the international framework has developed standards and mechanisms reaching well into the national normative framework. The relationship between these the national and international spheres of normative protection is usually defined in the Constitution, which may either consider international norms as part of the national legal framework or require legislative acts for their applicability within the domestic realm. In both cases,States (its organs) remain bound by the international obligations and failure to implement them will trigger specific consequences under the international normative framework.They may thus serve as important benchmarks against which to measure the extent to which normative protection is provided for and to hold governments accountable accordingly. They may furthermore serve as authoritative standards to be referred to when pursuing reform in furtherance of the normative protection of disadvantaged groups. Last but not least, remedies provided for under the international normative framework may directly be available to individuals who feel that their human rights have been infringed by the State. The international legal framework also provides normative protection for access to justice by providing: \ufffdInternational obligations for states through human rights treaties and customary law; \ufffdOther human rights standards that are not binding on States as such but give normative guidance on specific issues (e.g., resolutions, declarations, guiding principles etc.) and may be indicative of a growing international consensus to further develop the international legal framework; \ufffdAn additional forum for access to justice, (e.g., communications and inquiry procedures initiated through treaty bodies and regional courts and commissions, in cases where national mechanisms are ineffective); \ufffdMechanisms to monitor states compliance with human rights and access to justice obligations; and \ufffdAn additional forum to create or influence national norm making. Treaties A treaty is an international agreement concluded between states in written form and governed by international law.13 Treaties may either be concluded between a number of States (multilateral treaty) or between two States only (bilateral treaty).Multilateral treaties are frequently referred to as Charter, Convention or Covenant, whereas bilateral treaties are often termed Agreement. Treaties may be supplemented by so-called Protocols. A treaty (and its protocol) is binding among the States that ratified or acceded to it, in which case the State is called a State Party or a Member State in the case of treaties establishing international organizations, such as the United Nations.Mere signature does not bind a State to follow the terms of the treaty in its entirety, but merely to refrain from conduct which would render the treaty obsolete (or defeat its object and purpose). The relationship between the national normative framework and international treaties is normally determined by the Constitution.While States enjoy discretion as to the normative value they afford to international obligations within their normative framework (i.e. the applicability of treaties), they cannot use provisions of the national normative framework as an excuse for the failure to meet the international obligations deriving from the treaty. However, they may enter into reservations in order to render certain treaty obligations inapplicable.In general, there are two approaches concerning the relationship between international treaties and the national legal system depending on whether the international normative framework is considered as part of the national legal system or as separate, thus requiring legislative acts within the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8853d19e-cb23-4a86-bdbc-10230dceaad6": {"__data__": {"id_": "8853d19e-cb23-4a86-bdbc-10230dceaad6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a565ac359d9a0769d5490406583be364ffb66253988edff0be39c52bceecb86"}}, "hash": "0a565ac359d9a0769d5490406583be364ffb66253988edff0be39c52bceecb86", "text": "national normative framework to become part of it: \ufffdInternational treaties are directly applicable, provided that they are sufficiently specific (in wording), i.e. self-executing.In this case,they can be directly applied after ratification without further legislative action,14 i.e., rights and obligations can be relied on by individuals and/or courts. In many of these cases, it involves a situation when Constitutional texts provides for its direct application, thus settling any ambiguity regarding its application; or 45 Chapter 3: Normative Protection 13 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,Article 1. 14 See examples of the Constitutions of the Republic of Korea and Nepal in the section on Recommendations on Using International Law at the national level. \ufffdThey require further legislative action to \u201cintroduce\u201d (transform or incorporate) international norms into the domestic legal system. This can be achieved by the adoption of specific legislation corresponding to or duplicating (if sufficiently specific in wording) the obligations set out in the international treaty. In contradistinction to the previous approach, individuals and courts will not primarily rely on the text of the international treaty but on the legislation specifically enacted to meet the State\u2019s international obligations. (For further discussion, see the section on ways to use international law at the national level). International human rights treaties provide the basic normative framework for access to justice. The seven main UN human rights treaties that help establish this framework are: \ufffdInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its two Optional Protocols \ufffdInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) \ufffdInternational Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) \ufffdConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its Optional Protocol (CAT) \ufffdConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and its Optional Protocol (CEDAW) \ufffdConvention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and its two Optional Protocols \ufffdInternational Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (CMW) Treaties are legally binding for states that have ratified them. In addition, the human rights treaty system has developed a mechanism to continuously generate normative standards and expanding normative protection through the monitoring of compliance with each treaty by a specialized body, also known as a \u201ctreaty body\u201d (e.g., the Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors compliance with the CRC, the Human Rights Committee monitors compliance with the ICCPR etc.). Members of treaty bodies are independent experts selected by States Parties from different regions of the world. The treaty body fulfils its monitoring functions in the following ways: \ufffdA system of reporting Each treaty has a provision that obligates States Parties to report to the treaty body at regular intervals. Once the State Party\u2019s report has been submitted a constructive dialogue between the State Party and the treaty body then takes place on the State Party\u2019s compliance with the treaty concerned. The report is used as the primary, but not the sole, basis of consideration.15 As a result of this dialogue, the treaty body drafts a set of Concluding Comments or Concluding Observations in relation to the State\u2019s compliance with the treaty. These comments or observations set out the positive areas of implementation, factors impeding implementation and areas of concern,and provides recommendations for better application of the convention. The value of the reporting process rests in the fact that it measures progress in a State\u2019s compliance with its human rights obligations. As reports are periodically submitted, the initial report acts as the baseline from which succeeding reports are to be assessed in terms of progression or regression. It allows States to avail of the expertise of the members of the treaty bodies who can advise on the appropriate ways to address obstacles in implementation.Thus,it creates and builds a better understanding of a State\u2019s obligation under the treaty as they are being held accountable for compliance. NGOs also submit additional information (alternative or shadow reports) to the treaty bodies whenever their country reports to the treaty body. For example, IWRAW Asia Pacific since 1997 through its \u2018From Global to Local Programme\u2019, has facilitated the participation of women from countries reporting to the CEDAW Committee by providing guidelines on writing alternative/ shadow reports and mentoring them through the reporting process. The project has focused on building better understanding among its participants on the relevance and usefulness of CEDAW in their advocacy at the local level. It has worked to create a space for NGOs within the CEDAW reporting process especially in providing Committee members more information and data to assist the Committee in constructive dialogue with governments.

For example, Article 12 of the ICESCR guarantees the right to the highest standard of physical and mental health. The Committee on Economic,Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment No. 14 on the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health further elaborates on the Article by providing for the essential elements and components of the right. General Recommendations and Comments can provide protection of rights not explicitly mentioned in the body of the treaties, thus broadening the scope of the application of the application of the Convention. For example, the CEDAW Committee in its General Recommendation No. 19 interpreted violence against women as a form of discrimination and therefore States Parties are bound to eliminate it based on their obligation under CEDAW. In using human rights treaty law, reference should always be made to the General Recommendations and Comments that form part of the treaty bodies\u2019 interpretation of the Convention and provide authoritative clarification on the scope and the meaning of provisions therein. \ufffdComplaints (or Communications) Procedure Among the key international human rights treaties, four have individual complaints procedures. Through these procedures,an individual may bring a complaint before the treaty body concerned claiming that she or he is a victim of a right guaranteed under the relevant treaty. Provision of an individual complaint mechanism is optional.For states to be bound by it, they must make open acceptance of it either by declaration (in the case of ICERD and CAT) or by ratification of a special optional protocol (in the case of ICCPR and CEDAW).The procedure is subsidiary in nature and thus, all domestic remedies must be exhausted before one can avail of these international procedures.Decisions by treaty bodies can provide states with a better understanding of their obligations under the treaty concerned. Although not entirely a court, the treaty body acts in a quasi-judicial authority as it makes a finding of compliance or non-compliance with the treaty concerned. Some treaties have inter-state complaint procedures. However, there has been no instance of any case filed under this procedure. \ufffdInquiry procedures CAT and CEDAW (through their optional protocols) have inquiry procedures. An inquiry procedure can be initiated by a treaty body when it receives reliable information of grave or systematic violations of the rights protected under the convention concerned. In an inquiry, the treaty body can decide to conduct a field visit in the country concerned with the consent of the State. The recommendations arising from the inquiry further highlight how the treaty should be applied and elaborates on the normative protection of the treaty. Other treaties It is important to note that there are also other treaties which can be used as a basis for advocacy work on access to justice. Thus, in addition to the human rights treaties mentioned earlier, there are other treaties that can also be used in advocacy work on access to justice.These include: \ufffdRome Statute of the International Criminal 47 Chapter 3: Normative Protection The Use of the Reporting Process by NGOs to Further the Rights of the Disadvantaged For the last 50 years, women\u2019s groups in Nepal have been working on equal inheritance rights for women. Among the many discriminatory provisions in the law, is the provision that for a daughter to inherit, she must be single and at least 35 years old. If she marries afterwards, the property has to be returned. No such restrictions are made on the son\u2019s right to inherit.

The CEDAW Committee in its Concluding Comments urged the Government to amend the present law. These Concluding Comments were used by NGOs as a basis to further strengthen their advocacy work before the Government on equal inheritance rights.

The UN Charter provides that all members of the UN pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in co-operation with the organization to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion. The Charter also created the Economic and Social Council to make recommendations for the purpose of observing human rights for all. In view of this, the Council set up the Commission on Human Rights and its sub-commission. These commissions issue resolutions and recommendations on various human rights issues. They have also established the system of the special rapporteurs and experts who issue a variety of recommendations on better observance of human rights based on information, research and country visits. Many bilateral treaties (treaties between two states usually regulating a specific matter) also provide human rights protection and enhance access to justice. For example, there are bilateral treaties governing migrant workers which provide a high degree of protection for the nationals of the sending country. Regional human rights systems Normative protection at a multilateral level can also be derived from regional human rights treaties. These regional systems provide another layer of protection in the regions concerned in cases where national protection is lacking or inefficient. In Europe, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) provides normative standards which are safeguarded by a European Court of Human Rights, which can act on both individual and inter-state complaints procedures. In the Americas, cases can be filed by individuals and states with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and Inter-American Court of Human Rights for breach of the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man or the American Convention on Human Rights. The African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019Rights is monitored by the African Commission on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights. In January 2004, an African Court of Human Rights came into existence. The existence of the regional courts and commissions is an additional mechanism enabling individuals to access justice after they have exhausted all possible domestic remedies at the national level.

However, applicability of the regional systems depends on ratification by a State within the respective region. Asia and the Pacific are now cited as the only regions without regional human rights systems. However, although there are no regional human rights mechanisms in Asia and the Pacific, it should be noted that the decisions of regional bodies are important sources of standards for the international community as a whole and are useful examples of the universality of human rights norms. See for example, the Velasquez Rodriguez17 Case and its elaboration on the obligations of the State to respect and ensure human rights. International Custom Customary international law is an important source of the international normative framework as it has the ability to bind States even without express consent as required for the conclusion of international treaties. Traditionally, customary international law has complemented or even modified rights and obligations flowing from treaty law and vice-versa. It plays a particularly important role in instances in which States have not ratified binding human rights instruments and thereby ensures the universal applicability of international human rights standards 48 Programming for Justice: Access for All 17 Vel\u00e1squez-Rodriguez v.Honduras,Inter-American Court of Human Rights,Judgment of July 29,1988,Judgment of July 29,1988,Inter-Am.Ct.H.R. (Ser.C) No.4 (1988).Available at http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/b_11_12d.htm This case documents numerous disappearances in Honduras from 1981 to 1984.This case also illustrates the development of a major human right case in the courts and the difficulties associated with it and the role that an international court can play when access to domestic remedies is precluded. For a rule to evolve into a norm of customary international law, it has to fulfil very stringent requirements i.e. meet the following two requirements: (1) a general practice of states and (2) as the conviction that this practice is required under the international normative framework. The first element requires a sufficient number of states must pursue conduct in a general and consistent manner. The second element, which involves a certain degree of tautology (also referred as opinio juris), means that a \u201cState regards a particular customary rule as a norm of international law, as a rule legally binding on the international plane.\u201d 18 In other words, States follow the rule because of a sense of legal obligation. The relationship between customary international law and the national normative framework follows the same pattern as described above with regard to international treaties: depending on the mechanism adopted (in the Constitution), customary norms may either be directly applicable (as part of the national legal system), or require an (legislative) act of \u201cintroduction\u201d into the national legal system. However, frequently, there is no easy way to measure whether a standard has reached the status of an international custom, or whether it is accepted by states especially in view of their resistance to become legally obliged to follow a certain conduct. In the absence of an international \u201clegislator\u201d, States frequently consider different rules as having evolved into customary international law. However, the following norms have generally and firmly been recognized as having attained the (binding) status of customary international: \ufffdProhibition of genocide \ufffdAbolition of slavery and the slave trade \ufffdThe murder or causing the disappearance of individuals \ufffdTorture and other cruel,inhuman or degrading treatment \ufffdProlonged arbitrary detention \ufffdSystematic racial discrimination \ufffdSystematic religious discrimination \ufffdGender discrimination \ufffdConsistent pattern of gross violations of human rights Thus, even in the absence of treaties, states are bound to observe these customary norms, and individuals as well as courts may rely on customary provisions provided that they are directly applicable or have been properly \u201cintroduced\u201d into the national normative framework. Most recently, customary international law has evolved to extend to holding perpetrators of international crimes \u2013 such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes - directly accountable.19In the cases of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, both States and the individuals who perpetrated genocide cannot hide behind the curtain of non- ratification of relevant treaties.

In relation to normative protection, jus cogens embodies a supreme norm which guarantees the most urgent human rights protection.

Declarations, resolutions, principles and guidelines General norms of international law and practices are often stated in declarations, standards, rules, guidelines,recommendations and principles.While they are often dismissed as having no binding legal effect on states, and therefore being \u201csoft law\u201d, they are documents that represent broad consensus by states and therefore they have a strong moral and persuasive force. Therefore, their value as such must be recognized. In some instances, a declaration is the initial steps towards the drafting of treaty. For example, the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was a stepping stone towards the eventual drafting of CEDAW. Further, declarations themselves can become customary international law and therefore,binding on states even without their express acquiescence. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, for example, though not a binding treaty has provisions which are now considered as customary international law and therefore binding on states. In terms of access to justice, the following \u201csoft laws\u201dprovide some guidance in the administration of justice: \ufffdBasic principles on the Independence of the Judiciary \ufffdBasic principles on the Role of Lawyers \ufffdGuidelines on the Role of Prosecutors \ufffdUnited Nations Standard Minimum Rules for Non-Custodial Measures (The Tokyo Rules) \ufffdUnited Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the administration of Juvenile Justice (The Beijing Rules) Recommendations on Using International Law at the National Level International standards are not solely for use at the international level \u2013 in fact, the international normative framework is increasingly addressing the individual within the national sphere. International law also has many potential uses at the domestic level to ensure normative protection is provided in its fullest. There are many different ways of using international laws. Therefore, practitioners and advocacy groups should exercise creativity in exploring opportunities and possibilities. In countries where international law form part of national law In some countries, treaties ratified by the State form part of the national law and may override conflicting national laws. Their exact placement in the hierarchy of national laws may vary from being superior to the Constitution, to having constitutional status or being superior or equal to national laws.They can also be used to declare laws and administrative practices as inconsistent or in breach of the treaty\u2019s provisions. The extent of which this can be done depends on the treaty\u2019s status and the existing rules of interpretations of statutes in the countries concerned.

The first line of advocacy in such cases is to work towards the incorporation or transformation of the treaty. This has been done, for example in Hong Kong, where the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance of 1991 was a direct enactment into domestic law of the ICCPR. However, even in cases when international human rights treaties have not been incorporated into the domestic legal framework they can on occasions still be used to support arguments in domestic courts. Some potential uses of international treaties in countries where they have not been transformed or incorporated include: \ufffdAs a source of standards 50 Programming for Justice: Access for All 23 Reena Bajracharya v HMG,Writ No.2812 of 1999,Supreme Court of Nepal 24 Forum for Women,Law and Development,Baseline Study on Inheritance Rights of Women.August 2001 (unpublished paper),pg.42 Where there are no laws or where the laws are deficient,international law can fill in the lacunae by providing standards. These standards in many cases are the results of global consensus or the work of experts, such as UN treaty bodies. For example, in the case of Vishaka vs. State of Rajasthan (India), a group of women\u2019s NGOs brought a petition before the Supreme Court of India to address the pervasive problem of sexual harassment as there were no laws protecting them from this in India. The NGOs relied on India\u2019s constitutional provisions on equality, CEDAW and CEDAW General Recommendation No. 19 on Violence against Women. The court ruled that by ratifying CEDAW and by making official commitments to the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women, India had endorsed women\u2019s human rights and thus, must undertake to protect women from sexual harassment as part of its stated commitments to gender equality. The court prepared guidelines to define sexual harassment and called on the State to regulate to actions of private and public employers.The court\u2019s definition in the guidelines closely follows that of CEDAW General Recommendation 19.25 \ufffdAs a tool for interpreting the Constitution and national laws If an issue of uncertainty arises, a judge may seek guidance in the general principles of international law, as accepted by the community of nations.26 In the same case of Vishaka, the Court decided that CEDAW should be used to elaborate further and give meaning to the Constitutional guarantees. It stated that international covenants can be used by the Courts to interpret national laws.27 \ufffdAs a catalyst for changing discriminatory laws and standards In the case of Mabo v State of Queensland, the Australian High Court used international law to condemn discrimination against indigenous people, even if international treaties are not directly applicable in Australia. The Court argued that discriminatory doctrine that denies recognition of the rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants can no longer be upheld. It stated that such a discriminatory doctrine demands reconsideration: \u201cthe opening up of international remedies to individuals pursuant to Australia\u2019s accession to the Optional Protocol to the ICCPR brings to bear on the common law the powerful influence of the Covenant and the international standards it imports\u201d.The Court stated that it was \u201ccontrary both to international standards and to the fundamental values of common law to entrench a discriminatory rule which, because of the supposed position on the scale of social organization of the indigenous inhabitants of a settled colony, denies them a right to occupy their traditional land\u201d.28 \ufffdAs a guide for policy and rule-making International instruments are useful in identifying what factors should be taken into account in policy making. CEDAW, for example, was specifically mentioned as one of the guiding principles of the 28 April 2001 draft of the National Policy for the Development and Empowerment of Women in India.29 In some cases, even treaties not applicable in a given State (for a lack of ratification) and \u2018soft\u2019 standards have been used as a resource to help in implementing the Constitution and national laws and as a guide for rule and policy-making. Duality of Norms: Not all norms are good norms In working with norms, it is critical to note that not all norms are just and in conformity with human rights.

In Pakistan, a village council as a collective body ordered the rape of a woman as a punishment for her when her brother eloped with a woman of a higher status.31 The order, which was carried out, violated her right to be protected from violence, among others, and is a consequence of non-recognition of the right to choice in decisions concerning marriage, as well as sexual and reproductive rights. The case has been elevated to the criminal courts of Pakistan and is waiting a final resolution at the Supreme Court, especially after a lower court\u2019s decision to acquit members of the council for their decision. Many of these norms have been formulated without the participation of the disadvantaged groups. In some instances where members of disadvantaged groups have participated, they may not have sufficient understanding or power to negotiate their terms. For example: \ufffdIn many countries the participation of women in politics is extremely low compared to men, and can even be non-existent. \ufffdWith the caste system, the Dalits (or the untouchables) have systematically been discriminated and excluded from political and public life. \ufffdA certain tribe in Rajasthan has been considered \u201ccriminal\u201dand thus, they have been refused entry into the villages and its members are forced to live under trees without any basic support from the government.32 This duality in norms poses a considerable risk to disadvantaged groups.Norms that reflect access to justice and human rights must be upheld. Those that violate these principles must be modified or abolished. When working in normative protection, a critical eye is required. Every constitution, legislation, court decision and customary law must be measured against human rights standards. This is especially critical in dealing with customary laws and practices as cultural practices are often used as a justification for the non-application of human rights standards and thus, not only deny disadvantaged groups their human rights but also lead to impunity for those committing violations against them. 3.3 CHALLENGES IN ACHIEVING THE FULL BENEFITS OF NORMATIVE PROTECTION There are many obstacles to achieving the full benefits of normative protection. Barriers may be actively or passively created or sustained and may be (a) legal, (b) institutional, (c) political or (d) social/cultural. Legal barriers \ufffdBarriers in relation to international law. There are several barriers relating to international law including non-ratification of treaties; ratified treaties that are not incorporated into national law;and lack of knowledge on how to apply inter national law to the domestic legal and judicial framework. \ufffdGaps in the legal framework. Legal gaps in the protection of fundamental rights are commonplace and may be due to many factors, including: \ufffdNon-recognition of the rights (e.g., non- recognition of indigenous people\u2019s title over their ancestral lands) \ufffdOmission or refusal to provide protection (e.g., in some countries, there is refusal to legislate on marital rape) \ufffdConstitutional and legal discrimination.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bec672e9-5f2e-4be6-b182-924fc0e15bec": {"__data__": {"id_": "bec672e9-5f2e-4be6-b182-924fc0e15bec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2e288721e02d9069fd5784300254fbb6a7d977f2bb5783af37fc061d35d7197"}, "2": {"node_id": "3d7d4586-d83c-40a0-b6ae-13b0427a4c0b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b8ad13539f5c26a52f979e8ebc2e3723ef3655f92e2b9c0f2affa905b09d175"}}, "hash": "4fff52c6dc1de086d4200d5d2687a531074cccc07a636dc91fc99f5461ded84b", "text": "Laws can discriminate against disadvantaged groups either directly or indirectly, adding to their marginalization.

By not providing them with identity cards, they are unable to access basic needs such as food, shelter, education and health. They are also unable to vote or to access the courts to express their grievances. The lack of conceptual understanding on the need for specialized legislation to prevent discrimination is one of the main causes of indirect discrimination. At the formal legal text level, there may not be any discrimination against the disadvantaged groups. However,due to cultural or social attitudes towards the disadvantaged groups and the structural level of discrimination experienced by them, they may be unable to access and enjoy the benefits of a neutral legislation. Hence, specialized legislation is required and failure to provide such legislation can 52 Programming for Justice: Access for All 31 Case of Mukhtar Mai case in Pakistan,see,for example,The acquittal of five men convicted of gang rape throws doubt on Pakistan's criminal justice system at http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/em/fr/-/2/hi/south_asia/4315491.stm. 32 Interlinkages between Violence against Women and the Rights to Adequate Housing.(2004) Yamini,Rea Chiongson,Mary Jane real and Tomoko K. (eds) at 45 hereinafter Interlinkages. be an obstacle to accessing justice. For example, the right to run for public office is available to everyone. However, due to entrenched discrimination, those from disadvantaged groups are unable to run as candidates. If they do, they are unable to get elected. Although the law is neutral, as it does not provide measures to support and enable participation by these groups, and thus by not \u201clevelling the playing field\u201d, it indirectly discriminates against them. \ufffdLaws that contradict human rights standards. There are many examples of laws which simply contradict access to justice and human rights norms. In addition to those highlighted above other examples include: \ufffdDetention without trial for a lengthy period of time. \ufffdThe dropping of rape charges when the victim marries the accused. \ufffdAcceptance of evidence obtained illegally in a court of law. \ufffdNot providing people with mental disabilities with the proper health care and refusing standing in courts to redress their grievances. Institutional barriers Often, the institutional capacities required for drafting,reviewing,interpreting and implementing legislation are weak or lacking. \ufffdLack of conceptual clarity. In both legislation and case law-making, the lack of conceptual clarity on issues of discrimination pervades. Further, there is often little understanding of human rights norms, especially on complex and new issues in relation to international standards. Opportunities to create such under standing and conceptual clarity are also few. \ufffdLack of independence. Independence of the legislature and the judiciary creates an environment for participation and inclusion of disadvantaged groups as well as human rights-consistent laws and jurisprudence. The absence of such an environment not only transforms the legislature and the judiciary into rubber stamps, it also stifles their roles as mechanisms for the promotion and protection of access to justice norms and for redress of grievances (see also the Section on the Court System in Chapter 4). \ufffdWeak capacities to develop statutes and case law.Another barrier can be the lack of capacity in the technical aspects of developing law. Often difficulties in implementing laws can reflect defects in drafting.These derive not only from a scarcity of drafting and assessment skills,but also from a lack of clear guidelines governing drafting processes, overlapping drafting projects, non-review of the consistency of laws with the existing legal frameworks, or lack of detailed justification for the laws. \ufffdWeak capacities to apply international norms. In a similar way, judges rarely exercise their ability to create jurisprudence due to their weak capacity in developing creative arguments in favour of access to justice norms. Often, domestic judges are reluctant to apply international norms for they are simply not familiar with their content and thus uncomfortable in referring to them, though legally binding \u2013 need for training, particularly in post-conflict countries with a record of human rights violations. In many cases, capacities also entail developing administrative and managerial skills such as managing the pool of court personnel, reducing the backlog of court dockets, among others (see The Court system section in Chapter 4). \ufffdLack of channels for participation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6dec73c-48c6-4b20-9dfc-974d540de5d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6dec73c-48c6-4b20-9dfc-974d540de5d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "def02cc005d9f576c89b55eccc95818fd7d0d5e53acc5fd79f6bd328413fb50d"}, "2": {"node_id": "7af82073-261e-4dc3-8e66-9fc47efdecad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f80a1ff0dd644380afabf7a35dde7cc06464581053887d37fb9ce3028bb337c"}}, "hash": "d6a34b38ba9f8f103ae77339bb101676cbe28b24915343c2f77d1585e0d378c4", "text": "\ufffdLack of channels for participation.

Persistent lack of participation by disadvantaged groups in the process of making laws affecting them is a powerful barrier, underlying inefficient protection. Obstacles to participation may arise from the absence of adequate channels to bring disadvantaged people\u2019s voices into legal drafting processes \u2013 e.g., through public consultations, awareness campaigns, etc. These groups may also not have the necessary critical capacities for participation, such as organization, information and policy advocacy skills due to state omissions. Political barriers Understanding the political nature of reform is critical.Some obstacles reflect the unwillingness or refusal of the State to comply with access to justice and human rights standards. This is logical as normative reforms entails a shift in power relations and thus,in many cases,the status quo is sought to be preserved. For example, the development of a quota system or the reserving of seats to enable women to participate in parliament involves a shift in power in favour of women and has serious implications for those who are presently political power brokers. Reform leads to real benefits and redistribution of resources and power. It can also lead to the possibility of friction with special interest groups who are concerned to ensure they retain their positions in society. 53 Chapter 3: Normative Protection Even where there is no open political resistance, low priority may be given to access to justice and human rights programmes. This can also be a political barrier. This may be explicit or it may be masked by invoking other barriers, such as lack of resources, lack of capacity, lack of incorporation of international laws, etc. Social and cultural barriers \ufffdDiscriminatory social and cultural norms. The role of social and customary norms in discriminating against disadvantaged groups is well documented. Although customary practices can provide protection for vulnerable groups, they can also be a source of discrimination. The second-class status given to women in the social and customary norms of many societies is one such example. Other examples abound, especially in relation to violation of women\u2019s human rights through traditional, harmful practices, i.e., forced and early marriages, dowry, female genital mutilation, polygamy, to name a few. Many social and customary norms have permeated into the Constitution,legislation,rules and regulations,and jurisprudence. Further, discriminatory social and cultural norms define the roles and behaviour of women. The value given to a chaste woman, for example, has influenced legislation and jurisprudence in dismissing complaints of sexual violence by women who are not seen as being of good moral character. \ufffdSocietal attitudes towards disadvantaged groups. Disadvantaged groups are often viewed through the lens of stereotypes and false notions of hierarchy. For example, urban poor communities, especially poor women, may be refused positions on school boards as they are stereotyped as uneducated, dirty, immoral and with possible criminal tendencies.33 Also, despite huge efforts to change stereotypes of people with disabilities, they are still typically looked upon as being incompetent to make decisions and are most often the subject of guardianship and substituted decision-making. Their capacity to file complaints on their own is often challenged. Other barriers in relation to claiming rights \ufffdFailure of the State to increase the capacity of disadvantaged groups to understand and exercise their rights.Often,the State fails to raise the capacity of disadvantaged groups to ensure their full understanding of their rights. In many instances, the capacity of disadvantaged groups to claim their rights will depend on the following capacities that should be fostered by states: \ufffdAwareness of rights. \ufffdUnderstanding of the content and attributes of rights, including the principle of holding the State liable for acts of commission and omission. \ufffdKnowledge of the appropriate tools and methodology necessary to claim rights, including the channels for participation, venues for redress of grievance, etc. \ufffdUnderstanding of the process of making statutory and case law. \ufffdLack of environment to enable the exercise of rights. A supportive environment that encourages and enables the exercise and enjoyment of rights is crucial in developing normative protection. An environment of corruption,lack of respect for the rule of law, impunity and lack of accountability illegitimizes the legal framework and discourages engagement in it as a means of social transformation. 3.4 CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE NORMATIVE PROTECTION This section identifies potential strategies and areas of intervention to address critical obstacles or barriers in the normative framework preventing disadvantaged groups from full access to justice. Addressing Legal, Institutional and Political Barriers National normative frameworks can be strengthened by supporting (a) ratification and accession of international conventions, (b) incorporation of international human rights law treaties, and (c) harmonization of domestic legal frameworks with international obligations and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7662d3a-422d-47dd-994d-cacbadcc7700": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7662d3a-422d-47dd-994d-cacbadcc7700", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a11f816d2d94666df3665f74908ff5b5dd084a675bf77ce15d43c34c28bf605"}}, "hash": "3a11f816d2d94666df3665f74908ff5b5dd084a675bf77ce15d43c34c28bf605", "text": "commitments. Ratification and Accession Strategies. \ufffdInformation on Treaty Obligations Create an understanding of the treaty and its usefulness in promoting, protecting and fulfilling human rights as well as its capacity to provide access to justice remedies at a supplemental level to domestic remedies. \ufffdDevelop Strategic Partnerships and Advocacy Campaigns Strategic advocacy campaigns targeting public officials, especially those involved with treaty ratification. This primarily involves the Foreign Ministry with the other ministries being part of a task force or team, e.g., the Justice Ministry, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Law Ministry and the Ministry on Social Development. This also entails 54 Programming for Justice: Access for All 33 Interlinkages at 44 that lobbying strategies are employed within the country and outside, especially in international meetings and conferences. Strengthening strategic partnerships with NGOs and universities, both within the country and outside. They are a rich source of information and resource persons on the impact of lack of ratification. Hold consultations and discussions to elicit views on ratification, especially from disadvantaged groups. Collect comparative information on the benefits of ratification from other states. Public awareness campaigns and the distribution of campaign materials can accelerate a country\u2019s willingness to sign up and later ratify an international treaty. Influencing the media and bringing them in as allies is also critical. Incorporation of human rights treaties and harmonization of national laws \ufffdExamine the Normative Framework Identify inconsistencies in the normative framework and provide recommendations on ways to make it consistent with the treaty provisions. \ufffdAdvocacy for Reform Lobby the legislature for the enactment of new legislation and the review of existing laws. Advocacy conducted on the appropriate ministries and agencies of the State can ensure their support of legal reform and their development of appropriate rules and regulations. Programmes of public dissemination and legal awareness and training must be launched in order to expose relevant state actors and institutions to the substantive and procedural aspects of emerging legislation.This is important so that legal reforms may enjoy widespread legitimacy. It is important to ensure local/national ownership, i.e., develop the technical understanding of local population and government officials in order to ensure that the relevant stakeholders are able, capable and willing to sustain the reforms instituted.33 Consultations and discussions also need to be held with disadvantaged groups to ensure that their views are taken into consideration and given weight. \ufffdSupport Engagement with International Law and Reporting Processes Engagement with international law and international processes should be facilitated (e.g., the CEDAW reporting process which can increase awareness of women\u2019s human rights and open up opportunities for advocacy and reform). Support can be provided for the preparation for the reporting process, i.e., the drafting of the State Party report, inter-governmental consultations on their compliance with the Convention, meetings with NGOs and government, the participation of government in the treaty body session for the reporting. Drafting of the NGO shadow reports and their participation in the treaty bodies\u2019 sessions to observe the governments reporting should also be encouraged. Also, resources and support for activities to be undertaken as a follow up to the reporting process should be provided. Support work on raising awareness of the international complaints and inquiry procedures by identifying (through collaboration with disadvantage groups) situations which can be dealt with through international complaints and inquiry procedures and discuss the pros and cons of bringing it to the international level. Distributing materials to enhance understanding of disadvantage groups of such international procedures can also help the process. Additionally advocacy efforts can be made to encourage the State to ratify instruments or submit declarations that enable the use of such instruments. Training of lawyers on international the complaints and inquiry procedures of treaties can support the process. As can providing ways for human rights advocates and members of disadvantaged groups to advocate for the ratification of such instruments. \ufffdEnsure Conceptual Clarity Engage with the latest developments on international law in the area concerned. This can include ensuring conceptual clarity and 55 Chapter 3: Normative Protection 33 See F\u00e1undez,pg 388.

For example, training can be provided for NGOs to increase their conceptual understanding of access to justice. Trainings and education programmes for national and local legislators, judges and administrators of ministries to increase understanding of access to justice, human rights and the key concepts on discrimination, equality, and accountability is critical. Strategic work with universities, especially law universities, is important in changing legal biases towards legally inherited and unchallenged notions of justice,human rights,equality and other principles. \ufffdSupport Reform of the Constitution Support the development of new constitutions, or the review of existing constitutions to reflect changing realities and provide recognition to vulnerable groups such as indigenous peoples or minorities.34 For example, rights and remedies for disadvantaged groups can be reflected in constitutional texts in the form of definition of fundamental rights or liberties (e.g., Constitutions of India, Hong Kong and Singapore), Bill of Rights, or with explicit reference to recognition of rights contained in core human rights treaties. \ufffdMonitor Laws and Their Impact New challenges and rapidly changing environments make it necessary to monitor the impact of laws on disadvantaged people and how legal frameworks can help them. For example, in the context of globalization, market-friendly legislation is not necessarily pro-poor, and has limitations in addressing the major concerns of vulnerable groups \u2013 such as illegal arrest and detention, violence against women or protection of ancestral domains. Within the specific framework of access to justice,legal reforms should therefore be oriented towards protecting the fundamental rights of disadvantaged people, as necessary guarantees to prevent and overcome human poverty and empower their participation in decision-making. Monitoring and reviewing should be undertaken constantly as who is disadvantaged varies over time, and new categories of disadvantaged people may arise. It is critical to take stock of legal legacies when monitoring and to ensure that they are not blindly adhered to. \ufffdPromote Review of Existing Legislation Promote and assist in the development of new laws, review or abolish existing legislation to further protect the rights of specific vulnerable groups. Ensure the participation of disadvantage groups in legislative reform. Such participation should extend beyond the narrow structures of government and reach down to community-level participation. Provide necessary technical expertise on for the reform process. Preference should be for local and internal experts. Consultants or experts from foreign legal systems have a supporting role to play in this process,but they are not a replacement for national capacities. Ensure that all aspects of implementation and enforcement are considered. It is critical to ensure preparation of \u201cgood\u201d laws that take into account cohesiveness, coherency and harmony in legal system so as to minimize dysfunction and contradictions that may be used as a basis of non-implementation of the law. This also requires ensuring that programmes that support the legislation must be planned even prior to the passage of the law, e.g., preparing subordinate legislation, allocating institutional resources, ensuring community awareness, and establishing clear accountability and reporting systems. Strengthen the capacities of disadvantaged groups to evaluate pending bills, assess the social impact of legislation already enacted, and provide inputs to the formulation of relevant legislation (see also discussion on strategies to promote participation of disadvantaged groups). \ufffdDevelop and Monitor Rules and Regulations When intervening at this level, it is important to conduct a careful assessment of ministerial capacities and motivations, identify competent ministerial expertise, associate legal academics when feasible and devise continuous mechanisms for consultation and participatory processes,which are essential to develop coherent and effective rules and regulations (for specific operating regulations of courts, police and prisons, see capacity to provide remedy section in Chapter 4). It is also critical to regularly monitor rules and regulations and to assess their impact. \ufffdDevelop Progressive Judicial Decisions Capacity building to develop progressive human rights jurisprudence. This may involve 56 Programming for Justice: Access for All 34 For instance,the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Human Rights in Cambodia in his report to the Commission on Human Rights of 18 February 1998 urged the Government of Cambodia to recognize officially the presence and citizenship of the Highland peoples,as well as their use of land,forests and other natural resources.The 1999 Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia only recognizes as citizens the Khmer,which are the largest ethnic group in Cambodia,ignoring the highland peoples,Khmer Loeu and the montagnards which represent 1% of the population. interpreting the law vis \u00e0 vis international and constitutional principles and is important to expand normative protection.

It is critical for judges to deepen their understanding of other critical issues such as the interfaces between formal and informal justice institutions, justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights, equality, and non-discrimination; that may lead to increased access to justice by disadvantaged groups. A key component to developing progressive jurisprudence is the provision of training for lawyers on how to use progressive human rights standards and international law in their arguments before the court. Providing support for public interest litigation cases, especially in the area of technical assistance is important. So too is building partnerships with legal NGOs especially those involved in public interest litigation. Compilation of progressive local jurisprudence as well as from other jurisdictions can serve as a model for legal argumentation in one\u2019s own country. \ufffdCapacity Development for National and Local Legislators. Training in legal drafting should include not only drafting techniques, but also building capacity on the development of legislation, analytical skills in assessing foreign and comparative law, social science research techniques and statistical methodologies, and inclusive processes to enable participation, among others. Capacity development strategies to enhance the capacities of incoming or incumbent legal and judicial professionals may also include introducing specific legal subjects in relevant universities (such as comparative law methodologies, international law and customary law) as well as subjects on ethics and non-discrimination. Support can also be provided for the establishment of specialised professional schools (e.g., National Centres for Training Lawyers, judicial academies or training schools) or specific programmes within schools (e.g., gender and legal awareness) or continuous (or refreshing) legal education programmes. \ufffdBuild on Customary and Traditional Law Monitor whether customary and informal laws restrict or widen opportunities for access to justice. Assess whether customary or informal laws comply with human rights standards and are inclusive of disadvantage groups. Identify customary laws that discriminate against disadvantaged groups or are in violation of human rights standards. Conduct public awareness campaigns to create the understanding of human rights standards and why there is a need to modify or abolish customary laws that are discriminatory or violative of human rights. Increase access to justice through interfaces between formal and traditional systems by providing constitutional or legislative provisions. See examples in the earlier discussion on customary laws. \ufffdSupport Institutional Capacity Building Support institutional capacity development on a wide range of processes including knowledge development and skills transfer, change bureaucratic cultures through advocacy efforts and exposure to best practices and strengthen internal accountability mechanisms \u2013 a necessary pillar of institutional development, and attitudinal change. Support legal reform processes that improve existing institutions or create new institutions to ensure accountability (i.e. Ombudsman, Human Rights Commissions, judicial oversight/watchdogs such as councils of magistrates, legal aid systems, women\u2019s commissions, equality commissions). \ufffdEncourage Judicial Independence and Diverse Representation Within the Judicial Branch Work towards the development of clear provisions on non-partisan appointments, judges\u2019 conditions of tenure, removal or dismissal of judges and regular state budgetary allocations. Ensure that the judicial branch has the tools to operate independently and apply the law. Advocate for diverse representation within the judiciary, i.e. in terms of hiring judges from various sectors of society (e.g., women, minorities) Addressing social and cultural barriers \ufffdGather and Disseminate Information on Discriminatory Practices Research and document the discriminatory impact of compiling with cultural and social norms that discriminate against disadvantaged groups and are in violation of access to justice and human rights standards. 57 Chapter 3: Normative Protection Use public information campaigns to encourage behavioural changes. Legal awareness campaigns at different levels can stimulate debate for normative changes and support for advocacy campaigns. Address changing stereotypes through evaluation and reform of school curricula and textbooks. Work with educators and trainers to ensure that stereotypes against disadvantaged groups are corrected. Work with the media to sensitize them and to use them to create broader sensitisation. \ufffdChallenge Discriminatory Provisions Support the challenging of discriminatory provisions in courts and human rights tribunals. Care should be taken to ensure that proper preparatory work has been initiated to build an environment that will be able to accept the decision of the court. Work with progressive customary and religious leaders to enable the modification and abolition of incompatible norms.

For example, by raising the awareness of the providers of justice of the needs of disadvantaged groups. \ufffdEncourage Focus on Disadvantaged Groups Poor people\u2019s survival often depends on certain behaviours (e.g., street vendors, squatters, immigrants, etc.) that are discouraged by the legal system,but dictated by social and economic needs. The mismatch between the reality of the poor and the legal prescriptions affecting them is created and reinforced by the invisibility of disadvantaged groups in legislative processes. Promote the participation of disadvantaged groups in the political debate. Truly participatory processes require time and are a necessary condition to generating a socio-political debate and understanding on issues in many areas,but they may also be used by governments as delaying tactics. Strengthen and enhance effective legislators- constituent relationships with a special focus on disadvantaged communities. By enhancing people\u2019s connection with their representatives, \u201creal life\u201d experiences can influence the development of new legislation. Support initiatives to increase the participation of disadvantage groups in the legislature through different systems such as setting aside specific seats, (e.g., Uganda), quotas for political parties running for parliamentary elections (e.g., Argentina) and the creation of temporary measures to accelerate de facto equality. Support formal or informal processes which allow for regular exchanges between legislators and the community (facilitating participation of disadvantaged groups) including public hearings, informal town hall meetings (or open meetings), and public interest forums to generate public awareness and debate. Support formal or informal processes for exchanges with legislative officers and staff. In understanding the challenges faced by disadvantaged groups in existing legislation, legal assistants may be better equipped to advise legislators on concrete legal measures or pieces of legislation to improve issues related to disadvantaged groups. In addition, disadvantaged groups will be provided with a wider network to advocate their rights. Build strategic partnerships with NGOs and community-based organizations to develop the capacities of others. Create an enabling environment for the exercise of access to justice, including supporting work against corruption, impunity and the lack of respect for the rule of law. 58 Programming for Justice: Access for All Participation and Political Will Participation and political will are two key elements to advance critical changes in the normative framework.As in any legal reform process, adequate understanding of the local context and of the potential focus of resistance may well be critical factors for success. Legal vacuums and discrimination in the recognition of the rights of disadvantaged groups are not coincidental legal gaps. They reflect the type of social processes involved behind the creation of the law itself.Even if laws are written in response to inputs and feedback rather than in response to particular interests, the critical factor is who are those in the position of providing such inputs, and who are left voiceless. 4 CAPACITY TO PROVIDE JUSTICE REMEDIES C H A P T E R Overview of the Chapter 4.1 The Ministry of Justice 4.2 The Court System 4.2.1 The Courts 4.2.2 Prosecutors 4.3 Informal Justice Systems 4.3.1 Alternative Dispute Resolution 4.3.2 Traditional and Indigenous Justice Systems 4.4 Oversight 4.4.1 National Human Rights Institutions 4.4.2 Civil Society Oversight 4.4.3 Parliamentary Oversight 4.5 Enforcement 4.5.1 Police 4.5.2 Prisons CHAPTER 4 OVERVIEW OF CHAPTER This chapter deals with the capacities required by duty bearers or institutions of the justice system to provide a remedy for grievances through formal and informal mechanisms in accordance with human rights principles and standards. In line with the rights-based approach, the chapter discusses how to support the justice system so as to ensure it works for those who are poor and disadvantaged. As explained in previous chapters, justice systems include formal institutions and procedures, such as the judiciary, public defence and prosecution. However, from an access to justice perspective, a number of other actors also play a critical role. In the Asia-Pacific region, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms and traditional justice systems often deal with the bulk of cases, especially for disadvantaged groups, and therefore, cannot be overlooked. Ministries of Justice are often responsible for the policies and procedures that affect the management and administration of the national justice system. Quasi-judicial institutions, such as National Human Rights Institutions and Ombudsman offices complement the Courts and undertake oversight, advocacy and investigative functions.In addition, the important role of civil society and parliamentary oversight must be taken into", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4188090b-eb9b-4890-ad03-e7995e5824aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4188090b-eb9b-4890-ad03-e7995e5824aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "800dbc2f0376dfaa210c94bb304c24ea2cfd693dfc005cb5509f2ca8609161b3"}}, "hash": "800dbc2f0376dfaa210c94bb304c24ea2cfd693dfc005cb5509f2ca8609161b3", "text": "account,as they can play a critical role in strengthening institutional accountability for the provision of remedies.

The chapter is divided into five sections: \ufffd Ministries of Justice as the policy setting institutions for the justice system \ufffd The court system and prosecutors \ufffd Alternatives to formal justice \ufffd Oversight mechanisms, and \ufffd Enforcement mechanisms Given the magnitude of the task to reform the performance of a justice system, this Guide offers a number of different entry points and strategies for capacity development to address the obstacles often faced by justice institutions.The aim is to enable the system to become more responsive to the expectations and needs of claim holders by improving access to justice.The extent of how strategic such interventions will be,or how much impact they will have, will depend on the careful analysis and assessment of the context as per the rights-based approach to programming. Some suggestions on how such analysis should be undertaken is provided in Chapter 2 of this Guide. 4.1 The Ministry of Justice 4.1 The Ministry of Justice Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 63 63 63 4.1 THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE This section discusses capacity development strategies that may improve the Ministry of Justice\u2019s capacity as a duty bearer and, in turn, improve access to justice by disadvantaged groups. The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) is responsible for the administration of justice and for ensuring that the justice system is effective, fair and accessible. The Ministry of Justice plays an important role in strengthening normative protection, as well as implementing and enforcing justice. The Ministry is a service provider dispensing information and services to other governments departments, legal professionals and the population at large. Therefore, it is important that the Ministry ensures that these services are sensitive to the needs of disadvantaged groups. While the tasks of the Ministry of Justice may differ from country to country, in general the Ministry is responsible for: \ufffdPolicies and procedures that affect the management and administration of the national justice system, i.e., to ensure that the justice system functions effectively and efficiently in the country; \ufffdAdvising Parliament on legal policy and constitutional matters; \ufffdDrafting of bills and laws for the Government; \ufffdReviewing laws and recommending modification based on the Constitution and international standards and treaty obligations; \ufffdReviewing and presenting legislation to the Parliament; \ufffdManaging legal aid schemes and programmes; \ufffdRepresenting the public interest in all its dealings, including litigation; \ufffdRepresenting the Government in legal matters and in government litigation; \ufffdEnsuring principles of justice, equity and fundamental fairness when representing the public interest. In some cases,the Judiciary,the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Department, the Department of Prisons/ Corrections, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Law Commission, Mediation Boards, Anti-Corruption Commission, Judicial/Legal Training, etc. all fall under the Ministry of Justice.The Ministry may also represent the State in international legal disputes, as well as civil cases against the Government, and facilitate international efforts in the justice sector.1 The Ministry is normally headed by a minister who is either an elected representative of the people or appointed as minister by the President or Prime Minister. The minister is supported by a vice or deputy minister.The administration of the Ministry is in the hands of a Secretary who is supported by a number of deputies, assistants, and a full complement of staff. Role of the Ministry of Justice in Strengthening Access to Justice The Ministry of Justice plays an important role in maintaining the standards of the justice system throughout the country. While representing the public interest, the Ministry should endeavour to ensure that the interests of justice are served. It should include access to justice for the disadvantaged as a core standard for the justice system. The Ministry of Justice can be instrumental in drafting laws that protect and promote the rights of disadvantaged groups, and in advising the Government to put in place normative frameworks for the protection of disadvantaged groups. It can set policies and establish procedures for the justice system to ensure access to justice. It can also help in creating strategic plans to strengthen judicial institutions and to encourage them to focus on improving access for all. At a local level, dissemination of legal information to increase the awareness of people about their 1 In some cases,the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes the lead in representing the State in international disputes and the Ministry of Justice may be consulted in the process.In the case", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b95f94bd-573b-4e08-bcad-c77b3cebaac1": {"__data__": {"id_": "b95f94bd-573b-4e08-bcad-c77b3cebaac1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb82bf567086473f44db8028d0795befc3a03b7792654005a6dd6880f99c4f58"}}, "hash": "cb82bf567086473f44db8028d0795befc3a03b7792654005a6dd6880f99c4f58", "text": "where there is no legal department within the Foreign Ministry,the Ministry of Justice takes the lead. The Role of the Ministry of Justice in Sri Lanka In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is part of the executive branch. Although infrastructure, such as court buildings and judges\u2019 houses, are the responsibility of the MoJ, the administration of justice in Sri Lanka comes under a separate Judicial Services Commission headed by the Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. Although UNDP works with the Legal Aid Commission (under the MoJ) , which is mandated to provide legal assistance to economically disadvantaged persons, the primary partner in strengthening access to justice through the judiciary is the Judicial Services Commission. As the Sri Lanka case points out, the tasks of the MoJ are context specific and it is necessary to understand the particular responsibilities of the MoJ in the country in order to find ways to work with it. UNDP Sri Lanka their rights, providing legal aid for those who can\u2019t afford it, and ensuring access to mediation as an alternative to lengthy and costly court processes are some ways that the Ministry of Justice can improve the ability of people to access justice (also see Chapter 5 and the Informal Justice Systems section in this chapter). Challenges Faced by the Ministry of Justice in Ensuring Access to Justice Inadequate capacity of staff The Ministry of Justice faces many of the same problems other government departments and ministries often face,including under/over-staffing, inadequate pay and structural deficiencies.Specific problems can include: \ufffdInsufficient capacity of officers to understand new processes. Some lack the capacity to respond positively and promptly to requests for information or services by disadvantaged groups. \ufffdLow morale due to low pay and poor working conditions. Officers may have low morale making it difficult to get them to do anything extra for disadvantaged groups or in new areas. \ufffdLack of expertise. Staff may not have the necessarry skills to conduct the work of the Ministry, such as legal drafting. \ufffdCorruption. Corruption can hinder the work of the Ministry in providing justice as this can limit the access of the poor and disadvantaged because of their inability to pay bribes. Lack of awareness of access to justice principles and the rights-based approach The capacity of staff may also be limited in terms of understanding access to justice related issues. For example: \ufffdLack of attention to disadvantaged groups. Ministry lawyers may not be focused on improving access to justice to disadvantaged groups. \ufffdLack of awareness of the rights-based approach. Officers at the Ministry may be unaware of human rights-based approaches or that they have a role to play in increasing access to justice for all. \ufffdInadequate prioritization of access to justice issues. If justice issues are not prioritized by the Government, the Ministry may get inadequate funding, making it difficult to train staff in new areas. Insufficient infrastructure The Ministry of Justice also needs adequate funding so that it can operate and maintain court facilities and judicial offices at national and local levels and introduce new technologies that can expedite court processes. Increasing the presence of court facilities and judicial offices (including mediation services) at the local level can facilitate access to court services for disadvantaged groups (especially those who live in remote areas). Insufficient legal dissemination The Ministry of Justice may be responsible for legal dissemination and ensuring adequate access to legal information. It is important to ensure that efforts are made to make legal information easier to access, so that people (especially from disadvantaged groups) are able to use the information produced by the Ministry. UNDP programme officers should make sure that these communication projects focus on providing information and awareness and are not used as a tool for government propaganda. Inadequate political support For the Ministry of Justice to fulfil its role in improving access to justice it is necessary to gain political support from a variety of different areas, including government and civil society, as well as from within the Ministry itself. Some obstacles to building support could include: \ufffdResistance to change by bureaucratic officials. Some officials may resist changes in the way they work and may be reluctant to promote the inclusion and participation of disadvantaged groups in their programmes. 64 Programming for Justice: Access for All Legal Aid and the Ministry of Justice In many countries, legal aid services are also handled by the MoJ. In Viet Nam, for example, UNDP has been involved for the past 10 years in assisting the MoJ in law education and legal dissemination at the local level \u2013 including for those living in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bdafae3-6b82-4d4d-80bf-f5a416957f5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bdafae3-6b82-4d4d-80bf-f5a416957f5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66e53352b7fb3d6e0dec272b43f7694c2558eb4d16588e22b9ab2f7975d49e2b"}}, "hash": "66e53352b7fb3d6e0dec272b43f7694c2558eb4d16588e22b9ab2f7975d49e2b", "text": "rural and mountain areas. These legal awareness campaigns provide people with basic legal information that can have an impact on their daily lives. More recently, UNDP Viet Nam has been working with the MoJ in assessing the seven-year implementation of the legal aid service in order to determine areas for future intervention and development.It is also assisting in the drafting of the first \u2018Ordinance on Legal Aid\u2019. Support for mediation groups and local justice officials is also being provided so that they can fulfil their role in enhancing access to justice at the grassroots level. UNDP Viet Nam It is important to secure top-level support for reform and address any institutional culture that may perpetuate resistance to change. \ufffdPolitical rivalry. Rivalries between different ministries can be detrimental to the work of the Ministry of Justice. Activities may be blocked,progress may be hindered,or projects may behalted for political reasons. \ufffdLack of coordination between different government branches. The coordination between different branches of the Government is crucial when addressing access to justice issues. Lack of coordination between the Ministry of Justice and other governmental agencies (e.g., the Home Ministry or the Ministry of Women and Social Affairs, etc.) can causes delays and duplications, which pose serious obstacles to achieving reform. \ufffd Lack of budgetary support. Lack of political support often translates into inadequate funding. This can severely limit the number, type and quality of the activities that can be conducted by the Ministry. Capacity Development Strategies for the Ministry of Justice to Enhance Access to Justice2 Build justice values The most important task of the Ministry of Justice is to build values - including access to justice and human rights \u2013 into all aspects of its work. This means building and reinforcing the internal commitment of Ministry staff and management to human rights, as well as creating a sense of entitlement to justice among the people, i.e., improving their capacity to demand justice. In order to achieve this,the Ministry of Justice should: \ufffdScrutinize government activities. The Ministry can play a role in monitoring the activities of the Government to ensure the principles of human rights and access to justice are adhered to. A Minister of Justice must ask justice questions as routinely as the Minister of Finance asks, \u201cDo we have a budget for this?\u201d The Justice Minister should ask, \u201cIs this the most \u2018just\u2018 decision?\u201d Such simple questions need to become a regular part of cabinet deliberations as well. \ufffdAct as a government watchdog. The Ministry of Justice should work with other Ministries and hold them accountable in terms of the justice and human rights dimensions in their work.Ministry of Justice officials should ensure that justice values are adequately protected in all government programmes.This includes not just asking, \u201cIs this programme/policy legal?\u201d But also,\u201cIs there access to justice?\u201d, \u201cHow will this affect women, minorities and other disadvantaged groups?\u201d, and \u201cWill justice and the public interest be served if this course of action is taken?\u201d \ufffdImproving justice values within the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice also needs to be the promoter of justice values in its own activities. For example, the Ministry should ensure that its programmes in legal aid, juvenile justice, witness protection, etc., incorporate and promote justice values. This will help to build an awareness of rights and a sense of entitlement among citizens and create the synergies that build justice values. 65 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Encouraging the MoJ to Develop a Strategy for the Legal Sector In 2003, UNDP Lao PDR undertook an evaluation of the legal sector in Lao PDR (Legal Sector Outcome Evaluation), which assessed the challenges and capacity gaps facing the justice sector. As a result, UNDP formulated a strategic programme of assistance for the legal sector. The centrepiece of the programme was the development of a legal sector strategy led by the Ministry of Justice. To motivate the Ministry and overcome resistance from the Government, a study tour to Viet Nam was organized to learn about similar undertakings in a neighbouring country. In early 2002, the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice approached UNDP Viet Nam to request technical assistance in carrying out a comprehensive legal needs assessment. Lessons could be extracted from Viet Nam\u2019s experience and applied to the Laos PDR context. In addition to the study tour, a visit from the UNDP Viet Nam CO to Lao PDR (to share the lessons learned from the Viet Nam study) and several consultations were held over the year, which also encouraged the Ministry of Justice to be more supportive of the project.

If there is undue interference by the MoJ with the actual justice process, the independence of the judiciary can be seen to be compromised. For example, the MoJ may have vested interests in seeing legislation interpreted a certain way and may be able to exert inappropriate influence over the judiciary. Putting the judiciary under the authority of the highest court of the land rather than the MoJ is a means to safeguard judicial independence. As a result, there is often tension (especially in civil law countries) between the MoJ and the highest court of the land or the Supreme Council of Magistracy regarding the role and the influence of the MoJ over the judiciary. 2 The strategies in this section apply to the officers and workers of the Ministry of Justice only,not its other specialized departments.Specific strategies need to be developed for other specialized services such as the police,prisons,public prosecutors departments and others.These services are addressed later in the chapter.For training materials see the OHCHR website which includes handbooks and manuals on human rights for judges, prosecutors,lawyers,police,and prisons officials.[http://www.ohchr.org/english/about/publications/training.htm]. Improve the capacity of ministry staff \ufffdTraining in rights-based approaches and access to justice. Ministry officials should be given basic training on rights-based approaches which take into consideration their role as duty bearers who are expected to provide information and services to people. Training should include how to talk, listen, and respond to people, especially those who are disadvantaged. Anti-corruption training (e.g., ethics) should also be provided. \ufffdIncrease staff motivation. Motivation is extremely important for the success of capacity development strategies. Study tours to enable staff to learn from and replicate best practices of other countries can be useful. In addition, motivational retreats,workshops and seminars can be conducted. Peer reviews and cross- training with officers from other countries can also help maintain high levels of motivation. \ufffdUse IT to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of staff. New technologies can assist ministry officials in case management. For example, computerization of court offices can help in tracking court information and setting up legal databases can assist staff in their work. Training needs to accompany technological enhancements so that it is used effectively. Strengthen the legal drafting process Harmonizing domestic legislation with international human rights and global environmental obligations can be a way to ensure that international commitments are reflected in the laws that are drafted.This process can be done in collaboration with the Law Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the Ministries of Environment and Foreign Affairs. In addition to providing technical expertise on the drafting itself, the Ministry of Justice can also increase public involvement in law-making by inviting public comments and participation on proposed new laws. Improve accountability of the Ministry of Justice3 \ufffdEstablishment of an Ombudsman-like office. In addition to the setting up of help desks where people can report complaints, an ombudsman office could be established where citizens could take complaints about ministry officials. This could help improve accountability of ministry officers as duty bearers. 66 Programming for Justice: Access for All Modernizing the Justice Sector Modernizing the justice sector and introducing new technologies is key to improving access to justice as it can help expedite court cases and provide the means to monitor the court system as a whole. A good example of this is UNDP Yemen\u2019s project in modernizing the justice sector.The project includes the following components: 1. Establishment of an Electronic Legal Database. The database is accessible via the Internet and containsupdated Yemeni Laws and the latest precedents set bythe Supreme Court.An English webpage has also beencreated withinformation about Yemeni laws. AnInternet Legal Research Unit is available for judges/lawyers who cannot afford a personal computer.CD-ROMs with the laws have also been created and disseminated. 2.

[http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption.html]. \ufffdEstablish external oversight requirements. To counter corruption, requirements such as double signatures, disclosure of personal finances of persons with significant responsibility, and monitoring mechanisms for activities of officials or other departments within the Ministry can be effective. \ufffdImprove transparency. UNDP can assist the Ministry of Justice to undertake administrative reforms where needed to improve the transparency of its operations. UNDP can also play a role in streamlining the interface between the judiciary and Parliament and improve the Ministry\u2019s coordinating role in relation to other actors of the executive branch. For example, a comprehensive legal sector strategy can be developed with the participation of different agencies and aligned with the country\u2019s development policies. Encourage legal dissemination to improve awareness Part of the role of the Ministry of Justice is to ensure that the public have access to comprehensible,timely,accurate and relevant legal information. The Ministry should provide information on both substantive law as well as procedures to access the formal system. UNDP could support the Ministry to set up communication units with communication strategies and guidelines, and provide communication tools and training to government communication officers. 4 \ufffdAwareness campaigns. Claim holders, especially those from disadvantaged groups, should be made aware of the services they can obtain from the Ministry.This can be achieved through poster campaigns targeted at disadvantaged groups, through media campaigns (TV and radio shows, newspapers), etc.The Ministry of Justice could also collaborate with parliamentary commissions, the Ministry of Education,and the media and civil society in broader civic education initiatives (also see Chapter 5). \ufffdDisemination of legal information. Legal information should be easily and readily available for those who need it. In order to ensure access to legal information, the Ministry of Justice could prepare support materials to assist in the implementation of laws and regulations at the national and local levels. These materials could include: explanatory commentaries, memoranda, or compliance guides on key laws and regulations. \ufffdPublic access to information. Library and law research centres with Internet access and holding all statutory instruments and legal texts could be established. Such centres should be accessible to both legal staff and the general public. In addition, special help desks or hotlines could be established within the Ministry to respond to those seeking information and services. Build coalitions within and outside of the Ministry of Justice To bring about change, it is necessary to have political will. One way to enhance political will is to build coalitions \u2013 both within and outside the Ministry of Justice: \ufffdIndentity catalysts and change-agents. It is an effective strategy to identify within the system catalysts committed to the principles of a rights-based approach and access to 67 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 4 UNDP Latvia,for example developed a project to build institutional capacity of the judiciary in Latvia by preparing and implementing a communication policy.[http://www.tm.gov.lv/str/962_UNDP_projekts.doc].UNDP Indonesia is also working with the Minister of Justice to develop their Communications and Public Relations Department for better dissemination of legal information.

Building coalitions with partners outside the Ministry of Justice is also necessary. With the support of institutions such as other ministries, National Human Rights Commissions as well as civil society organizations, the pressure on the Ministry of Justice to undertake necessary reforms can be increased. These coalitions are also important in carrying out activities such as human rights sensitization of the police or educating public officials on their responsibilities under the Constitution. Encourage civil society and civilian oversight of the Ministry of Justice Where there is a strong civil society movement, or programmes are in place to increase civil society capacities, development of mechanisms for civil society monitoring and feedback to the Ministry could be a strategic undertaking. \ufffdLobbying and Advocacy.

This following section focuses specifically on the courts, the judiciary and prosecutors.6 A court consists of an official,public forum,which a public power establishes by lawful authority to adjudicate disputes and to dispense justice according to the law.Courts are intended to offer a forum where the poor and powerless can stand with all others as equals before the law.The courts should also protect the rights of people who can\u2019t protect themselves. A trial court or court of first instance is the court in which most civil or criminal cases begin. A trial court is different from an appellate court. An appellate court is a court that hears cases in which a lower court has already made some decision, which at least one party to the action wants to challenge. The judiciary consists of judges and magistrates as well as administrative staff such as clerks, bailiffs, translators and security personnel. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers,it is one of the three branches of government. The primary function of the judiciary is to adjudicate legal disputes and to ensure the provision of a remedy sought for a grievance through the application of law. The judiciary is also responsible for determining who has violated criminal laws and to assess punishments or other remedies. The judiciary also serves to check and balance the power of the executive and legislative branches of the Government. 7 The prosecution is the legal party responsible for presenting the case against an individual suspected of breaking the law in a criminal proceeding. 8 Crimes are offences against the social order and government officials are responsible for the prosecution of offenders. In some legal systems, prosecutors will advise or supervise the work of the police or other evidence-gathering institutions, and they will also enforce the judgments of a court. Prosecutors can hold a wide variety of statutory positions, some are private lawyers and prosecute public cases, others are civil servants under the executive, and still others enjoy the independence of a quasi-judicial status. In the Asia-Pacific,there are many different types of legal systems.

Also, in some cases, traditional and indigenous systems of justice that follow customary law may be used more than formal court systems (see Section 4.3 Informal Justice Systems). No matter which legal system is in place, judicial reform efforts should be in accordance with international human rights and rule of law standards. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides basic guiding principles for all legal and judicial systems. Numerous international human rights instruments recognize as fundamental the right of all persons to due process of law, including to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law. The importance of this right in the protection of human rights is underscored by the fact that the implementation of all other rights depends upon proper administration of justice. 9 4.2.1 THE COURTS Court reform strategies traditionally focus on enhancing operational efficiency and developing human resource capacity. While these approaches are critical, if the court system is approached from an access to justice perspective, additional principles, which underpin the provision of access to justice by the court system will need to be addressed. These principles are accountability, accessibility and independence. It is important to recognize that all three principles need to guide any programming intervention aiming to enhance access to justice within the court system and enhance public confidence and trust in the justice 71 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 5 Alternative Disputer Resolution and traditional and indigenous justice systems are covered in a separate section.See Section 4.3.Informal Justice Systems. 6 Public defence systems are also part of the judiciary and are established for those who are accused of criminal offences but cannot afford a lawyer. Public defence systems are discussed in detail in Chapter 5. 7 The judicial branch of the Government and the legislative and executive branches are Constitutional Partners.However,the critical constitutional notion is that they are separate and independent branches of government while at the same time they are also interdependent.Therefore, it is important that the judicial branch pursue efforts and establish programmes to acquaint the legislative and the executive branches with the duties and functions of the judicial branch. 8 In some legal systems,prosecutors will advise or supervise the work of the police or other evidence-gathering institutions,and they will also enforce the judgments of a court. 9 These international principles and guidelines also specifically mention protection for disadvantaged groups \u2013 for example,children, people with mental disabilities,etc should be provided with the protection they need. Criminal Cases A criminal case is when the Government brings an action against an individual for offences against society whereas civil disputes are between private parties.In criminal cases, defendants can lose their lives and freedom, as well as property. Therefore, protecting the rights of criminal defendants is an important consideration for access to justice programmes. system.10 The application of these principles also contributes to improving public perception of the justice system \u2013 the judicial system not only needs to deliver justice, but needs to be seen by the public as a just system. The following sections examine the five key areas of intervention: A. Operational Efficiency B. Human Resource Development C. Integrity and Accountability D. Independence E. Accessibility A. OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY Operational efficiency is usually associated with timely trials and delivery of judgments.It also refers to efficient courtroom management,case-flow and efficiency in the service process and effective and efficient rules and procedures. Operational inefficiencies can serve to hide corrupt or discriminatory practices or behaviour by judicial and administrative staff.11 An inefficient justice system will result in delayed decision-making.Such delays can have a greater impact on poor and disadvantaged people. For example, undue delays in solving property or commercial issues involving a poor citizen are likely to deprive them of their livelihoods. In addition, a disorganized and uncoordinated court system can in many cases suffer from communication problems between the centre and the periphery and between the different levels of courts, thereby producing inconsistent and unpredictable decisions. It can also negatively impact other institutions within the justice system.An overly bureaucratic,complicated and inefficient system is also less accessible to all and less likely to be accessed by those who don\u2019t trust or understand it.12 Another key obstacle to operational efficiency can be the inability to enforce judicial decisions (see the section on Enforcement later in this chapter).

In many developing countries there are inadequate structures for court administration, coordination and management, and structures for 72 Programming for Justice: Access for All 10 The widely adopted Court Performance Standards (CPS) include as fundamental principles for courts: access to justice,expedition and timeliness, equality,fairness and integrity,independence and accountability as well as public trust and confidence.See the World Bank site on \u2018Measuring the Performance of a Legal System\u2019,http://www1.worldbank.org/publicsector/legal/performancebrief.htm. 11 Including personnel involved in filing,typing,translating as well as security guards,bailiffs,summons runners,court inspectors,etc. 12 The rate of appeal can,for example,be an indication of the dissatisfaction with the trial level. Typology of Legal Systems Listed below are some of the main legal systems found in the Asia-Pacific region. In many countries, hybrid systems have emerged where different legal systems have been merged to make the legal system more relevant for the local context. Common law is a legal tradition in which common law rules and principles co-exist with statutes and in which the judiciary plays a central role in developing the legal system through its power of statutory interpretation and judge-made precedent. Common law systems in Asia and the Pacific have usually developed through the influence of British law (see e.g., Brunei, India, Sri Lanka). Civil law is a legal system that relies heavily on the codification of laws into criminal or civil codes and statutes, which are left for judges to interpret and apply. In civil law systems the judicial process traditionally follows an inquisitorial model,by which judges,particularly in criminal cases,can take on an investigative role.The civil law tradition developed in continental European countries.In Asia and the Pacific, the legal system of Thailand and Viet Nam, for example, are largely based on the civil law tradition. Socialist law is the legal system that is used in Communist states. It is based on the civil law system, with modifications to suit the Marxist-Leninist ideology.Most important of these modifications is providing for most property to be owned by the State or by agricultural cooperatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises. Courts generally have less power than the other two branches of government and are not considered an equal branch of government. Islamic law is called Syariah or Shar\u2019ia. It is a set of rules based on Islamic scripture and jurisprudence potentially applicable to all forms of legal interaction. Traditional sources of Islamic law are derived from the Qur\u2019an (the Islamic holy text which sets out general principles that guide Muslim communities) and the Hadith (the recordings of the practices of the Prophet). Most countries that practice Syariah/Shar\u2019ia, for example Indonesia, Pakistan, Brunei, and Afghanistan, maintain a dual system of secular courts and religious courts, in which the latter mainly regulate marriage and inheritance. Iran maintains religious courts for all aspects of jurisprudence.Though predominantly applied to Muslims, it may at times be applied to non-Muslims as well. effective record and case management are absent. As a result records can be lost or misplaced, prolonging and delaying court proceedings. In addition, the lack, or destruction, of the means for timely delivery of court documents, such as postal services, roads and transport systems can be an obstacle. Lack of streamlined procedures A lack of streamlined procedures for filing and disposing of cases can result in delays, corruption, mishandling of records, and arbitrariness. Complex or unclear procedures can be confusing and discouraging for potential claimants. Claims which could be dealt with through other means but which go to court can result in an endemic backlog of cases which puts unnecessary strains on the court system. Further, the slow pace of legislative reform often does not address the needs of the court system for streamlined procedures. Lack of laws,legal information and jurisprudence A lack of laws, legal information and jurisprudence by courts, including law reports, law gazettes and other publications, can result in legal personnel often having only limited reference materials, and being at risk of not keeping up with new developments and interpretations of the law.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "177a39c0-1a6d-41c2-9884-0bcf6a71738b": {"__data__": {"id_": "177a39c0-1a6d-41c2-9884-0bcf6a71738b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22ed104c01cd65f5da2ab22ba19446e8b0a1a16f1c4d9a6526e0e9de08abcb6b"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf152176-8e24-4d08-a396-d4cc0f3dda54", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1f411a846882a794650a780da07273bc3b5360aa0cf2670a66bf9f9864a139e"}}, "hash": "c88e320f5e10b107161e16e6c823a3d5ee905de181e9d44fc4f1b9e25f9da136", "text": "Without access to such information, legal uncertainty, inconsistent law development and application, poor legal education and a high percentage of trial court decision reversals can occur.

Resistance to change and adopting streamlined procedures that may enhance operational efficiency can prevent necessary reforms from being implemented. Strategies to develop capacities for operational efficiency Increase the human resource capacity of the justice system In cases where a shortage of personnel leads to case backlog, strategies to increase the number of judicial personnel should be developed. This shortage is especially apparent in countries coming out of long periods of conflict. Strategies should aim to do more than simply increase the number of judges as this alone may not lead to increased efficiency. It may be more successful to find ways to increase the efficiency of the court systems rather than increase the number of staff. For example, in some cases it may be advisable to reduce the number of judges and increase their pay or increase the number of court support staff instead.Strategies for interventions will need to be carefully assessed within the context of each country. 13 Utilize available resources more efficiently One of the ways to reduce case backlog is to systematically reduce the number of cases that enter the justice system. In appropriate circumstances, cases that enter the judicial system (or leave without trial) can be diverted to alternative dispute resolution (ADR) mechanisms which could reduce the number of cases requiring judicial adjudication. This can be achieved by law reform interventions affecting both civil and criminal law.Civil interventions can include the use of ADR and traditional mechanisms, limitations to court jurisdiction to cases above a certain value, and through the use of pre-trial settlements (also see section 4.3. on Informal Justice Systems). Criminal law interventions could include plea bargaining and other pre-trial settlement mechanisms. 14 Use decriminalization, plea bargaining and simplified criminal and civil procedures to eliminate excess workloads for courts and reduce backlog In some countries, criminal laws may be archaic and criminalize behaviour that is generally considered acceptable. Decriminalization repeals or amends statutes so that those acts are no longer subject to prosecution. Plea bargaining is a negotiation between the defendant, his/her attorney and the prosecutor. In such a negotiation, the defendant agrees to plead \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018no contest\u2019 to some crimes, in return for the dismissal of other charges, a reduction in the severity of the charges,the prosecutor\u2019s willingness to recommend a particular sentence or some other benefit to the defendant. Plea bargaining may be conducted in private,but acceptance of a plea,and ensuring that the defendant understands the plea and its consequences should be done in open court and approved by the judge.There are several dangers with plea bargaining,including the danger 73 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Poor Pay for Court Support Staff Poor pay for court support staff can affect staff morale and performance, in turn inhibiting the public\u2019s ability to access justice. Poor pay for court support staff can also foster corruption as underpaid staff may be more vulnerable to bribery or pressure from corrupt lawyers and judiciary. 13 In the Solomon Islands,for example,the number of judges has been increased yet,arguably,well-qualified magistrates should be more of a priority. 14 In serious criminal cases,however,caution must be exercised in terms of using ADR,traditional mechanisms or plea bargaining or pre-trial settlements so as not to compromise the deliverance of justice. that an innocent person will be pressured into pleading guilty out of fear of a severe penalty if convicted. There are also constitutional implications concerning the right to a fair trial, the rights of victims, and the possibility that the plea bargaining practice may lead to unequal treatment in contravention of the right to equality. Where plea bargaining takes place, it must be clearly monitored.15 Expand the role of alternative dispute resolution Another method for reducing the strain on the justice system is to redirect cases to ADR systems when appropriate. For example, the National Law Commission in India has recommended expanding the role of ADR in India to address lesser value claims in property, trade disputes, local small business and family disputes (see section 4.3 Informal Justice Systems). However, it is important to carefully analyze the local conditions before establishing ADR mechanisms. Improve court and case management, scheduling, and streamlining of procedures Case prioritization, active case management and strict timelines can also reduce the backlog of cases and improve clearance times. General procedures for handling cases should be standardized and mechanisms should be created to ensure their adherence to these standards. However, aggressive and rigid scheduling may discourage thorough investigations, legal analysis, and case preparation. The application of category- specific time frames can mitigate this while ensuring greater injustices, such as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5a5c6df-3446-4f60-98cb-789c9741fac6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5a5c6df-3446-4f60-98cb-789c9741fac6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ebf85ca2cb68bbc4fddaf1576ebde35f1e317e10b4a7d58fad7c98a3ec014fe"}}, "hash": "5ebf85ca2cb68bbc4fddaf1576ebde35f1e317e10b4a7d58fad7c98a3ec014fe", "text": "the detention of persons without trial, is avoided. Procedures should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate the individual needs of a case. Promote the use of information technology (IT) to improve the operational efficiency of courts Automated case management and case tracking help to ensure that files are not lost and cases progress according to a set timetable. Automated documentation and certification systems can also aid the recording, printing and distribution of witness depositions as well as being useful for individuals obtaining copies of documents, especially in countries where the judiciary also performs notary/registry functions for property, births and personal status of citizens. However, IT approach should be carefully phased in, and any initiatives promoting the introduction of automated systems need to be accompanied by intensive capacity development initiatives.16 It can be expensive not just to install but also to maintain and replace systems as well. It may, in some cases, be more effective to concentrate on administrative processes instead of IT. Provide training for judges and court staff in operational efficiency techniques The provision of training in IT, court ethics, non- discrimination, court management, and case management, as well as knowledge of substantive and procedural law is an essential component of any strategy focusing on improving operational efficiency of the court system.Such training should also target administrative and paralegal staff and can act as a vehicle for attitudinal change within the system. Provide support to coordination mechanisms Support should be provided within courts, between different levels of courts and with other actors and institutions of the justice sector. Effective coordination can identify and address blockages in the system and improve overall performance. Streamline the organizational structure of the courts Court bureaucracy is a significant barrier to those wishing to access to the court system. Court clerks should be able to explain the court procedures and filing requirements, and should try to limit unnecessary bureaucratic requirements. Clerks\u2019 offices could also be a good place for hosting legal clinics, especially for litigants needing only basic legal advice. 74 Programming for Justice: Access for All Restructuring the Judiciary UNDP Afghanistan, as part of its \u2018Rebuilding the Justice Sector\u2019 programme, is supporting the capacity building of permanent justice institutions through support to the Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) scheme. Through this scheme ministries and other public institutions are restructuring and streamlining selected key departments and are compensated by a series of interim salary incentives for staff of the \u2018restructured\u2019 departments. While the justice institutions were not originally included in the PRR plan, the Civil Service Commission was asked by the Supreme Court and Attorney General that they be allowed to participate in the scheme. UNDP is supporting this plan by providing technical assistance and capacity development activities coupled with in-kind incentives for the departments willing to undergo reform. 15 Monitoring can be done by legal aid organizations or other civil society organizations.Though it is inappropriate for the court to involve itself in the actual bargaining process,it has the authority to reject plea bargains deemed inappropriate. 16 Basic computer skills cannot be taken for granted.In addition,there may be insufficient trained personnel to deal with breakdowns and to provide user support.Also,many office buildings may also not be air-conditioned or dust and humidity may affect equipment. UNDP\u2019s approach to public administration reform (PAR) aims to create a well-managed, non-partisan civil service.17 While the judiciary is normally outside the scope of PAR,18 it shares some of the same concerns and its reform can also be considered as PAR. In some situations, especially post-conflict situations, a public administration/ management approach can provide an important baseline for reforms that can increase access to justice through the development of transparent and efficient management of resources, streamlined roles for civil service/court personnel and judges, and through the provision of incentives such as an appropriate salary and in-kind incentives for judges. This type of intervention should aim to develop a culture of accountability, non-discrimination and abidance by the rule of law by both judges and court staff. Support the creation of,and/or provide ongoing assistance to,national judicial management institutions Institutions such as judicial services commissions and high councils of the judiciary can inform central administrative and procedural policies and ensure effective coordination between the different branches/ levels of the judicial system. They can also be mandated to present concerns and requirements (budgeting, training etc.) on behalf of the judiciary and can enact and enforce codes of conduct relating to discriminatory and corrupt practices. As in any other intervention attempting to regulate or manage the judicial process, special consideration needs to be given to maintaining judicial independence.

It can also protect vulnerable and disadvantaged groups from discriminatory practices as it can inform legal personnel about their responsibilities and the rights of disadvantaged groups. All courts should be able to access regularly updated litigation,court decisions and sentencing guidelines. A central legal documentation centre for judicial decisions within the country should be established and should be tasked with the systematic collection, collation and dissemination of all legislation and authoritative court decisions. Support the development of and adherence to sentencing and evidentiary guidelines Sentencing guidelines can ensure consistency by promoting uniform and proportional sentences and can help to ensure that sentencing decisions are not influenced by factors such as race, gender, religion or economic status. Use of guidelines can provide a standard to measure how well the system is working. Specific objectives of sentencing guidelines are to: a) increase public safety, b) promote uniformity of sentencing, c) promote proportionality in sentencing, d) provide clarity and certainty in sentencing, and e) coordinate sentencing practices with correctional resources. However, sentencing guidelines should still allow for judicial discretion to ensure that sentences are fair and proportionate, and that factors particular to each defendant are considered. Evidentiary guidelines are also necessary to specify the degree and nature of evidence required. For example, guidelines for confessions, credibility of witness, weight of evidence, etc. Sentences should also be monitored and filings and plea agreements should be reported to a central agency within the court system. A sentencing commission composed of interested parties and public members can be a way to monitor the process and identify problem areas. Public access to information should be a priority Some intervention in this area can include support for the creation of freedom of information legal frameworks to allow maximum transparency of court proceedings through the publication of orders and judgments; publication of the annual reports on the performance of courts; public outreach programmes informing people of court procedures and rules; awareness programmes about the law and rights; and setting up customer information booths/kiosks at the courts. Court support staff could be trained to facilitate public access to information.These measures can all serve to improve accessibility, familiarity and understanding, especially for the poor and disadvantaged. 75 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Measuring Court Performance Creating systems to measure court performance and setting indicators can assist in monitoring the judiciary. Care needs to be taken in pursuing this type of methodology, however, as it is difficult to quantify the performance of the judiciary, and this type of process could be misleading. Therefore, indicators need to be established to measure the quality of the programmes and services being delivered. These measurements can serve as \u2018report cards\u2019 for different courts and judges and can identify areas that need to be targeted for reform. 17 See UNDP Public Administration Reform Practice Note,2004.[http://www.undp.org/policy/docs/practicenotes/PAR-PN.doc]. 18 Reform of the judiciary can also be considered as PAR,but it is often not incorporated within general public administration reform. Develop an internal monitoring system for judicial performance and link career advancement to performance Such systems should not be based solely on the number of cases resolved, instead the system should also take into account the difficulty of the cases solved. Performance monitoring should be based on annual statistics, together with monitoring of performance indicators for integrity and non-discrimination. For example, the number of valid complaints regarding corrupt practices and evaluation of case disposition by disaggregated data on ethnicity, gender, and geographical origin.19 These interventions, however, should not compromise the independence of the judiciary nor influence judges to adjudicate based on the perceived preferences of those who have the power to intervene in their careers. 20 Support external monitoring mechanisms Public oversight, discussion and debate are a necessary part of a democratic process, providing checks on the judiciary and ensuring impartiality, transparency and accountability. Such public participation can be encouraged while still maintaining judicial independence. For example, consultations between stakeholders in the court system (police, lawyers, legal aid, NGOs, etc.) on issues of concern regarding the operational efficiency of the court system could be encouraged. As discussed later in this chapter, in the section on civil society oversight,ultimately,the judiciary, like other institutions of democratic governance, should be accountable to the public for both its decisions and its operations.21 The following table includes some critical lesson on increasing operational efficiency.22 B.

The targets of court education should include both judges and support staff. 76 Programming for Justice: Access for All Objectives of Judicial Training Programmes \ufffd To prepare newly appointed judges for their duties through the provision of necessary information and tools. \ufffd To enable greater consistency and predictability in judicial decision-making. \ufffd To inform judges of new methods, laws, and related areas of knowledge required in their work. \ufffd To introduce new concepts and approaches that may positively influence the values, outlooks and attitudes of judges. \ufffd To screen candidates to the judiciary -- successful completion of entry level training may also be used to screen other judicial professionals and support staff. In reform programmes,training may have additional purposes: \ufffd To build a reform coalition within the judiciary or overcome resistance to reform. \ufffd To identify problems that may need other interventions if they are to be resolved. \ufffd To build solidarity and a sense of common purpose. 19 Bar associations and private citizen advisory groups can also provide input on performance of judges and court personnel.Also see Chapter 5. 20 One way to monitor and provide feedback for judges is to establish judicial performance commissions in each judicial district comprised of both attorneys and non-attorneys.When judges are scheduled to go through a retention election,the performance commission can collect data by distributing questionnaires to litigants,attorneys,witnesses,jurors and court staff.The information can be compiled,the judge can be interviewed by the commission,and then the results of the process can be published. 21 Accountable

Often government funding is especially limited for entry-level and continuing training programmes for judges and support staff. Gaps in government funding can be bridged by NGOs, professional associations, academic institutions, etc., who can also provide funding and training opportunities. However, it is important that governments show political commitment to developing and supporting the judiciary by providing sufficient funds for training programmes. Inadequate numbers of qualified, competent and committed teachers and lawyers There may be a shortage of qualified trainers and teachers available to conduct training programmes for the judiciary. The numbers of lawyers and academics from disadvantaged groups (e.g., women, minority groups, etc.) are also limited. Limited access to updated judicial and legal tools and text books Access to legal tools and text books can be limited resulting in poor legal education.There might also be also limited availability of legal tools such as bench books, guidelines and standards for lawyers and judges to refer to. Assessment of the needs of the judiciary is incomplete and inadequate When assessments are not conducted properly, it can lead to the adoption of unsystematic or undesirable training techniques and tools. In addition, judicial training needs to be conducted at a pace that will not compromise judicial expediency. Understanding of international human rights norms is limited Judges and judicial staff need to understand the international human rights framework that protects the rights of individuals and the particular provisions that have been established to protect the rights of the disadvantaged. Training should include modules on international human rights instruments and how to apply international human rights norms in the national context. Training for higher-level judges and administrative staff is limited Judges from higher courts do not regularly participate in training programmes as they often perceive them as not being useful. Further, programmes may not be provided for appellate 78 Programming for Justice: Access for All Poor Donor Coordination Often there is poor coordination of limited resources amongst donors seeking to assist in judicial training.This can lead to many problems as there can be significant difference in approaches, or there may be duplication of assistance in some areas and neglect in others.

Hence, there is a limited participation of high ranking judges in trainings. Appropriate incentives or separate trainings specifically targeted to higher ranked judges need to be provided to encourage their participation. Entrenched attitudes and behaviour that compromise reform initiatives The emphasis of many training programmes tends to be on building knowledge and skills without sufficient emphasis given to changing behaviours, ethics and attitudes. For example, the judiciary can be very traditional and hierarchical; therefore, some judges do not wish to be trained by anyone who is not a lawyer or a peer. Such narrowing of associations may lead to the entrenching rather than the changing of behaviours, ethics and attitudes, as trainings may not address broader social values. Strategies to Build Capacities for Human Resource Development Engage the executive and legislative branches in providing an enabling environment and policies in support of training programmes for the judiciary It is necessary to have political commitment in order to establish training programmes that enhance the competency, independence and efficiency of the judiciary, so that it is able to fulfil its mandate. Advocacy and sensitization programmes for the executive and legislative branches should be pursued to enhance their understanding of the role of the judiciary. For example, experiences and lessons from other countries on how the different branches of government can work together can be shared. Start reforms in judicial education at the university level The values, skills, attitudes and knowledge of students can be developed and strengthened at the university level by qualified and committed academics and lawyers.

In addition, local and national bar associations could support change, prepare guidance and sponsor training (also see Chapter 5). Support the development of bench books Bench books are essentially working aids and guides to judges as well as judicial support staff. Bench books may provide guidance on both procedural and substantive laws. They should be tailored to the everyday needs of the judiciary and targeted to specific needs of each jurisdiction. Encourage attitudinal change in the judiciary Attitudinal change is needed to enhance judicial integrity and independence and eliminate biases and discrimination. Consideration of how to eliminate biases based on gender, race, ethnicity, class or age should be an integral part of judicial training. Reforming the justice sector will only be successful if judges understand why reforms are necessary. Broadening the knowledge and competencies of judges will better equip them to resolve issues as well as advance reforms from within. Emphasize the role of judges as the protectors of rights and freedoms and as impartial adjudicators Training programmes should include components on integrity, impartiality, independence and accountability based on judicial codes of conduct. Judicial complaint mechanisms and disciplinary processes also need to be included in training programmes.Trainings should also prepare judges for the potential political dimensions of their rulings and should assist them to articulate the values that inform their decisions to ensure transparency. Judges should also be careful of taking an overly technical approach to the law, at the risk of ignoring the broader social goals of a law. Train judges to act as conduits of the Constitution and promoters of basic human rights Judicial education is necessary in this context to ensure appropriate interpretation of the law. The judiciary should be encouraged to develop the necessary skills to deliver disciplined judgements following rules of evidence and providing parties due process of law. Such training can limit corruption and manipulation of the judiciary and reduce the occurrence of inconsistent decisions. Judicial training programmes should also train judges and support staff to interpret and protect fundamental rights and freedoms provided for in 79 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Judicial Activism The law in some jurisdictions allows judges broad interpretation in public interest cases \u2013 courts have an important role in stepping in when evidence is not sufficient to convict, or if lines governing courtroom conduct are crossed. While such powers can enable more vigorous promotion and protection of human rights by courts,they can also be misused to violate the rights of disadvantaged groups if the court deems it to be in the general public (majority) interest. Generally, judicial activism should not be focused on issues within individual cases, but on broader social reform issues. national constitutions and legislation as well international human rights norms.National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) can assist in familiarizing judges and court personnel on human rights (see section 4.4.1 on NHRIs). Assistance can also be sought from international organizations (such as UNHCHR, UNODC, etc.) as well as foreign/ international bar associations, academic institutions and NGOs. Encourage specialized training and promote a diverse judiciary Training programmes which encourage specialization with a view to developing a representative, educated and sensitive judiciary should be promoted once general training has been completed. Potential users of the justice system, especially those from disadvantaged groups should be consulted in developing the curriculum. Representatives from civil society organizations working with disadvantaged groups or representatives from the groups themselves should also be involved in the training. Their involvement could increase the awareness of lawyers and judges of the concerns of disadvantaged groups and could contribute to the changing of behaviours, ethics and attitudes of judges. Also, incentives should be provided to encourage members of disadvantaged groups to take part in judicial training. This could be accompanied by a public awareness campaign to educate the public about the need for diverse representation in the judiciary.24 Prioritize the development a judicial faculty to assist in the establishment of judicial training mechanisms This will enhance credibility as well as ownership of training initiatives by judges and students of law. Acceptance by judges can encourage academic exchanges with scholars and students of law. To undertake training, the judiciary could call upon law schools or judicial training academies, or develop their own training institutes. Capacity development strategies could include curriculum development, long distance learning, training- of-trainers, development of a network of trained judicial educators and building the capacity of training centres. Development of a judicial faculty should involve senior judges and qualified members of the judiciary.

Judicial educators should work with professional educators and adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, using a variety of teaching methods such as case studies, focus group discussions, class presentations, study tours, videos and lectures. Training and education activities should also include mentoring and training-of-trainers. Members of disadvantaged groups should be encouraged to take part in the training programmes to train and raise awareness as well as participate in training themselves. Base training programmes on an in-depth assessment of training needs Judicial education should analyze weaknesses in the judiciary and design programmes to address these areas. It is also helpful to acknowledge existing strengths and build on them. Judicial training can include training in substantive law, especially in countries where the legal and judicial framework has been disrupted (e.g., Timor-Leste, Afghanistan, etc.). Training in contract law, commercial law, criminal law, family law, land and property law, immigration law, etc., along with procedural laws may be necessary. In other cases it may be necessary to focus training on enabling effective and efficient court management and case flow management and reform rules and procedures so that judges and court staff are equipped to institute such reform processes within the system. Judicial training institutes or law schools can be effective monitoring and feedback agents on judicial performance Monitoring systems could engage civil society, the media, alternative law groups (ALGs) and the public to help set training curricula as well as provide evaluation of training programmes \u2013 particularly in providing feedback on how trainings can serve the poor and the disadvantaged more effectively, efficiently and sensitively. An effective evaluation of the judiciary\u2019s performance can be beneficial in identifying weaknesses and gaps in the justice system to be addressed by training. Training programmes may need to be included as part of the job description or be required for the purposes 80 Programming for Justice: Access for All Evaluating the Effectiveness of Judicial Training Regular evaluation of judicial training programmes should be undertaken to assess the efficient and effective transfer of knowledge, including changes in attitudes and behaviour.The focus should not only be on completing the training programmes but on determining the impact training has on how judicial staff perform their jobs and whether it has made a positive difference for those seeking to access the justice system. It may therefore be useful to evaluate the performance of trainees not only during training, but also for a fixed time afterwards. 24 In some situations members of the judiciary are expected to be composed of the elite.When efforts are made to promote diverse representation especially from disadvantaged groups,it may not be easily accepted (e.g.,discrimination against court personnel who are of lower castes,lack of respect for female attorneys or judges from minority ethnic groups,etc.) of promotion in order to provide incentive to take part in the trainings.Further,where not already the case,promotion based on performance rather than length of service should also be encouraged. C. INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY The essence of an independent and impartial judgement depends on each judge\u2019s personal integrity. Further, an essential element of the right to a fair trial is an independent and impartial tribunal. In the absence of integrity, independence and accountability, corruption and corrupt practices are likely to take root. If the judicial system is corrupt, access to, and the outcome of, judicial decisions are likely to be affected. Corruption of the judiciary disproportionately impacts the poor and disadvantaged, as by definition they are less likely to be politically influential, affluent or have personal connections. Corruption and responses to address or eliminate corruption can be grouped into two categories \u2013 institutional and attitudinal. Corruption can be perceived by the public as a number of different actions, including delays in the executing of court orders and delivery of judgements, unjustifiable issuance of summonses,conflicts of interest,lack of public access to records of court proceedings, unusual variation in sentencing, appointments perceived as resulting from political patronage and so on. 25 Challenges to Ensuring Integrity and Accountability in the Court System Lack of a legal framework and the political will to combat corruption There may not be any legal provisions or enforcement mechanisms to hold judges and other court staff accountable for corruption. Even where laws exist, they are often not enforced. Unless there is genuine political will to tackle corruption, little will be done to address the problem. Tolerance of corruption In some countries, corruption is seen as the only way to accomplish certain activities and the payment of a bribe is a normal and acceptable way of doing business. For instance, it may be acceptable for an", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "edf078bd-b7c9-4f39-86a6-e92626adf6f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "edf078bd-b7c9-4f39-86a6-e92626adf6f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0113c1a22f130ab9d69e781ec472d95006fe8e44222f7b17f079db18eeee3c2"}}, "hash": "c0113c1a22f130ab9d69e781ec472d95006fe8e44222f7b17f079db18eeee3c2", "text": "otherwise law-abiding attorney to pay a bribe to a court clerk to expedite a case file. Such behaviour may be considered justifiable because the attorney is perceived as not interfering in the substance of the case. In other cases, there may be a sense of complacency when judges are threatened and intimidated (in order to influence their decision) as it may be seen that little can be done to hold accountable those who abuse power. Lack of proper case tracking, monitoring and accountability within the courts In the courts there is a vast array of administrative responsibilities, which if inadequately monitored, can create a climate for corruption. In many countries, administrative court procedures are bureaucratic, cumbersome and confusing, and are carried out by court personnel who have broad discretionary powers with little accountability. As in any workplace, some court employees are willing to circumvent the administrative process for their private benefit. Where there is limited oversight of their wide ranging responsibilities, rules and procedures can be manipulated with little regulation. This may have the effect of accelerating or delaying a case without detection. Lawyers may request inappropriate support from court employees responsible for unsupervised administrative tasks, as they know there is a low risk of being detected. For those litigants who do not have legal representation and or who already have difficulty meeting the cost of legitimate fees, equal access to justice is denied,as they are unable to make the illicit payments required. Similarly, judges can also affect the procedural process of a case, e.g., by continually adjourning a case until a fee is paid. Corruption also emanates from within the justice system Chief police officers, prosecutors or judges can exert significant administrative authority over their subordinates. By the simple act of assigning an investigation to a certain police officer, or a case to a certain prosecutor or judge, the outcome of the investigation or case may be pre-determined. Low salary levels of the judiciary/prosecutors This can encourage the use of bribes as a source of income generation. However, while an adequate salary is important, it is not sufficient in itself to ensure judicial integrity.Yet if judicial salaries are so low that judges or support staff cannot reasonably support a family, this provides fertile ground for those wishing to resort to bribery to influence outcomes in their favour. Lack of legal knowledge of prevailing laws and regulations Lack of legal knowledge related to improper conduct and attempts to influence judicial rulings can inhibit a judge\u2019s ability to respond to inappropriate pressure or requests. Additionally, if judges are not well versed in the substance of the law, then they are also more likely to be influenced by improper internal and external factors. 81 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 25 UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime).2001.\u201cStrengthening Judicial Integrity Against Corruption.\u201dGlobal Programme Against Corruption,Vienna. [http://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/gpacpublications/cicp10.pdf] . Non-transparent adjudication procedures and pervasive use of closed door trials In some countries, particularly those of civil law tradition, judicial decisions are traditionally not published, nor are verbatim court transcripts provided. Often open trials are also not held.Thus, when there are inconsistent applications of the law, or where there is an indefensible ruling, it is difficult for the public to ascertain and establish such facts.It is not uncommon for judges sitting on the same bench to apply the law differently, or, of even more concern, for an individual judge to apply the law differently to cases with similar circumstances. Without verbatim court transcripts or published decisions, such discrepancies are difficult to detect. Instituting public trials, hearings and proceedings can also improve the transparency of courts rulings. Public perception of corruption is a disincentive to engage in judicial reform In countries where corruption is endemic, and there is little respect for government office,citizens may view any unfavourable decision to be an indication of corruption. Public perception of corruption (whether true or not) prevents people from using the formal justice system as they feel that it is biased against them. Disadvantaged groups in particular may avoid the system if they feel they will not receive a fair judgement. Inadequate data/statistics on the extent of judicial corruption Such statistics are necessary to provide a basis to establish effective remedies. Further, accurate and up-to-date documentation of cases can facilitate civil society, National Human Rights Institutions and specialized NGOs in scrutinizing the decisions of judges. Lack of effective mechanisms for employee selection,promotion and discipline A lack of transparency in selection mechanisms, and appointments which are not based on merit, enable nepotism and political influence.

Lack of external review mechanisms by state and non-state actors Ombudsmen, National Human Rights Commissions, civil society, etc., can all play a critical role in monitoring the judiciary and ensuring the integrity of the justice system is maintained. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance Integrity and Accountability in the Court System Support lobby groups to sensitize and encourage government ratification of the Convention Against Corruption26 Gain political commitment at the highest level to fight corruption and put into place laws that address corrupt practices. Seek out and support reformers in the system so that laws against corrupt behaviour are enforced. Undertake an independent assessment of the extent,cause,location,impact and cost of corruption This is necessary for the formulation of effective remedies. Planning based on such assessments is only possible where the data has a high level of credibility. Follow-up assessments must be conducted regularly to allow independent impact monitoring of anti-corruption work.The findings of the assessment should be disseminated widely in local languages. Evidence of corruption, not just the perception, is required in order to effectively assess its incidence and develop a framework of anti-corruption policies. The entire process should be monitored by an independent and credible body with members selected on the basis of professional integrity and competence. The assessment and investigation of corruption could be done by an independent Ombudsman or Inspector General. Improvement of the legal education system and training on rules of practice and ethics In many countries significant improvement of legal and judicial education is needed, including mandating courses on professional ethics. An acute understanding of the law is an effective weapon against corruption and professional misconduct. Training on professional responsibility and codes of conduct provide judges and prosecutors with basic information on legal ethics. Mentoring schemes within the courts may also reduce corrupt practices and can act as another mechanism for internal monitoring of the judiciary. Introduction of clear sentencing guidelines This can limit discrepancies in sentencing and provide a tool for transparent adjudication of cases. It is important, however, that any system developed should not unduly impinge on judicial discretion to match the sentencing to the circumstances of each individual defendant. 82 Programming for Justice: Access for All 26 See the United Nations Convention Against Corruption,December 2003 [http://untreaty.un.org/English/notpubl/Corruption_E.pdf]. Support the formation and development of professional organizations for judges27 Such organizations can also be useful in maintaining integrity and holding members accountable as well as playing a key role in training. Disciplinary mechanisms must be in place to address corruption The drafting and adoption of codes of conduct and the establishment of an independent, credible and responsive complaint mechanism within the judiciary is an essential step in the fight against judicial corruption.The responsible entity should be staffed with serving and retired judges and should include, to the extent possible, attorneys and lay people. It should also be given the mandate to receive, investigate and determine complaints of corruption involving judicial officers and court staff.Similar mechanisms should be established for all the legal professions.In the event of proof of the involvement of a legal practitioner in corruption, appropriate sanctions should be in place including disbarment of the persons concerned. Bar councils and associations can act as a regulatory body for all legal practitioners as they ensure appropriate qualifications and training before being \u2018admitted\u2019 to the practice. They can also act as a complaints bureau and tribunal on complaints of misconduct against lawyers. Investigation of criminal conduct should be undertaken by the police and the judiciary while investigation of administrative violations could be done by independent ombudsmen. Streamline court administrative procedures Procedures must be streamlined and easily understood by all so that arbitrary decision- making by court staff is reduced - uniformity and transparency in the administrative process significantly diminishes court personnel\u2019s capacity to obtain illicit payments.

Declaration of assets Judges should be encouraged to declare their assets and those of their immediate family members prior to taking office, and then periodically throughout their tenure and upon departing from office. Declaration of assets could be one of the comprehensive ethical rules for all senior level government employees. Such declarations can be made public. They could be verified and monitored on a regular basis by an independent official or body and necessary disciplinary measures should be in place to deal with corruption if it is detected. Ensure the security of judges handling sensitive cases Support the development of mechanisms and allocation of resources to ensure security for judges handling sensitive cases. Measures should be taken to protect judges from intimidation and threats from those in power to avoid undue influence. Improve access to information The publication of judicial decisions is one of the most effective ways to eliminate corruption within the justice system. It not only reduces corruption but also the perception of corruption as judicial decisions are made accessible and judges can be held accountable for the decisions they make. Further, the public should have access to information about the status of proceedings and procedures to avoid delays. Holding hearings in public and allowing decisions to be made public offer one solution. The media should also have access to non-sensitive information regarding the case and a right to publicize the information. Civil society and other external review mechanisms play an important role in reducing corruption Civil society and other external review mechanisms can play an important role in reducing corruption within the justice system by enhancing public awareness of judicial procedures and citizens\u2019 rights, while creating public pressure for reform. They can also engage in court monitoring. Institutions providing external checks and balances and anti-corruption campaigns should be supported. It may also be useful to create a disciplinary body consisting of experienced and 83 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 27 See the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary,Adopted by the Seventh United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders held at Milan from 26 August to 6 September 1985 and endorsed by General Assembly resolutions 40/32 of 29 November 1985 and 40/146 of 13 December 1985.[http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp50.htm]. 28 IT improvements,however,may not always be appropriate or applicable.See section on Operational Efficiency. impartial officials to receive,investigate and decide on complaints made against judges and prosecutors. While such initiatives must adhere to the principle of judicial independence, independence should not impinge on operational transparency. Recognize, enhance and strengthen the role of the independent media as a vigilant and informed guardian against corruption in the judiciary This should be supported by the judiciary itself \u2013 courts should be afforded the means to appoint, and should appoint, media liaison officers to explain to the public the importance of integrity in judicial institutions, the procedures available for complaint and investigation of corruption and the outcome of any such investigations. Journalists who routinely cover the courts must be educated in the law and court procedures, and their responsibility to be factually correct must be emphasized. An independent media should have free access to court records so that they can assess court performance directly and not have to depend on court personnel. D. INDEPENDENCE Judicial independence means that both the institution of the judiciary and individual judges are free from interference from other institutions and individuals.29 Judicial independence lies at the heart of a well functioning judiciary and is a fundamental principle in ensuring access to justice and upholding the rule of law. The law can only guarantee people\u2019s rights and freedoms when it is interpreted and applied by independent and impartial judges.30 An independent judiciary functions as a mechanism of checks and balances on the legislative and executive branches of government, and a watchdog against corruption and abuse of power. There are three general principles informing the independence of the judiciary: \ufffdCourts and individual judges within judicial systems must be (and publicly perceived to be) impartial in rendering their decisions. \ufffdJudicial decisions must be accepted by the contesting parties and the larger public. \ufffdJudges must be free from undue interference from other branches of government as well as from private powers and higher court judges within a national judiciary. Challenges to the Independence of Courts Inadequacy of constitutional provisions for judicial power and independence It is essential that constitutional and legislative provisions be adequate to secure judicial independence, otherwise there is a risk that independence will not be established at all, or that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe60fe6d-a544-433e-9032-23358fb97d51": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe60fe6d-a544-433e-9032-23358fb97d51", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd216ba7e64cd23291340bd3375595791962f123f09029ad2708c1e369621c48"}}, "hash": "cd216ba7e64cd23291340bd3375595791962f123f09029ad2708c1e369621c48", "text": "it may, once established be eroded and weakened. Political interference and executive domination are two of the most serious threats to judicial integrity and independence. Although provisions vesting judicial power exclusively with the judiciary and guaranteeing its independence are made in most constitutions, these constitutional safeguards can be diluted, manipulated or overturned through constitutional amendments and new legislation. In some countries, ruling parties have attempted to amend constitutions or pass laws in ways that undermine the jurisdiction of the courts or make the court vulnerable to partisan influence. If the jurisdiction of the courts is subject to political manipulation and incursion,judicial independence is called into question. For example, non- transparent criteria/qualifications for judicial appointments can be a way of undermining judicial independence. Inadequate budgets for the judiciary and inadequate control over expenditures Judiciaries with inadequate budgets cannot provide the salaries, benefits and pensions necessary to retain qualified candidates and discourage corruption. Budgetary distribution can sometimes be arbitrary and lacking in transparency and allocation of resources can be politically influenced. Poor financial planning exacerbates these problems. The failure of the judiciary to present its financial needs in a professional and comprehensive manner weakens its ability to acquire the necessary resources. Independent control of the budget is also necessary to ensure that the needs of the judiciary are met. 84 Programming for Justice: Access for All 29 Interference can come from various sources,the executive,legislature,local governments,individual government officials or legislators,political parties,political and economic elites,the military,paramilitary and intelligence forces,criminal networks and the judicial hierarchy itself. Independence issues can be particularly evident in countries where the Ministry of Justice has a controlling influence over the judiciary. 30 A judicial officer and prosecutor must act independently,and without fear of retaliation when engaged in the authorized discharge of his or her duties. Restore Public Trust and the Credibility of the Judiciary Eliminating judicial corruption is not enough if courts and judges are still perceived as corrupt by litigants and the general population.A monitoring system could be put in place to assist in restoring the credibility of the judiciary. For example, independent groups of counsels could evaluate court proceedings, provide feedback to the bench and their assessments could be made public. In addition, judicial conduct commissions could be established enabling breaches of ethics to be reported and dealt with accordingly. Inadequate mechanisms for judicial appointment In many countries the problems of judicial independence stem from the selection and appointment of judges. If, for example, appointments are made for political or personal motives, or through non-transparent procedures, judges become vulnerable to external influence. Lack of security of tenure and unclear disciplinary mechanisms When judges are arbitrarily or easily removed from their positions, they are much more vulnerable to internal or external pressures in their consideration of cases.In many countries,the authority,standards and procedures for disciplining and removing judges are unclear and non-transparent. Deficient law school training, judicial training and continuing legal education Deficient legal training is a significant obstacle to the development of an independent judiciary. In order for judges to apply the law impartially they must know and understand it well, otherwise they may be susceptible to outside pressures. For example, they may be influenced by bad legal arguments or if they have poor appreciation of the doctrine of judicial independence they may submit to executive direction when they should not.Judicial schools controlled by the executive are also a threat to judicial independence. Judicial reform aimed at strengthening judicial independence could meet with strong opposition Efforts for reform may meet with resistance from the legislature, the executive, political parties, special interest groups,judicial hierarchy and other self-interested groups. The tension between independence and accountability Judicial independence and judicial accountability are often believed to stand in irreconcilable opposition. Independence frees the judiciary from external control over its decisions. On the other hand, accountability focuses on having mechanisms in place which require the judiciary to explain its decisions, often to external bodies or assessors. To ease the tension between accountability and independence, a mechanism should be developed that is not vulnerable to misuse by the executive or other influences. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhance the Independence of the Courts Reform of the judicial appointment,promotion and transfer process The development and application of distinct selection criteria and procedures should be undertaken to assist in the selection and appointment of judges. Criteria for judicial appointments should be objective,clear,and made accessible to the public. A broadly representative selection body such as a judicial council can be an effective mechanism to screen candidates.31 However, it is necessary to minimize the potential for politicization of such a screening body and ensure that members have the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64b52f5d-3be4-48d4-af5a-f5d70655b75c": {"__data__": {"id_": "64b52f5d-3be4-48d4-af5a-f5d70655b75c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e335ad00ace398bfe2505196bf17c5dd7004a1915a59392e24c756704dc499c"}}, "hash": "8e335ad00ace398bfe2505196bf17c5dd7004a1915a59392e24c756704dc499c", "text": "requisite experience, abilities, and/or training to assess the qualifications of candidates.Any method of judicial selection and promotion should be based on merit. It is crucial to build in transparency at every stage of the process so that the public is informed and the risk of political manipulation is reduced. Support the development of codes of ethics These can be valuable to the extent that they stimulate debate and discussion and understanding among judges, as well as the general public about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable conduct. Because debate and discussion of ethical issues are among the most important results of a code of ethics, the process of developing such a code of conduct can be as important as the final product. Enforcement mechanisms for a code of ethics also need to be addressed. 85 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies Judicial Councils In many countries, judicial councils or commissions have been established to improve the process of judicial selection. In civil law countries, these bodies are generally called \u2018judicial councils\u2019 or \u2018high councils of the magistracy\u2019. In common law countries, they are generally called \u2018judicial service commissions\u2019. The role of judicial councils varies from one country to the next. Some judicial councils have oversight or even primary responsibility for the full range of issues related to the management of the judiciary, including administration of the court system. Others are focused primarily on appointment, evaluation, training, and/or discipline of judges, and do not take on administration. The membership of judicial councils often includes representatives of several different institutions, in order to provide an effective check on outside influence over the judiciary or to reduce Supreme Court control over the rest of the judiciary. The judiciary itself frequently has one or more representative. Often the executive has its own members. In some countries, the legislature, private bar and law schools may be included. Adapted from USAID,\u201cGuidance for Promoting Judicial Independence and Impartiality\u201d, Revised Edition,January 2002 31 Other methods include selection by the executive or the legislature,election of the judiciary (with a system for retaining judges who have been once elected) or competitive examination. Develop the leadership necessary for judicial independence Training of entry level judges as well as more senior judges to strengthen their commitment to judicial independence and their abilities to resist public pressure can assist judges when they have to make unpopular decisions in controversial cases. Such programmes are also useful in developing good working relationships and helping to identify potential reformers within the system. Strengthen security of tenure as a fundamental safeguard of judicial independence Judges need to have guaranteed tenure until a mandatory retirement age or the expiry of their term of office, which should not be subject to government interference. Judges should be removed only if an independent investigation with formal proceedings and procedural protections recommends removal on the grounds of professional misconduct (i.e., corruption or incompetence). Provide non-monetary incentives Judges and court staff should be provided with adequate monetary remuneration, however non- monetary incentives can also encourage improved performance, for example, providing opportunities for additional training. Training programmes for judges and staff should be included in budgeting and planning Success in gaining a budget allocation for training programmes is more likely if resource needs are well documented, all court levels participate in identifying needs, and a strategic approach is developed to defend those needs to the Ministry of Justice. Effective judicial reform requires hard facts Poor diagnosis of problems increases the likelihood of reform failure. Measuring and analyzing demand for an independent judiciary is an important area of inquiry,as is the development of statistical systems to measure the performance of the judicial system. Polls and sectoral surveys of judges and the public can be an effective tool for gathering information and can be used as part of a media strategy or for coalition building itself. The statistics generated by good case tracking and information systems not only allow courts to better manage their operations, but they also enable outside watchdogs to observe trends and identify aberrations. External monitoring mechanisms can be a powerful tool for enhancing the independence of the judiciary Public review, discussion and debate are all necessary checks on the judiciary to ensure impartiality, transparency and accountability. However, external monitoring can also have its deficiencies, for example, an irresponsible public statement by a member of civil society can have the effect of politicizing the judiciary. Promoting societal respect for the role of an independent judiciary If a society expects and demands an independent judiciary it will most likely get one. However, if expectations are low, the likelihood that the judiciary will", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d65ce75-3ad5-4107-857d-203ddc0df774": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d65ce75-3ad5-4107-857d-203ddc0df774", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Programming for Justice: Access for All", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/programming-justice-access-all", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5802fe67115436be40dc09b007cdbf093f385484c789194bdcad5a9597b0e298"}}, "hash": "5802fe67115436be40dc09b007cdbf093f385484c789194bdcad5a9597b0e298", "text": "operate fairly is equally low. Legal empowerment and legal literacy interventions can be successful in developing constituencies that place such demands on actors within the judicial and political institutions (see Chapter 5). Clarifying links,separating powers and developing cooperation The judiciary, the prosecution service, the police and other justice sector agencies can contribute to the strengthening of judicial independence by respecting the role and function of the judiciary and by working in cooperation with it. The judiciary should be accountable to the public for its decisions and operations Judicial independence does not render judges free from public accountability,however the media,and other institutions should be aware of the potential for conflict between judicial independence and the monitoring of judicial activities. Accountability requires that clear criteria be developed by which courts, individual judges, and others are held accountable. Developing judicial accountability and integrity without interference is critical to ensuring that the judiciary is able to fulfil its role and hold governments accountable. E. ACCESSIBILITY Accessibility refers to the right of every person to access an independent and impartial court and the opportunity to receive a fair and just trial with a view to providing an effective remedy to a grievance. Impediments to such access can be numerous, including high court costs, delays, inadequate normative framework and improperly narrow interpretation of laws by the judiciary, restrictive jurisdictional rules, overly complex regulations, language barriers, geographical proximity, ineffective enforcement mechanisms, 86 Programming for Justice: Access for All security of would-be litigants and corruption. It is also linked to judicial independence and legal literacy.32 Accessibility is a pre-requisite to justice for all. Many of the world\u2019s poor have difficulty accessing their legal systems and face unfair decisions, intimidation, high costs, and the risk of productive time lost in proceedings they feel they cannot win. Those living in rural areas, as well as those with claims that are small for the court system but important to the claimant, and those who need speedy justice, can find the courts completely inaccessible. While this chapter is looking at accessibility from the side of the provider, many issues relating to accessibility are also covered in the capacity to seek justice section of the Guide in Chapter 5. Also specific challenges of accessibility for disadvantaged groups are discussed in Chapter 6. Challenges to Ensuring Accessibility of the Court System Court costs are too high for people to seek a remedy Many people cannot afford to go to court and are therefore deprived of a judicial remedy. Legal aid systems usually apply only to criminal matters. Family, property and civil matters are not covered and access to justice with respect to them is effectively denied because of the expense and complexity of such cases. For example, as family law issues are generally not covered by legal aid, women often suffer disproportionately from the high costs of litigation and legal services and have to represent themselves in complex legal matters. The costs involved in obtaining a judgement are proportionally more expensive for small amount disputes, creating a further impediment. A system needs to be put in place a system where access to an effective legal remedy is also affordable for small claimants. The lack of clarity in the normative framework on the justice dimensions of social, economic and cultural rights This prevents people from seeking remedies through the courts for violation of rights,and leads to the failure of the State to fulfil their obligations in relation to such rights. (For further discussion on this see the section on Normative Protection in Chapter 3). Restrictive rules of \u2018standing\u2019act as a barrier to accessing justice \u2018Standing\u2019 is fundamental to access to justice. Standing is a party\u2019s right to make a legal claim. In essence, the question of standing is whether the litigant is entitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues. Often the argument is improperly used that restrictive rules of standing guard against a flood of litigation or against damaging and meddlesome interference. Complex regulations and procedures are alien and off-putting to the majority of the population Poorly trained or unhelpful court staff can also inhibit people from referring their claim to a court. Court support staff are the first point of contact for most people entering the court system and they should assist people in their attempt to access the court system. Geographical and physical barriers Those living in rural and remote areas sometimes find the courts and legal services inaccessible due to remoteness and poor transportation.

Further, there are fewer lawyers in rural and remote areas as these areas are less able to attract well-trained legal professionals. Cultural and linguistic barriers For people from culturally and/or linguistically diverse backgrounds in multicultural and multilingual countries, the judicial system can be too alien or complex for them to understand. For example, there may be no provision of interpreter services and translated legal information materials. There may be a subtle or overt lack of cultural awareness, sensitivity and compassion to the needs of cultural, linguistic and ethnic minorities among judges and legal professionals. Lack of female court staff may be a barrier for women in seeking assistance from the courts in matters such as sexual assaults and domestic violence. Women may be reluctant to try to access the court system if female court staff are not available to hear their complaints. 87 Chapter 4: Capacity to Provide Justice Remedies 32 Though narrow interpretation of the law can be an obstacle,allowing wide discretion in interpretation of the law can also raise problems of accountability. Capacity Development Strategies to Enhancing the Accessibility of the Court System Make courts more accessible Provide support to make courts more accessible through implementing measures such as: \ufffdReducing litigation costs such as bail, transcript, filing and enforcement fees, waiver of court fees; \ufffdProviding defence attorneys at a low cost or for free for those who are unable to pay, introduction of legal aid systems throughout universities and law schools, and encouragement of volunteerism by members of the bar; \ufffdStreamlining rules and procedures for courts to make them more accessible to the public and improving case management to speed up trials; \ufffdEstablishing small claims tribunals or other alternative mechanisms where disputes can be resolved more quickly, cost-efficiently, and less formally, without a lawyer; \ufffdRaising awareness of the different access problems faced by people that may prevent them from seeking out remedies for their grievances; \ufffdMainstreaming gender in the judicial process; \ufffdUsing mobile courts to ensure territorial coverage; \ufffdProviding information about the courts to the public through publications, public notice boards, radio,TV, help lines, ICT etc.; \ufffdPromoting the use of plain language in legislation and legal documentation; use of local languages to conduct trials and publish court records; and publishing of laws and decisions in all major languages; \ufffdEncouraging regular interaction between judges and people of local communities to better understand each other; \ufffdSensitizing judges to the cultural, linguistic and religious needs of minorities; \ufffdIncreasing opportunities for candidates from disadvantaged groups to qualify as judges; \ufffdBetter coordination between courts and other dispute resolution mechanisms; \ufffdProviding secure court premises which are necessary for victims and vulnerable persons (e.g., victims of sexual assault and domestic violence, children, etc.). Witness protection services should be provided to those who file a complaint to protect them from intimidation before their testimony or criminal retaliation after; \ufffdEnsuring that there is no discrimination in the selection of judges and lawyers. Women and minorities should be encouraged to seek judicial office. Rules on standing In order for the right of access to justice to be truly effective,the rules on standing should be sufficient to allow any member of the public having an interest in a matter or being affected or potentially affected by a matter to have the right to make a legal claim. Therefore, support should be provided to the development of inclusive standing tests, rules and procedures. 88 Programming for Justice: Access for All An Example of a Public Litigation Success Story Barse, a journalist, filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the State of Maharashtra in India. Barse argued that women prisoners were being subjected to violence while incarcerated in prisons within the City of Bombay. The Supreme Court ordered a third party to conduct an investigation and issue a report on the findings. As a result of the report, the Supreme Court ordered that women prisoners should only be held in prison cells guarded by female police officers and that a woman officer be present at all times during interrogations. Public Interest Litigation: \u201c\u2026public interest litigation is a collaborative effort on the part of the petitioner,the court and the Government or the public official to see that basic human rights become meaningful for large masses of people. It merely seeks to draw the attention of the authorities to their constitutional and legal obligations to enforce them so that the rule of law does not remain confined in its beneficent effects to a fortunate few, but extends to all, irrespective of their power, position or wealth\u201d.

Public interest litigation should be encouraged as it can help those who are disadvantaged, through third party action, to seek legal redress for human rights violations. Sufficient pool of interpreters There should be enough interpreters, trained to function in courts, who are competent, accredited and available to interpret in the languages needed. Courts should have staff to manage interpreter services. Interpreters should have a professional code of conduct, e.g., they should not interpret for both the witness and the defendant.Judges should ascertain the language competence of litigants to follow court proceedings and order interpreter services when needed. Provide advocacy and support for judicial interpretation and application of laws using international and national human rights frameworks and instruments Such support is necessary especially to promote and protect social, economic and cultural rights. However, unenforceable judgements should be avoided as they can undermine the credibility of the courts. Build political will and encourage local ownership For reform efforts to be successful and sustainable, they must build on solid political will and local ownership. If the judiciary is not brought into the process, or judges feel attacked by the reform process they can become effective opponents. However, once engaged, they can help design and refine programmes based on their pre-eminent understanding of what the challenges to independence are. Reform of the formal justice system is a long-term goal that will require sustained effort on the part of reformers and the UNDP. 4.2.2 PROSECUTORS Prosecutors play a crucial role in the administration of justice,in particular criminal justice.They enjoy a range of statutory positions, which include private lawyers prosecuting public cases, civil servants working for the executive, and prosecutors enjoying the independence of a quasi-judicial status33. Their main responsibilities are to file criminal cases and to prosecute defendants. With the power to request the conditional release of detainees, prosecutors act on behalf of states to protect the rights of all parties, which include the accused and the public, in criminal proceedings. The aim of prosecutors is to help the delivery of justice rather than to punish. They are responsible for investigating both incriminating and exonerating, circumstances. In addition, prosecutors supervise the police in investigating and gathering evidence. They may also be entrusted with supervising the enforcement of the judgments of the courts. The role, duties, and responsibilities of prosecutors are affected by various factors, such as the Constitution, the political system, the legal system and framework in place, international organizations present in the country, ethnic, religious, cultural, and linguistic diversity etc. As their role and duties may differ slightly from one jurisdiction to the other, this section addresses the general principles, challenges, and strategies concerning prosecutors in access to justice programmes. However, as prosecutors are part of the court system, many of the issues addressed in the previous section also concerns prosecutors.34 Prosecutors have a considerable impact on poor and disadvantaged persons\u2019 access to justice. In court proceedings, disadvantaged groups are often uninformed of the notion of their rights under the law, including fundamental human rights, and they seldom locate the appropriate channels to report injustices and gross violations of their fundamental freedoms.
