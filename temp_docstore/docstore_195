Also, the pandemic has resulted, as we showed earlier, in a massive income and health shock for many households, with increases in unemployment and underemployment. Reductions in income and the need for greater health spending will make it difficult for some families to cover education costs.

While girls and boys from the richest households in Lao PDR and the Philippines were almost equally likely to com- plete primary to upper secondary education before COVID-19, girls from the poorest households were much less likely to complete their edu- cation than boys. 76 In Viet Nam, the Peace House, a shelter for women and girl victims of domestic violence and abuse, has received double the usual number of clients since COVID-related measures were introduced. Malaysia reported that calls related to violence against children to the Talian Kasih Helpline increased by 12 percent during the last two weeks of the Movement Control Order/Conditional Movement Control Order compared to the preceding two weeks, while reports of domestic violence nearly tripled. The number of calls and chats to the UNICEF-supported Childline in Thailand increased from just over 500 in January at the onset of COVID-19 to over 4,500 in June. 77 Findings are consistent across countries in the East Asia and Pacific region. A recent survey of 800 girls and adolescents conducted by UNICEF Philippines found that 30 percent of girls felt worried, and 28 percent felt sad. Only 14 percent of girls claimed to have remained calm. A recent survey of more than 600 girls conducted in Viet Nam found that 60 percent of participants felt worried and pressured during the COVID-19 pandemic. A survey conducted by UNICEF Thailand with almost 7,000 participants found that three out of every four female respon- dents reported mental health issues such as stress, boredom, lack of motivation and frustration caused by the lockdown. All three studies found that girls are generally more susceptible to mental health concerns than boys. 78 Among the ASEAN 10, current education expenditure as a share of GDP is the highest in Viet Nam at 5.7 percent, which is an LMIC; in the UMICs of Malaysia (4.8 percent), Thailand (4.1 percent) and Indonesia (3.6 percent) it is lower (Table ET 3). In the LMICs it is even lower: Cambodia 1.6 percent; Lao PDR 2.9 percent; Myanmar 2.2 percent; and the Philippines 2.5 percent. Singapore, which is a high-income country, spends 2.9 percent of GDP on education, and Brunei much more (4.4 percent). Only UMICs in the ASEAN region may need to examine the potential for di- verting some education funding to increase access to the Internet locally, and community access to computers with mobile broadband, where the children could receive community supervision from educated older people. 79 Wang Xiaoxiao, Online Education Development in China to Bridge the Digital Divide, presentation at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Sympo- sium, 7 December 2021. 80 S.

Countries may need to speed up procurement and administration of vaccines faster than has happened so far. There are specific dimensions of health-related in- equality that stem from income inequality. Thus, the be- haviour and choices that put poorer individuals on the front lines of infection during a pandemic are often the product of necessity.84 Many low-wage workers are employed in services deemed essential during the pandemic (such as gro- cery stores and delivery services) or jobs with limited options for remote working. Second, poorer neighbour- hoods are likely to have denser populations and poor housing conditions (lack of adequate water and sani- tation infrastructure), which is more conducive to con- tagion. Third, people in poorer communities also tend to have very little in emergency savings, limiting their ability to reduce work hours to reduce their infection risks (for example, self-employed informal workers, to whom we will turn in a later section). The effect of these choices is dramatic. The model sim- ulations by Dizioli, Andrle and Bluedorn indicate that while a little more than 10 percent of rich households ever get infected by the virus, over half of poor house- holds would become infected over a two-year period.85 These numbers suggest that poor households bear the brunt of the pandemic\u2019s health costs. The main reason for high out-of-pocket health expenditures (which impoverish people) is limited government health spending. This leads to limited health infrastructure.86 Lim- ited infrastructure is the result of relatively limited health expenditures as a share of GDP (as noted above). But the source of inequality is really the private health expenditure, most of which is out of pocket by households.87 Given that a very small proportion of the population have private health insurance, most of this expenditure is households\u2019 own out- of-pocket spending. Inefficiency and inequality in health systems and health outcomes are the result, in the first in- stance, of low public expenditure.88 81 World Bank, East Asia and Pacific Economic Update: Uneven Recovery, Washington, DC, 2021. 82 Al-Sammarai, S., The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Education Financing, World Bank Brief, Washington, DC, May 2020. 83 UNICEF East Asia and Pacific Regional Office, COVID-19 Response Issue Brief (2020): COVID-19 and Girls\u2019 Education in East Asia and Pacific, Bangkok, October 2020. 84 A.

Table 7 shows that none of the ASEAN countries reach even half of that level, though Brunei is the highest at 2.7 (China 4.34). In Singapore it was 2.4, and in Viet Nam 2.6. In the UMICs, in Thailand it was 2.1, in Malaysia it was 1.9, and in Indonesia 1.04. In the LMICs, Cambodia 0.84, Lao PDR 1.04, Myanmar 0.9 and the Philippines 1.0. 87 Total private and public spending on health was in the range of 5.92 percent in Viet Nam at the highest end, and 2.25 percent in Lao PDR (see Table ET4). In no ASEAN country is the private share lower than 49 percent (Lao PDR), with the exception of Brunei, a high-income country, where it was only 5 percent of total current health expenditure in 2018. Thailand is an exception, where the private share is 23.4 percent. But in the rest of ASEAN at least half of all health expenditure is private, which is a great source of inequality. 88 S.

Two important policy measures can help alleviate the epidemic\u2019s con- siderable impact on poor households until effective vaccines and therapeutics are widely available and pro- vided to all who need them. First, improving information on the pandemic\u2019s spread and containment with widespread testing enhance the ability to identify and isolate new cases, reducing in- fection risks. The latest rapid tests are affordable; the World Health Organization recently negotiated a price of US$5 per test,89 and with scaled-up demand and pro- duction, prices could drop to US$1 or less.90 Mass testing could reduce the pandemic\u2019s spread and bring it under control, especially when combined with mask-wearing, hand-washing and physical distancing.

The simulation also shows that when no asymptomatic infectious people are tested and the virus spreads unde- tected, the drop in GDP is a staggering 15 percent in the first year for the representative economy. The loss shrinks to just 3.3 percent of GDP if 50 percent of asymptomatic infectious people are identified through testing and iso- late to reduce the spread.92 With the potential to avoid large GDP losses and the comparatively low and declining costs of rapid tests, the returns from widespread testing combined with mask-wearing, hand-washing and physical distanc- ing are enormous. This approach could also reduce some of the inequities made worse by the pandemic, helping poor and more vulnerable households better weather the crisis. Second, governments may wish to carry out large-scale representative sample surveys among the adult popu- lation to find out the share of the population that has been infected; in other words, conduct seropositivity surveys. A high proportion of the population with virus antibodies would suggest that the population is moving towards herd immunity, even though vaccination rates are still low. However, high seropositivity in the popula- tion should not mean that there is scope for any laxity in the speed of vaccination. Third, health inequality in ASEAN is generally the result of limited public health infrastructure and burdensome private health expenditure (mostly out of pocket, due to limited coverage by health insurance). Without increas- ing public spending on health, private expenses cannot fall; such expenses can exacerbate inequality and pov- erty at the time of a once-in-a-century pandemic. Fur- ther, until effective vaccines and therapeutics are widely available and provided to all who need them, improving information on the pandemic\u2019s spread and containment with widespread testing enhance the ability to identify and isolate new cases, reducing infection risks. Fourth, public investment in strengthening health care systems (particularly primary health care) will need to be a greater priority when public health infrastruc- ture is strengthened based on increased government spending on health. A stronger primary health care system would significantly contribute to early detec- tion, testing and curbing transmission. In other words, this greater focus on the primary, preventive health care system as well as on basic curative care ser- vices could prepare the ASEAN region for other health crises in the future, which may arise due to climate change or other causes. An additional dimension of public health spending is that an overwhelming share of it may be allocated to curative care (e.g. around two thirds in Indonesia, with the rest being split equally be- tween preventive and other spending).93 Fifth, the need for health system digitization has be- come urgent. It can have several dimensions: digitiz- ing logistics to ensure availability of essential drugs and vaccines; digitizing health records of all individuals across the country; and encouraging telemedicine. This can improve the distribution of essential medical sup- plies in remote locations. Sixth, migrants all over the world, including in ASEAN, have been disproportionately more vulnerable to the risk of COVID infection and have had much less access to vaccination and treatment than country nationals. 89 Financial Times, WHO to offer 120m cheap coronavirus tests to developing world, 2021, https://www.ft.com/content/cd10aef3-f10d-427f-af40- aecb8c625535. 90 See http://www.rapidtests.org/. 91 A.

Poverty rates are higher in rural than urban areas. One element of this inequality is the gap between rural and urban incomes, which contributes to rela- tively higher income inequality. Moreover, the major- ity of people living in rural areas are engaged in agri- culture, where incomes tend to be low and unstable; and the vast majority have no or little social security (see Table 9). The proportion of the rural population in the ASEAN 10 varies enormously, from as low as 22 percent in Brunei and 23 percent in Malaysia to 64 percent in Lao PDR and over 75 percent in Cam- bodia (Table 9).

The primary risks to food security are at the country level: higher retail prices, combined with reduced incomes, mean more and more households are having to cut down on the quantity and quality of their food consumption. Rising food prices have a greater impact on people in low- and middle-in- come countries, since they spend a larger share of their income on food than people in high-income countries. SUGGESTIONS FOR POLICY Dealing with the impact on women and children in ag- riculture. The impact of COVID-19 on the agriculture sector has had differential impacts on different popu- lation groups. Due to the predominance of women as market food vendors, many of them were also forced to significantly reduce the price of their goods and oper- ating capacity so that they could cover the cost of their household necessities. As a result, negative impacts on household nutrition and food security outcomes have been observed.103 Moreover, although women officially make up over a third of workers in the agriculture sector in ASEAN, they hold only 13 percent of agricultural land.104 Operational- ly, men and women may share roles in resource man- agement responsibilities. However, this legal bias of not owning land is problematic when female migrant work- ers return home and intend to start farm production ac- tivities but cannot exercise control over their resources due to the absence of their male counterparts. Policies to empower women through greater access to resourc- es, such as land, need to coincide with COVID-19 re- lief efforts to present women with the independence of household decision-making. Also, investments should be made to create an enabling environment to reduce the care burden on women. Dietary shifts towards starch-based diets, highlighted by FAO and others,105 if sustained, are likely to further exac- erbate already high rates of stunting in children under 5 years old and anaemia among women. In poorer ASEAN Member States, and poorer households in particular, such dietary shifts could have longer-term adverse impacts on maternal and child health, with knock-on complications for the incidence of stunting, mental health issues and edu- cational attainment prospects. Achieving a \u2018nutrition ade- quate\u2019 diet will be a challenge for ASEAN. Actions to improve agricultural productivity and re- lieve rural distress.

Second, governments could consider re- placing input subsidies and output subsidies with direct income support for farming households.

In rural areas, the transformation of agri-food systems presents an opportunity for some of the poorest smallholders, who are not well integrated into food value chains.109 In Southeast Asia, rural pov- erty among smallholders is exacerbated by the lack of access to productive resources and poor market integration, further compounded by climate-related and economic shocks, as well as periodic plant and animal disease outbreaks. In this region, the integra- tion of poor smallholders into food value chains has been facilitated through public\u2013private\u2013producer partnerships that provide opportunities to overcome poverty and structural inequalities, especially where reinforced by improved governance mechanisms and multi-stakeholder platforms.110 More accessible services for better rural\u2013urban con- nectivity\u2014which is digitally enabled\u2014are being pro- moted by the FAO across Asia. In 2021, the 1,000 Digi- tal Village Initiative started\u2014a global initiative currently being rolled out in over 12 countries, the majority of which are in ASEAN. The FAO is supporting digital vil- lage readiness assessments and piloting best practices with the aim of enabling, supporting and accelerating the digitization of villages in Asia.111 Finally, Ramirez suggests, as does a partnership net- work of 11 rural development organizations working mainly in Southeast Asia, that there should be increased development financing and investment for responsive small-scale infrastructure and the harmonization of bor- der facilities supportive of smallholders\u2019 participation in agricultural value chains (i.e. minimum storage, pack- aging, trading equipment, market information).112 This would require renewed support to the ASEAN Guide- lines to Develop Agri-cooperatives. This also implies rural revitalization as a policy priority and infrastructure investment to improve the economic 106 Ibid. 107 ASEAN, ASEAN ministerial meeting on rural development and poverty eradication, Singapore, 19 August 2020, https://asean.org/wp-content/ uploads/2021/09/AMRDPE-Joint-Statement-on-COVID-19_adopted_9Nov2020.pdf. 108 Statista, ASEAN countries: Urbanization from 2010 to 2020, 2021, https://www.statista.com/statistics/804503/urbanization-in-the-ase- an-countries/. 109 However, changes are possible. For instance, in Indonesia in 2017, the total production and value of cocoa had fallen by 70 percent from its peak in 2009, hitting smallholders\u2019 incomes and livelihoods particularly hard. In 2014, in an effort to reduce the number of cocoa farmers living below the poverty line and empower them to engage in a more efficient and resilient cocoa supply chain, a multi-stakeholder \u2018whole of value chain\u2019 approach was introduced. The public\u2013private\u2013producer partnership approach engaging 150,000 smallholders included, among others, increased access to financing and productivity-enhancing technologies, product certification to capture premium prices, improved primary processing, and the establishment of farmer organizations. Over a five-year period, cocoa yields increased by 73 percent, while em- powered smallholders saw their incomes increase by more than 200 percent (FAO, WFP and UNICEF, The State Food Security and Nutrition in the World, Rome, 2021). 110 In Viet Nam, about half a million mostly poor smallholder farmers earn their livelihoods from coffee production. In mid-2020, coffee prices had plummeted by 48 percent from a peak in late 2016, before recovering but remaining volatile (FAO, WFP and UNICEF, The State Food Security and Nutrition in the World, Rome, 2021). To help reduce smallholder vulnerability to both economic and climate-related shocks, provincial and district-level coffee boards were established to assist smallholders with improved technologies and good environmental practices in coffee production. Now coffee is certified for a premium on producer prices, while also strengthening the resilience of coffee growers to climate shocks and future economic shocks. 111 A.

It also demands the assessment of the need for digital solutions and opportunities, to strike the right balance between nationwide digital infrastructure deployment and digital literacy/awareness within the rural development context. However, none of this is possible without strengthening the role of local and governmental institutions through capacity- building measures and maintaining the competency of institutional actors. This should include measures to: \u2022 empower rural farmers and ensure inclusion of small- scale producers in the value chain; \u2022 enhance capacity in territorial rural development planning; \u2022 foster rural\u2013urban connectivity and design an integrated rural\u2013urban development strategy; and \u2022 promote a sense of ownership and identify local champions to ensure successful implementation of programmes. Digitalization also plays a crucial role in resolving the urban\u2013rural divide. To ensure that rural communities are not left behind, it is vital to raise awareness and enhance the digital capacities of rural communities. Nationwide strategies on digitalization need to be coupled with identification of specific needs of rural communities to ensure impactful interventions. At the regional level, ASEAN might consider establishing a fund to support empowerment of rural people\u2019s organizations. Moreover, as ASEAN is currently in the process of developing a masterplan on rural development, it is suggested that the masterplan should promote a comprehensive and cross-sectoral approach in transforming rural areas, especially addressing the nexus between agriculture, food security and rural development. 113 Taken from Group 1 discussions at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium, 7 December 2021. The discussion in previous sections has highlighted the prevalence of inequality, both high and rising, across the ASEAN region. It has also underlined that inequal- ities existed even prior to the pandemic, and were exacerbated by it. This not only creates obstacles for recovery out of the pandemic but also poses a risk of inequalities worsening further. First, we have made policy suggestions for the socio-eco- nomic revival of ASEAN countries. This needs to be car- ried out in two phases: an exit strategy for recovery out of the pandemic to attain the pre-COVID status, and then to improve the situation thereafter. Second, prioritization across the policy suggestions is the key to attaining the requisites for a successful and timely exit strategy. We divide the policy suggestions into short-term strategies and medium-to-long-term structural adjustments. This will help ASEAN Mem- ber States safeguard against immediate and urgent COVID-related vulnerabilities and also strengthen the socio-economic base to recover better. Third, the exit strategy needs to be tested in the interim through performance feedback. Such analysis requires that there be a set of exit indicators\u2014i.e. a set of socio-econom- ic indicators that need to be generated and monitored by THEME 5: THE DATA REQUIREMENTS TO MONITOR INDICATORS TO MANAGE THE CRISIS The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 29 each country. We present these indicators in Exit Tables 1\u201312. An important discussion in this regard relates to the availability of data on selected indicators, the ab- sence of which hinders the entire exercise and is thus a serious impediment to effective policy analysis and implementation. Let us begin by discussing the exit strategies, which are intimately linked to the exit indicators (identified in the Exit Indicators Tables). As posited earlier, the strategy to recover from the pandemic should reflect its effec- tiveness through a series of indicators. They are dis- cussed below. EXIT STRATEGIES The first exit strategy is health-related: to contain the COVID-19 caseload. The requisite indicators are the number of new cases per 1,000 population and the proportion of the population who have received the first and second vaccinations against COVID-19. In 2021, the Delta variant contributed to a rapid rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in parts of Asia, causing a severe strain on the health care infrastructure in some countries. Vaccination rates are relatively low in many Asian countries, compared to China or India, leading to fears that the virus will continue to spread. Since the middle of 2021, the case numbers have risen particular- ly in some countries. The Delta variant identified world- wide was the source of the spread of COVID-19 globally in 2021.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5fac40c-4026-4595-abfb-a87304495bfc": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5fac40c-4026-4595-abfb-a87304495bfc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdfa498dd41e792e04186a13bc5cde0b71420e2c72a489d01289efdd079d53ba"}, "2": {"node_id": "dc6abd6d-449c-4519-92fa-f6524af110e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "30844a47d8a594260e348ebd80b4b4b6075f38f5c9a04389adb62caba0367f2d"}}, "hash": "37711a6cc40ce45bc4ae36e4905b8590da446d5cb706d4a4de79cb9b6f83ea4e", "text": "However, 2021 ended with the appearance of another variant, Omicron, which spreads more rapidly than Delta, although it is thought to be causing less se- verity of disease among those who are vaccinated; this has created a new uncertainty.

The reason for this is that with GDP growth down, the fiscal situation is adversely impacted in all countries. Yet at the same time, the pressures on governments to increase expen- ditures on health, education and cash transfers, among other demands, has only heightened, not reduced. In other words, just when the capacity of government to generate revenues is reduced, the demands on it to spend more have grown. As noted earlier, govern- ments in the region have taken exemplary action with the size of the fiscal stimulus (or above-the-line) mea- sures in 2020. However, the pressure to borrow more will increase, from international sources for the LMICs and domestic sources for the UMICs. Hence the need to monitor these indicators. The third exit strategy is employment generation, with quarter-on-quarter job growth being the most sig- nificant indicator. This indicator depends on whether quarterly labour force surveys are currently conducted regularly. If not, they may need to be started. Another important indicator under this strategy is real wages at least in the major employing sectors of the economy, which will vary by country. The availability of these da- ta is again dependent on regular labour force surveys being conducted across the economy. This is especially important because while companies might report data regularly to the Ministry of Finance or central bank, the informal economy is very large (as mentioned earlier). Labour force surveys among households (as opposed to informal enterprises) may reveal the real situation on the ground in respect of consumption demand, in the present and in the near future. Once employment re- vives, investment in human development is the key to sustainability. The fourth exit strategy is thus human development, indicated through government expenditure on educa- tion and health, with a special focus on child nutrition. Data on quarterly government education expenditure and its distribution by level of education are needed because, as the economy recovers, schools will re- open, but children who fell behind in learning or those who were so impoverished that they never returned to school can be helped. Hence, education expenditure cannot fall at any level of education. Further, we have seen that if public health spending becomes squeezed or receives less priority as the pandemic recedes, cit- izens may not be in a position to reduce their out-of- pocket costs, which have become a burden on house- holds without health coverage or health insurance, especially those who are informally employed. Earlier sections showed how private health expenditure is very high in most countries in the region. Public health ex- penditure will need to increase and be monitored in real time to offset out-of-pocket expenses and mitigate pov- erty and inequality. The previous section noted that food security has been especially impacted as a result of COVID-19. The effect of reduced food availability and falling incomes is felt by young children and shows up in child wasting\u2014a sign of acute distress (as opposed to chronic undernutrition among children). It is a fast-changing indicator. Howev- er, it is unclear how frequently these data are collect- ed in each country (the data we found were relatively dated). The bilateral and multilateral agencies could support sentinel site surveillance of child wasting in re- The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 30 gions where there is a risk. Thus, in the remote islands of archipelagos of the region it is possible that vulner- able subregions are facing undetected child wasting (see Table 14). The fifth exit strategy relates to digitalization of the ASEAN region. Digital access/penetration among in- dividuals is an important exit strategy indicator. Data gaps persist, at least at the international level (though the same data may be available at national level, we have no way of confirming this data availability). We show the latest available values for each indicator. However, information disaggregated by rural vs. urban area or by gender was often not available to the au- thor, although significant efforts were made to collect it. Hence our analysis is limited by the lack of data disag- gregated by location and gender. Implementing an exit strategy is a time-consuming ex- ercise and has lagged effects, especially with respect to human development investments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4dcecab3-515c-4382-817c-3d3ae4f66203": {"__data__": {"id_": "4dcecab3-515c-4382-817c-3d3ae4f66203", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "REDUCING INEQUALITY IN THE DECADE OF ACTION TO ACHIEVE THE SDGS AND ACCELERATE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b889d250f5639931a982b5d13047860ef692d3a002be0ed7d3494415e3a95cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0f60b39-ecc4-4f79-8c06-703fe99e4f03", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/reducing-inequality-decade-action-achieve-sdgs-and-accelerate-post-pandemic-recovery", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48558dc1b3e5f667031e0f41a26a660c7d0b4b9b2347badf4cf9659ba2e64d5e"}}, "hash": "0447d1d97c19491b513d625fa40b77da9e1ea33d0f6091a98382d5d07ab69787", "text": "A short-term strat- egy is thus called for, to tackle the urgency due to the pandemic.

It is, therefore, neces- sary to monitor public expenditure on social protection, given that expanding social protection is fundamental to a robust recovery. Huge gaps exist with respect to data availability for major indicators such as wages, job growth and even GDP per capita, quarter-on-quarter. It is strongly rec- ommended that efforts be made to make data available in a more regular and timely fashion. They must be gen- erated quickly if they are not already being generated. In most cases, the fast-moving indicators should cut across a variety of economic and human development indicators. Data should also be made available across gender and location. Two data sources can be used to help in understand- ing inequality in access to services and opportunities: Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and Demo- graphic and Health Surveys (DHS). UNESCAP has used these surveys, implemented in eight ASEAN countries, to build the Dissimilarity Index, an index to measure inequality of opportunity among groups.114 Countries could use this analysis or conduct it at local level to un- derstand the scale of inequality.115 In summary, there is a need to enhance statistical sys- tems and the availability of data to monitor progress, design targeted interventions and enhance account- ability. Policymakers, for instance, should know in which areas progress has been made, which groups are furthest behind and which types of programme should be designed. ASEAN Member States should also use opportunities arising from technology such as big data in collecting, managing and presenting data. 114 Ermina Sokou (UNESCAP), presentation at the 6th ASEAN\u2013China\u2013UNDP Symposium, 7 December 2021. 115 Similarly, Wang Xu (Guizhou University), in a presentation at the Symposium, discussed public data analysis and collection based on the Guizhou model. Big data are a new means to understand complex systems, contribute to economic growth, ensure national security and im- prove governance capacity. Guizhou was established as the national big data comprehensive experimental zone in 2016 and is considered a leader in the digital economy in China. Guizhou Province has built a precision poverty alleviation big data support platform, collected over 25 million poverty alleviation data to realize interoperability, sharing, automatic comparison, real-time update and automatic early warning. Big data have helped in water conservancy, poverty alleviation and advancing commerce. They have also been applied in the context of COVID-19.

The global economic and public health cost of air pollutants is estimated to be US$2.9trn annually or 3.3% of global GDP (2018).5 However, the impacts of air pollution are unevenly distributed. This holds true for both low-income and high-income countries. Informal economy workers, Indigenous Peoples, women and low-income families are exposed to far greater levels of pollutants, than other groups. The health impacts of air pollution put future generations at risk. Air pollution can have significant consequences for maternal and neonatal health, adversely affecting fertility, increasing the risk of preterm births and leading to a higher incidence of infant and maternal mortality, birth defects and breast cancer. Falling birth rates could lead to a reduction in the labour force in the coming years, with knock-on effects for future economic growth. Health impacts of air pollution on the economy. Labour productivity can be adversely affected by air pollution as rising incidences of air pollution-related illnesses lead to increased absenteeism. Poor air quality has proven impacts too, on agricultural production. Consumer-facing businesses report substantially less revenue as customers stay indoors when air quality is poor. The most sought- after workers tend to shun cities and countries where air pollution is high. The lack of uniform regulatory frameworks and standardised data contributes to the challenge of addressing air pollution in Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5043a333-288d-46c1-9c4c-0f2e11f5c967": {"__data__": {"id_": "5043a333-288d-46c1-9c4c-0f2e11f5c967", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "576d7378752c454f00bcb0dbc9d7297f77f45f46adfec176d684077240685d0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "cc3aae4f-3dda-4905-8dcb-323538501732", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5c8e8ad5fe22e267b33d3037eff6e723a90f1e7ce7623d8353cd73c469cbbfb"}}, "hash": "42b8d252c21bd253d8508989fdaaf38bf61caef2aa4f3f5a97cd8abd729a9b9b", "text": "The problem of inconsistency in regulatory frameworks among Asian countries is a key obstacle to collaboration in the region.

Key recommendations Clean air must be recognised as a basic human right and priority policy objective. Classifying clean air as a human right changes the perspective with which governments and civil society treat this issue. Rooting clean air policy in human rights gives greater urgency to Approximately 92% of Asia-Pacific\u2019s population is exposed to levels of air pollution that violate the human right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.1 Yet, air pollution does not affect everyone equally. Polluted air disproportionately impacts low-skilled workers, workers in the informal sector, Indigenous Peoples, women and children. Air pollution also has negative implications for economies across the region, including loss of potential economic output (3.3% of global GDP, 2018), reduced productivity among workers and increased health care costs.2 Moreover, businesses located in countries with high levels of air pollution may face restricted access to capital markets. Businesses may also find it difficult to recruit from a global talent pool, which has grown increasingly mobile, health-conscious and environmentally aware. Given the extent and criticality of the issue, research is urgently required into the root causes of air pollution and potential solutions. Among other prescriptions, this report concludes that governments must address clean air as a priority policy objective, rooted in the State\u2019s duty to protect human rights. In this context, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) offer a useful framework to delineate the State\u2019s responsibility to protect the right to clean air and provide access to remedy when abuses have occurred.3 Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda begins by examining the extent of the air pollution challenge in the region. Following this, the report highlights the major sources of air pollution in Asia and explores the cost implications for the region\u2019s economies and people. The report then outlines challenges to formulating air pollution policy and charts mitigation measures already in place. The report concludes by exploring the link between air pollution and human rights, and demonstrating how international human rights instruments enable a rights-based approach to addressing environmental violations. Importantly, the report outlines how the three-pillared framework of the UNGPs might be applied to effectively overcome the air pollution challenge. Key findings The problem of air pollution is particularly severe in the rapidly growing urban centres of Asia. Mounting scientific evidence has brought the magnitude of the air pollution problem into focus along with the long- term economic and health consequences of prolonged exposure to unhealthy air. Asia is disproportionately affected, with South and East Asia home to 49 of the 50 most polluted cities worldwide.4 iii due diligence to better understand the human rights risks they pose through the air pollution emissions of their operations and supply chains. The challenge of air pollution can be addressed through focused State interventions using the UNGPs as a framework. The solutions to curbing air pollution are well-understood, though measures are difficult to coordinate in practice. The UNGPs can help by providing a framework for enabling State action to address air pollution-related human rights impacts. States should implement laws to monitor air quality and its impact on health, and develop laws and regulations to improve air quality ensuring adequate compliance monitoring and enforcement mechanisms. States should also collaborate with different stakeholders in developing solutions to air pollution, educate businesses and civil society to bring about behavioural change and devise incentives and disincentives to promote more sustainable actions. Lastly, States should ensure adequate access to remedies for affected populations. actions that might mitigate air pollution and generates additional impetus for civil society to demand remedies in courts of law.6 However, while air pollution litigation is on the rise, there are few States in Asia that recognise the right to clean air. Businesses must work to prevent, mitigate and remedy air-pollution-related impacts resulting from their business operations. Businesses have a responsibility to respect human rights, irrespective of their size, location or industry. In Asia, 82% of total urban ambient air pollution resulting from PM2.5 originates from man-made sources such as fossil fuel burning (for electricity generation and transport fuels), agricultural burning, waste burning and industrial operations. It is critical for businesses to understand any adverse impacts of their operations and take steps to mitigate air pollution resulting both directly and indirectly from their operations.

Moving from grey skies to blue: why the noise now? Air pollution is a long-standing environmental issue. However, over the past decade, mounting scientific evidence has cast a spotlight on the long-term economic and health consequences of prolonged exposure to air pollution. Among the most important features of the science include: + The magnitude of the problem: Close to 99% of the global population is exposed to air that does not meet WHO air quality standards. Middle-income countries have experienced an alarming rise in air pollution levels as a result of rapid urbanisation and economic development, most of which rely on the burning of fossil fuels. Consequently, middle-income countries also account for more than 80% of global deaths resulting from air pollution. In 2019, air pollution was the third leading cause of premature mortality worldwide. Chart 1: Global ranking of risk factors by the total number of deaths, 2019 Source: Health Effects Institute (2020), State of Global Air 2020. Special Report.17 On April 3rd 2020, residents of Jalandhar, India, a city in the northern state of Punjab woke to the majestic sight of the glimmering Himalayan peaks against a backdrop of clear blue skies. So rare was this phenomenon that Himachal Tourism\u2014the regional government\u2019s official tourism body\u2014posted it as a leading news story of the day. The headline read simply, \u201cJalandhar residents have a view of snow-capped mountains.\u201d8,9 According to experts, the sighting of these mountains, some 200km from the city, was due to an unexpected shift in the air quality from \u201chazardous\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d. A national lockdown imposed from March 25th 2020 to help control the spread of the covid-19 virus resulted in the immediate suspension of all transport and construction activities, drastically reducing air pollution in urban areas across the country. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that close to 99%10 of the global population is exposed to unhealthy air. While air pollution is a challenge in many cities across the world, the problem is much more severe in Asia. Approximately four billion people\u201492% of the Asia-Pacific region\u2019s population\u2014are exposed to levels of air pollution that pose a significant risk to their health.11 South and East Asian locations emerge as the most polluted, with Bangladesh, China, India, and Pakistan sharing 49 of the 50 most polluted cities worldwide and experiencing the worst air quality in the region.12 Key sources of air pollution in Asia include particulate matter emissions from the burning of fossil fuels\u2014for electricity generation and transportation fuel\u2014and agricultural crop burning, among others. Even with the reduction of economic activity due to covid-19 lockdowns, 32% of cities in India, 67% of cities in Pakistan and 80% of cities in Bangladesh experienced \u2018unhealthy\u2019 air quality.13 In 2020, air pollution resulted in a loss of 7.4% of South Asia\u2019s GDP and accounted for 13-22% of deaths in the South Asia region.14 Worsening air quality has significant public health consequences for current and future generations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e17e71d-0211-4abc-87c7-61309d345b81": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e17e71d-0211-4abc-87c7-61309d345b81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41aba1095c9c362d487ddfca2a57c3f97e3b391bc99cc15b2a544e3e2e398cf0"}, "2": {"node_id": "445f4527-411e-4b75-82d7-428446c5290c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c79b102bcbc56e37d45744c013ec5908543565f78efaaf4f3007b6cb6c40562f"}}, "hash": "ec9784c3530487cd70da494d735e19c51e0af6a179d12675c6c35ded4e3681bf", "text": "Data from the Air Quality Index reveals that four South Asian countries\u2014Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan\u2014 account for 60% of the person-years lost globally at current pollution levels and that compliance with WHO air pollution guidelines would increase life expectancy by an average of five years in these countries.15 Air pollution can also have consequences over several generations as exposure to air pollution among women has been identified as a major risk to female reproductive health.

The burning of fossil fuels not only releases the greenhouse gases that cause climate change but also the particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide that cause air pollution. According to the WHO, \u201cImproving air quality can enhance climate change mitigation efforts, while reducing emissions will, in turn, improve air quality\u201d.23 With these facts in mind, many Asian governments have responded robustly, and have developed policies to address air pollution in a coordinated manner. Still, it is too early to say that the tide is turning on air pollution in Asia. Will the next decade see a reduction in health and environmental risks linked to air pollution? And will people reap the economic benefits that environmental activists have been claiming will surely flow if air pollution is mitigated? Though the answers are not definitive, it is clear that coordinated action from all stakeholders will be required to implement meaningful air pollution mitigation measures. + The growing evidence of health impacts: Over the past two decades, the body of scientific evidence on the impact of air pollution on human health has grown, making it clear that exposure to ambient air pollution can have long-term adverse health impacts. In 2013, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified outdoor air pollution and particulate matter as carcinogenic.18 Air pollution has since become a leading cause of lung cancer, affecting even the non-smoking population.19 Between 2005 and 2019, the total number of global deaths attributable to air pollution increased by 40%.20 Chart 2: Deaths caused by outdoor air pollution, 2019, by income level Source: Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network (2021), Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.21 Chart 3: Total global deaths from outdoor air pollution, 2005-2019 Source: Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network (2021), Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.22 + The accessibility of the science: Air pollution is a complex issue that requires scientific methodologies to understand. The technical nature of discussions has, until recently, been confined to scientific circles. However, as the debilitating impacts of air pollution have become more evident, matters have shifted into mainstream media, where the science is simplified.

UNDERSTANDING AIR POLLUTION \u2014 b. Sources of air pollution in Asia Broadly, air pollution can be categorised into outdoor (or ambient air pollution) and indoor air pollution. Pollutants originate from a number of natural and man-made activities. Natural events include volcanoes, forest fires and dust storms. Man-made causes include the burning of fossil fuels for electricity generation, transportation fuels and industrial operations. Globally, only 18% of total urban ambient air pollution resulting from PM2.5 originates from natural sources, while 82% is attributable to man-made sources.31 + Fossil fuel burning: Rapid urbanisation over recent decades has led to an increase in energy demand\u2014for electricity generation and transport fuels\u2014the majority of which has been met from coal and crude oil derivatives. Burning fossil fuels releases noxious gases such as nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide. + Agricultural burning: Slash and burn agriculture, prevalent in Asia, is a significant contributor to air pollution in the region. Many countries still rely on burning as a cheap means to clear fields post- harvest\u2014a major contributor to seasonal smog in Northern India and South-East Asia. + Waste burning: Improper waste disposal is another leading cause of air pollution. In developing countries, incineration is a common waste disposal method. Open burning can lead to emissions of particulate matter and poisonous gases.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "224558d2-11d9-4968-8711-921263f4e1c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "224558d2-11d9-4968-8711-921263f4e1c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "106453fa17d72ea9f8ae4ceae32d5fbfed8c96ec1e8caf36b50c6f3245b18f5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "626127d0-12bc-4167-b363-5cb2b7fbc9cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3068c929b1563e33e750ff3bd13d4cc7db920deb85a2c85e5b617c1510ec26f"}}, "hash": "12813912939650fa81901e934c3b57ec530c54c68f5641d1d49567747a2be02f", "text": "Open burning can lead to emissions of particulate matter and poisonous gases.

According to a 2019 report published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in association with Asia Pacific Clean Air Partnership and Climate & Clean Air Coalition, 92% of the population in the Asia and Pacific region is exposed to unhealthy levels of air pollution.26 The WHO defines air pollution as \u201cthe contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere\u201d. Pollutants that are a major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide.27 Of these pollutants, PM2.5\u2014particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 microns\u2014is a common proxy for air pollution as it poses the greatest health risk. Given its minute size, it can penetrate the lungs and enter the bloodstream.28 Exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5 leads to increased mortality or morbidity and increases the risk of developing lung cancer or cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. a. Air pollution guidelines The WHO has been issuing guidelines relating to air pollution levels since 1987. The organisation released its most recent set of more stringent air quality guidelines in September 2021.

However, the manufacturing process itself can also be a major source of pollution as it releases volatile organic compounds that remain suspended in the air and can cause respiratory illnesses.

AIR POLLUTION AND HUMAN RIGHTS \u2014 environment as a basic human right, brings the issue of environmental pollution, which includes air pollution, directly within the remit of the UNGPs. In their present form, the UNGPs do not mention climate change or nature. By recognising a clean environment as a basic human right, any form of environmental pollution (including air pollution) becomes an abuse of a human right, which necessitates remedial action on the part of both States and businesses.39 \u201cEven non-binding resolutions like these [HRC/RES/48/13] prove to be a good tool for civil society organisations to fight for justice, particularly for the most disadvantaged and under- represented sections of society.\u201d Hemantha Withanage, Senior Advisor, Centre for Environmental Justice (Sri Lanka) Human right to water and sanitation (UNGA/RES/64/292) Resolution adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 28 July 2010 64/292: The human right to water and sanitation40 The potential impact of recognising clean air as a human right can be understood through a review of other such measures, for example, the UN General Assembly\u2019s 2010 resolution 64/292, which recognises clean water as a human right.

Government authorities now have a clear, legally enforceable obligation to respect, protect and provide for clean air as a human right.35 a. International human rights instruments Human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment (HRC/RES/48/13) Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on 8 October 2021 48/13. The human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment36 In July 2022, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) affirmed in resolution A/76/L.75 that a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is a human right.37 This historic resolution largely adopted the language of the UN Human Rights Council resolution 48/13, on the same matter in October 2021. By extension, the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment includes the right to clean air. Experts interviewed for this report acknowledged the importance of these resolutions, despite their non-binding legal status, as they provide added support to arguments civil society champions bring to courts of law as they fight for remedies. Furthermore, classifying a clean environment (and clean air) as a human right also holds governments accountable for failing to act to prevent air pollution. The recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a basic human right is significant in the following ways: + Recognition promotes a rights-based approach to addressing environmental violations:38 Classifying a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right opens the doors to identifying both the various attributes of a clean environment as well as groups that are denied access to a clean environment. Such a rights-based approach encourages people to question why there is a \u2018lack of a clean environment\u2019 and who should be held responsible. + Recognition places environmental pollution within the remit of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs): Recognising a clean 6 to the creation of independent regulatory bodies that not only monitor compliance but also drive policy changes and enforce implementation. b. UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights The UNGPs are a set of guidelines for States and businesses to follow to prevent and address human rights abuses committed in the context of business operations. The guidelines are based on three pillars, commonly referred to as the \u2018Protect, Respect and Remedy\u2019 framework. The first pillar involves the State\u2019s duty to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, including business enterprises. The second pillar focuses on the responsibility of businesses to respect human rights. Finally, the third pillar involves the need for both State and businesses to provide access to effective remedy.46 acknowledging that \u2018safe drinking water and sanitation constitute two distinct human rights that warrant separate treatment to address the specific challenges in their implementation, and to avoid sanitation being neglected as a secondary human right\u2019.43 Acknowledging the right to water and sanitation influenced the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and led to the adoption of an independent goal on water and sanitation in the 2030 agenda.44 + Updated legal frameworks: Several countries updated their legal frameworks to reflect water and sanitation as human rights, including Australia, Costa Rica, Egypt, Fiji, Kenya, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Niger, Slovenia, Somalia, Togo, Tunisia and Zimbabwe.45 + Established independent monitoring: When implemented at a national level, the inclusion of the right to clean water in the legal framework has led UN Guiding Principles Pillar 1: The State duty to protect human rights The first pillar of the UNGPs focuses on the State\u2019s obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and fundamental freedoms. To implement this duty, the guiding principles recommend the setting of clear expectations, such as relevant legal guidelines for businesses, that must be followed by both domestic and foreign businesses within the State\u2019s jurisdiction. Setting clear expectations ensures predictability for businesses by signalling a consistent message applicable to all enterprises. In the context of the State\u2019s responsibility, Foundational Principles 4 and 5 state that: 4. \u201c States must protect against human rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises. This requires taking appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish and redress such abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations and adjudication.\u201d47 5. \u201c States should set out clearly the expectation that all business enterprises domiciled in their territory and/or jurisdiction respect human rights throughout their operations.\u201d Pillar 2: The corporate responsibility to respect human rights", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "01f6c716-8543-4b78-8c4e-dee3ca173979": {"__data__": {"id_": "01f6c716-8543-4b78-8c4e-dee3ca173979", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6232ec1a2ec2aa08b7fab832c3d7d5f9809a3e7fd25f86ae2505262ed03301af"}}, "hash": "6232ec1a2ec2aa08b7fab832c3d7d5f9809a3e7fd25f86ae2505262ed03301af", "text": "The second pillar of the UNGPs focuses on the corporate responsibility to respect human rights. To carry out this responsibility, business enterprises are required to comply with all applicable local and international laws, but also go further and address any human rights risks or adverse human rights impacts of their operations. The UNGPs provide the necessary context for businesses to understand their responsibilities in taking steps to mitigate air pollution resulting directly from their operations. Guiding Principle 14 states, \u201cThe responsibility to respect human rights requires that business enterprises: (a) Avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own activities and address such impacts when they occur; (b) Seek to prevent or mitigate adverse human rights impacts that are directly linked to their operations, products or services by their business relationships, even if they have not contributed to those impacts.\u201d48 Pillar 3: Access to remedy The final UNGP pillar outlines State and corporate responsibilities with regard to ensuring the appropriate judicial and legislative mechanisms are set up to address and remediate grievances and regulatory breaches. Guiding Principle 25 states that: \u201cAs part of their duty to protect against business-related human rights abuse, States must take appropriate steps to ensure, through judicial, administrative, legislative or other appropriate means, that when such abuses occur within their territory and/or jurisdiction those affected have access to effective remedy.\u201d However, the onus does not rest solely with the State. Guiding Principle 29 provides that: \u201cto make it possible for grievances to be addressed early and remediated directly, business enterprises should establish or participate in effective operational-level grievance mechanisms for individuals and communities who may be adversely impacted.\u201d 7 c. Clean air litigation at national level The inclusion of environmental rights in a country\u2019s constitution signals the country\u2019s commitment to protecting its natural resources and shifts the conversation away from \u2018whether to protect natural resources\u2019 to \u2018how to protect natural resources\u2019. Using their constitutional environmental rights as leverage, petitioners in Asia have tried to hold governments and business entities accountable for their failure to address environmental issues, including air pollution. The table below highlights some instances of air-pollution-related litigation cases in Asia that have used a rights-based approach to seek redress for the adverse impacts of air pollution. Subsequent to the establishment of the UNGPs in 2011, the UN Human Rights Council (HRC) urged States to develop National Action Plans (NAPs) on Business and Human Rights (BHR) that would define how the implementation of the UNGPs would be taken forward. At present, 43 governments and non-state actors (such as national human rights institutions) across Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia have launched NAPs or NAP- related processes to implement the UNGPs. In Asia, three countries\u2014Japan, Pakistan and Thailand\u2014have successfully launched their NAPs, while India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia and Vietnam are in the active process of developing these policy initiatives. Promoting the UNGPs in Asia will strengthen internationally recognised standards of responsible business behaviour, based on agreed human rights norms while levelling the playing field for businesses that integrate human rights considerations into their operations and supply chain policies. Notable instances of litigation cases involving air pollution in Asia49 + Jakarta air pollution lawsuit (2019, Indonesia) In 2019, 32 Jakarta citizens filed a legal challenge against the Indonesian President, three cabinet ministers, the Jakarta governor and two provincial leaders, for being negligent in their responsibility to control air pollution in the Indonesian capital city of Jakarta. The verdict, which followed two years later, found that the Indonesian government had failed to uphold citizens\u2019 right to clean air. The court held that the President must establish national air quality standards to safeguard human health and that the health minister and Jakarta governor must design strategies to control air pollution. Other mandates included cross-border emissions analysis and periodic testing of old vehicles. + Segovia et al. v. Climate Change Commission et al. (2017, Philippines) Petitioners took legal action against the government demanding immediate and concrete action to reduce air pollution from transport emissions. The petitioners required the government to take steps to reduce \u2018personal and official consumption of fossil fuels\u2019 by at least 50%, implement road-sharing schemes, allocate open spaces for urban farming and release more financial resources to mitigate environmental pollution.

The court found Travancore-Electro Chemicals Industries guilty of violating the national air pollution act and invasion of citizens\u2019 constitutional right to life. As part of the verdict, the court suggested the creation of a national agency with powers to plan and enforce compliance. The court ordered the polluting industrial plant to comply with existing pollution norms within three months or to cease operations. 8 \u201c \u2026We shouldn\u2019t have to rely on legal action. When we recognise that people have the right to a healthy environment, that creates obligations on the part of the government, and governments should fulfil those obligations. Governments themselves need to respect, protect and fulfil the right. They need to respect the right by not violating it themselves through government projects that generate air pollution.\u201d Dr David Boyd, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, Associate Professor, Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, University of British Columbia The above cases highlight how litigation can be a potentially powerful tool in raising awareness of the failure of the State and businesses to limit air pollution and its adverse impacts. However, few institutions or firms have been held accountable thus far. Citizen-led litigation might be more effective in the future where it is complemented by State commitments to the UNGPs through a NAP on Business and Human Rights. Where States adopt a NAP on Business and Human Rights to implement the UNGPs, States can focus attention and consolidate the work of the many ministries that might regulate air quality. A NAP also offers a means of bringing public attention and inputs into planning and enforcement measures. Where States adopt a NAP on Business and Human Rights, they also send a clear message to businesses to respect human rights related to air quality. NAP processes may also encourage inputs from industry and lead to public commitments. Finally, under Pillar 3, the UNGPs recognise that judicial mechanisms are a powerful tool providing for access to remedy. Clean air litigation can be complemented where the judiciary is also apprised of the concrete measures that government is taking to address air pollution in the context of a NAP on Business and Human Rights. 9 4. STATE OF AIR POLLUTION IN ASIA \u2014 Fossil-fuel-based electricity generation Another significant contributor to air pollution is the power generation industry.

Special Report.58 a. The role of industry Some of the leading causes of air pollution in Asia are transport emissions, industrial operations, coal- powered energy production and crop burning. Transboundary air pollution is also a critical issue in South-East Asia, often caused by forest fires linked to the clearing of forests to make way for cash crop plantations, such as palm oil and rubber. This section discusses the role of key contributing business sectors to air pollution in Asia. Industrial operations Industries such as iron and steel plants, cement factories, glass production and brick kilns release large amounts of particulate matter, emissions that are among the most dangerous forms of pollutants. Brick kilns burn low-grade coal in the process of manufacturing bricks, making brick kilns an important source of particulate matter emissions. In certain South Asian cities, brick kilns account for almost 91% of total particulate matter emissions.51 Another major contributor to air pollution in Asia is cement production, which involves the use of minerals such as limestone, bauxite or gypsum. The burning of these substances emits large volumes of carbon dioxide and other gases, including nitrous oxide.52 The manufacturing processes of many consumer goods also emit a significant volume of pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. In the absence of effective post-combustion control measures, emissions can lead to persistently high levels of air pollution in the regions in which these manufacturers operate. Transport The transport sector has been widely recognised as a key source of air pollution53 as it is a major consumer of liquid fossil fuels, such as petroleum, diesel and aviation fuel. Vehicular emissions from the burning of these fuels contain particulate matter and other polluting gases that cause a range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The growth in private vehicle ownership across Asia\u2014a sign of growing economic prosperity and rising urbanisation\u2014has led to an increase in emissions from the transport sector. Between 2005 and 2015, the car ownership rate increased to 87% in Asia, which is nearly three times the global average of 27%.54 Over the same period, PM2.5 emissions from road transport activity rose significantly in some Asian countries: 43% in Bangladesh, 22% in China, 94% in India, 47% in Indonesia, and 27% in Vietnam.55 10 Chart 6: Welfare losses* due to air pollution, Asian countries 201864 Source: Greenpeace Southeast Asia (2020), Toxic air: The price of fossil fuels.65 * Welfare losses refer to the harm incurred to societal well-being and quality of life For Asia, reducing fossil fuel consumption would have many benefits, including reducing carbon emissions by 18-25%, and deaths linked to air pollution by around 55-60%. The resulting welfare gains (social well-being and quality of life) are also significant, in the range of 5-7% of regional GDP.66 Public health costs of air pollution Air pollution harms cognitive function from prenatal development through childhood and young adulthood to old age.67 It is known to cause dementia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research shows that prolonged exposure to excess amounts of PM2.5 increases the risk of dementia by 92%.68 Children are at particularly high risk from the debilitating effects of air pollution due to lower immunity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "986863eb-80a5-485c-82da-965601867513": {"__data__": {"id_": "986863eb-80a5-485c-82da-965601867513", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76cdb2599820ba0150e970b88f7c96304b5aa4bacffc78b6ed46e81d0602c1f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "88ee7ed8-093f-49f8-b74f-719910e841ea", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6441df63eab7c298ed1a37687980743063cc50dd64174b537edce1ff18c33be5"}}, "hash": "68798fa42eb4517e9d970982cc26faf4a0cdc878e6f42530614400900efa07a7", "text": "Globally, 93% of children are exposed to air pollution levels higher than WHO-prescribed levels.69 Children are also at higher risk from household air pollution in communities that lack access to clean cooking fuel, as being indoors with their mothers while they are cooking exposes them to greater risk from particulate matter. Air pollution also leads to an increased burden of diseases and premature mortality. A growing body of scientific evidence shows that long-term exposure to air pollution causes ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke and type-2 diabetes.

A recent study by Dalberg Group, consultancy found that in 2019, India\u2019s economy lost nearly 1.3 billion working days and US$6bn in business revenue, attributable to high levels of air- pollution-driven absenteeism.76 The same study also found that consumer-facing businesses earned US$22bn less as consumers stayed indoors due to high levels of air pollution. The most affected sectors were clothing stores and restaurants.77 In another study on Chinese cities, it was found that halving the level of air pollution could lead to a 12% increase in incomes in Beijing.78 + Output loss: Agricultural output and the quality of soybeans, wheat, rice, maize and barley are affected by pollutants such as ground-level ozone.79 Pollutants stick to plant surfaces and reduce the amount of sunlight reaching crops, which stunts their growth. A recent study on the impacts of ozone pollution on agriculture in East Asia concluded that surface-level ozone pollution caused annual production losses worth US$63bn in China, Japan and South Korea, resulting from reduced yields of three major crops\u2014 rice, wheat and maize.80 Furthermore, crop losses from ozone pollution can have significant implications for food security, leading to a rise in food prices with disproportionate impacts on women-led households.81 This causes women to bear a larger burden of air- pollution-driven food insecurity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8485199e-57c2-4e5c-a88a-3923c9336018": {"__data__": {"id_": "8485199e-57c2-4e5c-a88a-3923c9336018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "757a4459bc07920cd33dfbdfa85b90fca376eb6a2481609bb1d5e07977bbb634"}, "2": {"node_id": "f2716c56-52eb-40a9-bd17-1810f1b9203c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3c6a2d53ebe1899fd00d10f02e7bb826bbdaa992d0f8cdb1d3bc937d6316fac1"}}, "hash": "77012ad28f55b1caf100ceab2938cb2857e878151ce418d09c2591de98517f21", "text": "lead to many premature deaths and significantly shorten a person\u2019s healthy and economically productive lifespan.

Their workplaces include temporary shelters, mobile street vehicles placed on busy street corners, roadsides, and crowded city centres. By the nature of their work, these informal economy workers are constantly exposed to pollutants from exhaust gases emanating from city traffic. They lack access to social protections such as health benefits and are often living below the poverty line or suffering from multidimensional poverty.90 + Co-morbidity patients: Research from the WHO has increasingly shown that exposure to air pollution at any level can exacerbate existing conditions and can lead to premature death for patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other respiratory infections.91 Research has also identified air pollution to be a cofactor that led to an increase in mortality from covid-19.92 + Women: Women\u2019s exposure to air pollution can have significant consequences on maternal and neonatal health, leading to a higher incidence of infant and maternal mortality, birth defects and breast cancer. This has a direct impact on the health of future generations (and the labour force). The public health costs of adverse birth outcomes and resulting disabilities can be significant. Maternal exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) has been found to have a link with a higher incidence of pre-term births. In 2010, 2.7 million births\u201418% (mid-point) of the total pre-term births globally\u2014were associated with maternal exposure to PM2.5.93 + Loss of investment: Investors are increasingly facing pressure from regulators, clients and the public to divest from companies involved in activities that contribute to environmental pollution and climate change. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations are also being applied in the finance industry, where they are increasingly viewed as an essential part of investment strategies. Several asset managers have announced their intention to withdraw investments from companies that fail to take adequate actions to address climate risks\u2014including those linked to air pollution\u2014arising from their operations.82 This trend is also reflected in the financial performance of climate-conscious investments. In a recent survey of institutional investors carried out by Economist Impact, 74% of survey respondents said that investments that took ESG factors into account performed better financially than equivalent traditional investments in the three years prior to 2020.83 + Loss of urban competitiveness: Air pollution significantly impacts the perception of a city\u2019s desirability as a place to live and raise a family.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1b356fe-1da4-4b8d-ad82-3e9d335ef224": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1b356fe-1da4-4b8d-ad82-3e9d335ef224", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d73f9cdeda36893dd22e874bc19a9665c8001f15ae5eabf91e32d43d74e8bc6"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e0327f7-d9f6-4dbf-9106-7f8f12567f64", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61f4d13fa7c898cc04609d412eed452ff6852e0cfca7600515fd63b7151b7f15"}}, "hash": "c6f0112c0828ede546474637078cfe0b93192aa50bcfe92ae47e9ff48161e678", "text": "In recent years, a growing body of evidence suggests that the worsening air quality in many Asian cities is driving an outflow of workers from metropolitan areas to cities with cleaner air.84 Reportedly, highly educated workers are shunning capitals like Delhi, which experiences severe air pollution, for other cities such as Bengaluru, Pune and Hyderabad.85 A study on skilled workers in China revealed similar findings: highly educated workers are much more likely to migrate over time to cities with less pollution than unskilled workers.86 + Biodiversity loss: The earth\u2019s biodiversity provides a range of essential goods and services that support human needs including economic opportunities, such as tourism and leisure activities.87 Pollutants emanating from various sources (industrial manufacturing, transport, power generation, etc.) can have adverse impacts on ecosystems, leading", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f06f51c5-8b90-4803-9a8d-7b928977d5a1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f06f51c5-8b90-4803-9a8d-7b928977d5a1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31ad42e729a1373597bdc151bb7bfce3d174514f5a5612799e7a045b7d930155"}, "3": {"node_id": "4e7b634d-4aee-43c6-9ce0-ca00f1a7c268", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e55ed5cbaf669ad454dad53594098678520f0e9f1dcaa93c792c1e330fc3f42a"}}, "hash": "715a213297120adf0459b05c1148f338fc160a62c7150405bef7a187755ffee4", "text": "to biodiversity loss.88 Impact of air pollution on vulnerable groups \u201cIn terms of the distribution, air pollution in many parts of the world, including in Asia, is not evenly distributed across cities and the landscape. We know from a huge body of scientific research that air pollution is disproportionately affecting people living in poverty and those who are marginalised or in disadvantaged groups.\u201d Dr David Boyd, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, Associate Professor, Institute for Resources, Environment and Sustainability, School of Public Policy and Global Affairs, University of British Columbia 13 Even in high-income economies, poorer neighbourhoods are often located near busy city highways or close to industrial areas. These locations have higher air pollution levels, increasing exposure to outdoor air pollution among disadvantaged and marginalised families. \u201cVulnerable groups such as traffic policemen, taxi drivers and workers in the informal economy, such as street vendors and peddlers, have some of the highest exposure levels to air pollution caused by traffic. Despite their high risk, there is little research to quantify the impact on their health.\u201d Prarthana Borah, Director, CDP India The chart below illustrates how people living in low- and middle-income countries are more likely to be exposed to high levels of PM2.5 than people living in higher- income settings. Based on 2017 data, countries with the highest exposure levels to PM2.5 include Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Chart 9: PM2.5 exposure vs GDP per capita, selected Asian countries Source: Brauer et al. (2017), Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, World Bank.99 e. Cost of inaction Unchecked air pollution would mean foggier skies and unbreathable air for present and future generations. This means worsening health outcomes coupled with an increase in global temperature, melting polar ice caps and a rise in mean sea levels. The practical implications of this include an increase in food insecurity, increased occurrence of natural disasters and economic instability, to name a few. + Indigenous Peoples: The impacts of air pollution are unevenly distributed, with people from low- and middle-income countries bearing a heavier burden compared with those living in high-income countries. However, even within lower-income countries, certain population groups, like Indigenous Peoples, bear a disproportionate burden. Asia is home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s Indigenous Peoples94 who tie their identities closely to the land and the natural resources on which they depend for their survival and livelihoods.95 Indigenous Peoples are more likely to reside in areas that are rich in natural resources such as minerals, coal, oil and gas. These resources are, in turn, targeted for extraction, which can involve the burning of forests, leaving Indigenous Peoples displaced and subject to high levels of air pollution. Given their health vulnerability\u2014life expectancy among Indigenous Peoples is up to 20 years lower than that of non- indigenous people worldwide96\u2014Indigenous Peoples are also at a higher risk of death from air pollution- related illnesses. Indigenous Peoples often lack access to formal healthcare systems, compounding the impact of air pollution on health and well-being. \u201cIndigenous Peoples get triply victimised. First, the infrastructure causing air pollution is built on lands that belong to them, as a result of which they lose their livelihoods. Second, they suffer from the debilitating health impacts of air pollution. Third, they are discriminated against in the access to affordable healthcare and adequate political representation, and thereby suffer from layers of harm.\u201d Joan Carling, Executive Director, Indigenous Peoples Rights International d. Air pollution and poverty Air pollution also has a disproportionate impact on low- income families across countries at each income level. Crowded cities and suburbs bustling with traffic and large- scale industrial operations are more likely to run on fossil fuels, which are a significant contributor to air pollution. According to IQAir\u2019s latest World Air Quality Report, 2021, 97% of cities in low- and middle-income countries do not meet WHO-specified international air pollution guidelines for PM2.5.97 Of the seven million people who die annually from air pollution, 57% (four million people) are residents of the Asia-Pacific region.98 As stated above, the section of the population most exposed to harmful outdoor air pollution in urban areas is workers in the informal economy, such as street vendors, hawkers, daily wage workers and vehicle drivers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4e7b634d-4aee-43c6-9ce0-ca00f1a7c268": {"__data__": {"id_": "4e7b634d-4aee-43c6-9ce0-ca00f1a7c268", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "31ad42e729a1373597bdc151bb7bfce3d174514f5a5612799e7a045b7d930155"}, "2": {"node_id": "f06f51c5-8b90-4803-9a8d-7b928977d5a1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "715a213297120adf0459b05c1148f338fc160a62c7150405bef7a187755ffee4"}}, "hash": "e55ed5cbaf669ad454dad53594098678520f0e9f1dcaa93c792c1e330fc3f42a", "text": "0 10,000 20,000 30,000 50,000 40,000 60,000 70,000 80,000 90,000 100,000 PM 2.5 mean annual exposure (\u00b5g/m3)\" GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 international $) 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 Nepal India Bangladesh Pakistan China Afghanistan Myanmar Mongolia Bhutan Thailand Vietnam Laos Cambodia Philippines Indonesia Maldives Sri Lanka Malaysia South Korea Japan Singapore 14 Lack of compliance and clean authority \u201cOftentimes, the institutions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "930ca32f-220a-4b48-8c95-3f137d88ff71": {"__data__": {"id_": "930ca32f-220a-4b48-8c95-3f137d88ff71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00deeb392f79ab5384635485dc206eee2f7dbd9aa7b710386b0aacd1940518ea"}, "3": {"node_id": "41ca8092-9f60-4664-8fc3-c35f7b350c87", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c403ba515bb238fa7040995dcfd61041e0b5e34c129d4277b48be6f305843c66"}}, "hash": "6cbc8030c3c2205dfefb6aa3fd4b36ddd72c94222a7ab8e50cc083368bb3c67c", "text": "responsible for creating air pollution standards lack the powers to enforce these standards, which is a serious shortcoming.\u201d Polash Mukerjee, Lead, Air Pollution and Climate Resilience, NRDC, India Environmental policies that lack proper implementation measures hinder compliance efforts throughout the Asia- Pacific region. To enforce compliance, environmental agencies require the de facto authority to regulate emission sources. However, this authority is not always provided. Though environmental agencies have seen their status rise across the Asia-Pacific region, they may struggle to advance their agenda when other more powerful agencies have conflicting objectives. Lack of financial resources One of the main causes of compliance gaps is a lack of financial resources for pollution prevention and control. Although governments throughout Asia receive development funding to fight air pollution from a variety of sources, these funds are not distributed equitably.101 Even at the national level, there is often a lack of funding to meet the staffing needs of a pollution control office. According to a recent OECD study, air pollution will shave off 1% of global GDP by 2060 as measured by lost labour productivity, growing health expenditure and falling agricultural crop yields. Additionally, the number of premature deaths due to outdoor air pollution is projected to increase from approximately three million people in 2010 to 6-9 million annually by 2060, with annual global welfare costs associated with premature deaths from outdoor air pollution rising from US$3trn in 2015 to US$18-25trn in 2060. However, while the threat is real, the biggest polluters in Asia are often among the most important industries in the region, as a share of GDP. This means that efforts to curb air pollution could slow economic growth in the near term. As such, governments must explore the trade-offs between the cost of inaction and the benefits gained through expanding GDP under current growth strategies. Slower short-term growth may be the cost of long-term or sustainable economic development, as governments invest in clean air technologies and while preparing citizens to undertake higher-skilled vocations in less- polluting industries. f. Challenges in addressing air pollution Lack of uniform regulatory frameworks on air pollution Interviewees cited inconsistent regulatory frameworks as a key challenge in addressing air pollution, particularly around transboundary haze. For a region as vast and diverse as Asia, this may require sub-regional cooperation through networks such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). Creating a common governance framework could also pool technical and financial resources and help to disseminate research and knowledge. \u201cIn Asia, regional integration will play a key role in addressing the challenge of air pollution. Pooling resources (technical and financial) and establishing a common and well-coordinated regional governance framework, will help to achieve the desired results in mitigating air pollution.\u201d Allan Meso, Environmental Lawyer Lack of data standardisation Data availability remains a key challenge in most Asian cities. There is a lack of standardised monitoring as the required equipment is often too expensive for developing countries and affordable options do not produce data to the specifications required. As a result, much of the data generated is not useful for measuring air pollution levels or driving policy action.100 15 5. CURRENT MITIGATION MEASURES \u2014 Governments in the Asia-Pacific region are adopting and implementing policies that are reducing pollution levels and will likely continue to do so in future. Without these policy interventions, population-weighted exposure to harmful particulate matter was expected to grow by more than 50% by 2030, based on the region\u2019s projected 80% economic growth.102 Air pollution mitigation strategies adopted across Asia can be broadly divided into the following categories: vehicular emission standards, energy policies, air quality monitoring and transboundary haze. a. Regional measures The table below describes the regional agreements in place to address transboundary haze. Table 6: Legal instruments set up to manage transboundary haze pollution in ASEAN According to some advocates, the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution has not yet achieved the desired result of reducing transboundary haze. This is primarily because the agreement lacks the power to penalise countries for non-compliance. Day-to-day management of the environmental agenda remains the responsibility of each ASEAN Member State. In this respect, there is something to learn from the enforceable protocols of the Long-Range Transboundary Air- Pollution (LRTAP) treaty signed in 1979 by 32 European countries. The LRTAP resulted in a successful reduction in concentrations of particulate matter through active engagement between scientists and policymakers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41ca8092-9f60-4664-8fc3-c35f7b350c87": {"__data__": {"id_": "41ca8092-9f60-4664-8fc3-c35f7b350c87", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00deeb392f79ab5384635485dc206eee2f7dbd9aa7b710386b0aacd1940518ea"}, "2": {"node_id": "930ca32f-220a-4b48-8c95-3f137d88ff71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6cbc8030c3c2205dfefb6aa3fd4b36ddd72c94222a7ab8e50cc083368bb3c67c"}}, "hash": "c403ba515bb238fa7040995dcfd61041e0b5e34c129d4277b48be6f305843c66", "text": "ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATHP), 2002 The ASEAN Peatland Management Initiative (APMI), 2003 ASEAN Peatland Management Strategy (APMS), 2013 Signed in 2002 and enforced in 2003, the AATHP was", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4743e1b3-96f8-45cb-8162-c3a01ac0a508": {"__data__": {"id_": "4743e1b3-96f8-45cb-8162-c3a01ac0a508", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5a353e5cedc2f0331ff639e6b3f9a0f03ace1b4c3e4e7bd571926af50e430be"}, "3": {"node_id": "341abe9c-1659-477f-b0e1-d11b705d6033", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3ffd73332724f96bd21dbbc4c5cb1d094ebbad59bfef46702a3fd595516b1617"}}, "hash": "305765fbbc4932a9942cbdace1a789b88349524d272cbe6edc00525f646089ab", "text": "the first regional agreement that brought together a group of contiguous States to tackle transboundary haze pollution emanating from land and forest fires. Signed in 2003, the APMI was established to provide a framework for regional cooperation and to discuss measures related to capacity building and fire prevention.

The APMS was adopted in 2013 and focuses on the following objectives:103 \u2022 Enhancing awareness and knowledge of peatlands \u2022 Addressing transboundary haze pollution and environmental degradation \u2022 Promoting sustainable management of peatlands \u2022 Enhancing and promoting collective regional cooperation on peatland issues. Case Study: Transboundary air pollution in South-East Asia104 Transboundary haze pollution is a recurring event in South-East Asia, mainly caused by the use of fires to clear vegetation for growing agricultural or cash crops such as corn, and palm oil, rubber or pulpwood. In the absence of legal restrictions in some South-East Asian countries, fires have become a cheap and convenient way to clear forests or agricultural land. This large-scale burning causes major episodes of transboundary haze that travels across borders and into neighbouring countries. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been working to address the issue of transboundary haze pollution since 1995 when it established the Haze Technical Task Force. The ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (AATHP) was signed in 2002 and ratified by six members, Brunei, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Indonesia ratified the agreement in 2015. The AATHP has several institutional provisions to support actions around managing haze pollution emanating from land/forest fires in the region. However, despite the existence of this legal framework, much remains to be done by member countries as severe haze events have continued in the region over the past decade. According to Greenpeace Southeast Asia, the AATHP has not been effective.105 A key shortcoming of the agreement is the lack of a provision for penalties for non-compliance with the stipulated obligations. Despite almost annual occurrences of haze, regional governments have only raised concerns surrounding the lack of action in originating countries. 16 b. Country-level measures The table below summarises key mitigation measures that have been implemented to control air pollution in select Asian countries.

For example, it is helping to find solutions to open burning by developing an air quality forecasting tool that could help to identify the appropriate weather conditions for burning to occur.111 \u2022 From 2017 to 2020, Thailand\u2019s public air quality monitoring network grew from 54 to 565 stations. While the Thai government provides the region\u2019s largest monitoring network, non-governmental contributors operate 73% of monitoring stations nationally.112 \u2022 Bangkok plans to amend regulations to allow access to electricity chargers at petrol stations.

In 2014, the Chinese government declared a \u2018war on pollution\u2019, implementing a number of stringent measures to regulate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions. Between 2014 and 2019, Beijing witnessed a 21% decline in the concentration of particulate matter, while Shanghai witnessed a 31% decline. Though there is more to be done, the measures adopted by the Chinese government set a new standard of commitment and action in the region. 18 Chart 12: Global debt issuance by banks 2015-2020 (US$ bn) Source: Bloomberg League Tables, 2021138 There is growing evidence of increased interest from private investment firms in financing renewable sector projects. Since the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, bank lending to the green sector, which includes renewable energy, among other climate-friendly ventures, has more than quadrupled\u2014from US$68bn in 2015 to US$323bn in 2020. By contrast, investments in fossil fuels\u2014oil, gas and coal-related investments\u2014have been on a downward trend since 2018. Another important trend involves private sector players stepping in as corporate purchasers of renewable energy. Traditionally, the key purchasers for most energy projects are State-owned energy utilities. However, today multinational companies are signing corporate power purchase agreements (corporate PPAs) to purchase power directly from renewable energy producers in a bid to reduce their carbon footprint. c. Speeding up the energy transition for better air quality Business enterprises involved in thermal energy production are among the largest direct contributors to air pollution. The burning of coal for energy is a leading cause of both climate change and air pollution and of the world\u2019s three largest coal-consuming countries, two are found in Asia. By transitioning away from fossil-fuel- powered energy to renewable energy sources, businesses can reduce their contribution to air pollution and address human rights abuses that arise as a direct result of their operations. The State can facilitate the acceleration of this transition by incentivising investments in renewable energy projects and by holding energy firms accountable for adverse impacts on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. The transition from conventional power to renewables can help to significantly reduce air pollution from energy generation in Asia.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6527a0ec-710f-4e3d-b77a-d71bdd92303c": {"__data__": {"id_": "6527a0ec-710f-4e3d-b77a-d71bdd92303c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d85eb394d9353441ac130c04503f85df62bed955069ac11cbff27eae4699af8"}, "2": {"node_id": "29994d47-0e36-488e-999b-d9cabe90ef58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2251889b4c30989e7ae483fa6eb29feb1471e971bb3a493f39a6bf4568e38430"}}, "hash": "9fd5527eb770a0914b5a7609e9b1927660dff79501940cc4fe4f2023b85e0c5b", "text": "Chart 11: Investments in energy infrastructure, renewables vs conventional, % share, 2015-2019 Source: IJGlobal, 2019137 2013 2014 2015 2017 2016 2018 2019 80 60 40 20 0 WHO guideline (2021) Beijing Shanghai 44.7 48.2 47.5 44.5 39.5 33.8 33.2 68.7 56.2 57.5 56.2 47.0 48.2 44.2 Chart 10: PM 2.5 mean annual exposure (\u00b5g/m3), 2013-2019 Source: Energy Policy Institute, University of Chicago (2018), The Air Quality Life Index.136 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 0 10 20 30 50 % 40 60 70 80 90 100 Conventional Power Renewables 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 0 200 400", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a9c69e13-be6d-4d4f-bf77-4ffc0c7c6314": {"__data__": {"id_": "a9c69e13-be6d-4d4f-bf77-4ffc0c7c6314", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71660a7c2800c5fce7a6c16954e8c27846d965b78db749e3dc1db8cabd658ba1"}}, "hash": "71660a7c2800c5fce7a6c16954e8c27846d965b78db749e3dc1db8cabd658ba1", "text": "600 Fossil Fuel industry Green projects 800 19 d. Leveraging trade policy to mitigate air pollution Another potentially powerful tool States can leverage to mitigate air pollution is trade policy. Trade policy is an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction, but trade expansion can also lead to higher levels of pollution, particularly in countries with less stringent environmental policies. By contrast, research suggests that when preferential trade agreements (PTAs) include environmental provisions, they can promote domestic environmental legislation, which leads to a reduction in air pollution and emissions.144 While this trend has been prevalent in the Americas and Europe, Middle East and Africa regions since 2013, corporate energy purchasing is now gaining pace in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, in January 2019, Google signed a long-term corporate PPA (>10 years) where it agreed to purchase electricity from a 10MW solar farm in Tainan City for its Changhua data centre. In 2018, Microsoft signed a corporate PPA with the Sunseap Group in Singapore to purchase 100% of the electricity generated by its 60MW solar rooftop portfolio. Through 2018 and 2019, Australia has witnessed a number of corporations, such as Telstra, Kellogg and Coca-Cola Amatil, signing up to purchase wind and solar power. While these steps were primarily implemented to reduce their carbon footprint, the move to renewable energy can drive down demand for electricity derived from air- polluting coal.139 Case Study: Emissions trading scheme for particulate matter \u2013 Surat, India Surat, an industrial city in India known for its vibrant textile manufacturing industry, witnessed the launch of a global first in controlling air pollution: an emissions trading scheme for particulate matter. The scheme was implemented by the Gujarat Pollution Control Board in coordination with researchers from the University of Chicago, Yale University and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL). The pilot scheme started operating in September 2019. It aims to reduce particulate emissions by 29%. The emissions ceiling set by the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is equal to the amount of air pollution that would have been released if all industrial units had complied with the norm of 280 tonnes per month.140 Hence, the ETS monthly cap was set at 280 tonnes per industrial unit. Participating units can comply by either cutting their particulate matter emissions using appropriate technology or by purchasing emission permits to emit more than the government-specified limit. Units with surplus permits can sell excess permits to more polluting units for whom it is more expensive to install pollution-reducing technology.141 Existing pollution control measures involve installing bag filters and cyclone equipment to comply with pollution norms. Under the ETS, the average cost of reducing 1kg of particulate pollution was found to be less than the cost of installing the pollution control equipment.142 The scheme is projected to foster economic growth by reducing compliance costs for industries and improving people\u2019s health by reducing particulate air pollution. Preliminary results indicate that pollution emissions witnessed a 24% decline among participating factories compared with the control units.143 Case study: India\u2019s climateSMART city mission \u2013 measuring air quality The inclusion of air quality as an indicator in India\u2019s climateSMART Cities Assessment Framework145 aims to embed a green mindset in cities. The framework has five main pillars and a total of 28 indicators. \u2018Mobility and air quality\u2019 is a standalone pillar with five indicators that measure existing air pollution levels and clean air action plans. The five indicators under the \u2018Mobility and air quality\u2019 pillar are:146 + Clean Air Action Plan (Planning and Implementation) + Level of air pollution + Non-motorised transport network coverage (pedestrian and bicycle) + Availability of public transport + Clean technology-shared vehicles The inclusion of air- and climate-relevant parameters place green measures at the heart of the Smart City framework, an indicator of the government\u2019s commitment to improving air quality as cities develop and grow. The framework currently applies to 100 cities included in the Smart City Mission. \u201cBy mandating that all smart cities monitor air quality and have a clean air action plan in place, it works very well for cities as it directly focuses on mitigation.\u201d Prarthana Borah, Director, CDP India 20 6. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS \u2014 Highlighted below are some suggested measures States could potentially adopt in building air quality monitoring capabilities: + Update and build: Governments should invest in updating existing air quality monitoring stations with the latest equipment. Expanding coverage by building new monitoring stations in previously uncovered areas could improve data collection. + Calibrate instruments: Instruments used in monitoring stations should be calibrated periodically to reduce measurement errors and ensure accurate data collection and greater standardisation in results that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "68ce9a79-0ae4-4e3b-91c3-30ff7d15c29c": {"__data__": {"id_": "68ce9a79-0ae4-4e3b-91c3-30ff7d15c29c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e59381a0effdd7b0cc86c029a409d50517ee8ad4d0470d92bb017a4b884d082f"}}, "hash": "e59381a0effdd7b0cc86c029a409d50517ee8ad4d0470d92bb017a4b884d082f", "text": "would help in making it internationally comparable. + Increase grid density: In locations where current grid density is found to be inadequate, monitoring and surveillance efforts should be expanded to cover rural and urban residential areas and not remain confined to industrial zones. + Use satellite data: To cover existing gaps in routine monitoring and steadily transition from manual air quality monitoring to automatic monitoring systems, data from existing equipment should be combined with satellite data. These systems generate high- volume, short-frequency data that can be helpful in covering gaps. + Mobile monitoring: Low-cost sensors and mobile monitoring should be deployed to measure local air quality to estimate improvements brought about by specific interventions. + Data dissemination: Collected data should be made publicly available to encourage research on the impacts of air pollution on human health and, where possible, to understand gender-disaggregated costs of air pollution. Under Principle 2, States should enforce laws that require business enterprises to respect human rights and periodically assess the adequacy of such laws and address gaps. In the absence of clear laws and punishment mechanisms for non-compliance with air pollution regulations, there is little incentive for businesses to comply. Thus, in addition to ensuring adequate air monitoring facilities, States should also develop clean air regulations and monitor compliance. Principle 2 also provides that regulations may be applied to the extraterritorial activities of businesses domiciled in their territory. \u201cAir pollution is not a law of nature, it\u2019s a choice. Countries can choose to have lower or higher air pollution; it requires political will. This is the lesson we need to take away from cities that have succeeded in reducing air pollution.\u201d Dr Michael Greenstone, Milton Friedman Distinguished Service Professor in Economics; Director, Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago (EPIC); Director, Becker Friedman Institute, University of Chicago Despite the mounting evidence of the harmful impacts of air pollution on human health and the economic losses resulting from it, few countries are able to meet the air quality standards prescribed by the WHO. However, past evidence from cities that have succeeded is proof enough that improving air quality is feasible and that focused legislative and policy action is the key to achieving clean air. Leveraging the framework of the UNGPs, this section outlines recommendations that can be adopted by States and businesses to improve air quality. The recommendations are global in nature and therefore, are applicable to countries at varying stages of economic growth and phases of their air pollution mitigation journey. UN Guiding Principles: The State Duty to Protect Human Rights States should actively work towards preventing adverse human rights impacts from air pollution by taking appropriate steps to identify risks, investigate sources, and where appropriate, punish and redress such abuse, through effective laws and policies.147 Under Principle 1, States must protect against human rights abuse within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises. To do so, States must first be aware of the extent and sources of air pollution. This requires effective data gathering and monitoring by investing in the right technologies to collect reliable, high-quality and internationally comparable data and building air quality monitoring centres. Some experts pointed out that the lack of uniform, standardised data collection guidelines, resulted in large gaps in analysis. Collected data could not be compared and contrasted. 21 other major market players. This is especially true when State-owned enterprises (SOEs) prefer to partner with ESG-compliant entities. Principle 6 provides that States should promote respect for human rights by business enterprises with which they conduct commercial transactions. State-owned and state-controlled enterprises regularly make high-value transactions as part of their business activities. These public contracts could be used as an incentive whereby entities in violation of air quality standards are excluded from these public contracts. As outlined in Principle 8, States should enable greater policy coherence among State-based institutions that shape business practices and ensure that these institutions are aware of and observe the State\u2019s human rights obligations, including providing of training and support. According to experts, inadequate enforcement of regulations is primarily due to the fragmented nature of accountability among regulatory agencies. In many countries there is no single ministry/department responsible for air pollution, which can lead to confusion and overlapping duties, making it difficult to enforce regulations and hence penalise non-compliance. In the absence of a singular point of authority accountable for enforcement, the many regulations are of little help. Thus, States should consolidate air quality regulations across different government departments. This may involve fixing a central point of authority and equipping that institution with the legislative and financial power to implement", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e37eed6-d0d6-49ab-ad78-51a02bb32050": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e37eed6-d0d6-49ab-ad78-51a02bb32050", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32fec4dc13b22ef4fd4c94ffac9c0f6d07cc3d649699bab3af897fbe0789114a"}}, "hash": "32fec4dc13b22ef4fd4c94ffac9c0f6d07cc3d649699bab3af897fbe0789114a", "text": "policies. Such an institution should also be equipped with the required capacity, training and legislative powers to enable it to carry out its mandates, such as monitoring compliance with air quality standards and the power to issue penalties in case of violations. Under Principle 8 of the UNGPs, the appointed authority should work with businesses to raise awareness of the impacts of air pollution, promote due diligence practice and otherwise ensure compliance through the enforcement of existing laws. As outlined in Principle 9, States should ensure there is adequate domestic policy space to meet their human rights obligations while signing trade and investment agreements. Trade is a connector\u2014of products, people and the planet\u2014 and can help drive collective action to facilitate solutions to environmental challenges, including air pollution. However, States should be cautious when signing bilateral or multilateral trade and investment agreements to ensure that domestic policy space is maintained to adequately implement policies aimed at protecting air quality. In the past, the terms of trade and investment agreements have restricted the policy space for developing countries wishing to protect the right to health. Some States have been subjected to lengthy and expensive binding arbitration processes when, for example, they attempted to strengthen labelling requirements on tobacco products, sugary snacks and drinks.150 With this in mind, States should avoid entering into international trade and investment agreements that could complicate air quality standards for vehicles or manufacturing facilities, subjecting them to investor-State dispute settlement (ISDS) processes. Below, are regulatory and monitoring policies that the State could adopt to improve air quality: + Update emission standards: Regular updates to vehicular and industrial emissions standards should be stringent enough to reduce air pollution. For industries, advanced emissions standards should be designed for polluting entities such as iron and steel plants, cement factories, glass production, chemical industry, etc. + Ban open burning of agricultural waste: To prevent seasonal haze, States should introduce a ban on the burning of agricultural crop residue as a means of clearing fields. However, such bans must also be supplemented with adequate alternatives to clear crop residue. This could potentially involve providing farmers with affordable access to relevant technologies. + Ban open burning of urban waste: States should introduce laws to ban the open burning of urban waste as a means of waste disposal. Such a ban should be supplemented with alternative methods of urban waste disposal. This could involve policies mandating waste segregation at the household level to promote recycling initiatives. + Mandate installation of pollution control equipment: For industries that directly contribute to air pollution, such as coal power plants, cement industries, etc. mandate the installation of pollution control equipment such as smokestacks and scrubbers to prevent the emission of harmful air pollutants. + Compliance and enforcement: - Physical installation of air quality control monitors to ensure continuous monitoring and centralised inspection. - Regular pollution emission checks on polluting vehicles in the transport sector - Implement the use of policy performance bonds.148 These bonds are an enforcement and assurance mechanism used in extractive industries. The bonds are a way of setting aside the financial resources required to terminate operations under situations where the issuing entity is unable to fulfil contractual obligations to limit ambient air pollution. Such a mechanism can be used to ensure compliance among polluting industries. - Enforcement through fines and penalties for polluting industries and individuals can set an important precedent to prevent future violations of regulatory standards. An interesting example of such an initiative is the Special Vehicle Pollution Control Fund started by the Philippines Government.149 This is an emission reduction initiative where funds are generated from a charge on all motor vehicles, paid by owners. As outlined in Principle 4, business enterprises supported or controlled by the State should set an example for private sector enterprises to emulate. The State should leverage its role as a market actor to ensure business compliance with air pollution measures. For instance, conventional energy production facilities in Asia (major contributors to air pollution) are often either State- owned or State-controlled. Any heightened air pollution monitoring and reduction efforts employed by these facilities are likely to raise the baseline of behaviour for 22 As outlined in UNGPs 17-21, business enterprises should carry out adequate due diligence to identify and address risks and any impacts of human rights abuses arising directly or indirectly as a result of their business operations. To be aware of the true cost of their actions and address potential human rights violations linked to air pollution, businesses should conduct human rights due diligence (HRDD).

Importantly, businesses conducting HRDD should consult with impacted stakeholders, particularly the most vulnerable sections of society and those who lack adequate political representation. Some measures aimed at reducing air pollution through due diligence that could be enforced include: + Actively measuring and tracking the impact of their business operations on local air quality. Such data should be consistently maintained and should be used to inform future growth strategies. + Employing external experts to assess their contributions to local air pollution and any impacts. Such exercises could be repeated on an annual basis and their results made available to the public on demand. + Ensuring proper stakeholder consultations are carried out before the commissioning of a new plant or factory, to take account of all stakeholders and their concerns. Under the UNGPs, businesses should also consult with the most affected and most vulnerable so that businesses can understand the range of impacts of air pollution on human rights and how best to mitigate risks. Such consultations should be repeated periodically to assess any new developments or changes that may have led to an increase in air pollution as a direct or indirect result of business operations. UN Guiding Principles: The Corporate Responsibility to Protect Human Rights As outlined in Principle 15, business enterprises should have policies and processes in place to both prevent and address adverse human rights impacts of their operations. States can facilitate action by mandating compliance through corporate or securities law. In the context of clean air provision, businesses should communicate in a policy statement their commitment to addressing air pollution. They should implement due diligence processes to reduce negative impacts on human rights due to their operations, including along their supply chains. The key industries contributing to air pollution involve both large and small players. Each business enterprise\u2014commensurate with its size and contributions\u2014 should have adequate processes in place to identify the direct contribution to air pollution as a result of their operations, including the burning of fossil fuels. Business enterprises heavily dependent on fossil fuels\u2014 transport and electricity generation, heavy industries involving steel plants, cement factories, glass production and brick kilns\u2014should develop internal processes to enable solutions that reduce their direct contributions to air pollution. Where they find health and other impacts, businesses should provide access to remedy. Businesses in these industries could adopt suo-moto policies by including measures such as: + Investing in research and development to explore renewable sources of energy, such as solar, wind and hydro, which have the combined advantage of causing less air pollution while also addressing the challenge of global warming. + Actively investing in technologies aimed at reducing particulate matter emissions from conventional transport while simultaneously investing in research to build electric vehicles\u2014applies to transport companies. As outlined in Principle 16, business enterprises should demonstrate their commitment to respecting human rights by publishing a statement of policy that, among other things, is approved at the most senior level of the business enterprise; is informed by relevant internal and/or external expertise; and stipulates the enterprise\u2019s human rights expectations of personnel, business partners and other parties directly linked to the business. Similarly, businesses should reflect their commitment to reducing air pollution in a public statement that might include planned technology upgrades, detailed efforts made to protect workers and communities, outlining investments in monitoring pollution and/or capacity building of business partners on the same. Other commitments might include using electric vehicles within factory premises, compulsory installation of smokestacks and scrubbers on chimneys to reduce particulate emissions and mandatory compliance with local air quality standards in all factory locations. A policy commitment might also involve plans to join a local cap-and-trade scheme to reduce air pollution emissions. 23 Cooperation between State and private sector A road-sharing scheme in the Philippines is often cited as a good example of how cooperation between the State and the private sector can reduce air pollution. Discussions involved participation from business chambers and several notable private corporations. Involving private entities in discussions from the planning stage allowed them to find business opportunities in the form of building cycling infrastructure in the cities. Finding such opportunities can ensure the involvement of businesses in air pollution mitigation strategies and enable them to pre-empt the violation of human rights caused by their business operations. \u201cInternational NGOs, or NGOs in general, should never underestimate the power of working together with more progressive member", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "054aae86-eb62-4a6f-9da3-e6dc0c4c63da": {"__data__": {"id_": "054aae86-eb62-4a6f-9da3-e6dc0c4c63da", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b49d056bca2e8dc2fee9725c6140db065b8245046b8e287c97edccd50f31ca1"}}, "hash": "5b49d056bca2e8dc2fee9725c6140db065b8245046b8e287c97edccd50f31ca1", "text": "States\u2019 diplomatic representatives in their communities. There is much to be learned from the experience of developed nations that have achieved a lowering of their air pollution levels.\u201d Kevin Punzalan, former Senior Policy Officer, Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in the Philippines. Currently an International Business Developer for VDE Renewables GmbH. Community participation Involving the community in discussions on air pollution mitigation measures can yield important benefits and viable solutions that are more useful in a local context. This includes consultations with marginalised groups, including Indigenous Peoples. For example, Nepal\u2019s climate change policy of 2011 carried a strategic objective to ensure the participation of vulnerable communities in the implementation of climate adaptation and climate change-related programmes. Through the implementation of local adaptation plans of action (LAPAs), the government implemented over 2,303 adaptation actions benefitting over 600,000 climate-vulnerable people during the period 2013-2016. The plans were based on a flexible and inclusive decision-making structure with the aim of protecting the livelihoods of the most vulnerable.152 Including women in the discussions on air pollution mitigation measures can help reduce the risks and reduce the inequalities they face as a result of structural and biological factors.153 UN Guiding Principles: Access to Remedy Under Principle 25,151 States should draft laws and develop appropriate mechanisms and instruments that create avenues for civil society to seek remedies for human rights abuses due to business operations. To fulfil their duty to ensure that affected populations have access to effective remedy, laws should be drafted allowing for public litigation to be filed. Furthermore, courts should be capacitated to account for damages relating to air pollution. States should also consider establishing an oversight board that has the authority to hold businesses accountable for rule violations when complaints are brought by local communities. This report provided a brief overview of public litigation brought in pursuit of clean air. Public-interest litigation can complement State efforts in combating air pollution. However, these efforts are still at a nascent stage in many Asian countries. To facilitate greater access to remedy, States should consider the following: (a) Specialised bodies tasked with adjudicating environment-based litigation can deliver decisions faster than regular courts. Environmental cases can often be very time-sensitive, requiring a fast-tracked decision, which is often difficult to achieve in a regular court. (b) Creating a single point of authority responsible for air pollution can promote the ability of rights-holders to hold enterprises accountable for violations of air pollution regulations. A judgement in favour of the aggrieved will fail to achieve any real success if there is no authority to effectively carry out the measures pronounced in the court-issued judgement. (c) Court judgments have the potential to drive change. In some cases, the courts have prescribed the creation of national agencies with the appropriate powers to enforce laws. Such judgments can drive real change in achieving good air quality. Other recommendations Collaboration among stakeholders Inviting public consultations in NAP processes, or other national strategies, with relevant stakeholders and knowledge partners can lead to innovative solutions on how to improve air quality. Developing synergies and multi-stakeholder platforms involving civil society, business and government can help to promote sustainable, local solutions. 24 Promoting knowledge sharing through city networks City networks may be particularly well-placed to transfer knowledge between countries and cities, in part because they are more flexible than formal government-to- government arrangements. The Asia-Pacific region has several existing air pollution and environmental collaboration networks that have helped to share scientific understanding, strengthen monitoring and, in some instances, promote collective action. These include the Asia Pacific Clean Air Partnership (APCAP), which is co- financing this report together with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), the global network that is also helping to advance an action-oriented agenda through a better understanding of science and a series of initiatives targeting a particular sector or cross-sectoral concern. Furthermore, public and civil society organisations can play an important role in monitoring air pollution by notifying regulatory authorities of a lack of compliance. For example, in Lahore, citizens are using air quality index (AQI) monitors and sharing information on real-time air pollution levels so that they can take effective measures. Citizens are actively joining ventures such as the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, which aims to accurately report AQI numbers across the country.154 25 7. CONCLUSION \u2014 and update appropriate legislation and regulations, and leverage its role as a market actor to motivate private sector enterprises.

Business enterprises should demonstrate commitments toward reducing air pollution through policy statements, implementing due diligence processes, detailed stakeholder consultations and complying with local air quality standards. Businesses should also invest in research and development to identify new technologies and processes that could potentially reduce their direct and indirect contributions to air pollution. Successes in achieving improved air quality in Asia is evidence that improving air quality is not an unattainable goal. Improving air quality requires dedicated and coordinated action from all stakeholders, including the government and the private sector. With the necessary political will and committed action from all stakeholders, significant improvements in air quality can be achieved. Air pollution is among the most urgent challenges faced by Asia today. There is mounting evidence of health impacts in the shape of rising incidence of respiratory illnesses and air pollution-related mortality. Urban centres are witnessing a steady increase in the number of residents leaving due to hazardous levels of air pollution. The scale and seriousness of the problem has clearly come to a tipping point. The debilitating impact of air pollution has huge economic and social implications. The public health and economic costs from air pollution can cause losses of up to 3.3% of global GDP, accounting for the loss of income, productivity, investment, urban competitiveness and biodiversity in a country.155 Polluted air is a silent killer that is affecting the well-being and quality of life of future generations as well through its impact on maternal and neonatal health. However, the impacts and costs of air pollution are not borne equally. Vulnerable groups such as women, informal economy workers, low-income families and Indigenous Peoples experience much greater harm, especially when they lack the adequate platforms and political representation to voice their concerns or access remedy. The UN resolution HRC/RES/48/13: \u2018The human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment\u2019 is a major step in the recognition of clean air as a basic human right. Despite the legally non-binding status, the resolution is expected to compel States and businesses to take action towards improving air quality. By recognising clean air as a basic human right, the resolution brings the issue of air pollution directly within the remit of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. However, a key challenge remains: industries directly contributing to poor air quality are also some of the largest drivers of economic growth in the region. Getting these industries to take concrete steps towards improving air quality requires dedicated legislative action from governments and a commitment from industry to embrace long-term thinking. The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights provide a useful framework for States and businesses to begin taking steps to improve air quality. The three pillars of the framework\u2014the State duty to protect, the corporate responsibility to respect, and the responsibility of both State and business to provide access to remedy\u2014provide practical recommendations for governments and business to play their role in achieving the collective objective of improvement in air quality. To carry out its duty to protect, the State must mandate air quality standards, while monitoring compliance by both private and State enterprises.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1940b8af-d1bc-423c-be78-cdb249c8addb": {"__data__": {"id_": "1940b8af-d1bc-423c-be78-cdb249c8addb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia in Focus: Clean Air and the Business and Human Rights Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fa1e3adb73e6bb7280c3bd07bdee4472963e005f408d6c0927662ba1f4e3764"}, "2": {"node_id": "d3ef048e-8415-4e11-9f43-d19c0ffa198d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53b9a8cb362aa3c5e93cca8ac48c69278f36454c441f07c4f7cfeb3864563e7d"}, "3": {"node_id": "6f66a436-867f-48ca-ab64-20e0ec0e5ec2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-focus-clean-air-and-business-and-human-rights-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf06302d473dc31e5387cae61c470701a4077024c4522abc1d60ce55fe7ae5ed"}}, "hash": "3b4f814330f7a87ac7e37c1ee26bb425532f512b5df24886d121d8058ff01e2a", "text": "The State should also ensure policy coherence among ministries, develop 26 ENDNOTES \u2014 https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/content/air-pollution-measures-asia-and-pacific https://e360.yale.edu/digest/air-pollution-from-fossil-fuels-costs-8-billion-per-day-new-research-finds For the full list of UNGPs, see > https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-third-most-polluted-country-delhi-most-polluted-capital-report/articleshow/81537532.cms Greenpeace Southeast Asia and Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6923778/#B3 https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-coronavirus-offers-a-radical-new-vision-for-indias-cities-pollution https://twitter.com/hp_tourism/status/1246017228274728960 https://www.ndtv.com/cities/jalandhar-sees-dhauladhar-range-for-first-time-in-decades-amid-lockdown-2205943 https://www.who.int/news/item/04-04-2022-billions-of-people-still-breathe-unhealthy-air-new-who-data https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/content/air-pollution-measures-asia-and-pacific https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-third-most-polluted-country-delhi-most-polluted-capital-report/articleshow/81537532.cms; world-air-quality-report-2020-en-pdf (2020 Report-English - page 4, section on Executive summary) More recent data is available from the same source but was released after the report went into production.

Scientific studies that use computer models do not give results with absolute certainty. Instead a range is provided (known as an \u2018interval\u2019). The \u2018confidence range\u2019 is the range that is most likely to contain the true value. A 95% confidence interval means that with 95% probability, reality is somewhere inside the confidence interval, and a 5% chance it is outside the interval (either higher or lower than the range of numbers in the range). The value with the highest probability to be the true value is called the central estimate. It is somewhere inside the confidence interval. The bounds of the confidence interval are called the low and the high estimate. https://www.greenpeace.org/static/planet4-southeastasia-stateless/2020/02/29e450ab-data-driven-media-briefing-110220.pdf These figures are central estimates.

However, its utilization poses risks to human and environmental health. To combat the chal- lenges associated with the manufacture, utilization, and disposal of plastics, a transition towards circular plastics economy is integral, with a global aim to reduce, reuse and recycle all plastics. This transition to circular plastic economy should be made across the entire plastics value chain, i.e., at the upstream (manufacture), midstream (utilization), and downstream (disposal) of the plastics value chain, in or- der to bring about circular design, production, utilization, and waste management. A number of studies have addressed the downstream phases of plastics, suggesting that the upstream and midstream phases have majorly been neglected. Therefore, there is a wide opportunity to document the interplay of various elements at the upstream and mid- stream levels of the plastics value chain. In this information package, the UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji presents unusual and untapped forms of insights that can inform of the pain points and as well identify potential levers of change to help counter the plastics crisis facing the globe today, in particular the Pacific region. Using methods of community research and ethnography, the UNDP Accelerator Lab in Fiji over a period of 8+ months fully immersed in the plastics circularity and waste manage- ment domain along the plastics value chain in Fiji and in Vanuatu by harnessing on ethno- graphic method of participant observation as principal research instrument, supported by semi-structured interviews, Pacific Talanoa sessions, informal conversations, attendance in formal event gatherings, virtual ethnography, and through formal interviews. The ethnographic data presented in this information package captures insights from the stakeholders along the whole plastics value chain in the Pacific. It provides micro-narratives of lived realities of stakeholders into the complexities of the current global plastics chal- lenge facing humanity and the environment and helps in identifying potential entry points for a systemically designed portfolio of interventions to overcome the difficulties around the manufacture, utilization and disposal of plastics.

Like elsewhere in the globe, transitioning towards a circular plastics economy in the Pacific will require radical transformation in the plastics circularity and waste management realm, for example moving away from traditional approaches or solutions such as household waste segregation, whilst important, however its impacts are minimal and such interventions are short-lived and more downstream focused. As a matter of fact, such interventions on its own cannot fully combat the challenge, and therefore must be combined with more inno- vative interventions with other parts of the plastics value chain. For this to be realized, it will require the full plastics value chain to be widely explored in order to determine how to design, produce, utilize and recycle plastics within the circular economy. This information package adds an additional dimension to for example the ongoing re- search, discussions, debates on plastics and its movement across the plastics value chain. Apart from the already existing technical and scientific evidence, the insights presented in this information package augments anthropological notions of how most actors in the sys- tem interact with plastics every day. Through this ethnographic study, we would like to re-emphasize the importance of people centered analyses that can help unearth and as well address environmental and global health concerns related to plastics in the region. We are hopeful that the insights generated will contribute to enhance national and local action by all stakeholders. Yemesrach Assefa Workie Deputy Resident Representative UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji 5 Methodological Design and Research Instruments: Plastics Circularity and Waste Management in Fiji and Vanuatu Introduction The global production of plastics has skyrocketed in the past decades. It has slowly turned into a global chaos with nearly the equivalent of one garbage truck of plastics dumped into our oceans every minute (UNEP: 2022). The plastics crisis, as often called, is nothing but a plastics emergency for our small island developing states in the Pacific. Our oceans and seabed are suffering the plastics plaque, a menace that is disturbing our main sources of livelihoods. Regionally, there have been calls made by various actors in the plastics ecosystem for global leaders to take stronger stance and serious urgent actions on the whole life cycle of plastics, to curb the plastic challenge facing the world today. The Pacific communities are gravely concerned about the environmental, social, cultural, economic, human health and food security implications arising from plastic pollution- at each stage of its life cycle. If something is not done about the plastics emergency in the Pacific now, it will lead to many other consequential catastrophes for the region. While in western countries plastics circularity and waste management are viewed as two different rubrics of the same ecosystem, each having has its own research and development space, during the PESTEL and Iceberg mental model workshops conducted with staffs in the UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji, we find that both plastics circularity and waste management, in the Pacific context, are connected with each other, suggesting that both these topics be dissected and explored vis-\u00e0-vis each other. In recognizing that there have already been many studies conducted in the Pacific on plastics circularity and waste management, yet there remained vast opportunities to bring an additional lens, specifically human centered stories, thus supplementing the existing studies with \u2018ground-truthed\u2019 realities. Therefore, a customized study involving both community research and ethnography was developed by the Lab. The Lab conducted an 8+ months of community research and ethnography with various actors, ranging from the grassroots up to the levels of policy makers and influencers in the plastics circularity and waste management realm, in Fiji and in Vanuatu. Mohseen Riaz Ud Dean Head of Community Research and Ethnographic Solutions Mapping UNDP Pacific Accelerator Lab (Fiji) 6 Methodological Design and Research Methods The Lab fully immersed in the plastics circularity and waste management realm by harnessing on ethnographic method of participant observation- as principal research instrument, supported by research methods of semi- structured interviews, Pacific Talanoa sessions, informal conversations, attendance in formal event gatherings, virtual ethnography, and through formal interviews. These research methods helped to: (a) elicit human experiences in the plastics value chain, (b) explore and decode the underlying meanings behind plastic waste systems and waste management approaches and behaviours, (c) understand feelings and intentions of the actors in the plastics and waste management", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4371736b-16b2-4cdd-826e-702fe98a24af": {"__data__": {"id_": "4371736b-16b2-4cdd-826e-702fe98a24af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35c21f464c1beab13bd151cb2ff2e4afb67daa831dcc06b6bf8672597d2cb5bf"}}, "hash": "35c21f464c1beab13bd151cb2ff2e4afb67daa831dcc06b6bf8672597d2cb5bf", "text": "ecosystem to deduce and contribute to logical implications for strategic decisions and directions for tackling plastics in the Pacific, and (d) complement and supplement the insights captured from the different methods making the data generated more robust and meaningful. Below is how each research instrument contributed towards the ethnographic work. Participant Observation Participation observation is an important research ingredient of this study design. Carsten (2012) calls participant observation as \u2018total immersion\u2019 in the field. For this study, I drew from my previous work involving participant observation as a research method (Dean: 2019), wherein I was positioned as a \u2018participant-as-observer\u2019 in the study. Simonds et al (2012) state that ethnographic investigative methods such as participant observation can offer rich and valuable data on issues lurking behind the scenes of for example interviews, questionnaires, and quantified surveys. For this reason, I provided participant observation more prominence in the study over other methods, and therefore it is discussed comprehensively then other methods below. In this study, I was positioned as a \u2018complete observer\u2019, denoting that I was observing the social processes- in our case the behaviors of individuals travelling early mornings in their private vehicles from rural Nausori towards Suva in Fiji on Mondays and Thursdays, albeit without becoming a part of the process in any way. The participants in the study did not realize they were being studied because of my unobtrusiveness. Their behaviors for plastics circularity and waste management were observed and recorded. 7 Participant Observation Road Stretch Since early November 2021, every Monday and Thursday I would wake up early around 4.30am to conduct participant observation of private vehicle owners and their household members- most of whom travel from rural areas beyond the Nausori Airport Area, to work in the Suva, the Capital city. I observed a majority of these vehicles dropping their collected refuse in the early dark hours of the mornings at the foot of the rubbish bins installed at the bus stops and on the pavements along the stretch of the main highway- the Wainibokasi Road, knowing that their refuse would be collected by the Municipal waste collection trucks during the rubbish collection days of Monday and Thursday. However, as dawn strikes, I observed that many of these bags containing refuse are already torn by the now awake stray dogs who have started to roam around the highway. Sniffing their way into the bags, they tear it open to feed themselves on the food refuse and the used diapers of babies. 8 Early morning observations on stray dogs and wastes along the Wainibokasi Road, Nausori (Photo Credit: UNDP / Mohseen Dean) Improper placing of garbage bags containing refuse (Photo Credit: UNDP / Mohseen Dean) By the time the municipal waste collection truck arrives to carry out their normal collection chores, often after 8am, the scattered pieces of wastes from these garbage bags have already found their ways into the surrounding areas, while some others- mostly plastics and single-used beverage bottles have already been blown off by the winds or kicked off into the drains and waterways by the early morning pavement users, for example some remiss school students. I also noticed how some residents carelessly leave their garbage bags untied and often at the wrong spots expecting that the rubbish collection workers will do it for them. While some waste collection workers did ensure that they have collected all the rubbish, others were noted to be carefree and unbothered about the mess on the pavements and left it unattended moving to the next stops for collection. 9 On most days during the week, I also conducted participant observation on school students to study how they interacted with their wastes and the environment. While some of them did display responsible behaviors towards wastes in general, others (a majority) were laxed about it. They were seen to be discarding their wastes carelessly on the pavements, roads and at the bus stops. Semi-structured Interviews Semi-structured interviews are usually conducted to obtain deep insights into how different individuals in a system understand a phenomenon (Rousta et al: 2016). As a research method, it can also help draw information about peoples\u2019 situations, collect statements about their opinions on topics of interests, and to explore their motivation and experiences (Drever: 1995). The main aim of conducting semi-structured interviews in the plastics ecosystem was to examine what different actors perceived as the most critical challenges with regards to plastics in the Pacific, and to understand from them some of the innovations (new methodologies, technologies, approaches) that were tested across the Pacific to overcome the Plastics crisis in the region.

Semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (Photo Credit: UNDP / Marissa Asen) 10 The process of conducting the semi-structured interviews firstly included stocktaking of various actors in the plastics value chain in Fiji and in Vanuatu. An invitation email with leading questions for discussion during the interview was sent out to prospect interviewees in order to confirm their participation from Fiji. A total of 8 individuals confirmed their participation. We had conducted one face to face semi- structured interview while the rest were conducted virtually due to the ongoing rise in COVID-19 pandemic cases in the country. During the conduct of interviews, the interviewees were free to discuss their ideas and comments and had the flexibility to not answer any questions that they were not comfortable with. The interviews lasted from twenty minutes to an hour maximum depending on the interviewee\u2019s availability and schedule. With the consent of the interviewees, the face-to- face interview was otter recorded while virtual ones were both otter and zoom recorded, and later transcribed. The interview records were subsequently analyzed to identify key words, paragraphs, and themes of interest. Pacific Talanoa Sessions The Pacific Talanoa, as a research method, is a unique way of inquiry that gained momentum among indigenous researchers and academics. It is a competing research methodology to Eurocentric methods of inquiry frameworks, which often fails to reflect the Pacific region\u2019s ethnic diversity and inherent cultural wisdom and belief systems (Thaman: 2003). In most Talanoa sessions of inquiry in the Pacific, the researcher and the researched population share similar backgrounds (Nabobo-Baba: 2008), however in our case this was different as we approached the individuals and local indigenous communities as complete outsiders. We approached the participants as professional researchers yet providing them with the feel and atmosphere of the full Talanoa decorum during the sessions. We employed context-specific and Pacific-centric indigenous paradigms and knowledge during the Talanoa sessions to advance our understanding of how indigenous communities in Vanuatu, mainly those working in professional capacities yet retaining their cultural heritages, indigenous knowledge systems and contexts in which they live and operate, can potentially lead to transformative approaches and sustainable models for plastics circularity and waste management. Through Talanoa sessions, we identified how cultural traditions and practices in Vanuatu can offer an in-depth understanding of citizens behaviors and responses to the plastics crisis in the Pacific. The sessions also help afford a deeper appreciation of certain unused Pacific traditional knowledge and wisdom that can be rejuvenated to contribute positively to the plastics crisis, for example the use of bamboo straws as an alternative to plastic straws, the use of handwoven coconut leaves baskets as a replacement for plastic garbage bags, and the use of leaves for serving foods on occasions and events. 11 Informal Conversations Informal conversations in the literature have majorly been referred to as \u2018natural conversations\u2019 (Bernard: 2011), or as \u2018unstructured\u2019 interviews (Patton: 2002). However, in this study, we regard informal conversation different from natural conversations or unstructured interviews which are often loosely organized and are usually pre-arranged by the researcher and the researched in terms of time and place, whereby both parties often know the topics that they will be discussing. In our case, our intentions have been purposive, with participants and the space or place where informal conversations taking place often being randomly selected. I casually approached some individuals on the streets, took their consent to have conversations on our topics of study. Other times, I had brought some individuals to our lab for expanded conversations. For example, I had approached a single-use beverage bottle collector to gather from him his everyday journey of single-use bottle collection trade and what his opinions and views were of people not properly discarding their refuse, especially plastic bottles.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99945f7f-f6bc-4e65-b8a4-1a367c5ddf04": {"__data__": {"id_": "99945f7f-f6bc-4e65-b8a4-1a367c5ddf04", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fec920e7d3731f642c1e82b71da6ac24d552713e8cea3e09f4a0ba299d78dc5c"}, "2": {"node_id": "99a3fab0-3f3d-461f-960c-e60f8af09ecc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d38ae9ff1f17f713e03581edc73b6632aaa168a59d4ccd69db5acf4b85dff1bb"}}, "hash": "1e4ef315338ef185c51977ed8bd533dcd9d0d9c4a59c41a9424a2efce27b396a", "text": "Informal conversation with Alipate- the devoted single-use plastic bottle collector (Photo Credit: UNDP / Mohseen Dean) 12 Informal conversation with Janif - the hardworking city beautifier (Photo Credit: UNDP / Mohseen Dean) On other occasions, I would approach for example a sub-contracted labourer in the Capital City, Suva to discuss the issue of plastics and improper waste management in the city.

As we spoke to different individu- als, mainly at the grassroots levels, we realized that the problem of improper waste management, specifically those related to mismanagement of plastics wastes are connected to bigger challenges facing small island states in the Pacific such as those related to environmen- tal stressors, like climate change, ecosystem degradation and re- source use. It would therefore be interesting to expand the cur- rent scope of study to explore in the future how these elements interact with each other in the ecosystem. 13 Attendance in Formal Event Gatherings Attendees at formal event gatherings reflect on their experiences that are provided to them by the event organizers. Formal event organizers often ensure that the attendees leave the event with experiences that are meaningful and memorable. To this end, the Lab was fortunate to have been invited to attend two formal events: one on waste recycling and the other on single-use bottle buy back scheme and circularity. The staff attending the events on behalf of the lab reflected and deduced key messag- es from what was staged during the formal events. We took our cue from Liu et al (2017) and built on their methodology of researching while attending a formal event as an invited guest. During the events, we observed and performed a content analysis of all the elements of the event.

(Photo Credit: UNDP / Marissa Asen) We took notes of the formal speeches and remarks made. We spoke to other attendees on top- ics of mutual interests. In particu- lar, we placed greater emphasis on the displays. We took pictures of the displays of interest, and as well penned down our reflections into a notebook, for decoding purposes later. At the lab, we then analyzed all the information captured to derive to a set of rough key focal themes, constructing a coding frame in- ductively from the broader range of the experiences, reflections and displays. In coding them, we first reviewed the information cap- tured and classified them based on the dominant foreground fo- cus of the content, for example the waste segregation bins. We then checked the event program against the display contents, our observations, and notes to funnel out any misconstructions and to arrive at a consensus of final set of themes specifically targeting plastics circularity. 14 (Photo Credit: UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji) Virtual Ethnography Virtual ethnography has been defined as a research approach for exploring the social inter- actions that take place in virtual environments (Given: 2008). Virtual ethnographers conduct their research on the World Wide Web to study online communities and culture. Kozinets (2006) describes virtual ethnography as \u201cethnography conducted on the internet; a quali- tative, interpretive research methodology that adapts the traditional, in-person ethnograph- ic research techniques of anthropology to the study of online cultures and communities formed through computer-mediated communications\u201d. As part of virtual ethnography, we utilized social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, In- stagram, LinkedIn for accessing and becoming part of conversations on plastics circularity and waste management. Firstly, we requested from the admins access to joining different pages and groups on plastics circularity and waste management on these social media sites as early as November 2021, and since then we have been keeping a track of new in- ternational, regional, and local developments in Fiji and in Vanuatu on these topics. At other times, we have socialized some of the insights that we have been capturing on our social media profiles to solicit feedbacks from our circle of connections online. Additionally, we constantly kept a look out through the Global Accelerator Lab webpages on how our sister Accelerator Labs in the Philippines, Maldives, Vietnam, Pakistan, and Bhutan were progressing with plastics circularity and waste management efforts in their own Country Offices. We would read their blogs and other online published materials on these topics and reflect on the narratives that was developing (UNDP Global Accelerator Lab: 2022). 15 Formal Interviews Formal interviews, also known as structured interviews, are the most schematized type of interview technique (Stuck- ey: 2013). In contrast to other interview method types, during the formal interviews the interviewer often uses a set of predetermined questions- in a set logical order (Doody and Noonan: 2013).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a44560e-29cb-4f7b-a7f2-6c5fa15f4e95": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a44560e-29cb-4f7b-a7f2-6c5fa15f4e95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e67a60dd0c44211c96b19cc9d276e86ed22daf81caaf75d0a9de044bb4357843"}, "2": {"node_id": "ec32fbc9-08dd-4e62-b836-4f7cfbe2c8af", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5beaca09fe82e091bd6aaf488bae65c945ab2aa3cbf6292c3e0425b3cacb34bd"}}, "hash": "6dfd36400e740b783f60025441787370d515e2689350da56354aee6a260685cc", "text": "This is because the researcher has already established a clear understanding of the top- ic at hand.

Its definition and utilization are constantly evolving, with scholars and institutions having different definitions and approaches towards ethno- graphic studies. For the current study on plastics circularity and waste management, the Accelerator Lab (Pacific) Fiji utilized various ethnographic methods to immerse on the topic of plastics circularity and waste management in Fiji and in Vanuatu for an extended period of time, with participant observation as the key research method for making regular obser- vations on the behaviour of different segments of the society on the topic. It also involved listening and engaging in conversations with different stakeholders and interviewing differ- ent actors to make overt issues that are not directly observable on the topic. In addition, the ethnography included collecting documentations on different stakeholder in the plastics value chain. The insights generated led to the curation of personas and themes for discus- sion, presented in the next sections.

She has been collecting discarded wastes, mainly plastic bottles from a dumpsite close to her home. After collection each day, Leli and her children thoroughly clean the plastic bottles before delivering to a private waste recycling company. According to Leli, the private waste recycling company has appetite for only certain types of plastic bottles collected. Nonetheless, Leli and her family receives monetary incentives according to the weight of preferred plastic bottles they have collected. From the money Leli has earned through recycling plastic bottles, she has been able to fund her daughter\u2019s education abroad and continues to financially support her grandchildren living in the maritime islands. She sees recycling as a source of livelihood and has been teaching her family and community members how to collect, sort, clean, and recycle plastic bottles. Leli has indeed changed the way how many people view informal waste picking as an occupation and hopes that her determination will inspire others to turn plastic wastes into a livelihood and income generation opportunity. Similarly, Joshua has been heavily involved in the informal waste picking community in Port Vila, Vanuatu. He has been engaged in collecting plastic wastes from a dumpsite nearby his house. He has been re-purposing and recycling most of the plastic items collected every day. Many of the plastic bottles he collects are cleansed and then re-used to store and sell kava in his neighborhood. Some of his mates, especially the women folks also collect plastic packaging strips and weave them into useful products such as purses and baskets which are then sold at the local market in Port Vila. Joshua feels empowered by doing this work, as it has been the only way for him to earn some living after retiring, and he feels proud knowing he is helping to reduce the amount of plastic waste that ends up in the landfill as well as the environment. 18 The Committed Academic Jim has dedicated much of his time and energy into researching the harmful effects of plastics, particularly microplastics on the intersections of the environment, biodiversity, and the human health. He actively promotes and shares his research to create awareness on the need for more responsible production and consumption of plastics, be it nano, micro, meso, macro or mega plastics. His research identifies improper disposal of plastic wastes as a detriment to island communities who are heavily dependent on the land and ocean for their daily sustenance. Jim emphasizes that while local solutions can have positive global impacts, legislature is the priority. He emphasized that irresponsible attitude towards plastic use, and improper waste management practices has become more prevalent than ever", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2430cf21-8a4e-4246-a167-9d0450831424": {"__data__": {"id_": "2430cf21-8a4e-4246-a167-9d0450831424", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9c85fff25203775a064c4b19235b3076e4799e4cc4aeedb08c186b0a3964c65"}}, "hash": "f9c85fff25203775a064c4b19235b3076e4799e4cc4aeedb08c186b0a3964c65", "text": "before. While he recognized that behavior, attitude and mindset of individuals are challenging to change, Pacific Islands needs to have policies in place that incentivizes and at the same time encourage a shift in people\u2019s behavior. Jim suggests that advocating for a focus on Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) and buy back systems in the Pacific can help foster more consumer conscious production and consumption. In addition to this, Jim realizes that much of the cutting-edge research being done in the plastics space is often done offshore and the results do not connect to local realities of the Pacific, therefore many modern-day solutions often do not connect well to Pacific Island Countries\u2019 (PIC) challenges. In addition, PICs, majorly atolls have limited land space for sanitary landfills, with limited resources and technical expertise, so according to Jim outside-the-box thinking is needed to design innovative solutions to address the complex plastics challenge. There is still much room for local research in the plastics space, and Jim is optimistic that with correct incentives, and continued motivation and inspiration, the younger generations will be wanting to get heavily involved with contributing to locally designed and adaptable design of solutions to tackle this issue and protect Pacific ecosystems from the destructive effects of plastic waste. 19 The Vested Director Daniel has been passionately managing a private waste recycling company for some 20+ years. His company works very closely with informal waste pickers, majority of which are women while others are part of the LGBTQIA+ community. He is determined to promote inclusive empowerment by actively engaging with marginalized communities through recycling initiatives and programs that his company undertakes. Daniel is also currently collaborating with various actors in the waste management sector to set up a foundation which will provide informal waste pickers have access to basic services and as well capacity building programs such as financial literacy training. His aim is to eventually transition the pool of informal waste pickers into the formal working sector. By doing this, Daniel is hopeful to improve the lives of informal waste pickers, in particular the marginalized and underprivilege members of the society and showcase to the world that by formalizing waste picking, the lives of those at the very bottom of the chain could be positively changed. For Daniel, he believes that younger generations can also play a crucial role in changing the tides when it comes to more responsible waste management behaviour and practices. For this reason, he works closely with schools through programs that train young students on waste segregation and recycling, who go on to become recycling ambassadors to nurture others and encourage recycling among their peers and families. Daniel is of the view that instilling good values in our youth and igniting a passion for responsible waste management practices and conservation of our environment, can have a domino effect within the larger community. The striking feature of Daniel\u2019s company\u2019s is its motto to \u201cDo No Harm\u201d. The notion of ensuring no harm is caused by any of their actions is strongly engrained in the company\u2019s ethos, keeping it at the core of their day-to-day activities. 20 The Dedicated Specialist Tevita, a climate change expert, is a staunch believer of indigenous knowledge, history, practices, ideas, materials, and crafts which he believes can be a catalyst for addressing the complex plastics waste challenge. To him, the passion to improve management of plastic waste in the Pacific comes from his innate desire to protect mother nature \u2013 it is spiritual \u2013 the protection of nature and the environment represents culture in the Pacific. Tevita sees great potential for scaling-up local, indigenous alternatives to plastic, with the use of natural plant materials and by-products. He draws his examples from his field work in Funafuti, Tuvalu where he has observed households utilizing green alternatives for the collection of trash over the traditional black rubbish collection bags which is utilized by households in a majority of the developing and developed nations across the globe. On another note, Tevita expresses that at the global scale there is an urgent need for more international agreements that directly address plastics circularity so that all countries could come together to tackle this complex transboundary issue. In his views, there also needs to be recognition that Pacific Island economies lack proper infrastructure to effectively support their desire to properly manage waste management initiatives. Lack of capacity also means it is difficult for Pacific Island Countries to align their national policies with global agendas.

As a climate change expert, Tevita understands the urgency of needing to reduce the use of plastics, as the production and incineration of plastics contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emissions. At the same time, Tevita recognizes the need to explore interdisciplinary topics such as those at the intersections of plastics pollution, climate change and the environment. 21 The Enthusiastic Regional Unifier Jojifini leads the waste management team of a regional organization. She refers to herself as an enthusiastic regional unifier because she believes in the power of combined regional efforts to addressing complex cross-cutting wicked challenges such as the plastic waste issue facing the Pacific. With reference to Jojifini, the plastics waste challenge is far too difficult for any one small island nation in the Pacific to solve on their own. She is adamant that a regional approach is the only chance we have at creating a circular economy for plastics, and that Pacific Island Countries can no longer afford to operate in silos. A regional approach to the plastics challenge that has already seen some success is the engagement of a shipping company that uses its empty shipping containers to transport plastic waste from Pacific Island Nations to countries having appropriate recycling or waste disposal facilities. While this initiative has been much needed, a trend that Joijifini has picked up on is that there has been a lot more focus on designing solutions for the end stage of the plastics value chain by the Pacific governments, with recycling and pollution management initiatives\u2014and not enough attention has been paid to the beginning stages where the design and production of plastic products happen. The entire thought process on the plastics value chain is crucial. At the production stages, products need to be designed with less plastic or with plastic that is 100 percent recyclable to ensure it continues to circulate in the economy after its first use and does not end up as waste. Jojifini acknowledges that finding solutions across the whole plastics value chain from design to end of the product life will require both political will and private sector involvement. She stresses that Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are key, as no single government, organization, or company can solve the plastics waste challenge on their own. 22 The Zealous Ocean Champion Shaheel is a talented artist, who dedicates much of his free time collecting plastic waste along coastal areas. He sorts, weighs, and analyses data on the wastes he collects and then turns these into beautiful pieces of art. He uses his art to actively advocate on the harmful effects of plastic waste on our environment, particularly our oceans. He has amassed a large number of follow- ers on his social media accounts, majorly on Facebook and TikTok. Just over a period of five years, Shaheel has influenced many individuals to join his cause, where large groups - mainly youths - get together to collect litter either along hiking trails, during stand-up paddle boarding, or sim- ply during their evening walks along parks and coastal areas. He teaches his followers how to sort and weigh waste, after which majority is disposed responsibly, recycled, or turned into art to continue promoting his cause. He hopes that by displaying his cause on plastic wastes in a creative, eye-catching way, it will influence others to become conscious of how they use and dis- pose plastic wastes. Shaheel has trouble reconciling the advent of thicker plastic bags for single-use plastic bags. He notes plas- tic bags, irrespective of their thickness, as one of the biggest culprits that often get washed up on the shores. He is confident that his work has the power to encour- age others to make the switch to products such as reus- able or biodegradable drink bottles, cutlery, and straws and while it is not a silver bullet to the core issue, it is for sure a positive start and can have a significant impact. Shaheel sees digital platforms such as Facebook and the TikTok as a crucial medium to raise awareness on the urgency of the plastic waste challenge. He believes this is the most effective way to get young people in- volved with issues such as the plastics crisis that will affect their futures. 23 The Passionate Innovator Rave is a passionate innovator who works in the tourism industry.

The pristine terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems of the Pacific are the pull factors for international visitors, with a majority of them turning to the pacific island nations to enjoy healthy, diverse environments. To protect these natural assets, Rave discovered a way to turn the litter problem into a solution. She regularly organizes workshops in several Pacific Island Countries training locals to make souvenirs and handicrafts out of plastic waste which is sold to international visitors. In this way, a good number of plastic wastes generated is turned into tourist products that are taken out of the country by the visitors. Not only does such an initiative fuel economic activity through creation of jobs and sources of income, but it is also inclusive. Rave has ensured that the initiative promotes women empowerment by encouraging unemployed women to realize their creative skills and income earning potential. The workshops are also conducted by local artists, as Rave strongly believes in the utilization and showcase of local talents. Rave emphasizes that there is great potential amongst Pacific local communities to find solutions to complex global issues such as the plastic waste challenge, regardless of how small and impactful it may be, the solution still counts. She strongly believes that the plastic problem in the Pacific require concerted efforts in reducing the consequences of plastics in the environment and in our communities, while at the same time those coming up with solutions and innovative ideas should ensure that the solutions are inclusive and can bring about amplifying effects. 24 The Frustrated Municipal Worker Janif is a frustrated municipal worker, who spends much of his time collecting litter that has been irresponsibly discard- ed along sidewalks and streets. He bare- ly remembers the year he was born but says he is of 50+ age. He says that he is uneducated, but also informs that he is much clever about waste disposal than most of those who are educated. He often gets disappointed seeing school children at the bus stations ca- sually tossing their empty plastic juice bottles and single-use plastic food pack- aging on the ground after having drank and munched on their snacks, expect- ing municipal workers like Janif to pick up their trash. It baffles him that such a behavior is seen to be normal by school children who are educated and are be- ing trained to become the future of this country and the world. He views this as a serious concern. Janif comments that the core issue of plastic pollution lies in the values we instill in our children. If we want to solve the plastic waste challenge, we must first look at what we are teaching our children, both at home and at school. He says that the schools need to relook at the curriculum and ensure they teach the children on responsible waste management and incorporate clean healthy habits into their daily learnings. He says that it is much easier to create healthy habits from a young age. He adds that the responsibility of reducing plastic wastes by every single person, actually begins with what the children are taught at their homes and the behaviours they observe of their elders. Children are very observant, so we must lead by example, and train them how to responsibly discard their trash. Littering should be considered a serious offence, and unfortunately Janif recognizes that has not been really the case, and we still have a long way to go in building better habits around plastic use and disposal. 25 The Visionary Senior Executive Mark works as a senior executive in an international beverage bottling company. While he understands that plastics are important to the company as it is the main material used to package their beverages, he is committed to creating a more circular economy for plastics in the Pacific. Most recently, the company has shifted to using 100 percent recyclable plastic bottles, which Mark believes is one of the boldest moves of his company towards address- ing the plastics waste issue. He knows that getting rid of plastic fully from the system is challenging but taking multiple innovative steps in the form of interventions to make sure the plastic that is being used is re- cyclable will ensure that it flows through a circular model rather than linear. This means that majority of plastic products of the company will continue to be used repeatedly (\u2018circulated\u2019 within the economy), and plastic products of the company will no longer take up space in landfills or pollute our precious resources- land and seas.

The company incentiv- izes recycling by paying customers for each bottle that is returned to their recycling facility. He knows that encouraging people to recycle in this way is crucial because it is simply not enough for bottles to be made from recyclable plastic - people need to make it a point to recycle the bottles, oth- erwise it defeats the purpose and discarded bottles will continue to pollute our environment anyway. Mark\u2019s resolve has not gone unnoticed, as other bottling companies have joined his cause to switch to recyclable plastic and have partnered to use his company\u2019s recycling collection facilities. It is his hope all plastic products will be designed to be re- cycled and that every actor in the plastics system will take responsibility and ownership of recycling the plastic products they use. 26 The Religious Influencer Eremasi is a religious leader in his community and is often found on social media advocat- ing for better plastic waste management. He is heavily involved in dialogues and talanoa sessions (Fijian informal discussions) on the gravity of the plastic pollution problem in the country. Eremasi takes a modern-day approach to intertwining faith, religion, and the plastics chal- lenges. He does this by using quotes on cleanliness and hygiene from his religious books and teachings, reinvigorating a sense of responsibility among his disciples that humans have for the environment and for humankind to be more mindful of their actions. Many religious teachings hold cleanliness and hygiene to high regard, and he encourages people to practice cleanliness of our natural environment when discarding waste. He is heavily involved in clean up campaigns and uses his social media page to document how plastic pollution is wreaking havoc on our environment. He preaches about the need for humans to be proactive citizens of this planet and in taking care of it, and believes our environment is a gift from God. Eremasi strongly believes that incorporating faith and responsible waste disposal can be an effective route for addressing the plastics challenge in the Pacific because regardless of what religious affiliation people belong to, many Pacific islanders are spiritual people, and understand that there is deeper meaning behind responsible waste management. Eremasi also thinks that larger and wealthier countries should be taking more responsibility for the plastics crisis as they produce and consume more plastic products than Pacific Island countries and should therefore make urgent efforts in designing products that are recyclable or biodegradable. 27 The Blas\u00e9 Citizen Kenny is an elderly citizen who does not under- stand the magnitude of the global plastic crisis. He has a relaxed attitude about waste disposal and sees no issue with littering as he does not view plastic as a serious threat to environment or hu- man health. Kenny has often tossed plastic wastes outside his moving car or when on walks, he thinks people who tell him not to do this are making a big deal out of nothing as plastic cannot hurt anybody, for him it is merely a piece of garbage. He does not see the point of recycling as he thinks there is no real value that can come from plastic that has already been used and thinks it is a waste of effort. He finds that it is much more convenient to discard plastic waste then to take it to a waste facility in exchange for a mere few cents. While his children and grandchildren often try to teach him new \u2018environmentally-friendly\u2019 waste management practices, he feels that his children and grandchildren are ill informed about the mag- nitude of the plastics problem which Kenny opines is insignificant for the Pacific. He is adamant that there is no need for a change because he has littered and disposed of his waste in ways he deemed convenient all his life and there have been no repercussions. Additionally, he informs that he has also seen others tossing their trash off their moving ve- hicles and during walks, but no one holds them accountable so his argument is why should he be solely reprimanded and be called out on. Kenny thinks that there are more pressing issues in the world that his children should focus on and that there is no such thing as a global plastic crisis. Kenny views plastic products as affordable, convenient, and versatile and will continue to utilize plastics daily and dispose them however he likes, regardless of what anyone else says. 28 The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c02a8004-108c-45eb-811e-55250fbba7eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c02a8004-108c-45eb-811e-55250fbba7eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "480050038d43d0008231f559fe5a5adbfd4edd2a0db7b27bbaa5847d01c2ce18"}}, "hash": "480050038d43d0008231f559fe5a5adbfd4edd2a0db7b27bbaa5847d01c2ce18", "text": "Unconcerned Fisherman Munaf is a fisherman who is unconcerned about the negative implications of wastes pro- duced by his fishing activities. Fishing is a livelihood and income generation activity for him and his family. Apart from line fishing, he often uses large nets to catch fish. Many times, his fishing nets have been torn by sharks, or have gotten caught on the coral reef, in which case he abandons these nets in the ocean as it is too bothersome to retrieve them especially knowing that they cannot be used again if they have been severely dam- aged. He is aware that ghost nets pose a serious threat to marine life by trapping marine animals or smothering coral reefs, however it is more convenient for him to abandon damaged nets in the ocean as retrieval can be costly and time consuming. He is not worried about ghost nets affecting his supply of fish because he thinks there is an abundant stock of fish in the sea that a few nets couldn\u2019t possibly make a difference. Munaf believes that larger industries and shipping companies are a big- ger threat to ocean health and marine biodiversity and that there should be more focus on them, rather than small- scale local fishermen whose activities are insignificant to have major nega- tive implications. Munaf intends to continue using nets to fish and abandon nets that gets damaged or caught as this is what he has done for many years and has not seen any negative consequences from doing this. 29 The Underprivileged Citizen Sera is a humble citizen who lives in an infor- mal settlement situated in a mangrove swamp. Her community does not have access to proper waste disposal services. Since waste collection trucks do not service her community, mem- bers of her community including Sera often dump their trash in the nearby mangrove to be washed away during high tide. While Sera knows that this may be harmful to marine life, she feels that they do not have many other options and feels that they are not on the radar of the municipal councils. Sera would gladly be more responsible with waste disposal if she was provided with proper waste disposal services, however, their current norm of dumping waste in the mangroves is the most convenient option for her. She believes that even having a large commu- nity waste bin in close proximity to their settle- ment would make a huge difference and en- courage better waste management practices. Improper waste disposal practices also attract disease carrying pests and insects and many of the community members often get ill from dis- eases such as leptospirosis, dengue fever and typhoid fever. Sera hopes that her community will soon be for- malized and will have equal access to basic ser- vices such as waste collection as this would al- low for improved sanitary living conditions and better human and environmental health. 30 The Frugal Restaurant Owner Ana, a small fast-food restaurant owner, is frugal when it comes to running her business. Her main priority is decreasing expenses and increasing profits. Most of her customers order food to be taken away, and she utilizes plastic containers to package takeaway as it is cheap and durable. Previously her restaurant used Styrofoam containers, however these were banned so she made the switch to plastic containers. She understands that plastic products are posing a threat to the environment and polluting our oceans but does not see herself switching to environmentally friendly packaging material in the near future. This is because Ana discovered that alternative food packaging is either expensive or nondurable and she intends to use packaging that is most convenient for her business as well as something that her clients are most convenient to utilize. Some of her competitors have switched to paper containers but she knows this is not a viable option for her as her food often contains very hot liquids and the paper material would not be able to hold the food safely for a lengthy period of time. Some of the newer food packaging options such as those made with bagasse, a sugarcane byproduct, is more expensive than plastic packaging which is another major hinderance of switching to plastic alternatives. Ana feels that if small business owners like herself are being requested to incorporate more sustainable practices in their operations, then there needs to be more affordable and durable alternative options. Ana feels that most small business owners like herself do not have the luxury of going green as it is not financially feasible. 31 The Inspirational Politician Leo has been part", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3a51b7f-8769-449c-882e-925da2021e9c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3a51b7f-8769-449c-882e-925da2021e9c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a1b76cac7c8debaa8841031dacaf9108925418f98f3e0a66aee6ee2a802d943"}}, "hash": "0a1b76cac7c8debaa8841031dacaf9108925418f98f3e0a66aee6ee2a802d943", "text": "of the political scene for many years and believes in \u201cleading by doing\u201d.

Leo feels that the responsibility of plastics circularity lies with every one of us. From the government\u2019s side, they are responsible for ensuring policies are in place to encourage responsible waste management practices. This may include bans on single-use plastic products, litter fines, and household waste segregation. Leo believes that bans on single-use plastics and the availability of biodegradable alternatives go hand in hand. If people use alternatives that are just as harmful to the environment as banned items, then it defeats the purpose of the ban. From the private sector context, he believes that companies should be practicing Extended Producer Responsibility and buy back systems, that incentivizes customers to recycle plastic products. Organizations should also be creating more awareness on the harmful effects of single-use plastics on the environment. He is fervent on encouraging citizens to be innovative and use locally sourced materials to design plastic alternatives. Leo believes that creating a circular economy for plastics is possible, but it will require the commitment and determination of all actors in the system. He believes that small changes can have big impacts if we all work together to do our part. 32 Key Learnings from Ethnography of Plastics Circularity and Waste Management The United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) that is made of 193 member states during the UNEA 5.2 session in Nairobi, Kenya from 28th February \u2013 2nd March 2022 made an historic decision to undertake negotiation on two very important and critical processes. Firstly, the UNEA decided to devise an internationally legally binding instrument by 2024 to end plastic pollution and secondly, agreed to establish a science-policy panel on chemicals and waste and to prevent pollution. (UNEP: 2022) The member states in Nairobi, Kenya adopted a resolution titled, \u2018End Plastic Pollution: Towards an internationally legally binding instrument\u2019. The Assembly agreed to set up an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) to draft a legally binding agreement by 2024. This Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee body would be similar to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the Intergovernmental Science- Policy Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). The plastics emergency, including marine litter; is a global environmental, social, economic issue requiring urgent attention. The issue with plastics is that a majority of them are produced from fossil fuels, and once released into the environment, they remain in the environment, albeit in different form- they degrade into physical and chemical forms, ultimately causing contamination of all biophysical systems, including the freshwater, terrestrial and marine ecosystem - the latter which is of utmost importance for the survival of Pacific island developing states and other small island developing states across the globe. It is said that if we continue to generate plastics on a business-as-usual basis, it has the potential to culminate into 1.1 billion tonnes having entered the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 (UNEP: 2021).

The research and ethnography involved immersing in the plastics circularity and waste management domain along the plastics value chain in Fiji and in Vanuatu. The Paradox of Plastic Waste Volume: Too Much, Yet Not Enough One of the major challenges that Pacific Islands face with plastic waste management is the volume of plastic waste that they produce. Pacific Island Countries produce more waste than can be properly managed on their own, yet the volume of waste is not quite enough to be shipped abroad for example to Australia and countries in Asia where proper plastic waste processing facilities exists, making such form of an intervention economically unpractical in the long run. Large volumes of plastic waste are required for chemical recycling plants to achieve profitability (Nikiema and Asiedu: 2022). Daniel, the vested director of a private waste recycling company explains that it can be a painstaking activity for recycling companies to take on such interventions in Pacific Island Countries. This is because it usually takes a long time to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ceed04f7-2046-446b-8448-54f939b64d89": {"__data__": {"id_": "ceed04f7-2046-446b-8448-54f939b64d89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Fiji Plastic Circularity and  Waste Management:  An Ethnographic Study", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-fiji-plastic-circularity-and-waste-management-ethnographic-study", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32add20bbf9406d8fe1e760cd74ceeac09ac689dd11518bc5d487e1bc5a20f3e"}}, "hash": "32add20bbf9406d8fe1e760cd74ceeac09ac689dd11518bc5d487e1bc5a20f3e", "text": "fill up even one whole shipping container with plastic waste to be transported out of the Pacific. The whole process in itself can significantly affect the cash flow of the company, particularly if the company is paying for the collection and processing of the plastic waste, they must wait a long period of time before a container is filled and sold. If there was a higher volume of plastic waste generated, then companies would be filling up the containers quickly and exporting them, slashing the timespan considerably from the period the containers are filled and shipped. This sentiment was echoed by Jojifini, who leads the waste management unit of a regional organization. She explained that the amount of plastic waste produced by each individual Pacific Island Country is not enough to warrant a full-scale recycling program and it would be unfeasible to set up one in each Pacific Island Country. She asserts that a more feasible solution would be to set up a regional recycling facility that has the capacity to process plastic waste from all Pacific Island Countries. Yet, the amounts of plastic waste generated in Pacific Island Countries is well above the limited local recycling capabilities and capacities. Pacific Island Countries produce approximately 310, 000 tonnes of plastic waste annually, with only a mere 5% being recycled. This means that the majority of plastic waste produced in Pacific islands is potentially leaking into our terrestrial environments and oceans, causing harm to Pacific islands natural ecosystems (SPREP: 2020). 34 Additionally, while tourism is a major contributor to GDP for many Pacific Island Countries, the tourism sector contributes significantly to waste production. This means Pacific Islands are not only faced with the challenge of managing waste produced by residents and industries but must also manage plastic wastes that are generated by the high number of incoming international visitors, who are one of the major sources of income and revenue earners to the small island developing economies of the Pacific (Environmental Investigation Agency: 2020). The Arduous Search for Plastic Alternatives \u201cYou cannot simply ban single-use plastics and expect the problem to be solved. We need to have viable alternatives. Plastic alternatives need to be biodegradable, otherwise we are just fixing one problem and creating another\u201d. These are the words of the inspirational politician \u2013 Leo. In addition, there has been a consensus among those who participated in the semi-structured interviews that there is a dire need for plastic alternatives in the Pacific that are affordable, durable, and environmentally friendly. The current lack of viable plastic alternatives is one of the main reasons why it is increasingly difficult to reduce the demand and use of plastic products\u2014particularly single-use plastic products in the Pacific. (Photo Credit: UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji) 35 Current alternatives that are affordable (and biodegradable) such as paper and bagasse packaging do not have similar durability characteristics as plastic, while durable alternatives such as glass, steel, and wood are comparatively expensive. Munaf, the unconcerned fisherman, stated: \u201cYes, fishing nets are made of nylon, which is a plastic that does not decompose, but what other choice do we have? We use it because it is cheap, strong and durable\u201d. Ghost nets\u2014fishing nets that have been lost, discarded, or abandoned\u2014make up the highest percentage of marine pollution. These ghost fishing nets are drifting in the ocean currents, ensnaring, harming and killing wildlife- they are the silent killers in the ocean (IUCN: 2015). Despite this, no alternatives to plastic fishing nets that tick all the boxes of being durable, affordable, and environmentally friendly have been designed, which explains the ongoing issue with ghost nets polluting our oceans. (Photo Credit: UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji) 36 The dedicated specialist, Tevita, emphasized that we should not have to look far for plastic alternatives. \u201cWe need to start using more locally designed alternatives, and utilize natural materials, just like our ancestors used to do\u201d. Tevita fondly recalled, whenever he would go to the market with his parents, they would use baskets made from coconut or pandanus leaves that had been woven together. People have switched to plastic because it is more convenient, but Tevita point outs that there are some local alternatives out there that needs to be re-discovered and rejuvenated, and as responsible citizens of the Pacific region we must make more of an effort to source and utilize them. As emphasized in the \u2018Pacific Regional Declaration on the Prevention of Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution and its Impacts\u2019, indigenous and traditional knowledge systems and innovations play an important role in tackling the plastics crisis in the Pacific (SPREP: 2021).

Tevita, the dedicated specialist makes a critical reference for latching on traditional knowledge systems, by combining of both local materials and knowledge system and modern technology and science to finding viable alternatives that can help drastically reduce the use of plastic products in the Pacific. Mind Over Matter: Behavioural Change in a Plastics World Just like other countries across the globe, the use and mismanagement of single-use plastic products has become a culture in the Pacific. When something becomes a culture, it becomes challenging to interrupt as it would take adjusting of human behaviours which in-turn over time has turned into norms, and the norms become extremely difficult to revolutionize, not saying that it is impossible to do so. Janif, the municipal worker highlighted that behavioral change needed to start from a young age. He is unable to resolve what youngsters are taught at home and at schools on cleanliness and hygiene and how these teachings are in fact translating and transforming the younger generations\u2019 lives. \u201cI always see young children littering mostly while they are in their school uniforms, and tend to wonder where have they picked up such behaviours? I ask myself what they are being taught in schools?\u201d He points out that trying to change this behavior as people get older and as more set in their ways, will only become more difficult to do so. Janif strongly believes that the key is to instill good, responsible habits in the younger generations from when they are as young as 2-3years of age. As these youngsters grow, their habits will be compounded by life-long learnings in schools. They will grow up to be mindful and responsible citizens who will help to positively impact the system, for example to influence their families and friends to do the same. 37 Another way to influence behavioral change is by using incentives. Incentives can be a powerful tool to encourage behavioural change. This was an early realization by Daniel, the vested director of a waste recycling company. \u201cIn the beginning, when we first set up the company, we thought people would be rushing to drop off their recyclables with us. We soon found out we were very wrong. Here in Fiji, it is not a culture to separate wastes into recyclables and non-recyclables. That is why we had to offer incentives to encourage more people to recycle. Only when we introduced the monetary incentive did we finally start to see increased uptake of our recycling initiatives.\u201d Daniel has seen a huge increase in recycling since the incentives were put in place, and many of the informal waste pickers have been clasping on recycling for income generation. Every day, informal waste pickers collect discarded plastic bottles from nearby dumpsites, thoroughly clean and turn them in for recycling. Not only do the earnings from recycling help them provide for their families, but their recycling efforts also reduce the overall amount of plastic that ends up at the dumpsites and landfills. Behavioral change is also difficult when there are no measures in place to support this shift when certain practices have become a culture. Leli, a marginalized citizen living in a secluded community says that it is simply impossible to practice more responsible waste management if there were no services or resources available to support this. \u201cOur community does not even have access to waste collection services for everyday waste, so recycling is not a priority for us even if we wanted to. We also cannot afford to have a private company collect our waste\u201d. Leli\u2019s experience suggests that although behavioural change can be difficult to achieve within a shorter span of time, it can however be encouraged if proper resources and services are made accessible, and incentives can be a strong lever for change in norms.

At the municipality levels in most Pacific Island Countries, they lack resources such as waste collection and recycling assets and facilities, technical capacities, and institutional support and capabilities to deal with wastes, especially plastics. As mentioned, most recyclable plastics get shipped to countries that have appropriate recycling facilities in place, and this is costly for Pacific Island countries as their relatively remote location means high transportation costs. It can also be costly for Pacific Island countries to combine their recyclables to be shipped together, since the islands are spread over a wide geographical area. Jojifini, the regional unifier, underscores the power of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) for innovatively working around the challenges of limited funding, resources, and capacity. 38 \u201cRecently there has been an innovative solution around the high transportation costs of recyclables. A partnership with a shipping company has allowed Pacific Island countries to export their recyclable plastics in shipping containers that would have otherwise returned empty. But can we forever rely on this intervention?\u201d. Jojifini stresses the need to think outside the box for complex issues such as the global plastics crisis. Complex global issues such as the plastics crisis will require innovative solutions and collective team efforts from all stakeholders across the plastics value chain (Kumar et al: 2021). Rave, the passionate innovator believes that it is often the most unusual partnerships that can have the greatest impact. While there have been some initiatives to improve waste management in the Pacific, such as the construction of sanitary landfills, for Rave there has been very little investment and focus on plastic wastes alone. And because of lack of investments in plastic waste management, Daniel says private waste recycling companies continue to struggle to keep their operations on-going while influencers such as Shaheel\u2014the zealous ocean champion\u2014go out of their way to raise awareness on the need for more attention, financing, and resources to be invested in tackling the global plastics crisis. He highlights how destructive plastic waste is to our oceans- a resource that is of high importance and is of utmost value for many Pacific Islanders who borne their sources of livelihood from. (Photo Credit: UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji) 39 While combining resources and adopting a regional approach to addressing the plastics challenge may sound ideal, Pacific Island countries are also spread across a large geographical area, with vast distances between many of these island countries, rendering transportation costs between Pacific Island countries expensive. This is one of the reasons economies of scale are difficult to achieve, even if Pacific Island countries were to combine efforts. It will become increasingly difficult to deal with the plastics crisis in the Pacific should these small island developing nations do not get the international support they need to back plastics circularity initiatives, the Pacific Ocean and marine life will continue to be negatively impacted by plastic pollution. Effective Governance and Demand for Environmental Justice Local policies and legislations and international treaties and agreements are key to helping curb the global plastics crisis (Nielsen et al: 2019). Jim, the committed academic, could not stress enough the role of policies as crucial factors in addressing the plastics challenge. \u201cLocally, people will not change the way they use and dispose of plastics unless there are policies and legislations in place that require them to. Governments have the power to change the game when it comes to plastics\u201d. Jim emphasizes that national policies and leg- islation can steer the behaviour of industries, businesses, and citizens. (Photo Credit: UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji) 40 There needs to be more effective policies for plastics man- agement that extensively address the role of all stakeholders in the system, such as the responsibility of producers for the post-consumer phase of plastic products. One such policy is the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) that holds produc- ers accountable for the treatment and disposal of plastic prod- ucts after they have been purchased by consumers. The EPR policy is an effective approach because it not only encourages producers to innovate product designs to use less plastic, but it also helps promote recycling initiatives and nurture more re- sponsible plastic waste management behaviours of both the producers and the users of plastics (Bhadra and Mishra: 2021; Johannes et al: 2021). International treaties and agreements are also crucial for addressing the transboundary movements of plastic wastes (Nikiema and Asiedu: 2022), with those nations held account- able for their plastics wastes ending into the sea and transported elsewhere to other coun- tries exclusive economic zones.

Plastic pollution and lack of commitment to dealing with it can pose a serious threat to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UNEP: 2021). For this reason, it is important to ensure vulnerable communities are included in the development of action plans that address the global plastics crisis. Leli, the undervalued waste picker, believes that marginalized and vulnerable communities contribute the least to the global plastics crisis, yet often bear the brunt of the negative impacts. \u201cPeople always look down on us because of the work we do. But we are the ones who risk our health, searching dumpsites without any protective gear, to salvage recyclable products that have been discarded and are filling up the dumpsite. We make an honest living and at the same time help the environment. We need better support\u201d. Conclusion: The Plastics Emergency in the Pacific The Pacific is facing a plastics emergency, which is exacerbated by the lack of stringent and effective solutions that directly address the emergency. In recognizing the impacts plastics have on the biophysical environment, Pacific Island nations ought to become more deliber- ate and cautious in their approach to dealing with the emergency. It is imperative that the best available solutions are tapped into\u2014with urgency\u2014to curb the impacts of plastics on the biophysical environment. An element that has received less attention and focus is the incorporation of environmental justice for transboundary issues related to plastics movement across national territories and zones. While Pacific Island countries are not the highest contributors to global plastic pro- duction and pollution, they are disproportionately affected due to their high dependency on ocean resources, and the transboundary movement of waste. Therefore, there is scope for the plastics emergency to find a stronger situatedness in pacific discourses from an en- vironmental justice context. 41 Pacific Island countries are also faced with specific vulnerabilities such as remoteness, small economies, and limited access to recycling facilities. Solutions to help tackle the plastics emergency in the Pacific need to be carefully designed with these vulnerabilities in mind to ensure they are locally contextual. All participants contributing to the study strongly felt that to address the plastics crisis, chal- lenge, catastrophe, or emergency\u2014however it is labelled\u2014Pacific Island countries need stronger support in funding, resources, and capacity.

Countries and organisations cannot fix the problem on their own. It is a global challenge that needs a coordinated and globally aligned response. Otherwise, the Pacific Ocean and all that depend on it will face increasing risks to food security, biodiversity and tourism. Plastics supply a critical part of the economy, but the Pacific Island countries contribute as little as 1.3 per cent of global plastic pollution (Leannem: 2021) but are grossly and disproportionately affected by its impacts. Pacific Leaders and Ministers have expressed their grave concern about the environmental, social, cultural, economic, human health and food security impacts of plastic pollution on the enjoyment of certain human rights for current and future generations. The effect of plastic is being seen at many different levels and not just with people. National and community concerns extend to migratory marine species such as seabirds, marine tur- tles and whales as they are especially vulnerable to the impacts of marine plastics through entanglement and ingestion of plastic and reaffirming these species as important cultural icons for Pacific peoples. Things are changing. Globally, the decision taken at United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) 5.2 in March 2022, UN member states agreed on the adoption of a mandate for an International Negotiating Committee (INC) to develop a legally binding UN Treaty on plastic pollution. The INC will begin its work to deliver on the agreement during the second half of 2022, with the ambition of completing it by the end of 2024. The impacts of plastics on climate change have been widely underestimated or even over- looked compared to other sectors so far. Over 90 percent of plastics are made out of fossil fuels. Without any changes, the sector\u2019s fossil fuel consumption will only increase by 2040, plastics could account for 19 per cent of the total emissions budget allowable if we are to re- main below a 1.5\u00b0C increase in global warming (The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ: 2020).

Perfecting waste collection and recycling plants is often not enough, as consumers may still generate unsustainable amounts of waste. That is why UNDP is supporting governments in the Asia-Pacific region with circular economy strategies to tackle both sides of the coin. Realising a circular economy for plastics (and beyond) is then crucial to address climate change and biodiversity loss. In view of the importance of these areas, it is the right time to raise awareness about the important contribution of a global transition towards a circular economy, for plastics and beyond, to achieve the sustainable development goals and meet the commitments under the Paris Agreement and Convention on Biological Diversity. Scott Hook Senior Economist UNDP Pacific Office in Fiji 43 The Ellen MacArthur Foundation (2021) in a White Paper on a new UN treaty to address plastic pollution to support the transition to a circular economy for plastics suggests that a comprehensive policy framework supporting the transition to a circular economy would: \u2022 Enable circular design solutions for plastics in the relevant sectors. \u2022 Promote better resource management capabilities to end waste and pollution, keeping plastics in use for longer and re-circulating them after their useful life. \u2022 Review the setup of financial incentives and regulations to shape the right economic conditions for a circular economy, including for reuse models and recycled plastics. \u2022 Facilitate investments to scale relevant innovations, infrastructures and skills in countries and industries most in need of international support. \u2022 Foster public-private collaboration across value chains and governance structures. To do this, things must change, the production, use, and dis- posal of plastic is interwoven in supply chains that cross and recross borders, continents, and oceans. To date, efforts to address the human health impacts of plastic have largely ig- nored the global dimensions of the plastic lifecycle and the plastic crisis. As a result, measures that succeed at a local level or with respect to a single product stream are often undermined or offset by the emergence of new plastic, new additives, and new exposure pathways (Azoulav et al: 2019). We must think about this as an interlinked process. (Photo Credit: UNDP / Mosheen Dean) 44 While the economic interests of the plastic industry are enormous, the financial costs to society are even more so. The science is clear that the health impacts of plastic throughout its lifecycle are negative. Many actions and solutions are needed to confront this threat to human life and human rights. To be effective, they must ultimately reduce the production, use, and disposal of plastic and its associated toxic chemicals. Until efforts at all levels of government confront the impacts of the full plastic lifecycle, the current piecemeal approach to addressing the plastic pollution crisis will fail. Thus far, efforts to address the plastic crisis have had limited success. This results from an array of factors, such as, the scale and complexity of impacts, the limitations of risk assessment systems (the combined effects of chemical substances and the limited exposure data), long and complex supply chains, formidable financial stakes in maintaining the status quo, and an industry in denial of the health impacts. In the Pacific, on the 14 September 2021, in Apia, Samoa \u2013 Pacific leaders and high-level representatives put forth a Pacific Regional Declaration on the Prevention of Marine Litter and Plastic Pollution and its Impacts for voluntary endorsement during the Environmental Ministers\u2019 High-Level Talanoa which took place at the conclusion of the 30th Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme\u2019s (SPREP) Meeting of Officials (Leannem: 2021). What can UNDP do? Through experience with pilots in Vietnam, Maldives, the Philippines and Sri Lanka, UNDP helps map different human experiences behind plastics pollution \u2013 interviewing households, informal waste pickers and waste management companies \u2013 to support policy makers in better understanding behaviours within the plastics system and shift approaches to waste disposal. Based on these analyses, a portfolio of experiments is being designed \u2013 covering policy and regulations, awareness raising, transparency and accountability, technology and infrastructure \u2013 that work across the waste generation-man- agement spectrum.

The global conundrum of plastics is a classic example of how human advancements can be a double-edged sword. Plastics are Dominating our Value Chains Despite all the benefits of plastics, 400 million metric tons of it are produced per annum glob- ally of which short term or single use plastics such as packaging and bags now account for about 40 percent of plastic production. Global plastic production is expected to spike to 600 million metric tons per year by 2030 and 800 million metric tons by 2040 (UNEP: 2021). In the absence of global trade controls, slow domestic transition towards alternatives, and mundane waste management solutions, usage of plastics not only in the Pacific but the world is on an upward trajectory and flows of plastic waste into aquatic ecosystems are expected to nearly triple from around 11 million tons in 2016 to around 29 million tons in 2040. Menace to Marine Biodiversity \u2013 Coral Reef Impacts For Pacific countries, the ocean and its rich biodiversity are their greatest national asset. In particular, coral reefs help support fragile fish stocks, are natural wave barriers during natural disasters, and are massive attractions for tourists. Exacerbated by rising ocean temperatures caused by climate change, plastics waste is quite literally chocking coral reefs and degrading marine ecosystems. 46 Plastics end up in oceans via wastewater systems, road runoff, and waterways. Given that it takes 500\u20131,000 years for plastics to degrade, all plastics created since 1907 still exist in the form of smaller plastic particles, such as microplastics[1] or nanoplastics[2] which are the result of years of wave action and sunlight. When these tiny particles reach coral reefs, they harm cor- als by constantly rubbing on them through the action of waves and currents. Corals may also ingest microplastics and get a false sense of \u201cfullness,\u201d which results in the coral not feeding on nutritious food. Within the coral, microplastics may block the gut and cause internal damage. Also, microplastics, which are already made of chemicals, can pick up pollutants and harmful micro-organisms from the seawater and transfer them to the coral. [1] Microplastics are tiny bits of plastic of <5 mm (smaller than an ant). Often, they are too small to be seen. They pollute water in many ways. [2] Nanoplastics are bits of plastic even smaller than microplastics. A billion nanoplastics can fit on the head of a pin.

This project seeks to sustainably commercialize locally managed marine area networks, a non-synthetic fertilizer factory to reduce Fiji\u2019s dependence on global synthetic fertilizers, create a new sanitary landfill in the Western Division, and incubate transformative blue economy projects through a dedicated blue Technical Assistance Facility. Waste Management and its Importance Waste management is often a low priority sector for the Pacific due to limited fiscal space and competing socio-economic commitments. But, if we are to holistically address negative externalities of plastics, there is a need for enabling regulatory environment that makes recycling commercially feasible. For example, there are thousands of different plastics, each with its own composition and characteristics. They all include different chemical additives and colorants that cannot be recycled together, making it impossible to sort the millions of pieces of plastics into separate types for processing. Korea has recently banned the use of coloured PET bottles for their soft drinks to make it easier for companies to recycle all forms of soft drink bottles \u2013 an exemplary policy decision that when combined with fiscal disincentives such as carbon taxes, create a holistic incentive for plastic recycling (Korea Bizwire in Environment, Policies and Regulation: 2019).

So far, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Niue and Fiji have banned single use plastics with numbers from Fiji indicating a massive decline in single use plastic bags.

While transfer of goods and services to these islands happen, albeit sporadically at times, there are no interisland waste treatment solutions that help ferry back waste to urban centers for proper disposal. There is increasing interest to create a \u2018hub-spoke\u2019 approach to waste collection in Fiji that will see the establishment of sanitary landfill catering for interisland waste using light weight sail and electric powered vessels inspired by traditional pacific double hulled canoes. If successful within Fiji, there is significant potential to scale up to nearby Pacific countries to ferry waste back to Fiji for recycling and value addition. Through the UNDP Building Back Blue (BBB) Project that supports the structuring of Fiji\u2019s upcoming Sovereign Blue Bond, a Blue Accelerator Grant Scheme has been set up to provide impact grant financing to private sector and non-government organizations to develop project level solutions such as the interisland waste transfer solution mentioned above1. Such projects along with many others, will have the option to take on concessional debt financing from a dedicated Blue Investment Fund that will be capitalized using Fiji\u2019s Blue Bond Proceeds and delivered through development and commercial banks (see figure below for details). The Pacific is denouncing the clich\u00e9 of playing catch up when it comes to innovations. The region is at the frontline of transformative solutions to negate the plastic crises but needs increasing blue finance to support the scale across and scale up of such solutions. UNDP recognizes this need and is responding with innovative project solutions through its blue economy portfolio. More needs to be done and we are ready to support the Pacific be innovators and test beds for sustainable transformative solutions. 49 References Bernard, H. R. 2011.

The Observatory will inform the international community, development partners and Myanmar civil society with up-to-date insights on Myanmar\u2019s socio-economic trajectory as the current situation develops. The data-driven in-house think-tank is constructed around three pillars: 1. Economy, to track the economic impact of the military takeover and pandemic, including relating to poverty. 2. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to assess regressions on key development indicators especially for vulnerable and marginalized populations. 3. Conflict, to monitor evolving dynamics with a particular focus on the nexus among conflict, poverty, livelihoods and the SDGs. Data collection for the Women living under the pandemic and military rule survey was commissioned by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women), under the steering of the UNDP Myanmar Development Observatory, and and undertaken by Myanmar Survey Research. I Foreword One year after the military takeover, it is difficult to foresee any rapid improvement in the divisive course of events in Myanmar. Women are starting to see their future disappear before their eyes. They are scared to leave their homes and the peace, political and economic rights they enjoyed for a decade are rapidly disappearing. UNDP and UN Women brought their complementary mandates and capacities together to conduct this study. This alliance has generated much-needed data on the impact of the twin crises on women. This complements datasets already held by both organizations, supports analysis to highlight the gendered nature of the pandemic and military takeover and provides a solid foundation for designing gender-sensitive interventions. The Women living under the pandemic and military rule survey looks at the way that women are affected by macro developments and trends. It is important to understand the real-time social and economic impacts of COVID-19 and the military takeover, not just for measures of income poverty but also for vulnerability more generally and for how the double crisis is impacting Myanmar\u2019s women both at the family and individual levels. Data from the survey on the Women living under the pandemic and military rule survey shows the following worrisome findings across women\u2019s living standards as it relates to security, health outcomes and economic impacts: Women are witnessing violence against women and girls One in five women in the survey has seen violent behaviour against a woman or girl living in their neighbourhood since COVID-19 began and, 6 percent know a girl or woman who has sought support to deal with domestic violence in the same period. Women are experiencing increased insecurity and fear, with links to women\u2019s health and living standards The military takeover coming on top of the pandemic brings another massive issue to the fore: fear. One in three women feel unsafe in their own home at night. Half of women are afraid to leave their own ward or village during the day. The UNDP recently created the Civilian Vulnerability to Violence Index (CVVI) ranking townships by the extent of violence against civilians. Linking this index to the survey data shows that living in one of the top 100-most violent townships is correlated with being more likely to have experienced COVID-19 symptoms since March 2020. \"Women report that getting to health services have been more difficult.\" This clearly shows that exposure to violence is intertwined with increased vulnerability across development indicators. Women report significant difficulties in accessing COVID-19 vaccinations and mistrust official information Looking at impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, this new data shows that only half of the women have had a second dose of vaccination and they recount that access to health services has seriously declined. The report suggests that the number of people dying from COVID-19 is several times higher than the official counts. The results also show the II divergence from official COVID-19 information, as women seem to have increasingly less trust in those sources. Women are bearing the brunt of drastic coping mechanisms to deal with falling incomes Four out of 10 households\u2019 have cut down on how much they eat as a way of dealing with their constantly declining incomes.

Nearly half of women report a significant increase in their unpaid care and domestic work, reducing their chances to earn a livelihood Women, who had always taken on more of the housework and caring roles, are now faced with even more \u2018time poverty.\u2019 Two of out five women with increased caring responsibilities, say this has impacted their ability to earn a livelihood and nearly a third say they can no longer do paid work because they must care for children or elderly people in the household. Myanmar is undergoing a developmental U-turn, and this is the time to step up commitment. Efforts must be made immediately to halt the risk of women being left behind as the two crises continue into 2022. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) sincerely thank the 2,200 women in Myanmar who provided valuable insights and gave their time to take part in this survey. 1 Table of Contents Acronyms 4 Executive Summary 5 1.

The survey is the largest data gathering of women\u2019s views and experiences since the military takeover. The new data quantifies the changing situation of women in Myanmar. The study utilizes several historical comparisons with earlier surveys. The main findings are summarized here: THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE ON WOMEN Feelings of insecurity \u2022 Security has become a massive issue for women in Myanmar. Almost one in three women reports not feeling safe in their own ward/village during the day. Insecurity is higher in urban areas; younger women in townships experience more violence and feel it more acutely.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c8dd08ad-5115-4f54-8d30-b7ea483ed87e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c8dd08ad-5115-4f54-8d30-b7ea483ed87e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regressing Gender Equality in Myanmar: Women living under the Pandemic and Military rule", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "115368f9da8e8f8fb608baad8f1cc94c78bb90907da180e0683c44133dce89e5"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9768c7a-ec62-443a-9611-6e359c44b68f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09251dcce2d324eebe0b70b6f153a6bb199d9c427321514e395bfb42043c48a5"}}, "hash": "58b8f4e0e180c0230223b710f517f7578d07948517243eb54355d750f4abc4b6", "text": "This is a considerable departure from 2019, when reliable data showed that only 3.5 percent of women felt unsafe during the day.

One in five women has seen violent behaviour against a woman or girl their neighbourhood since COVID-19 began. Women in their 30s and married women are most likely to be aware of nearby violence. Seeking support against domestic violence \u2022 Six percent of women know a girl or woman who has sought support against domestic violence since COVID-19 began, higher in the states and among younger women. The majority of the women who had sought assistance, had spoken to the elder in the community. Women who sought support are four times more likely to use an \u2018informal\u2019 source of support (relative, friend, etc.) than a formal one such as the Myanmar Women\u2019s Affairs Federation or the police. Women were asked to name all the sources they might use if they experienced domestic violence at home. Most women would talk to a relative outside the home. One-fifth said they would report experiences of physical violence to a Ward Administrator. Five years ago, one- third of women stated they would not tell anyone if they experienced violence, this has now declined to 6 percent, perhaps indicating an increased awareness and reduced shame in reporting such experiences to others. 6 THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND THE MILITARY TAKEOVER ON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH Attitude to access to health services \u2022 Half of women in 2021 report access to health services becoming more difficult. Women living in regions and 31- to 39-year-old women are most likely to report that access has become more difficult. Five percent of women had a pregnancy or childbirth issue for which public or private health services could not be accessed. The rate is higher in states and urban areas. For pregnant or breastfeeding women, the percentage doubles to 11 percent. Experienced symptoms of COVID-19 \u2022 Two out of five households had at least one person who had experienced COVID-19 symptoms. As there are approximately 11 million households in Myanmar, this would indicate about 4,444,000 households in Myanmar. Reporting of COVID-19 symptoms is higher in the regions than the states, among urban households, those living in townships with more violence and in households with above-average incomes. Deaths from COVID-19 \u2022 1.2 percent of women reported that at least one person in their household had died from COVID-19. 1.2 percent of 11 million households would suggest 132,000 COVID-19 deaths, almost seven times the official number given by the Ministry of Health of Myanmar. Extent of vaccination and sources of information on COVID-19 \u2022 More than half of women have not received a second dose of a COVID-19 vaccination. Lower income, less-educated, women living in regions compared to the states and women living in more violent townships are those least likely to have received a second vaccination. Six out of 10 women living in the regions have not had a second vaccination. The main reason for not having a second vaccination was that they were waiting for it to arrive in their ward/village. In 2020 and 2021, the main source of COVID-19 information for women was \u201cOther government information\u201d, but there has been a noticeable reduction in the use of these sources. The second-most popular source is family and friends, going up in 2021. There has been a tripling of women using non-government Facebook and social media for COVID-19 information. These results suggest a movement away from official sources. Using government television and newspapers for COVID-19 information is more common in rural areas and among older women. Friends and family are more likely to be a source in the states, where a woman is the household head and for women living in more violence inflicted townships. For these groups, there may be issues with accessing information from a phone, so they rely on non-technology-based sources. 7 THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF COVID-19 AND THE MILITARY TAKEOVER ON WOMEN Changes in household and personal income \u2022 Nearly seven out of 10 women report that household income has fallen since the military takeover. The percentage is slightly lower than that reported six months earlier in the People\u2019s Pulse survey. This could be the first signs of a \u2018bottoming out\u2019 of the economic decline that households are experiencing. However, there are distinct urban/rural differences, with rural households undergoing a continual decline in their incomes. Women\u2019s own personal incomes have fallen to a slightly lesser extent than have those of their households.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a16772ad-2c71-466b-a0d4-b9028c7456f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a16772ad-2c71-466b-a0d4-b9028c7456f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regressing Gender Equality in Myanmar: Women living under the Pandemic and Military rule", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbf90dc08d515883d4d8a3bfad88d3d7ee118d4bde32647a8f784d70facd8e80"}, "2": {"node_id": "92a6f5d4-3fde-4331-a884-035f33731601", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c59a0149ec34b49ee6e9fb394aeb2bd0dfe45d340ada82048a6be855c2df2ec"}}, "hash": "9c3e1836dae36d39edfb953023e9aa8a2c1901c7825c3819be9940e22696dcd5", "text": "A reduction in own personal income is higher in the states, in lower-income households and among older women.

Next, people are relying on their savings, borrowing from family or friends, and the selling of assets. The only strategy that has reduced over time is taking out a loan from a financial institution or money-lender. This reduction might not be due to a lack of need, but to a lack of supply. Borrowing from family/friends and taking out loans are more common in households with children, in lower-income households and among women with less education. Reversely, using savings is more common among younger (18-30) and higher-educated women. Women are more likely to be responsible for the coping strategy when they are the head of household and not married. Selling assets and taking loans are correlated with living in urban areas. Taking a loan is correlated with living in a region, where there might be more access to banks or lending institutions. In households who took a loan, the loan was taken out by a woman in six out of 10 cases. In households where assets were sold, the assets belonged to a woman in three out of 10 cases. In People\u2019s Pulse survey, the principle items sold were gold and jewellery, followed by livestock and motorbikes; six months later, this pattern is almost identical in this survey. 8 Eating less food due to diminishing incomes, by gender \u2022 Data from May 2020 to the current day shows an uninterrupted, steady increase in households eating less food so that they can cover other living expenses. Currently, four out of 10 households cut back on what they eat. The highest rate of eating less food is reported by 31- to 39-year-old women. Women in lower-income households, married women and women with lower levels of education are more likely to cut down on food consumption. In households reducing food consumption, men and women are jointly reducing their food consumption in half of them. However, in a third of these households, women are more likely to reduce their food intake. The impact of COVID-19 and the military takeover on the number of paid earners in a household \u2022 The percentage of households with at least one earner has fallen over time. The steepest reduction came about during the lockdowns associated with COVID-19. Since the military takeover, the percentage at the union level has continued to fall. Urban households have rallied to some extent and rural households have continued to decline. Higher-income households have almost recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels. On the other hand, among respondents 40 years old and above, those households are facing a serious decline in the percentage of earners in the household. Households living in violence inflicted townships are almost twice as likely not to have any earners in the household than households living in less violent townships. 9 Housework and caring responsibilities \u2022 Nearly half of women feel that housework has increased since COVID-19 began. Most women felt that women had taken on the burden of this extra housework, especially women living in urban areas and in the regions. Three out of five women stated that caring responsibilities had increased since COVID-19 began. Once again, more in the regions, and more in households with children and for women aged between 31 and 39 years. Two-fifths of women with increased caring responsibilities said this had impacted their ability to earn a livelihood. Nearly a third said they could no longer do paid work because of increased caring responsibilities; this figure is greater in households with lower incomes and within the 31-to-39 age group. Decision-making for large purchases \u2022 There is almost a doubling of the percentage of women reporting to be the main decision maker for the purchase of major items, suggesting increasing equality within the household. A woman is more likely to have an impact on decision- making if living in urban areas, the household has an above-average income and she is more-educated. The consequences of COVID-19 and the military takeover will not disappear quickly. Women are likely to face long-term setbacks in work force participation and income. Selling assets and using their own savings will have repercussions for their economic well-being far down the road. 10 1. Introduction 1.1 Context Currently, Myanmar faces a compounded political and public health crisis, on top of intensification of conflicts, all of which is putting the lives of women at risk. There is an increasing level of violence across the country: some is an intensification of long-running conflicts and some is newly erupted.

The survey took place against a backdrop of deepening economic recession, health system collapse, rising poverty and food insecurity. In January 2022, the World Bank1 projected growth of 1 percent in the year to September 2022. It noted that the combined effect of the pandemic and the military takeover led to a 30-percent reduction of the economy, measured by GDP growth. Support during the pandemic With the onset of COVID-19, the UN agencies, funding partners and civil society organizations (CSOs) planned their responses to address the socio-economic and health crisis resulting from the pandemic. Interventions were focused on economic recovery and support to the Government of Myanmar (GoM) for social protection and economic recovery schemes that reached the most vulnerable groups, in a gender-responsive manner. One of the key strategies of the COVID-19 response was technical partnership with the GoM, and UN agencies were working together with the GoM as well as CSOs on expanding social protection schemes and on addressing 1) issues of rising gender-based violence and prevention, 2) livelihood needs of the most vulnerable and 3) gaps seen in health and other services. In all of these, meaningful participation and leadership of women and their empowerment were to be ensured. Citizens and CSOs were beginning to work together with the GoM through structures such as Myanmar National Committee on Women (MNCW) or technical working groups to ensure Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (GEWE). Support since the military takeover As the UN and other entities seek to respond to the situation since the military takeover, it is imperative that gender data, research and analysis be available for informed support. Information about the condition of women in Myanmar and an examination into the specific ways that they are dealing with the extended economic distress, are needed to inform the programmatic direction of UN Agencies and other development partners to help address these issues. With the military takeover, the situation has become significantly more complex, with: \u2022 UN loss of a legitimate government partner to work with \u2022 A rift/conflict between civil society organizations and the military regime \u2022 An escalating humanitarian crisis 11 Additional challenges have come about since the military takeover, including: \u2022 Shrinkage of democratic spaces \u2022 Inadequate service provision in sectors such as health and education \u2022 Extended economic distress \u2022 Escalating violence and vulnerability \u2022 Concerns for the safety and security of women and their organizations At this time, technical support has shifted to non-governmental peace, humanitarian and development stakeholders. 1.2 Scope and objective of the study There are approximately 28 million women and girls in Myanmar and the Women living under the pandemic and military rule survey, jointly conducted by UNDP and UN Women, is a new data source identifying the current challenges of women in Myanmar. The survey, undertaken from November to December 2021 with national-level coverage, captures the views of 2,200 women. Despite numerous challenges to quantitative data collection in the last two years, various surveys have been conducted over the period. However, there has been a dearth of data quantifying explicitly how women have been affected by the two crises. The aim of this survey is to fill some of these gaps. As of December 2020, less than half (44 percent) of indicators needed to monitor the SDGs from a gender perspective were available. In addition, areas including gender and poverty, physical and sexual harassment, women\u2019s access to assets, and gender and the environment lack comparable methodologies for regular monitoring. 1.3 Background 1.3.1 History tells us where matters might be headed for women Over the last 50 years, military rule has been the norm, rather than the exception, in Myanmar. For many decades, women were excluded from positions of power and did not receive the same economic and educational opportunities as men. During these decades, with the country\u2019s culture of militarization and hyper-masculinity, social norms determined that women and girls should oversee the household, family and other caretaking responsibilities while men should be leaders. The patriarchal mentality of this period is epitomized in the military-drafted 2008 constitution, which frequently refers to women as mothers and declares that certain jobs \u201care suitable for men only\u201d. In the 2021 Social Institutions and Gender Index,2 Myanmar was classified as the second-most discriminatory country out of nine Southeast Asian nations. During the military\u2019s prior 50-year reign, the budgetary allocation for health and education ranged from 1 percent to 3 percent of GDP, compared to 20 percent to 30 percent dedicated to the military. This scarcity of investment harmed women, resulting in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eaef9d79-1ad8-44b6-a89d-6dcdb7889c25": {"__data__": {"id_": "eaef9d79-1ad8-44b6-a89d-6dcdb7889c25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regressing Gender Equality in Myanmar: Women living under the Pandemic and Military rule", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8df20a6214e637ef58fd5070338303187323ab38960ea48a0bb69da15b53255"}, "3": {"node_id": "921649c2-65ed-4a86-81c1-90c56c6fdb4b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "724ed44096582810e6a78bbee8bd8fb49fa5c59aa9143215b0fe2fb36b1ededa"}}, "hash": "255df683b6614964c11bbdb83a823fca54618ebcafa91b36b508832179adae54", "text": "a lack of opportunities and access to public services, as well as high maternal and infant mortality rates. 12 The present political turmoil not only suggests a regression of women\u2019s rights, but is also a direct threat to their physical safety. Studies have long shown that higher rates of gender inequality correlate with an increased risk of violence against women.3 United Nations human rights experts found that \u201cthe extent of gender inequality in Myanmar makes it especially prone to sexual and gender-based violence.\u201d 4 Civilian government and women\u2019s rights groups had been drafting a national law to protect women from this violence.5 This reversion harms women and men. Without gender equality, Myanmar cannot fulfil its potential as a stable, peaceful and economically productive member of the international community. Myanmar\u2019s decade-long period of political transition, peacebuilding and democratic elections unfortunately has fallen short of freeing the country from military control. The exclusion of women throughout the failed transition to democracy is partly why Myanmar was unable to create deep institutional change. 1.3.2 The short-term outlook is bleak Looking back over the past 15 years, Myanmar\u2019s journey from a closed to a more open economy, and the relatively high rates of economic growth that accompanied that journey, delivered a massive reduction in poverty. According to the 2017 Myanmar Living Conditions Survey, the poverty rate was halved, from 48 percent in 2005 to 24 percent in 2017.6 Yet, now, there is a real possibility that all these gains \u2013 and the millions of transformed lives \u2013 will be reversed in a few short years. UNDP\u2019s People\u2019s Pulse survey7 and a recently updated Poverty Analysis8 draw a disheartening picture of how Myanmar\u2019s most vulnerable are trying to deal with the economic impacts of COVID-19 and the military takeover. The research shows a virtual doubling of the poverty rate by 2022. Many people have lost their jobs or sources of income and their families are cutting back on food, selling jewellery and assets, and many people are digging into their savings to cope, though many of those now have no savings left. The survey updates many of these findings from a female perspective. Women in the survey are asked, \u201cTell me in your own words about life for women in Myanmar over the last few months,\u201d to which one in four women stated, \u201cWomen are not safe and secure when they go outside.\u201d Women talking in the survey, December 2021 \u201cThere is no place and rights for women. It is like women are useless in this country.\u201d 50-year-old from Ayeyarwady. \u201cAfter February 2021, the number of drug addicts increased, and women became victims of rape and robbery. Women\u2019s lives became insecure.\u201d 21-year-old from Kachin. \u201cWomen are not safe. There are more bad guys and more violence.\u201d 32-year-old from Mon \u201cAfter the military takeover, all the hopes and aims are gone and everything has been difficult. The education system is becoming worse and worse, and the scarcity of jobs is increasing.\u201d 55-year-old from Kayin. 13 2.

Limitations 3.1 Weaknesses of interview methods Myanmar in the double crisis of COVID-19 and the military takeover is facing severe challenges in data collection. The switch to adaptive methodologies is taking place at an extremely rapid rate. COVID-19 drove Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) to be increasingly used in surveys. As the pandemic took hold, it was no longer possible for a respondent and interviewer to be in the same enclosed space and a phone call became the practical solution. There are well-documented shortcomings related to CATI and the weaknesses that are particularly pertinent to this survey include: \u2022 People living in areas where mobile coverage is non-existent or weak are excluded. \u2022 Sensitive questions, such as experiences of GBV, would not yield reliable data, as it can be difficult for the respondent to talk privately. Some topics cannot be asked in CATI interviews. \u2022 Questions need to be concise. When doing face-to-face interviewing, questions can be longer to ensure more reliable responses. In addition, people without phones cannot be interviewed. This is a worldwide weakness of the CATI method. Telephone interviews risk excluding the poorest parts of society and this is almost certainly the case in Myanmar. Figure 3.1 shows that poor households are less likely to own a mobile phone. Figure 3.1: MLCS 2017: Households without a mobile phone, by poverty status (percent) Since the military takeover, the challenges have been compounded further. The perceived risks of providing data for the respondent and of gathering it for the interviewer have made collecting data increasingly difficult. 31.5 15.3 6.7 poor non-poor insecure (vulnerable) non-poor secure 16 3.2 Comparisons with other data sources The report attempts to compare the results from this survey with other surveys undertaken since 2015 (Table 2).

The impact of violence on women 4.1 Living in the midst of violence 4.1.1 Background One year on from the military takeover on 1 February 2022, the UN special envoy for Myanmar, Noeleen Heyzer, stated that violence and brutality have intensified since the military took power, sparking a resistance movement in the country, and all sides have hardened their positions on \u2018using violence as a solution\u2019.10 She also said that around 1,500 civilians have been killed in the past year and that the number of internally displaced people had risen from more than 320,000 at the end of 2021 to over 400,000 now. Six months earlier, in June 2021, Nicolas Koumjian, Head of the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar, stated, \u201cWhen people are targeted at night and randomly, it could be an indication that the objective is to create terror on a part of the civilian population and this terror could be a crime against humanity.\u201d11 The analysis below aims to examine some of the impacts of living amid violence. 4.1.2 The Civilian Vulnerability to Violence Index (CVVI) The UNDP Civilian Vulnerability to Violence Index (CVVI) captures violence against civilians at the township level in Myanmar.

Almost one in three women reports not feeling safe (30.1 percent) and this feeling of insecurity is higher in urban areas (34.7 percent), in areas experiencing more violence and conflict (36.6 percent) and among younger women (34.2 percent).

Myanmar\u2019s penal code does not have a specific law protecting victims of domestic violence. For instance, while rape is criminalized, marital rape is not. A Prevention of Violence Against Women (PoVAW) Bill was in development and consultation over several years. However, by late 2020, it was still under discussion. The pandemic and the military takeover have created conditions that can aggravate tensions at home. Families are confined to their homes, facilitating surveillance and making escape from abuse much more difficult. Job loss and reduced income can lead to men feeling inadequate in their socially prescribed role as breadwinners. In the conditions of social isolation brought on by the pandemic and the military takeover, usual restraints on behaviour can become weakened. Deep-rooted gender stereotypes also impact women\u2019s ability to talk about abuse and leave violent relationships. Being a \u2018good mother\u2019 and a \u2018good wife\u2019 involves tolerating manifestations of stress from partners, children and parents. Data on domestic violence against women is scarce due to victims fearing social isolation, retaliation, judgement by others and further maltreatment from the abuser. However, in 2018, 10.7 percent of women aged 15-49 years reported that they had been subject to physical and/or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months.19 Meanwhile, nearly one in five women (17.0 percent) of ever-partnered women aged 15-49 years experienced intimate partner physical and/or sexual violence at least once in their lifetime.20 Since COVID-19 began, the number of domestic violence complaints has risen. The Akhaya Women Organisation reported that case reports increased by over seven-fold during lockdown, most of which are domestic violence cases.21 \u201cBecause of COVID, there are shortages of jobs and marital problems.\u201d 38-year-old woman from Shan \u201cThere is no place to complain when women are abused.

Some respondents were living in challenging environments and sufficient care could not be guaranteed via a telephone survey. Therefore, the women in the survey were asked their opinion on whether there had been more physical violence since COVID-19 began. Figure 4.2 shows that most respondents disagreed with the statement that there had been more beating, slapping or punching between household members.

This is significantly higher in the states (10.4 percent) compared to regions (5.0 percent) and among younger women (Table 4.4).

Women were four times as likely to use an \u2018informal\u2019 source of support than a formal one such as the Myanmar Women\u2019s Affairs Federation or the police. Figure 4.4: Knows a woman who has sought support against domestic violence since March 2020 and the organization she went to for support (percent) The DHS 2015/16 found that only one percent of women sought help from the police, which appears not to have changed over time.25 Women in the survey were asked, \u201cIf you have experienced physical violence from a household member where would you go for help?\u201d Respondents were encouraged to name all sources they might use. The results in Figure 4.5 show that most women (31.2 percent) would talk to a relative outside the home.

This could indicate an increased awareness and reduced shame in reporting experiences to others. However, it should again be noted that the survey is not able to talk to the most marginalized women (those without phones for example) and these women might be less likely to tell people about violence they are subjected to at home. In addition, the two surveys use different methodologies, which makes comparisons weaker.

In 2021, at least half of women in 2021 reported health services becoming more difficult. Statistically significant, it can be seen in Table 5.1 that women living in regions are more likely than those living in states (55.5 percent compared to 48.0 percent) to say that access had become more difficult.

Women continue in their activism and serve their communities while also assuming significant responsibilities as caregivers for sick family members. The health care system is in chaos and only minimal COVID-19 testing is being done. The official COVID-19 case numbers are thought to be substantially undercounted, mainly due to the lack of testing in a health service that is in disarray. 5.2.2 Experienced symptoms of COVID-19 Two out of five (40.4 percent) households had at least one person who had experienced COVID-19 symptoms. This is based on reporting by respondents, not on reporting of official diagnosis based on testing. As there are approximately 11 million households in Myanmar, this would indicate about 4,444,000 households in Myanmar. Reporting of COVID-19 symptoms is higher in the regions compared to states, among urban households, among those living in townships with more violence and in households with above-average incomes (Figure 5.2).

Government Facebook, which includes those such as the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Information Facebook Pages, has remained relatively stable (25.6 percent in 2020 and 22.1 percent in 2021). These results suggest movement away from official information sources.

The economic impact of COVID-19 and the military takeover on women 6.1 Changes in household income 6.1.1 Background Globally, for the last two decades, extreme poverty had been declining. Then came COVID- 19 and, with it, massive job losses, shrinking economies and loss of livelihoods, particularly affecting women. Weakened social protection systems left many of the poorest without a safety net.36 It is estimated that the pandemic will push 96 million people into extreme poverty by 2021, 47 million of whom are women and girls. This will bring to 435 million the total number of women and girls living on $1.90 or less.37 The pandemic-induced poverty surge will also widen the gender poverty gap. This means that more women will be pushed into extreme poverty than men.38 This is especially the case among women aged 25 to 34, who are at the height of their productive and family formation period. In 2021, it is expected that there will be 118 women aged 25 to 34 in extreme poverty for every 100 men aged 25 to 34 in extreme poverty globally. In Myanmar, between 2005 and 2017, the poverty rate was effectively cut in half, from 48 percent to 24 percent.39 However, now there is a strong chance that these gains will be overturned in a few short years. UNDP\u2019s People\u2019s Pulse survey40 and a recently updated poverty analysis41 both show the dismal way in which Myanmar\u2019s most vulnerable are experiencing and trying to deal with the economic impacts of COVID-19 and the military takeover of the government. The poverty analysis reported that the highest number of poor people will be living in Ayeyarwady, followed by Yangon and Sagaing. Meanwhile, the greatest amount of funds needed to bring the poor over the poverty line will be needed in Yangon, due to the large population there and the depth of their poverty. 6.1.2 Changes in household income Figure 9.1 shows that, during HVS 2020, a substantial proportion of the households experienced a drop in income (83.3 percent) from March 2020, when COVID-19 began in Myanmar and when the Household Vulnerability Survey (HVS) interview took place six months later. The People\u2019s Pulse asked people whether their incomes had fallen since the military takeover; 73.6 percent stated that this was the case (Figure 6.1). Women in the survey were also asked whether their household income had fallen since the military takeover; here, the percentage, decreased a little, to 67 percent. This could be seen as the first signs of \u2018bottoming out\u2019. It could also be that the survey is not fully reaching some parts of society who are still seeing their incomes fall.

Figure 6.5 shows clear trend data for the different methods.43 Currently, more than three-quarters of households (76 percent) are cutting back on non- food purchases. Next, people are relying on their savings (46.1 percent), borrowing from family or friends (44.4 percent) and selling assets (36.9 percent). The only strategy that has fallen over time (shown in a dashed line) is that of taking out a loan from a financial institution or money-lender. This reduction is partially due to a lack of supply, as the banking and finance sector continues to have limited operational capacity, with restrictions and limits on cash withdrawals and loans. However, some people just cannot afford to take out a loan and pay the interest. It seems that they would rather cut back on non-essential items. Figure 6.5 shows that cutting back on non-food consumption is climbing higher and higher and now, three in four households take this approach. Figure 6.5: Coping strategies over time (percent)44 It is a sad situation that, since the summer of 2020, there has been no respite in people\u2019s struggles to make ends meet. 52.0 50.0 30.0 50.0 68.1 76.0 19.0 33.0 35.0 35.0 29.5 27.4 9.0 14.0 7.0 15.0 26.5 36.9 34.0 38.0 32.0 40.0 28.8 46.1 24.0 26.0 24.0 24.0 36.0 44.4 HFHS May 2020 HFHS June 2020 HFHS August 2020 HFHS Oct 2020 People's Pulse May/June 2021 Women Survey December 2021 Reduced non-food consumption Loan from financial instiution or money-lender Sold assets Relied on savings Borrowed from family/friends 39 Details on women and households that use each of these strategies are shown in Tables A 6.1 to A 6.5. In summary, the characteristics are as follows: \u2022 Borrowed from family friends: households with children, male-headed, lower income and woman with less education. \u2022 Took out a loan: households with children, lower income and the woman with less education. \u2022 Reduced non-food purchases: 31- to 39-year-old women, less education. \u2022 Sold assets: urban, households with children, male-headed, lower income and 31- to 39-year-old women. \u2022 Used savings: younger women (18-30) with more education. As seen in Figure 6.5, selling assets is an increasingly common strategy. In terms of the actual items sold, this has remained similar over time. In People\u2019s Pulse, six months earlier, the principle items sold were gold and jewellery, followed by livestock and motorbikes; this has remained the same in this survey (Figure 6.6).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33947e6b-c4fb-49d7-9a8d-1f930ec4e910": {"__data__": {"id_": "33947e6b-c4fb-49d7-9a8d-1f930ec4e910", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regressing Gender Equality in Myanmar: Women living under the Pandemic and Military rule", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ac34068451d3ef65410e3023b7e430a0ff8ff6b5d9947d0a2178bffa8b71b91"}, "2": {"node_id": "754c2e4a-8ed1-460a-86b9-9f81037973bb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "481cd48c32db016ab8e3ef2ab9d25ef0a5b0da9513e4387d0f9004f8316b0bfb"}}, "hash": "eb75c2d4d125506d7cb5f0201a52364a540533d190131063107b92c07e8279c9", "text": "Figure 6.6: Type of assets sold over time45 (percent) A unique aspect of this survey is that it is possible to identify who is taking most of the burden for these coping strategies.

Table 6.1 shows that, in those households that took out a loan since the military takeover, the loan has been taken out by a woman in the household in 63.2 percent of the cases.

In 4 out of 10 households that reduced non-food purchases, it was the women who cut back more. In 3 out of 10 households where assets were sold, the assets belonged to a woman. In 2 out of 10 households that used savings, the savings belonged to a woman. Examining the data in more detail (Tables A6.6 to A6.9),46 it can be seen that women are more likely to be responsible for the coping strategy when they are the head of household and not married. Selling assets and taking loans are correlated with living in urban areas. Taking a loan is correlated with living in a region, where access to banks or lending institutions/people might be easier. 6.3 Cutting back on food consumption 6.3.1 Background Prior to the military takeover, 2.8 million people were considered food-insecure in Myanmar. WFP estimated that, in three to six months, 1.5 million to 3.4 million additional people could be at risk of food insecurity and in need of assistance due to the economic slowdown provoked by the political crisis.47 The most recent estimates suggest that approximately 3 million people currently require humanitarian assistance.48 This is largely because poor people have lost jobs and income, making it harder for them to afford food. The market price of rice has risen by 5 percent and cooking oil by 18 percent since the military takeover. Even higher increases were recorded in Rakhine, Kachin and Chin. Given the importance of rice and cooking oil in the diet, continued price increases would further impact household food security. 41 6.3.2 Eating less food Figure 6.7 shows the growth in food insecurity. The same question has been asked in national-level surveys since August 2020 up until December 2021 and shows the steady increase in households eating less food so that they can afford other living expenses. Currently, four out of 10 households have cut back on what they eat. This might be an underestimate, since, as mentioned previously, the poorest households are missed in CATI surveys to some extent and weighting the data cannot completely correct for this. Figure 6.7: Ate less due to a lack of money or other resources in order to afford other living expenses, over time (percent) In terms of statistically significant differences, Figure 6.8 shows the highest rate of cutting down on food is reported by 31- to 39-year-old women (49.9 percent). These women are likely to be married, with children and perhaps with aging parents living at home, too.

Forty percent of all employed women \u2013 510 million women globally \u2013 work in hard-hit sectors, compared to 36.6 percent of employed men.49 With plummeting economic activity, women are particularly vulnerable to layoffs and loss of livelihoods. Globally, 58 percent of employed women work in informal employment, and estimates indicate that, during the first month of the pandemic, informal workers globally lost an average of 60 percent of their income.50 In Myanmar, women\u2019s waged work is focussed in lower-paid forms of employment, largely due to discriminatory social norms that restrict women to \u2018appropriate\u2019 jobs. Considerable gender wage gaps have been identified within several industries and, despite many years of advocacy by women\u2019s groups, Myanmar\u2019s labour laws still do not prohibit gender-based discrimination or sexual harassment within the workplace.51 The return to military rule has already rolled back many of the hard-fought gains made in expanding labour rights during recent years. It has also contributed to an estimated 1.2 million workers losing their jobs, 580,000 of them women.52 Action should also be taken to ensure that workers\u2019 rights are safeguarded. As part of its curb on popular resistance, the military declared 16 trade unions and civil society organizations to be \u201cillegal labour organizations,\u201d leaving only a handful of registered trade union federations remaining.53 \u201cCOVID-19 makes it harder for women to earn, making women feel more insecure when they go out.

The average number of men who have lost a job since COVID-19 began in March 2020 is 0.6 (approximately one man per two households); for women, it is slightly less, at 0.4. 6.5. Domestic work and unpaid care 6.5.1 Background When quarantine measures kept people at home and closed schools and day-care facilities, the burden of unpaid care and domestic work exploded55 for women and men alike. But, even before COVID-19, women did three times more unpaid care work than men, worldwide.56 School and day care closures, along with the reduced availability of outside help, have led to months of additional work for women. For working mothers, this has meant balancing employment with childcare and schooling responsibilities. A gendered division of labour is a major obstacle to women\u2019s empowerment. When women are disproportionately responsible for performing unpaid household work, this results in time poverty, which limits their ability to participate in the labour force. 6.5.2 Housework within the home When asked about housework/chores in the home, nearly half (48.3 percent) of the women interviewed felt that housework had increased since COVID-19 began in March 2020, going up to 51.1 percent in households with children (Table 6.3). The majority (50.2 percent) of women thought that women have taken on the burden of extra housework. This is especially felt by women living in urban areas and those living in the regions (Figure 6.13). Table 6.3: Housework/chores within the household since COVID-19 began in March 2020 (percent) Increased No change Total Union 48.3 51.7 100% Household without children 42.2 57.8 100% Household with children (0-17) 51.1 48.9 100% 47 Figure 6.13: Taken on the increased housework since March 2020, by gender (percent) 5 out of 10 women with children report taking on increased housework since COVID-19. 6.5.3 Caring responsibilities since March 2020 Even more than housework, women have experienced an increase in caring responsibilities since COVID-19.

Decision-making within the home 6.6.1 Background Power and decision\u2010making in the household are an important aspect of gender equality. Gender inequalities in the household reinforce and are reinforced by gender inequalities in society. Gender equality is a development goal on its own and a critical factor for achieving sustainable development, enveloping the concept of 'leaving no one behind'. There is evidence of the impact of household decision\u2010making \u2013 be it good or ill \u2013 on development, health, education, poverty and the division of paid work and household work.58 6.6.2 Decision making over time To examine how decision-making has changed over time, the question asked in the Myanmar DHS 2015/2016 was repeated in this survey. Figure 6.15: Main decision maker of major household purchases, 2015/2016 and 2021 (percent) 2015/2016 2021 Figure 6.15 shows a clear increase, from 19 percent to 33.8 percent, of women reporting to be the main decision maker for the purchase of major items. Once again, as the most marginalized women are often excluded in CATI interviews, the change might not actually be as large as the results suggest. However, there does seem to be some increasing equality experienced within the household. A woman is more likely to have an impact on decision making if living in urban areas, if the household has an above average income and if she is more educated (Table 6.6).

In 2011, when: \u2022 political prisoners were released, \u2022 press censorship was lifted, and \u2022 political parties could operate openly Members of this generation were in their early-teens. The unprecedented openness that people enjoyed from 2011 onwards led to a transformation in Myanmar, giving birth to Generation Z. This generation quickly learned how to use the Internet, to communicate on social media and to hold workshops and seminars on subjects related to democracy and civil rights. Now, its members are doctors and nurses, artists, bankers, railroad workers, teachers, LGBTQ activists, trade unionists and students, many of whom join and organize protests again the military regime. For the 18- to 30-year-old women interviewed in the survey, members of this age group are the most likely to: \u2022 Feel unsafe in their area and outside their area during the day. \u2022 Know a girl or woman who has sought support against domestic violence since COVID-19 began. \u2022 Used savings to cover living expenses since the military takeover. \u2022 Use social media (non-governmental) to obtain information about COVID-19. Meanwhile, they are the least likely to: \u2022 Stop paid work due to caring responsibilities. \u2022 Eat less due to a lack of money or other resources to help cover living expenses since the military takeover. Women in their 30s: At the time of this survey, 84.6 percent of the 31- to 39-year-old women had children at home. Members of this age group are the main caretakers of children and parents. Their current situation is perhaps one of the most depressing and stressful. 31- to 39-year-old Myanmar women in the survey are members of age group most likely to: \u2022 Say that access to health services has become more difficult.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdb9fbe2-d2db-46d0-8429-c13012719d4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdb9fbe2-d2db-46d0-8429-c13012719d4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regressing Gender Equality in Myanmar: Women living under the Pandemic and Military rule", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d497f693d705b2792b064ba354d767316be20f9206435d2afb4b316e3fbda34"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e9d1663-b0b1-4ca6-8b65-956064784e32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af3b43793601b7ad51190e1980075c8166f883dae4db23ad411723423e66c40e"}}, "hash": "1384cb4f5d0875d1deba5552f65f427f73e3e4f228f23bc733f4a6499fa3a0fb", "text": "\u2022 Agree with the statement that violence within the home has increased since COVID-19 began. \u2022 Notice domestic violence take place in their neighbourhood. \u2022 Be in households that have either cut down on food consumption, reduced non- food purchases or sold assets. \u2022 Have their unpaid care and domestic work responsibilities increase since COVID- 19 and not be able to engage in paid work any longer because of increased responsibilities. 51 7.

Conclusion The Myanmar military takeover and its crackdown on peaceful protesters are a dangerous set-back for democracy and the rule of law in Myanmar. They are especially devastating for women. The military takeover is likely to reverse the progress made over the last decade. The institutional and societal changes necessary to dismantle persistent gender discrimination are unlikely to take place under military rule. In addition to violence and regime oppression, people across Myanmar face a dire humanitarian predicament and long-term development challenges, with serious implications for Southeast Asia and beyond. The health and education systems have collapsed and schools and universities have been severely disrupted for months due to COVID-19 and the military takeover. The consequences of COVID-19 and the military takeover will not disappear quickly. Women are likely to experience long-term setbacks in work force participation and income. Impacts on assets and savings will have implications for women\u2019s economic security far down the road. The fall-out will be most severe for the most vulnerable women, including migrant workers, refugees and some ethnic groups. Economic insecurity has a snowball effect on the lives of women and girls for years to come. What is known from previous crises is: \u2022 Generally, increased unemployment tends to encourage people to go back to traditional gender roles: unemployed men are favoured in the hiring process when jobs are scarce, while unemployed women take on more household and care work. \u2022 During the Ebola outbreak in Western Africa, for instance, quarantines significantly reduced women\u2019s economic activity, driving a spike in poverty and food insecurity. While men\u2019s economic activity rebounded quickly, women\u2019s did not. In a situation of continuing violence, the destructive impact on the social and economic infrastructure of Myanmar means that humanitarian assistance and support for the restoration of livelihoods and micro and small businesses led by women will be required for the near future. The environment is difficult and volatile. Rapid localized shifts in power alter the on-the- ground conditions for development workers significantly and it is difficult to plan strategically. Things can quickly change from complex to chaotic. Specific support for women to mitigate the impact of the pandemic and the political crises at this time could include: Direct income support to women: economic support packages, including direct cash- transfers to give cash directly to women who are poor or lack income, can be a lifeline for those struggling to afford day-to-day necessities. 53 Support for women-owned and women-led businesses: Source food, personal protection equipment and other essential supplies from women-led businesses. Economic relief should similarly target sectors and industries where women are a sizeable proportion of workers. In armed conflict areas, due to instability and displacement, a direct cash-transfer programme would be more practical. Other sustainable support such as support for women- led business and income-generation programmes would be suitable for areas where there is more stability.

For example, local radio stations could be recommended to develop an awareness section on protection of women's rights, which could be aired in various local languages. Similarly, the support system for women survivors of domestic violence needs to be strengthened. Again, community-level mechanisms and systems can be established for referral and support to the survivors using a survivor-centred approach. Ensure continued maternity and reproductive health services: One of the most- impacted areas of service in the compounded crisis has been the health service. This study reveals the growing difficultly in access to maternity and childbirth services. Investing in community-level services for women and community health workers might be an option to fill this gap. 54 References CSO, World Bank, UNDP (2019) Myanmar Living Conditions Survey 2017: Poverty Report.

People\u2019s Pulse and Impact of COVID-19 and the military takeover on women survey since 1 February 2021. For the Impact of COVID-19 and the military takeover on women survey, household income is reported only by women. The HVS and People\u2019s Pulse interviews were taken 50/50 with women and men. Examining for gender differences in the reporting of household income in both the HVS and People\u2019s Pulse found no statistically significant differences. 43 Annex 2 provides further detail on the construction of Figure 6.5. 44 In the Impact of COVID-19 and the military takeover on women survey, these strategies are reported only by women; in the other surveys, they are reported by men and women. To examine whether gender affects the responses, the data for People\u2019s Pulse was analysed based only on women\u2019s responses and the results are shown in Annex 2. The differences are small and the trends remain the same. 45 Other assets sold include seven cars, four bicycles, two water pumps, three tuk-tuks, five farmlands, five mobile phones and four non-farmlands. 46 Questions asked only whether there was an adult man in the household.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b371d6ba-c5be-44ef-b1b8-985d0204962f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b371d6ba-c5be-44ef-b1b8-985d0204962f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Regressing Gender Equality in Myanmar: Women living under the Pandemic and Military rule", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3fda86b5a0f8e356c9340b44484cb60a56fb9db594f792439c236faf20b0d712"}, "2": {"node_id": "5fc47112-016a-4c36-95e2-8db421fd8208", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/regressing-gender-equality-myanmar-women-living-under-pandemic-and-military-rule", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e90ac380dc72d03e13daffb667ad2da4c392a654fcf6bcef2e7e2ea88b11ed2"}}, "hash": "3570fbb94232931913dffae0de2f7c388210012276635950b701acfd04cbc3f3", "text": "46 Questions asked only whether there was an adult man in the household. 47 https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Myanmar_Report_on_Economic_Fallout_- _Apr_2021.pdf 48 https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/walking-the-tightrope-humanitarian-assistance-in- myanmar 49 https://www.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2020/09/gender-equality-in-the-wake-of-covid-19 50 https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/9/feature-covid-19-economic-impacts-on-women 51 https://www.lift-fund.org/en/myanmar-forced-labour-study-rice-paddy-industrial-park 52 https://www.ilo.org/yangon/publications/WCMS_814681/lang--en/index.htm 53 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-ilo-idUSKBN2B71GC 54 https://www.frontiermyanmar.net/en/desperate-job-seekers-an-easy-target-for-scammers/ 55 https://interactive.unwomen.org/multimedia/explainer/unpaidcare/en/index.html 56 https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2020/9/feature-covid-19-economic-impacts-on-women 57 No statistically significant variation among the nine groups. 58 https://unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/stats/documents/ece/ces/ge.30/2016/WS/WP19_UNECE_Willis.pdf 59 Ninety-one potential interviews were lost due to the language barrier.

ROEMER EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY AS A MEASURE OF DEVELOPMENT The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 3 A society, regardless of average income, education and public health, is not truly developed unless all its citizens receive equal opportunities. An individual achieves success through three categories: an individual\u2019s choice, an individual\u2019s circumstances, and the public policy that enables economic and social envi- ronments in which an individual can find success despite their circumstances. Public policies should target specific categories that can make it more difficult for individuals to achieve equal so- cial and economic opportunities, thus achieving success in their society. Four uncontroversial and universal circumstance that impact a person\u2019s circumstances are parental income or educa- tional level, ethnicity, gender, and upbringing in a rural versus ur- ban household. The following paper explains how public policies should combat the unfair disadvantages the above circumstanc- es impress upon an individual if they do not experience unequal advantages, such as status advantages that come from belong- ing to certain ethnic or caste group, socioeconomic advantages, network and positional advantages that derive from living in the right place at the right time, and biological advantages that result from living without physical or mental disability. In additional to specific nations implementing policy changes that better ad- dress unequal opportunities, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) can also address this issue by determining regionally and nationally specific unequal opportunity circum- stances \u2013 including income, education and health status \u2013 and collecting data on how to implement policies that will be most effective at reducing inequalities of opportunity in each country.

But what exactly is fairness? However varied, most answers have their root in some notion of equality \u2013 equality before the law, equality of representation in politics, and so on. Building upon the work of one of the pres- ent authors (Roemer, 1996; 1998) we propose that fair- ness means that citizens have equal opportunities to achieve their goals. We will define the roles played by choices and circumstances in the origins of inequality and go on to propose metrics for measuring, and poli- cies for achieving, equality of opportunity. We will con- clude with a set of recommendations for policymakers. We consider the goals of citizens as those that prior work in development has identified as important and influential in policy: Individuals seek to achieve a high income, good health, the empowerment afforded by education and other such objectives as measured and reported in past United Nations Development Pro- gramme (UNDP) Human Development Reports.1 We will refer to these goals as the objectives of individuals. What does it mean for individuals to have equal op- portunities to achieve their objectives? We postulate three categories of inputs that determine success. The first set of factors are the individual\u2019s choices, which includes the effort she puts in, the decision of which sector to work in, etc. The second set includes those that we call the individual\u2019s circumstances. This includes all individual-specific factors relevant for success but not chosen. For example, individuals do not choose the ethnic group to which they belong, the socioeconomic status of their families of origin, their rural or urban background, or their gender. But it is ev- ident that these things will matter at least to a degree in determining their lot in life. Individuals ought to be held responsible for their choices, but not their cir- cumstances.2 The final category is public policy which shapes the economic and social environment in which they live,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eb700d68-0409-4e3a-94ae-ad879f1ecd76": {"__data__": {"id_": "eb700d68-0409-4e3a-94ae-ad879f1ecd76", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality of Opportunity as a Measure of Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dccb132d3fc76804563332eb9045bece332f5ec80d48b3835c9f002c40f29e76"}, "3": {"node_id": "79a4c68e-efe8-4300-8cb5-8f228112cacf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f27df10946cc7354a18f5412c25649129f9ae477b86cd5b3e99a27711525f3be"}}, "hash": "5d05f9c6f97a92e4d6909303ccf2e8d2c918341c2e5147110ce1f065fab78515", "text": "the benefits they receive, and, importantly, the relative importance of their circumstances versus their choices. Good public policy, we argue, blunts the effect of cir- cumstances, while amplifying the relative importance choices have in an individual\u2019s success. When individ- uals consider fairness, they think not just about what they and their fellow citizens are entitled to, but also what they are responsible for. Circumstances, as we have defined them, are the aspects of their situations or environments for which individuals cannot be held accountable, whereas choices are, up to a degree, their direct responsibility. Many will consider inequality due to circumstances to be unfair, but not inequality due to choices. Why, after all, should children born to poor, uneducated parents belonging to a disadvan- taged ethnic group have fewer opportunities than those born to wealthy, educated parents belonging to an advantaged ethnic group? On the other hand, if a pair of twins who received the same opportunities in life earn differential rewards because one was lazy while the other worked hard, it is harder to justify what we might term \u2018correcting\u2019 the inequality in some way.3 INTRODUCTION: DEVELOPMENT ENTAILS EQUALIZING OPPORTUNITIES \u201cWe cannot consider any society developed if its ordinary citizens remain steeped in a deep sense of unfairness, believing that the 'system is rigged'\u201d 1 Since 1990, the UNDP has published Human Development Reports (HDRs) most years; see http://hdr.undp.org/en/humandev. 2 We discuss below how circumstances may influence choices. 3 Actually, a fourth factor that we did not mention also contributes to determining an individual\u2019s success: \u2018episodic luck.\u2019 Two individuals with the same circumstances who worked equally hard may reap different rewards simply because one got lucky in life and the other did not. Developed societies are often ambivalent about accepting this kind of inequality, and implement social insurance policies to insure individuals against bad luck. Standard veil-of-ignorance arguments going back to the philosopher John Rawls (1971) are used to justify social insurance policies, besides the fact that there is a market demand for such insurance. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 6 What we are saying is that the reason, or source, of inequality matters. In the introduction to his influen- tial book, Capital in the 21st Century, Thomas Piketty (2014) wrote: \u201cInequality is not necessarily bad in itself: the key question is to decide whether it is justified, whether there are reasons for it.\u201d We then go on to learn that much contemporary inequality in industrial- ized countries arises from inherited wealth and, thus, rests on circumstance. Most people find this more disturbing than if the data had shown that essentially all inequality depends on differences in earnings rath- er than inheritance; that would indicate perhaps that choices play a more important role than circumstanc- es (although, of course, we could find other circum- stances beyond parental inheritance as objectionable sources of inequality). When opportunities are equal, how well individuals do in achieving their commonly held objectives does We have our own personal views as to which attributes define circumstances \u2014 those that individuals do not choose and for which they should not be held respon- sible. But, as a methodological matter, an important component of the equality-of-opportunity approach is cultural deference on this question. What serves as circumstance for some may prove a choice for others, and this may vary across cultures. Consider, for example, religion. An individual\u2019s faith can affect her success in pursuing an objective be- cause members of some religions may face greater societal discrimination than others. In some cultures, religion may be a circumstance, whereas in others it is a choice. When individuals of a particular religious background cannot avoid the discrimination that comes with it, even by converting to another religion or abandoning religion altogether, then religion con- stitutes a circumstance. In other societies where this is not the case, we might consider religion a choice. Another difficult question is whether we should con- sider even personal choices as completely determined not depend at all on their circumstances.

They must also move towards creating a fairer society for their citizens. The way to do this is by implementing policies that equalize opportunities for all citizens.4 by circumstances, because all choices may arise from mental or psychological states of mind outside the control of the individual. The materialist thesis says that any action a person takes has a correlated phys- ical state in his or her brain. A person\u2019s thinking and actions, in principle, can be read from physical brain states. Compatibilists say that the materialist thesis and the postulate of meaningful responsibility are mu- tually consistent. One can believe the materialist thesis and still assert that there are actions for which it makes sense to hold a person responsible. Incompatibilists say the two are inconsistent: if the materialist thesis is true, responsibility makes no sense. For an incompat- ibilist, everything is circumstance; there are no such things as choices.5 Most philosophers are compatibilists. What thinking supports the compatibilist view? If one has contem- plated an action and undertaken it in a calm and sober state, with intact powers of thought, then one becomes responsible for the action. The fact that the HOW DO WE IDENTIFY CIRCUMSTANCES? 4 See Appendix C for further reading on research into equality of opportunity. 5 Often, the language of \u2018freedom of the will\u2019 is used. Having free will means persons are responsible (to some degree at least) for their actions. An incompatibilist says this is impossible if the materialist thesis holds. A compatibilist does not consider the two to be inconsistent. The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 7 action and the thought that preceded it have physical correlations in the brain does not permit a person to say, \u201cDon\u2019t hold me responsible, my synapses did it.\u201d6 Of course, a society may, over time, hold people responsible for a smaller set of actions than it did earlier in history, as it learns how circumstances cause behaviour \u2013 that is, as social science advances. A compatibilist holds persons responsible for actions that they appear to have arrived at by calm, conscious thought, even though she recognizes that those ac- tions may eventually appear as due to circumstances beyond the individual\u2019s control. A compatibilist will rec- ognize that what counts as a circumstance will not on- ly vary across cultures; it will also change over time. Finally, at what age should society start holding indi- viduals responsible for their choices? Should children be held responsible in the same way that adults are? A child is an adult in the process of formation. As such, children should not be held responsible for any- thing, as far as equality of opportunity policies are concerned.7 Whatever the child does or accomplish- es results from nature and/or nurture, and the child cannot be considered responsible for either. Nurture entails the circumstance of parental education \u2013 and, of course, if we have more data on the environment in which the child was raised, those details comprise cir- cumstances as well. A child is not responsible for her nature: it was the luck of the birth lottery that endowed her with the talents and abilities that she has.8 This view implies that up to a certain point that we call the age of moral consent, everything that a child does should be considered as due to circumstances. Each society sets the age of moral consent \u2013 often some- time in adolescence. Ideally, if we measure inequal- ity of income opportunity in, say, a society of adults with 16 as the age of moral consent, then we should consider as \u2018circumstance\u2019 the entire biography of the individual up to that age! Some might object: if this were the case, then would not society end up holding adults responsible for very little, because the adult\u2019s path is in large part determined by who he or she is at age 16? Perhaps, but this only means that society must invest a great deal in children under 16, and particu- larly in disadvantaged children, so that they have an equal starting point to others at 16 years of age.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a91553ec-1068-4a91-912f-6c54a80a98f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "a91553ec-1068-4a91-912f-6c54a80a98f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality of Opportunity as a Measure of Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13ef5dc777175bcfe98cb2c044cd6177bca0dee9c0910ff43f5ba5db05336896"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f755510-d4d9-4868-888f-587f21f8d786", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c1125da51a8dfa0f96599126b842713ff65fe991cc311fa44b1dfdac10d3e33"}}, "hash": "7d9fa91fa278f5057f1bd2f229d523bad90a791d7ab5245c2dcde0c994d6443f", "text": "The alternative, of holding children responsible for their behaviour at age 10 (for example) is not acceptable, if we understand childhood as a period for learning what comprises morality and responsibility, and if we fix the age of moral consent at 16.

Of course, different people in society will hold different theories of responsibility, calling for eventual com- promise on these points. Many developing countries today tend to accept four circumstances as uncontro- versial: parental income or educational level, ethnic- ity, gender, and upbringing in a rural versus urban household. The first three are important circumstances in industrialized countries and the fourth \u2013 urban/rural status \u2013 may be as well.9 6 A few years ago, one of us was writing a paper measuring inequality of opportunity in several countries, and one of our collaborators proposed using brain scans of persons that were available in our data set as circumstances. We strongly opposed doing so. Why? As compatibilists, we believe that every action a person takes, for which she is responsible or not, has an associated brain state. Thus, showing that particular brain states were associated with an action tells us nothing about whether we should hold the person responsible for the action. Brain scan data are not irrelevant, but at present, we believe that using such data to excuse an individual from responsibility is only permissible if we have a causal theory of action. If we have a plausible theory of causation, in which the causes of the action are agreed to be circumstances beyond the individual\u2019s control, then she should not be held responsible. 7 The reason that we say children should not be held responsible as far as equality of opportunity policies are concerned, is that when raising children, we do hold them responsible for their behavior and actions, as a way of teaching them what is acceptable. This is a pedagogical strategy and does not imply that children are indeed morally responsible for their actions. 8 The terminology here is that talent is an inborn trait and skill is the output when education and training are applied to talent. 9 It is clear that parental income and education matter everywhere. Ethnicity is often the focus of discrimination, and should be delineated as circumstances. The same goes for gender. \u201cHow well an individual did in achieving the objective should depend entirely on the choices he or she has made and for which they may be held responsible, and not on their circumstances, for which they should not\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 8 As we have said, the important factors outside an indi- vidual\u2019s control that determine her success will vary by society, and so the data and measures of inequality of opportunity will also vary. In India, for example, mem- bership in a high caste makes it easier for one to suc- ceed in life. But individuals cannot choose their caste, so it is a circumstance; they cannot be held responsi- ble for its effect on their incomes. On the other hand, in a country like Iceland, we cannot consider caste a circumstance because it does not shape discrimi- nation. But some circumstances will be common to all societies. In virtually every society, the children of wealthier and more educated parents have an advan- tage. Children do not choose their parents, so again they cannot be held responsible for any disadvantage that comes with poorer or less educated parents; therefore, the wealth and education of one\u2019s parents become part of one\u2019s circumstance. Consider the following hypothetical scenario. Sangeeta is a Dalit woman in rural India from a poor background. She has worked hard to support herself and achieved a modest yearly income that is at the 80th percentile of income among all rural Indian Dalit women. Gopal is a Brahmin man living in Mumbai who comes from a priv- ileged background, and whose income is much higher than that of Sangeeta\u2019s. Gopal too has worked hard in life, and his income also sits at the 80th percentile of income among all urban Indian Brahmin men. If caste, urban-rural status, and gender are the main factors besides individual effort that determine success in earn- ings, we contend that the inequality in income between Gopal and Sangeeta is due entirely to these factors out- side their control. This would call for policies that would equalize their incomes.

What if he put in more long workdays and sleepless nights? We can only attribute this additional effort to his circumstance as a high-caste urban male; per- haps membership in this category teaches children to work harder. But if Gopal sits at the 90th percentile of income among urban Brahmin males, then part of the inequality between him and Sangeeta would be due to the choices that they have made. In this case, a policy that fully equalizes opportunities across members of Indian society would give Gopal a higher income than Sangeeta. Correspondingly, if Gopal sits at the 70th percentile among his circumstance cate- gory, but still earns more than Sangeeta, who is at the 80th percentile among her circumstance category (what we will call a \u2018type\u2019 from here on), a policy that equalizes opportunities would give Gopal a lower final income than Sangeeta. The claims that we make in the preceding two para- graphs rest on four important ideas. First, we charac- terize every individual as belonging to a type, a group of people who share the same circumstances. In the above example, Sangeeta is a member of the (female, rural, low caste) type and Gopal belongs to the (male, urban, high caste) type. Second, we define the degree of effort of an individual as his or her place (centile position) on the income distribution of his or her type. Third, we understand that the distribution of income of a type is itself a circumstance of that type: That is, it is a fact about society, determined by social policy, not by any individual. Therefore, it is a circumstance for that type and, as such, we should not hold persons responsible for belonging to a type with a low distribu- tion of income or effort \u2013 a distribution with, let us say, a low mean. Fourth, given these terms, we say that the equal-opportunity ideal at which policy should aim is to equalize the type-distributions of income. In particular, the income differences between those at the same centile of income across types should be minimized by crafting policies that raise the income of those in the most disadvantaged types. OPPORTUNITY MAPS What does this imply about how we measure inequal- ities in opportunity? Suppose for the sake of illustra- tion, that the only factor that affects an individual\u2019s expected income besides that individual\u2019s effort is parental educational level. Consider Figures 1 and 2, which present what we call \u2018opportunity maps\u2019 for Ec- uador and Germany, respectively. MEASURING EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 9 Figure 1 presents the distributions of (pre-tax) income among seven types of individual, defined by the levels of education of their two parents. The most disadvan- taged types are those whose parents did not complete elementary school, and the most advantaged type are those where at least one parent has a tertiary educa- tion and the other has at least a secondary education. We see that the distributions of income among the types in Ecuador are perfectly ordered.10 The left-most curve (with the darkest hue) represents the income distribution of the most disadvantaged type. This is not the case in Germany, which focuses on three levels of maternal education. We see that the three distributions of income in Germany fall much closer together. The distribution of income among persons of a given type precisely summarizes the in- come opportunities available to its members. Inequal- ity of opportunity for income is a good deal higher in Ecuador than in Germany. Of course, these inferences rest on the assumption that parental education is the only relevant circum- stance in both societies, which is an unlikely scenario. Many more circumstances will play a part, and these will vary by country. In many developing societies, such as China, urban-rural status may prove an import- ant circumstance, if children born and raised in rural areas become disadvantaged with respect to those from urban areas. In Figures 3 and 4, we present the evidence for this.

With these taken into account, the kinds of opportunity maps shown above for Ecua- dor, Germany and China can provide a clear picture of inequalities of opportunity. In Appendix A, we suggest a survey that can gather the information necessary to produce such opportunity maps, assuming the four cir- cumstances that we have suggested above (parental education, ethnicity, gender and rural/urban status) will define the main types. INDICES Consider again the opportunity maps for Ecuador and Germany. These opportunity maps suggest less inequality of opportunity in Germany because the distributions for Germany appear tighter (to the extent that the mother\u2019s income can be safely assumed as the only relevant circumstance \u2013 an assumption that we have already questioned). How can we formalize this in order to produce a simple measure of inequality of opportunity? One could measure the ratio of median income among the most disadvantaged type to the median income among the most advantaged type. We may infer that the higher the measure, the more equal the opportunities.11 In Ecuador, for example, we see that the median in- come for the most disadvantaged type is about 3,000, while that for the most advantaged type is 12,000. This gives us an equality of opportunity ratio (EOR) of 3,000/12,000 = 0.25. For Germany, the most advan- taged type has a median income of 27,000 while the most disadvantaged type has 23,000. Therefore, in Germany, EOR = 23,000/27,000 = 0.85. By this mea- sure, Germany appears significantly more developed than Ecuador. Of course, this simple measure discards much infor- mation that becomes available in the opportunity map, which depicts the extent of inequality of opportunity \u2014 with the caveat that parental education is only one of several important circumstances that determine in- dividual income, so that the figures presented here tell only part of the story. The EOR measure simply tells us how far apart the objective\u2019s distributions are across a pair of types. It does not have any qualitatively inter- pretable meaning beyond that. But it may still prove a useful statistic that can guide policy evaluation and help track improvements in opportunity equality over time and across countries. For example, the Czech Republic has an EOR of 0.57, allowing us to assert that the Czech Republic is more developed than Ecuador but less than Germany. Similarly, suppose that the government of Ecuador starts adopting policies that improve equality of op- portunity, and the EOR measure 10 years from now climbs to 0.5. We would be able to say that Ecuador has made substantial progress in equalizing oppor- tunities and is fast approaching the Czech Republic, although it still has some way to go before it reaches the level we see in Germany. We must emphasize that this measure discards the fuller picture derived from the opportunity maps, and that the latter themselves may not tell the whole story; they surely do not consider all of the immutable circumstances that we know contribute to individual success, and that vary across societies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c771e6b3-b848-4d8a-81f6-fdb467eaf144": {"__data__": {"id_": "c771e6b3-b848-4d8a-81f6-fdb467eaf144", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality of Opportunity as a Measure of Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "246ec4f29adff7ea98c24d401c40bc94ba271fc304fcebfe92961d45339003cf"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5f60968-b9ad-42e1-a528-9b4e6be13d68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9ff8380c0971e69d4c5e345bc571e19380d04e4d8861e5636da00fb0b947641"}}, "hash": "66e6c6c13826cac0fa1799b38304b5f2b9ccc2bd6287949c5a9659e5cb790393", "text": "Since UNDP produces region- and country-specific Human De- velopment Reports in addition to the global report, it could collect the data necessary to provide a more tailored picture of inequality in opportunity through regional and country-level opportunity maps, ones that account for important region- and country-specif- ic circumstances.

We explain how to compute this measure in Appendix B. COMPARISON WITH OTHER INEQUALITY MEASURES Our (in)equality of opportunity measures can play a vital role in public policy by complementing other measures of inequality such as Gini coefficients (for income, landownership, etc.) or even the inequali- ty-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) that the UNDP has published in recent years.12 To see why equality of opportunity measures have such relevance, let us return to Gopal and Sangeeta whom we introduced above. If despite their different backgrounds, Gopal and Sangeeta truly had equal opportunities in life but Gopal became twice as suc- cessful as Sangeeta simply because he worked much harder, we would have a difficult time justifying public policies that compensated Sangeeta (particularly if they came at Gopal\u2019s expense). But if Gopal is twice as successful as Sangeeta mainly due to his status as a high-caste urban male, where Sangeeta is a low-caste rural female, then it becomes easier, we would argue, to justify public policies that compensate Sangeeta for her disadvantage. The conventional measures of inequality such as the Gini (and for that matter the IHDI) do not distinguish between these two very different causes of inequality: The overall level of inequality is the same in both. But the equality of opportunity approach does distinguish between them: Inequality of opportunity is nil in the for- mer and substantial in the latter. And we argue that dis- tinguishing between these causes matters if we study inequality in the first place in order to create a fairer so- ciety. It is precisely this view that guides our distinction between circumstances and choices, and we encour- age policymakers to consider this distinction when they think about the right policies, as we discuss below.13 12 See http://www.hdr.undp.org/en/content/inequality-adjusted- human-development-index-ihdi. 13 Another critical point: the inequality of opportunity measures we propose are not utilitarian metrics along the lines of per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and the unadjusted HDI. (The introduction of the HDI made literacy and life expectancy important components of development in addition to per capita income, but the HDI is still an average of the whole society; in that sense, it remains a modified utilitarian measure. It does not record how well the most disadvantaged in the society are doing.) Like other measures of inequality, our equality of opportunity measures embody a special moral concern for the most disadvantaged members of society \u2013 in this case, those who have the most disadvantaged circumstances. In this sense, it is a Rawlsian measure that implicitly guides policymakers to maximize the average value of the objective for the most disadvantaged type: the one with the worst distribution of the objective. \u201cIf caste, urban-rural status, and gender are the main factors besides individual effort that determine earnings, inequality in income between two individuals in the same country is due entirely to factors outside their control, which calls for policies to equalize their incomes\u201d The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 12 Equality-of-opportunity policy should aim to mitigate the effect of circumstance on individual ability to achieve objectives, and make success or failure de- pend entirely (or at least more) on individual choices \u2013 in particular, individual effort.14 Naturally, the policies that improve equality of opportunity will depend on the relevant circumstances, which, as we have said, will vary by society. Nevertheless, we can generalize that certain circumstances are likely to be important in all developing societies.

Network and positional advantages that come from social connections, and from living at the right place at the right time. We can see a special case of this in China know as guanxi, through which individuals exploit their social networks and personal relation- ships for gains in business. In some cases, these networks come into being as a result of the choices that people make, but often they are inherited or de- rived from being at the right place at the right time, in which case they form part of an individual\u2019s cir- cumstances. For example, through these networks, people born and residing in a booming city may have an advantage compared to those who happen to live in depressed economic areas. Moreover, with the local economic environment as an important factor determining an individual\u2019s success, geogra- phy itself can become a significant circumstance, particularly when moving is costly. 4. Biological advantage that comes with the absence of mental or physical disabilities. Individuals who suffer from these disabilities, through no fault of their own, may become inherently disadvantaged if they cannot perform as effectively in certain jobs, or if they face societal discrimination on the basis of their disabilities, in life and work, alike. In Western countries, the rise of capitalism, which replaced feudalism, sought to eliminate the status advantages of category 1. But in many developing countries, status advantages akin to those of Europe- an feudalism remain quite prevalent. Policies that seek to eliminate these advantages also seek to abolish social discrimination.15 This includes abolishing titles; implementing laws that make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity and social category; and adopting affirmative action policies and minimum quo- tas for disadvantaged groups in education, politics and the economy. Additionally, even in the societies that have adopted capitalism, the structure of property ownership has preserved or even exacerbated the socioeconomic and network advantages of categories 2 and 3. For example, if successful wealthy individuals can be- queath their wealth to their children, this can give them advantages that others do not have \u2013 not because of any choices they made, or effort they applied, but simply because they had the right parents. Even where wealth cannot be easily transferred from one gener- ation to the next (because of, say, high estate taxes), successful parents may still pass down their knowl- edge, skills, and social networks to their children, or invest more in their children\u2019s education and human capital. Again, these advantages do not arise from the choices and effort applied by these children, but by virtue of their having the right parents. Similarly, geography can provide advantage. Raj Chet- ty and his collaborators show in the case of the United States, how social mobility varies considerably by region (Chetty et al, 2014). Presumably, this occurs be- 14 We do not support \u2018levelling down\u2019 \u2013 that is, reducing the average income of advantaged types simply to reduce the differences between average incomes of all types. It is more accurate to say that equality of opportunity policy compensates disadvantaged types through policies that increase their incomes. 15 In the United States \u2014 seen as a bastion of capitalism \u2014 naturalized citizens must renounce any titles of nobility, and the 1810 Titles of Nobility Amendment to the Constitution strips American citizenship from anyone who accepts a title from \u201cany emperor, king, prince or foreign power.\u201d WHAT POLICIES CAN REDUCE INEQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY? The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 13 cause opportunities to climb the economic ladder are more plentiful in some places than others. We have no reason to doubt that other countries besides the Unit- ed States also display regional variation in economic opportunities. In fact, we have already demonstrated above that in China, a rural versus urban background is a source of disadvantaged circumstance. Policies that target resources to the children of dis- advantaged parents help reduce the socioeconomic advantages of category 2. This includes investment in public education and public health targeted to low-income families. These policies aid human capital formation, and alleviate inequalities in human capital. As James Heckman and his collaborators have argued, investments in early childhood education are likely to have the highest returns (Heckman et al., 2013). Simi- larly, policies that encourage the spread of economic activity across regional geographies, or that promote geographic mobility in the labour market, can allevi- ate the network advantages of category 3.

Since one of the present authors began work on the topic in the early 1990s, research on equality of opportunity has exploded; we provide a partial bibli- ography of this literature as an addendum (Appendix C). But most of this prior work has focused on indus- trialized countries that have collected data in order to measure inequalities in opportunity and look at their various facets. We strongly recommend that UNDP collect this kind of data for developing countries as well. Fairness concerns are not the sole province of industrialized countries; they are just as important in developing countries, if not more. An effective research program, we propose, would proceed via the following steps: 1. UNDP should convene in each country a group of its philosophers, public intellectuals, government offi- cials, expert economists and other social scientists to determine the relevant set of \u2018circumstances\u2019 for its citizens and their \u2018objectives,\u2019 as we have de- fined these terms. We have suggested the follow- ing three objectives: income, education and health status. We have also suggested starting with the following four circumstances: parental income or education, ethnicity, urban/rural status and gender. But these circumstances must be tailored to each country, and any given country will no doubt have more of them to consider. 2. Based on the set of circumstances as defined in Step 1, the UNDP, along with country governments and local partners, should collect data on how distribution of achievement in each of the objec- tives varies with the circumstances, using the kind of step-by-step data-collection procedure that we describe in Appendix A. This calls for creating the kinds of \u2018opportunity maps\u2019 that we depicted above. 3. After examining these opportunity maps, the same group of experts mentioned in Step 1 above should craft the policies that they think would prove most effective in reducing inequalities of opportunity in each country. We have mentioned general policies that eliminate status advantages, socioeconomic advantages, network advantages and biological ad- vantages. But, again, these policies require tailoring to the needs of each society \u2014 hence the impor- tance of convening local experts to craft them.

The number of types of individual is then 23\u00b74=32. Each type comprises a group with the same set of circumstances. Suppose we collect data from a sample of 10,000 individuals. On average, then, there will be approximately 300 individuals in each type. Let us suppose that we asked these individuals questions regarding their objectives, of which we consider two: income and education. From these data, we can create opportunity maps for income and education by type, like the ones we depicted in the main text. These opportunity maps give us a picture of inequality of opportunity: disadvantaged types will have distributions of income and education that are overall worse than the those of advantaged types \u2013 just as how, in the main text, we saw opportunity maps showing the rural type in China, particularly in the Southwest, as disadvantaged relative to the urban type. How should we run the survey? The following are some sample questions: 1. What is your age? Let there be T types. Let F be the cumulative distribution function of income for the society. Let Ft be the income cumulative distribution function (cdf) in type t = 1,...,T . Let the fraction of type t in the population be ft.

The cdf \u0424(F) is a step function with T steps. In the distribution \u0424(F), it is as if every member of a given type has expended identical effort: The inequality in \u0424(F) is due only to circumstances, that is, to the individual\u2019s type.

How many years of schooling did your father have? 5. Were you raised up to the age of 16 primarily in a rural area (e.g., village, small rural town) or urban area (e.g., large town, major city)? 6. Please select your gender: Male, Female, Other/ Nonbinary. 7. What is your approximate monthly income? 8. How many years of schooling have you attained? These questions are merely suggestions. For example, in many developing countries, individuals cannot report their incomes, so the survey must ascertain their income or wealth status indirectly. In addition, we have asked individuals to self-report their urban/rural background, assuming that the age of moral consent is 16. However, it may be a better idea to simply ask them where they were born, where they lived when they were 10, etc., and then code their urban/ rural status later. (The age of moral consent itself may vary according to what that society considers appropriate.) For the ethnicity question, giving the respondents a set of options may produce more precise results. Expert surveyors will do better than we have in framing these questions, but the sample questions above provide a basic idea of the information needed. The survey should also collect data on any additional circumstances relevant to that country, beyond the four proposed. After creating the opportunity maps, one can measure the extent of inequality of opportunity using the equality of opportunity ratios (EORs) described in the main text, or by measuring the extent of inequality due to circumstance. A method of estimating this appears in Appendix B. is the fraction of inequality (as measured by the MLD) ascribed to circumstances. In fact, there is a nice formula: That is, the MLD of F is equal to the MLD of the smoothed distribution plus the weighted sum of MLDs of the type distributions. This formula implies that the MLD is decomposable. (The Gini coefficient, in particular, is not decomposable. That is if we substituted \u2018Gini\u2019 for \u2018m\u2019 in this formula, the two sides would not be equal.) To calculate r, one would need the following data: \u2022 The fraction of each type in the population \u2022 The mean income of each type, and \u2022 The income distribution in the aggregate population.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a08133e3-d9ab-425e-8530-420427da585e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a08133e3-d9ab-425e-8530-420427da585e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Equality of Opportunity as a Measure of Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4fc92fa7f6f5ca6cb4ca8823046c445314ab9daed26ed36f020215b9fc0ddb1"}, "2": {"node_id": "5bf71862-66b1-453e-a8ca-a7619dc4a123", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/equality-opportunity-measure-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8f3de0f6b341b5b217f72eddcd4031f0296853790ca4b2641ad2704eb7aed18"}}, "hash": "92e7ff9b00866e939781365d3b4917c8753ca17ccf530daa73c5617b5dc07cd8", "text": "The UNDP Strategy, Policy and Partnerships (SPP) team in RBAP Page 16 APPENDIX C: PARTIAL BIBLIOGRAPHY OF RECENT EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON EQUALITY OF OPPORTUNITY Bj\u00f6rklund, A., M.

For a region experiencing most of the world\u2019s natural hazards and extreme weather events, environmental perils are increasingly poised to inflict further suffering. The region has also witnessed democratic reversals in several countries this past year, with the most forceful experienced in Afghanistan and Myanmar. The barometer of public trust in governance institutions and leadership has diminished in most countries. Income inequalities widened in a large number of countries, as millions got left behind, whether in city-center urban slums or remote rural areas. Other deeply regrettable fall-backs were on gender equality markers, access to new technology and both within and among countries the evident vaccine and global financial flow inequities. 2021 should have been a year to reduce these gaps, not exacerbate them. UNDP swiftly realigned programmes and budgets to address immediate needs in these volatile situations, working in this context of \u2018development emergencies\u2019, where needed, without losing sight of longer-term sustainable development objectives of reducing poverty, shoring up underlying socioeconomic vulnerabilities, strengthening accountable and inclusive governance, promoting solutions for a sustainable planet, and supporting livelihoods. Fostering resilience, diversity and gender equality drove design and purpose. For UNDP, tackling these complex issues requires a constant rethink of how we bring in new ideas, learning and innovations to apply integrated approaches to a complex of challenges.

Our experience and presence in the Asia Pacific region, demonstrates a uniquely positioned UNDP that leads with analytics and substance, to work with national institutions as they test and drive their own transitions to COVID recovery and to decarbonizing their economies. As countries look for solutions at varying levels of acceleration, we must increasingly expand and tap our regional and global expertise and knowledge networks to engage with and support transformational change. This report highlights the results of this journey over the last two pandemic-defined years. It has been unusual times and has required from us an extraordinary response. We hope we have done justice to that team effort, and the work done together with our UN, national and international partners. If we can leave the reader with just one take-away \u2013 we hope the capture of results shows more than a series of outputs \u2013 we hope it conveys the spirit and commitment of UNDP teams working with clarity of purpose to help countries in the region get back on track with the SDGs.

Even as this report is compiled, the region grapples with the evolving and devastating consequences of the virus, which has taken the lives of thousands of people, destroyed tens of millions of jobs and livelihoods, reversed progress in reducing poverty, and exacerbated existing inequalities. As COVID-19 affects all human development dimensions, UNDP realigned programmes and budgets to address immediate emergency needs, without losing sight of longer-term aims like pulling people out of poverty, strengthening accountable and inclusive governance, building resilience, promoting solutions for a sustainable planet, and fostering diversity and gender equality. A results report like this one usually looks back at challenges and progress. However, given the enormity of the crisis that the world now faces, this report also presents responses to the current crisis that set a path for addressing future ones in Asia and the Pacific. After all, we need to look at the long road ahead to post-pandemic recovery to be better prepared for tomorrow\u2019s shocks, whatever form they may take. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The world was confronted by the ultimate disrupter in the form of a global pandemic that laid bare and intensified the development deficits that already existed. Gains in attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals were stopped in their tracks, and in many cases reversed. COVID-19 highlighted the integrated and interlinked nature of development issues and sectors, where progress in one area cannot be achieved without simultaneous and coordinated work in others. The pandemic also triggered new ways of thinking and collaborating. It provided avenues to harness the power of existing and emerging digital technologies to fight COVID-19, empower citizens to work remotely and transform the way governments connect with citizens.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b5a85642-57c7-413a-94fb-5a06eaae5fff": {"__data__": {"id_": "b5a85642-57c7-413a-94fb-5a06eaae5fff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "478c1f748bcc0153ce53efcbf7daedd68ff5bc7b18e0e55f27f023a1b710a14a"}, "2": {"node_id": "9bdb7603-5f6d-43f8-9d20-8b497ad4df82", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33e0ae5124049e6242c50dde4cee953aebcb3e2491dd5400068fd47e07a39c7d"}}, "hash": "8fb4a343906c2cceb66a260d968085b6cf7735fb4ad096778c27a90c9ca03245", "text": "Innovative use of technologies has spurred a rethink and a reimagining of the way we do development and has offered an opportunity to \u2018build back better.\u2019 Key Messages 17 COUNTRIES, SUPPORTED WITH COVID-19 SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACT ASSESSMENTS 1.9B ADMINISTERED USING DIGITAL SYSTEMS FOR COVID VACCINE MANAGEMENT IN US$30M PROCURED AND DELIVERED TO DOSES OF VACCINATIONS 5 COUNTRIES (BANGLADESH, BHUTAN, INDIA, INDONESIA, AND NEPAL) 22 COUNTRIES, INCLUDING PPE, DIAGNOSTICS, OXYGEN CONCENTRATORS, HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER COVID-RELATED ITEMS OF MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT Responding to COVID 27 20 RAISED MITIGATION AMBITION RAISED ADAPTATION AMBITION COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THROUGH CLIMATE PROMISE COUNTRIES PRODUCED NATIONALLY DETERMINED CONTRIBUTIONS (NDCS) 81% 93% 266,2 M HECTARES 487,000 HECTARES 141,000 HECTARES 193 M HECTARES 213,700 KILOMETERS OF COASTLINE ACROSS 12 EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES INTEGRATED COASTAL MANAGEMENT LIFE-SUPPORTING ECOSYSTEMS PROTECTED FOREST AND WETLANDS RESTORED MARINE ECOSYSTEMS UNDER IMPROVED MANAGEMENT/ PROTECTION LAND RESTORED Combating Climate Change COVERING 10.77% OF GLOBAL GHG EMISSION Protecting Nature Even as COVID-19 ravaged the globe in 2020 and 2021, ongoing development challenges persisted throughout the Asia-Pacific region.

UNDP continued to support the momentum of regional and national campaigns and the mobilization of public and private finance to achieve the SDGs by 2030. However, the pandemic forced UNDP to quickly evolve its programmes and expand its expertise to combat and manage the crisis. It repurposed existing resources to meet the challenge. Priority was given to rapid multi-dimensional assessments of the impact of COVID-19, and the development of national response and mitigation strategies. RBAP promoted regional dialogue platforms to share experiences and enrich knowledge and learning. We boosted the use of innovation, experimentation, and the leveraging of digital technologies for social service delivery and enhancing the interface between citizens and government.

The goal is to inspire innovation and influence action through cutting-edge analysis and policy advice. An important component of UNDP policy expertise is the Economist Network, which was expanded by placing economists directly in Country Offices.

It documents policy lessons that can underpin development discourse and outreach to governments, thinktanks, social movements and the private sector on development priorities leading to 2030. The chapters address policy shifts in areas accelerated by the pandemic, including climate change; sovereign finance; digitalization; global value chains and productivity growth; measures and aspirations for improved human conditions, such as equality of opportunities, multi- dimensional poverty, human security, and vaccine equity; and new modes of state capacity and international governance, including global public goods, and regional cooperation. In addition, Socio-Economic Impact Assessments in 17 countries provided much-needed evidence and information to policy makers for their COVID-19 responses. Policy options included adoption of economic stimulus packages and cross-sectoral response programmes. Strategic communication is an integral part of policy analysis and forecast. RBAP led a collective effort to study the anticipated impact of the crises in Myanmar and Afghanistan on the development trajectories in those countries.

THOUGHT LEADERSHIP - Frontier issues that reimagine development - Spotlight on Myanmar and Afghanistan - Responding to the shocks, preserving social sustainability - COVID-19 impact assessments inform response & recovery - National Human Development Reports fuel public debate [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Theme 2: COVID-19 response and socio-economic recovery The pandemic has revealed and intensified development deficits such as poverty, inequality, exclusion, and environmental decline. It has exposed institutional weaknesses including limited health and disease surveillance, education systems, insufficient social safety nets and inadequate fiscal resources to respond to crises. In 2020-2021, UNDP promoted holistic approaches to tackling COVID-19 through multi-dimensional responses to the pandemic, particularly in health and economic sectors. RBAP has fostered the sharing of best practices and lessons learned on effective surveillance and disease control, use of innovative IT technologies to track and map the spread of the virus, and the quick ramp up of income support schemes. We have also provided direct assistance through procurement and supply of essential health products and vaccine distribution. We have helped to strengthen crisis management and response and provided support to address critical social and economic impacts. Financial resources for the COVID-19 response have come from repurposing US $96 million and mobilizing US $131 million. Our strong partnerships in support of national programmes have enabled the administering of 1.9 billion doses of vaccines using digital systems for COVID-19 vaccine management, and the procurement of US $30 million worth of medical supplies and equipment delivered to 22 countries. Supplies have included PPE, test kits, oxygen concentrators, hospital equipment, and other COVID-related items. Many of the approaches introduced during the pandemic will remain as the new normal and will comprise some of the \u2018build back better\u2019 plans that can yield benefits in the future. Theme 3: Digital transformation and innovation Access to digital technologies is an enabler of development and an equalizer of opportunity, amplifying the voices and providing knowledge and information to the powerless and marginalized so that no one is left behind. Access to the internet transforms the way in which citizens interface with government and eases access to public service. Unequal access can deepen vulnerabilities. RBAP is working with partner governments to foster digital transformation by helping COVID RESPONSE AND RECOVERY - Immediate health response - Digital vaccine management - Social Protection to respond to economic shocks - Restoring livelihoods and building economic resilience - Effective Communication matters DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION AND INNOVATION - Digital transformation in government - Closing the digital divide for small businesses - Bringing care online - Making data work for people - Innovation as an integral part of development solutions them to bridge the digital divide, develop digital strategies, access finance, build digital infrastructure and mainstream digital solutions throughout national institutions. Improved accountability, transparency and reduction of corruption are crucial by-products of this effort. Finally, RBAP has worked to stimulate economic activity through skills development in e-commerce, e-payments, and funds transfers. UNDP has invested heavily in strengthening innovation and digital capabilities across the region through 18 Accelerator Labs, and a Regional Innovation and Digital Team, which is supported by global teams. They have focused on systems thinking, and systems design and transformation, rather than on isolated single point solutions. The disruptions from COVID-19 have provided the opportunity to reimagine the way our societies can work in the future and offered fertile ground for innovation and experimentation. Theme 4: Responsive and inclusive governance The COVID-19 pandemic was at first a health emergency, but with serious impacts across the socio-economic spectrum. Governance institutions in many cases struggled to organize capacities and resources for their response. Simultaneously, some countries in the Asia-Pacific region saw the gradual, but noticeable, expansion of centralized measures and the contraction of space in civil society for peaceful and free discourse. Laws were passed to bypass or undermine legislatures, judiciary, or civil society. Press freedoms were curtailed. UNDP helped to strengthen institutional responses to COVID-19, including support to social service delivery, revitalization of economic activity and bolstering social safety nets. UNDP also pioneered innovations in online governance such as digitalization of the judiciary and parliaments. It created new digital opportunities for citizen engagement, such as Social Innovation Platforms", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1509e26-491a-4f07-8227-e7c306e164e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1509e26-491a-4f07-8227-e7c306e164e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4b43621174825d415429ccb905888705509124ed1624434de10c3150f610c55b"}, "3": {"node_id": "4213e92b-c6e2-4373-95f8-c410bce52b2d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db14f674c340a7e88cad870ad6fd9783c9d32b29397d79b46eb0a4de664b5dc5"}}, "hash": "b9a146c8682bf24f88daa10e0b4c49742db2785e5bd445d4590ad3f5cdd80b3d", "text": "(SIPs), for collaboration at local level among citizens, governments, and the private sector. UNDP also developed guidance and toolkits to create awareness and promote human rights in the private sector. It supported advocacy, capacity building and policy changes to address gender-based violence. Partnerships and direct support to women\u2019s groups, police, judiciary, and parliaments were all part of its multi-pronged approach. Some of its most effective efforts to address gender-based violence were carried out as part of the EU and UN Spotlight Initiative. In addition, UNDP and the Citi Foundation helped to catalyze Asia\u2019s largest youth leadership and social entrepreneurship movement through its Youth Co:Lab programme, which has benefited more than 9,500 young entrepreneurs and 1,240 startups in 28 countries. Similarly, UNICEF and UNDP worked together in an Asia-Pacific partnership for young people\u2019s empowerment which helped more than two million youth.

It is also one of the most disaster- prone regions in the world. RBAP provides critical support to integrate environmental considerations into planning and budgeting frameworks, including National Adaptation Plans. We also help to prepare countries for Conference of Parties (COP) meetings and advocate for them to raise their ambitions for climate action. Through a portfolio of 131 projects in 33 countries in the region, we are a key interlocuter and conduit for programme countries to access environment and climate change funding from the Global Environment Facility, the Adaptation Fund, Green Climate Fund (GCF), Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF), Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) and bilateral donors. We advise countries on ways to finance the management of forests, natural ecosystems, and biodiversity, including through the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) which supported 11 countries in the region in 2020-2021. The REDD+ programme helps to conserve tropical forests and reduce greenhouse gases. With financing from the GEF, UNDP in the Pacific has been promoting a sustainable blue economy for decades through integrated coastal management and improved management of marine resources. Our support to energy efficiency and expanded use of renewable sources extends beyond technical solutions to also examine the linkages of energy access to poverty, gender, and human rights. In addition, UNDP works to de-risk investments for renewable energy markets and attract and leverage private and public sector resources. UNDP, in our most disaster-prone region in the world, works closely with governments to strengthen governance capacities to plan and respond to disasters and conduct impact assessments after disasters have occurred. It supports the development of national disaster reduction and management plans and strengthens resilience through disaster and climate change adaptation programmes. With UNDP assistance, a risk-informed lens is applied to national planning and budgetary processes, large-scale infrastructure investments, as well as local recovery and development actions.

The health emergency is not yet over, with new variants emerging and cases rising again in early 2022 even as this report is written. COVID-19 demonstrated the interlinked nature of the SDGs.

This is achieved through wide use of data and expertise, drawing on local policy context and developments, and undertaking rapid human development assessments, such as reports on the effects of acute crises in Afghanistan and Myanmar, or socio-economic assessments of COVID-19 impacts across the region. Thought leadership In recent decades, there has been heightened demand for sound technical advice to initiate policy reforms that pave the way for development outcomes that are just and lasting. With many developing countries in Asia and the Pacific now attaining lower- or upper-middle income status, rigorous evidence-based policy advice is a domain that merits greater UNDP engagement. As part of this effort, UNDP, including in Asia and the Pacific, aims to be an evidence and experience-based thought leader in the six signature solutions championed by the UNDP Strategic Plan and tailored to local contexts and needs. What is thought leadership? The goal is to offer policy guidance, inspire innovation and influence action through cutting edge analysis and policy advice. UNDP plays the role of a connector by linking country partners with resources, expertise, and knowledge. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Partnerships (SPP) Unit at Headquarters in New York. These steps augmented in-house capacity that resulted in rigorous, evidence-based knowledge products on policy and strategic foresight. To solicit periodic ideas from some of the world\u2019s finest thinkers in development, an Eminent Advisory Council was formed.1 High-level dialogues and events regularly brought together leading thinkers from academia and governments, including sessions with Asia-Pacific Ambassadors to the United Nations, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd at The Asia Society, and \u2018The Equity Imperative\u2019 discussion series with the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth in the sidelines of the 76th UN General Assembly. These helped to ensure a laser focus on the development challenges and explore the solutions that are critically important for the region. An edited policy compendium, The Great Upheaval: Resetting Development Policy and Institutions for the Decade of Action in Asia and the Pacific, will be published by Cambridge University Press. It documents policy lessons that can underpin current dialogues and outreach to governments, thinktanks, social movements and the private sector on development priorities leading to 2030. The chapters address policy shifts accelerated by the pandemic, including climate change, sovereign finance, digitalization, global value chains, and productivity growth; measures and aspirations for improved human conditions, such as equality of opportunities, multi-dimensional poverty, human security, and vaccine equity; and new modes of state capacity and international governance, including global public goods, regional cooperation, and lessons from pandemic governance.

Our policy teams produced 17 publications, several with partners such as WHO, ADB and ESCAP, that triggered policy debates often contributing to policy changes. Themes included COVID-19 response, such as the report, Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic: Leaving No Country Behind, which underlines the risk of leaving behind vulnerable countries. It highlights how digitalization and regional cooperation can help close development gaps and manage and mitigate growing divergence between countries.

Frontier issues that reimagine development for a sustainable future The Asia and Pacific region is remarkably diverse, and UNDP\u2019s policy support is essentially demand driven. However, issues such as inequality, climate change, basic social services, governance and judicial reform, LDC graduation, and building resilient economies are of global and lasting interest, and therefore are the focus of much of the thought leadership provided by UNDP. In 2020-2021, the high demand for policy advice to deal with the impacts of COVID-19 meant that RBAP ramped up advice on responding to the economic, health, inequality, and social effects of the pandemic. UNDP plans to deepen its support to policy and foresight analysis on frontier issues that reimagine development for a sustainable future. With the advanced capabilities for policy modeling and anticipatory analysis, UNDP and our national partners will be better positioned to navigate complexity and uncertainty. UNDP\u2019s core mandate to integrate and coordinate varied facets of sustainable development requires continued forging of partnerships with diverse development allies. In 2020-2021, UNDP laid the solid foundation to support a thought leadership agenda in the region. We consolidated the Economists Network by placing 27 economists in 20 country offices, formed a regional Foresight Network, strengthened a regional team of advisors on inclusive growth at the Bangkok Regional Hub, and established the Strategy, Policy and At the regional level in Asia and the Pacific, this includes creation of collaborative policy space to examine options and generate development solutions with national partners, through the help of policy briefs and analyses, establishment and nurturing of virtual theme-based knowledge networks, convening of symposia and conferences on key issues, and direct support to Country Offices. At the national level, in addition to the policy advice and advocacy provided through our projects, UNDP Country Offices in the region are catalysing national dialogue and conversations on critical development and policy issues. In 2020-2021 the launches of our flagship National Human Development Reports have brought together diverse national partners to generate consensus on the way forward, supported by perspectives of regional and global thought leaders. The effective use of media as part of a systematic communications strategy is key to this effort, be it turning a spotlight on rapidly evolving development emergencies through global news outlets or sharing real-time development events in social media.

The policy response to each of these shocks is multifaceted and call for globally coordinated actions that ensure social sustainability. The RBAP Economist Network produced a series of policy papers on these interrelated topics to examine development challenges faced by the countries in the region and proposed policy options to address them. The Economic Aspects of Climate Change provided a succinct overview of key policy elements needed for a shift from fossil fuels.3 It recommended pricing carbon in a way that is compatible with the ambitious targets in the Paris Agreement. It noted that taking this approach would contribute to creating the necessary fiscal space to help manage the transition. A critical mass of countries following this path could lead to a sustained transition. The Economist Network also produced a Position Note of the Social and Economic Impact of Covid-19 in the Asia-Pacific,4 policy guidance for UNDP Resident Representatives in the Asia- Pacific Region, and 17 country-specific notes, summarized in the Synthesis of Socio-Economic Impact Assessments of COVID-19 in Asia Pacific5.

Building on the Position Note of the Social and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in the Asia-Pacific,9 the policy guidance for UNDP Resident Representatives in the Asia-Pacific region, and the 17 Socio-Economic Impact Assessments commissioned by Country Offices in 2020 in the region, UNDP helped national partners to understand the dynamics of the socio- economic impact and derive policy options for the response in country-specific context. The Mongolia Country Office released Poverty and Inequality during COVID-19, using Big Data from Value-Added Tax data to track changes in consumption, poverty, and inequality. This is the first time that Big Data generated from such Photo: UNDP Mongolia. Rapid socio-economic impact assessment for vulnerable groups records was used for research and analysis to present alternative estimates of poverty and inequality in the country. The data can provide evidence for policy makers to define targeted social protection policies. The Philippines Country Office issued a brief on Leveraging Non- traditional Datasets for Assessing Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 across Philippine Households, using data from private sector market research and mobility data from internet companies to assess the impact of COVID-19 and recovery. In Fiji, monitoring of social and economic effects from the onset of the pandemic in 2020, led to the Country Office producing a COVID-19 recovery policy brief to help decision-makers to navigate the uncertainties of the crisis. The brief was developed through a \u2018sense-making methodology\u2019 to understand the evolving COVID-19 socio-economic impact, including through the collection of personal stories from those most affected by the pandemic. Future scenarios were then developed through a \u2018foresight approach\u2019 which led to a set of proposed policies in governance, and social and economic sectors. Several Country Offices have advocated for long-term investments in strengthening social protection systems as a policy lever for poverty reduction and inclusive growth. The Cambodia Country Office, with the Ministry of Economy and Finance, conducted a COVID-19 Economic and Social Impact Assessment in Cambodia based on modelling and simulation that also examined the impact of social protection on growth and poverty reduction. The brief informed high-level dialogues with national and UN partners. It also led to the Government launching in 2020 a new COVID-related social assistance programme and MSMEs stimulus packages, equivalent to 3.4 per cent of GDP. Accordingly, 674,146 poor households received US $300 million in cash transfers. A national allocation of around US $200 million benefitted 682,328 households in 2021.

UNDP assessments of the impact of the pandemic on tourism in Sri Lanka informed a recovery road map that is the basis for transforming the sector. A rapid assessment jointly undertaken by UNDP and the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority found that 67 per cent of those who lost their jobs due to the pandemic were female workers. As a result of these findings, UNDP, and the Tourism Authority, with financial assistance from Citi, have developed a project that is both a social protection and a recovery initiative. It has provided direct financial support to more than 685 women, business development services to more than 670 women to enhance their skills for livelihood development and assisted with registering 75 new businesses and provided PPE items that enabled 322 business ventures to reopen. As part of its wider support to the recovery of the tourism sector, UNDP is providing technical expertise for the national tourism policy, including rolling out the national sustainable certification scheme for tourism with funding support from the EU and BIOFIN.

The economic and social disruption of COVID-19 in Asia and the Pacific has been devastating. In addition to loss of life, millions have lost their livelihoods, many industries have gone into debt, small and larger businesses have gone bankrupt, and the education of millions has been interrupted for extended periods. The worst hit are the most vulnerable \u2013 the poor, women, workers in the informal sector, the elderly. There has been a marked regression of development gains of the past decades, and the growth momentum of the region has been stalled. However, the RBAP assessments of the impact of COVID-19 in Asia reveal another trend. Many Asian nations have mounted multi-dimensional responses to the pandemic which have mitigated its most damaging impacts, particularly COVID-19 response and socio-economic recovery The COVID-19 pandemic is the defining global health crisis of our time. It amplified what it is to live in poverty, as it did to live with opportunity. For UNDP, the pandemic has meant adapting to new demands and realigning programmes to meet the changing needs of countries in Asia and the Pacific. 2 Theme [ 26 ] [ 27 ] in the health and economic arenas. UNDP has been involved with some of the successful responses, including effective surveillance and disease control, use of innovative IT technologies to track and map the spread of the virus, and income support schemes. Another heartening development has been the robust regional cooperation to address the pandemic. Not surprisingly, the wide variance in the impact and effectiveness of the national response to COVID-19 reflects the diversity within the region with respect to institutional capacities, fiscal strength, and demographic size. UNDP has recognized that a one-size-fits-all approach does not work in Asia and the Pacific, and a customized and tailored COVID-19 response is required in each country. How has RBAP responded in 2020-2021 to meet the challenge of COVID-19? The pandemic brought shifts to UNDP which needed to swiftly adapt to new demands and reprogramme initiatives to meet the changing needs of the countries which it serves. While quickly tapping and bringing on board health expertise directly related to the spread and control of the disease, RBAP proactively repurposed existing substantive and budgetary resources at regional and country levels. To meet the unprecedented challenges, UNDP conducted multi-dimensional assessments of the impact of COVID-19, put in place institutional and fiscal capacities, and fostered national response and mitigation strategies. Specific areas of support to combat COVID-19 included health procurement; introduction and scale-up of digital vaccine management systems; improving access to PPE, vaccination, and health care services; ramping up tele- medicine; strengthening and scaling up social protection schemes and livelihoods support; and broad information campaigns to create awareness and influence safer behaviour. The intersection of these efforts and the need for a rapid response has led to the development of integrated COVID-19 response programmes that favour multi-sectoral national campaigns. RBAP has facilitated cross fertilization of experience throughout the region so that successes and lessons learned from \u2018first movers\u2019 could be shared with others. Leveraging longstanding partnerships, RBAP mobilized US $155 million for the immediate pandemic response, and quickly moved resources to where they were needed most in three priority areas: the procurement and supply of essential health products and vaccine distribution, strengthening crisis management and response, and addressing critical social and economic impacts. Asia\u2019s experience with COVID-19 has also revealed another silver lining. Many of the approaches introduced during the pandemic will remain as the new normal when this period becomes a distant memory. For example, digital solutions in managing health products, remote work and education arrangements, rapid-response mechanisms for strengthening social safety nets and livelihoods, management of vaccine delivery systems, and safe behavior communications will all be components of \u2018build back better\u2019 plans that can yield future benefits. Immediate Health Sector Support More than 12,000 new health facilities were established, and 250,000 health care workers were hired or trained with UNDP support for COVID-19 response in the region. Through its support to global procurement for early COVID-19 response, UNDP contributed to the world\u2019s collective efforts to combat the virus. UNDP helped countries to procure critical supplies from China, during the early days of the pandemic when supplies in most other global markets were running low and were subject to export restrictions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b6ae23a-bad7-432f-9430-308cd676366b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b6ae23a-bad7-432f-9430-308cd676366b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42406aef2deb90a59cb76f2f139f131f310e102bcbacdf001ea251e6d2942ba6"}, "2": {"node_id": "b635c008-95c5-4af5-92c1-9278c7279f9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "72bc7832c1842c1bc96d8ac1d677f9f3528389f62b563c7877f640a03c9e71c9"}}, "hash": "331ca84784c922cd5e5f1e1d71bf923d1be3ff4c7fd56bccc741da288f437151", "text": "In total, procurement support from UNDP China covered 47 different types of COVID-19 medical supplies for 72 countries.

The urgently needed equipment enhanced the capacity and preparedness of Cambodia\u2019s COVID-19 designated hospitals and testing facilities to respond and support the reopening of the country in late 2021. In Timor-Leste, UNDP worked closely with the Government through a cost-shared US$ 11 million programme to support emergency procurement and quality assurance of health products during the critical period of 2020. With UNDP assistance the Government was able to procure over 7.3 million units of medicines, 4.5 million test kits and reagents, 802 units of equipment and accessories, and other health supplies.

Building on health infrastructure created through the Global Fund, UNDP could immediately contribute to the COVID-19 response in Iran. UNDP joined forces with the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, the Social Welfare Organization, and the Prisons Organization to support government-led responses in harm reduction centers, specifically in mobile centers that offered infection prevention and control services to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among high-risk populations. UNDP supported the provision of 30 PCR machines to increase COVID-19 diagnostic and testing capacity. More than 2,500 health centers, 11,000 health workers and nearly 500,000 at-risk-individuals and patients directly benefited from targeted distribution of essential health supplies. In the Pacific region, the UNDP Multi-Country Western Pacific Programme (MCWP) funded through the Global Fund was positioned to provide immediate procurement of urgent medical supplies and equipment that included 85,500 PPE kits to 11 countries for 350 health care workers in public health departments, along with screening of TB, HIV and STI prevention and testing. In addition, the UNDP MCWP supported public health information campaigns in Samoa, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Palau. Niue and Samoa upgraded laboratory testing facilities. The Ministries of Health in Marshall Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and FSM enhanced their infection prevention and control in hospitals and other health facilities. Also, with financial support from the Global Fund, UNDP in Afghanistan assisted the Ministry of Public Health to strengthen laboratory capacity and establish a surveillance system by expanding prevention diagnosis and management services at the Central Public Health Laboratory facilities and reference labs in five regions. UNDP provided technical assistance to train 25 regional and provincial laboratory staff in the use of new equipment. UNDP also supported the establishment of 15 health centers, 11 mobile health teams and two home-based care outreach teams in eight provinces. In partnership with the Ministry of Interior Affairs, UNDP in Afghanistan provided technical and financial support to 300-bed hospital facilities and ICUs across five provinces to ensure they can quarantine, isolate, and treat affected Afghan National Police (ANP) personnel.

As part of strengthening capacities of national institutions in tackling the health crisis, UNDP also established an oxygen plant at the Sittwe Hospital in Rakhine. Partnering with the Korean International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) and the Lao Women\u2019s Union, UNDP Lao PDR provided essential health equipment to support more than 1,200 women in temporary quarantine centres. Medical supplies went to the national hospital for women and children, serving more than 2,000 patients. Community outreach initiatives in Bokeo Province, one of the regions hardest hit by COVID-19, informed women about their rights and how to access services if they experienced domestic violence during the pandemic. The community outreach model will be adopted in three more provinces. In Maldives, UNDP procurement of PPE for frontline health workers opened new opportunities in the health sector for UNDP to work with the Ministry of Health. In 2021, UNDP was able to secure funding for additional national emergency medical supplies. In addition, through the regional project on Digital Solutions for the Deployment of COVID-19 Vaccines, UNDP is conducting a digital readiness assessment. It is also providing technical support to strengthen the legal framework for data governance in the health sector through the Health Information Bill, which will cover data privacy, security, data use and data collection. Digital Vaccine Management Closing the digital divide and harnessing the power of digital technologies for COVID-19 vaccination is essential for driving faster and fairer vaccination access. As part of national deployment and vaccination plans, UNDP is working with governments, UN, and other partners to introduce digital solutions to strengthen health systems and ensure equitable, safe, and efficient vaccine distribution. By leveraging the experience of both India and Indonesia, UNDP supported digitalization of COVID-19 vaccine tracking in Bhutan, Bangladesh, Iran, Nepal, Philippines, and Afghanistan. South-South cooperation, facilitated Photo: UNDP India. CoWIN (Winning Over COVID-19) programme [ 30 ] [ 31 ] by UNDP, has been crucial to the success in digital vaccine tracking and deployment among these countries. In India, the mobile cloud-based eVIN system (Electronic Vaccine Intelligence Network) was adapted to manage COVID-19 vaccine logistics and ensure uninterrupted tracking of COVID-19 vaccines and other routine vaccines. The eVIN system, developed and implemented with technical support from UNDP, was already in use at all 28,994 vaccine cold chain points across all 733 districts in the country to manage vaccine stocks and storage temperatures for the regular immunization programme of the government. To bolster the herculean task of providing free vaccinations to a population of 1.4 billion people, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Government of India, developed the CoWIN digital platform. The existing eVIN platform with trained users in place to handle large-scale databases, facilitated the adoption of CoWIN (Winning Over COVID-19). CoWIN tracks vaccine recipients, appointment bookings, and facilitates vaccination registration and certificates. With 3.2 billion hits per day, no other Management Information System in India handles a scale equivalent to CoWIN, which by mid 2021 had registered more than 530 million vaccinations for an average of 3.5 million vaccinations a day, and more than 1.4 billion by end of 2021. UNDP provided technical support to the Ministry for developing and managing CoWIN and has assisted with training more than 1.2 million health workers and frontline staff on use of the Co-WIN software. It has set up a call centre which receives 1,500 calls a day that works in tandem with a government vaccination helpline. By partnering with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, UNICEF and WHO, UNDP also helped to expand digital solutions to vaccine management for COVID-19 in Indonesia. The existing digital vaccine logistics management system, Monitoring Imunisasi Logistik secara Elektronik (SMILE), funded by GAVI, uses a mobile app to provide an online dashboard of the entire vaccine supply chain. SMILE enables real- time visibility of vaccine cold chain logistics by digitizing stock supplies and storage temperature across vaccine cold chain points.

The app-based digital system ensures that those eligible for vaccinations are registered, vaccine supplies match demand, adverse effects are monitored and reported, and vaccination coverage information is sent to central health authorities. The IT equipment used for the system has meant that health workers could vaccinate more than 93 percent of eligible adults. More than 2,100 health workers received training on registering and screening patients through the digital system. Social Protection to respond to economic shocks during the pandemic The UNDP position paper on Addressing the COVID-19 economic crisis in Asia through Social Protection, noted that the strongest social protection systems are those that blend innovative approaches with existing ones that have a proven track record.

With UNDP support, more than 25,5000 jobs were protected by economic or other labour market measures in Asia and the Pacific. UNDP in Cambodia supported the government in mounting a quick policy response, including a stimulus package, which catalyzed partnerships with development banks. UNDP and the Ministry of Economy and Finance used economic modelling to predict the size and impact of the pandemic on vulnerable households, which assisted the government in developing stimulus options. Technical support from UNDP, GIZ and UNICEF contributed to the government rapid rollout of social protection cash transfers for every Cambodian below the national poverty line. The assistance reached over 670,000 households, including 98,494 people living with disabilities. Furthermore, nearly 7,800 PLHIV households received ID Poor cards and access to cash transfers in 2021, of which the majority were women-headed households. In addition, as part of the emergency response to COVID-19, UNDP in Cambodia with funding from SIDA, set up a cash-for-work scheme for affected households. It engaged 2,810 people from 1,915 households (27 per cent were headed by women) in tree planting, and injected emergency cash in communities that led to the reforestation of 181.93 hectares in community-managed areas.

The projects, co- funded with the respective municipalities, included building agriculture roads, trails, irrigation canals, and community buildings, using local labour and materials. UNDP fostered inclusive social services amidst the pandemic, with systems that will be useful for the future in Viet Nam. Specifically, it provided experts to design and test the software and processes for e-registration and e-payment of social assistance programmes and identify and verify eligible households. The online tools were tested in five provinces, benefiting more than 11,560 ethnic minority individuals. Approximately 100 ethnic minority cooperatives, led by women, gained access to cash transfers, cash for work, PPE, and other essential support to protect, and sustain their livelihoods. UNDP tapped its existing community outreach networks to implement a holistic COVID-19 response amongst the 30 million slum dwellers in Bangladesh. As part of its National Urban Poverty Reduction Programme, UNDP supported the Government of Bangladesh with a rapid emergency response in low income and slum communities in 19 towns and cities. The response provided food assistance to 77,560 households through digital cash transfers and food baskets. It also included COVID-19 preventative measures like the installation of more than 3,255 handwash points, distribution of 62,425 hygiene kits and 42,265 masks, and other PPE for health workers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fff4885a-689b-4aac-b100-7043a7d51d86": {"__data__": {"id_": "fff4885a-689b-4aac-b100-7043a7d51d86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3ca54ca17f86738b32ce375414888b463c447db4ec02434a1f9dd07926ba876"}, "2": {"node_id": "15602abe-5159-4814-80a9-b45f3d4d9aa8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34d7e97d996e5f15a9a4dae481fc05001d14bab0b6028fcbb0e929e6acdb4655"}}, "hash": "68e8d5c40cac668be78ed901df8b73d86932673fb4c2cfe353c412df33e6247b", "text": "In India, UNDP helped link 177,500 people across ten states to government social protection programmes.

In collaboration with the Ministry of Women and Children\u2019s Affairs, 164 women were trained to produce WHO-approved protective masks which have provided steady household incomes for the participating rural women, benefitting 650 families. In Iran, households received training, financial support, and assistance in linking their local supply chain networks with potential buyers. UNDP helped to re-tool women-headed microenterprises in the garment sector so they could produce PPEs to reduce national shortages. The focus on home-based businesses helped to repurpose jobs in other sectors such as food and extension services. These initiatives contributed to creating more than 5,500 direct and indirect jobs in hard-hit provinces. Under the SEEDS project to kick-start economic recovery, support to agricultural entrepreneurs is helping to increase food production and improve food security in Maldives.

[ 36 ] [ 37 ] 3 Theme Photo: UNDP Bangladesh Digital transformation and innovation Access to digital technologies is an enabler of development and an equalizer of opportunity, while unequal access can deepen vulnerabilities. COVID-19 and the lockdowns triggered new shifts towards digital technologies and highlighted the importance of access to the internet for children\u2019s education, working from home, telemedicine, coverage by social assistance programmes and accessing financial services for everyone. Policies and solutions that tackle the digital divide are therefore essential for inclusive recovery and continued digital transformation that ensure no one is left behind in socioeconomic inclusion. The power of digital technologies has opened new possibilities for accelerating human development, expanding engagement in social and economic life, and transforming the way government interacts with citizens. The emergence of digital technologies has prompted a rethink and a reimagining of the way we do development. UNDP has been a leader in this transformation. The Asia-Pacific region has been a source of innovation and digital and technological development long before the pandemic. New technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, robotics, and the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 have been influencing how societies and states connect. UNDP has been working with countries to build the foundations to harness the power of this Fourth Industrial Revolution. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Our work on digitalization and innovation in the region covers two broad areas: building government capacities to harness digital technologies for development; and empowering individuals to use data, information, and knowledge to enhance their capacity and maximize personal potential. UNDP is working with partner governments as an enabler of digital transformation by helping to develop digital strategies and encourage digital solutions in national institutions. We have been working with national partners to access new technologies and identify financing mechanisms for building physical digital infrastructure. We have provided support and advice to develop digital systems and interfaces in a range of sectors. Specifically, UNDP has fostered digital transformation in areas such as finance, business, government, health care, and the provision of easier public access to essential services. Improved accountability, transparency and reduction of corruption are crucial by-products of this effort. At the individual level, digitalization is empowering citizens through provision of information and knowledge and enabling them to be more active participants in civil society.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f48b672-a131-46b5-b4c5-16164fb56c15": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f48b672-a131-46b5-b4c5-16164fb56c15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6442bcfcb031955ddf58166d58132e7d507430c7f1056fc50f671007aed67de"}, "2": {"node_id": "ff94cf35-fe3a-409f-ac9e-93690aa93a2b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ab69c3705d28332dfb5208be4b53f2d60b7d85b47e8d8952376bd1c3b92ce87"}}, "hash": "5dfb4b84353ae2eaa9fef1ed7323f185843f200a5ebe06c40a3ce8b5c475af8e", "text": "UNDP in Asia and the Pacific is focusing on two important digitalization areas: ease of access to basic social services, in particular health and education; and bridging the digital divide for small and medium businesses through skills development and establishment of e-commerce and e-payment systems.

DIGITAL SUPPORT PARTNER GOVERNMENTS INDIVIDUAL LEVEL Digital transformation in government A significant area of work in the region has helped governments and institutions to continue functioning during the pandemic, while also planning broader and longer-term digital transformation strategies. With UNDP support, governments, and institutions in 18 countries benefited from new technological equipment and capacity building to maintain their operations while working towards closing digital gaps. In Lao PDR, UNDP is a strategic partner in the Digital Government Transformation project which pilots new government service delivery approaches. At the outset of the pandemic, UNDP provided capacity building to more than 3,000 government officials on digital literacy and the use of mobile applications. UNDP worked with the Department of International Cooperation (DIC) at the Ministry of Planning and Investment to assess their systems and re-engineer workflows. Installation of video conferencing equipment in all provinces and e-office suites in 14 priority provinces enabled the DIC to hold remote meetings. Equipment and capacity development at the E-Government Center at the Ministry of Technology and Communications similarly bolstered government functions. As smart phone use increases in the country, UNDP is helping to develop and test new mobile applications for the country\u2019s One Door Service Centers for people who apply online for government services. To advance the rule of law and widen access to justice in Lao PDR, UNDP launched the Digital Legal Aid Platform with the Ministry of Justice. The platform provides basic legal information and an interactive chat function for people to receive legal consultancy online. It provides targeted support to vulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities and women at risk of gender-based violence in rural communities who experience barriers to accessing legal advice. In Sri Lanka, UNDP supported the finalization of the Digital Economy Strategy which included incorporating scalable initiatives from UNDP and other partners, as well as sharing regional and global best practices on social innovation within this sector. The Country Office also facilitated a Digital Maturity Assessment that gauges public sector readiness for digital transformation, providing useful insights for the development of a Digital Government Strategy.

In parallel, UNDP and the Information and Communication Technology Agency assessed the needs and skills of the Chief Innovation Officer network for its readiness to carry out a digital government strategy. UNDP also helped to develop digital solutions for the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority. In addition, it offered technical assistance to the Department of Motor Traffic to re-engineer business processes for issuing driving licenses and transitioning to a smart office. A UNDP-supported assessment of the digital capacities in Solomon Islands was carried out to identify excluded and digitally marginalized areas in the country\u2019s nearly 1,000 islands. UNDP collaboration with the government led to the establishment of the Digital Transformation Authority in 2021 and a commitment to the first National Digital Strategy. UNDP partnered with the Office of the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening, the Ministry of Communication and Aviation, and the Government Information Communication Technologies Services to begin the digitalization of state authorities. New technology improved facilities in all nine provincial government headquarters, as did the procurement and installation of four microwave antennas to establish and upgrade internet connections in targeted remote areas. Laptops, LED monitors and related equipment, including video conferencing capabilities, and generators were complemented with more than 120 Zoom licenses.

Approximately 40 professors from the Central Institute for Civil Service received training- of-trainers distance learning for Senior and Executive Leadership Development, who in turn trained 268 civil servants. UNDP supported the Hluttaw Learning Centre to establish its Online Learning Centre, which was used to deliver professional development support to Members of Parliament and courses for other staff. UNDP also provided training and ICT equipment for the Human Rights Commission and the Anti- Corruption Commission to facilitate remote working during the pandemic. IT equipment, projectors and laptops strengthened the communication and planning capabilities of the Ministries of Health in Palau and Samoa. Fiji\u2019s National Disaster Management Office was also supplied with laptops that bolstered its coordination of remote emergency operations. Siren systems and HF/ VHF radios meant that all of Palau\u2019s remote island communities could be reached. In Samoa, e-governance platforms were enhanced and open-source e-learning management systems were established at seven educational institutions in response to the disruptions from the pandemic. Teachers and students benefited from capacity building for their digital skills. These initiatives are developing the necessary capabilities for several countries in the Pacific to make a successful digital transition. UNDP in the Philippines provided 43 Zoom teleconferencing licenses to the government in Bangsamoro to continue operations and reach its partners amidst COVID-19. Among the recipients are the Office of the Chief Minister, all 15 ministries and select Local Government Units. With community quarantine in the provinces, the government in Bangsamoro capitalized on virtual meetings and teleconferencing technology to reach its constituencies and partners. UNDP also created the EMPOWER PH platform to improve digital access to the PPE supply chain, consolidate PPE-related resources approved by the Department of Health through a centralized information hub, and facilitate the vetting of non- medical use PPE for consumer protection. The EMPOWER PH platform has been handed over to the Department of Trade and Industry, with UNDP continuing to provide technical support services for its expansion to include RT-PCR test services.

For example, UNDP partnered with the healthcare firm, Sehat Kahani, in Pakistan, to design and roll out a telemedicine ICU pilot platform. At the same time, it supported the Ministry of Health with policy and legislative changes that will institutionalize tele-medicine in the country. While the healthcare firm had 27 existing e-clinics across Pakistan, their platform was modified to meet the expanding needs of public and private hospitals, clinics, and critical care experts. To date, the e-clinics reach more than 1.5 million people. Nearly 4,500 medical professionals and junior doctors in 60 underequipped or understaffed intensive care units are now linked with critical care specialists and can receive on-the-spot guidance on patient care via the platform. UNDP continues to engage with the digital health team in the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Information Technology, and the National Database and Registration Authority to enhance policies on telehealth. UNDP is providing technical assistance to the country\u2019s Digital Health Strategy and is coordinating with USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA and WHO to mobilize resources with private telecom partners. Knowledge exchange on the digital health agenda is also expanding through the UNDP Singapore Global Center. UNDP supported the development of robotics in healthcare in Viet Nam with the provision of 19 service robots for 10 health facilities in six provinces. The robots helped to protect frontline doctors and nurses from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases by performing nonclinical tasks like remote communication, diagnoses and treatment, and delivery of medicine to isolated patients.

The Ministry of Health in Bhutan, in partnership with UNDP, JICA and the Government of Japan, launched a programme to scale up eHealth solutions in one of the country\u2019s most important priorities \u2013 meeting Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health, especially for maternal and childcare. Forty-six new mobile cardiotocography devices, or iCTG, are being used to remotely monitor fetal heart rates and uterine contractions of pregnant women to detect high-risk pregnancies and ensure timely care. With only 14 gynecologists in the country, access to their care and obstetric services remains a challenge, especially for pregnant women in remote areas. The technology helps reduce exposure to infections including COVID-19 and allows continuity of maternal health services. The new iCTGs will benefit more than half of the 10,000 pregnancies reported each year in Bhutan. In Bangladesh, UNDP partnered with an online team of counselors at Moner Bondhu to facilitate psycho-social counselling during the pandemic. This initiative focuses on women and adolescents to destigmatize mental health and sensitize people to psychosocial counselling. This partnership fostered primary mental health care for 14,130 people through a helpline and conducted 1,171 remote psychosocial counseling sessions. UNDP piloted a 40-hour training course on mental health in which 100,000 participants enrolled. The nearly 15,540 people who completed the course reported that they found Photo: UNDP Viet Nam.

A rural development organization, Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation, made the course mandatory for its staff. In addition, a UNDP- supported mobile app provides information and self-assessment tools on common mental health problems like stress, sleep problems, depression, and domestic violence. Caritas Bangladesh and OKUP, a community-based migrants\u2019 rights organization, has used the app with 1,000 return migrant workers and their families. Action in Disability and Development, and the Innovation for Wellbeing Foundation and Disability Children\u2019s Foundation have also used the app to raise mental health awareness among 9,000 people with psychosocial needs. Similarly in Fiji, Empower Pacific, which is a community-based provider of counselling, social services, and training, opened counselling helplines to respond to stress and anxieties caused by the pandemic. Their expert counsellors responded to calls across Fiji, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Callers received counselling support and were linked to social service providers. In 2021, the helpline responded to 4,550 calls, 69 per cent of them female. Making data work for people Using new and traditional forms of data to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals is one of UNDP\u2019s core capabilities. Real-time data and evidence to inform decisions are essential during crises. As countries faced widening data gaps and information scarcity for an effective response to the pandemic, UNDP supported 23 different data collection systems in nine countries to enhance the integration and analysis of data and facilitate decision-making. For a more comprehensive picture of the economic impact of the pandemic, the Accelerator Lab in Cambodia developed a nowcasting dashboard, called www.dataforcambodia.org, that shows the short-term past and future forecasting of socio-economic data. The dashboard combines traditional phone-based surveys and mobility data to provide up-to-date insights on the impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs and informal workers to show socio-economic trends since the onset of the pandemic. In addition to the data dashboard, the Country Office is leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to combine big data with traditional data to create models that generate poverty and vulnerability data across the country. Using AI for poverty mapping ensures the provision of timely and transparent data for decision-making during crises.

Given the large number of migrants returning from India to the province, the application has an \u2018Immigrant Assistant\u2019 feature that reports migrants who return, which helps local authorities with quarantine management. Data received is monitored daily from the SmartPalika Call Center, which assists local government to manage their COVID-19 response amidst the influx of migrants. With funding from Japan, UNDP in Mongolia offered technical assistance for the creation of a digital case management system for social workers to better assist marginalized people and those with disabilities whose lives were disrupted by COVID-19.

This virtual assistance system also enhances the collection and updating of social services data which will inform the government as it develops policies on social welfare and protection services. Making innovation integral to development solutions Innovation at UNDP supports transformation of systems and structures rather than a single solution to development challenges. The 18 Accelerator Labs in the region serve as a platform for innovation, and for decision-makers and development partners to explore and experiment with new approaches to address their most pressing development concerns. Systems transformation UNDP works with countries to develop new and transformational solutions to the complex challenges they face. In Bhutan, UNDP is helping to tackle youth unemployment through technology and infrastructure solutions which are now being prototyped and tested with government and other partners. Thailand\u2019s tourism industry was hit hard by COVID-19. UNDP has been working with the Thai Government to reimagine tourism that is more sustainable and environmentally friendly, while also fostering economic growth. This systems transformation approach involves participation across sectors and society to find solutions together. Exploration, experimentation, mapping, and scaling solutions UNDP has provided support to test new development approaches that involve experimentation, mapping, and scaling solutions in 18 countries. UNDP\u2019s Accelerator Lab activities include mapping small grassroot innovations, as well as large-scale public sector innovations. Processes involve sensemaking, systems thinking, collective intelligence, data analytics, the use of emerging technologies and Artificial Intelligence, and predictive analysis to add value to UNDP programming and deliver next generation development solutions. For example, in Malaysia the Accelerator Lab has run an urban biodiversity challenge, using citizen science, ethnography, and in-depth interviews to develop locally driven insights on green and blue spaces to bring nature to urban centres. They are also building a network of partners for the Youth Environment Living Labs, which is a joint project with UNICEF to equip and mobilize youth for local action on the environment and the SDGs. In Nepal, the Accelerator Labs are working in a range of areas including unplanned urbanization, unemployment, and promoting a circular economy through ethnographic research and GIS mapping of urban municipalities to track plastic waste. In Samoa, the Accelerator Lab has entered a partnership with the Samoa Bureau of Statistics to test a digital solution that helps increase the timeliness and coverage of birth registration, especially in rural villages where there are significant information gaps on home births. This is a critical gateway activity supporting the Government\u2019s move towards introduction of a national digital ID.

However, the emergence of two factors in 2020-2021 had a critical impact on our governance support in the region. The first was a once-in-a-generation pandemic, COVID-19, a development emergency that halted social and economic activity and forced UNDP to devise new kinds of responses. The second was the gradual, but noticeable, expansion of authoritarian impulses and the contraction of space in civil society for peaceful and free discourse. Some countries manifested these changes through policies that bypassed or limited the scope of legislatures, the judiciary, or civil society. Press freedoms were curtailed. The year 2021 saw the ascension of regressive regimes, in Myanmar and Afghanistan, both countries now in deep crisis. UNDP has been assessing the impacts of these changes on human development in these and other countries.

[ 50 ] [ 51 ] Photo: UNDP Bhutan. Supreme Court Justice Tashi Chozom and UNDP Resident Representative Ms. Azusa Kubota at the launch of eLitigation at the Supreme Court of Justice The COVID-19 pandemic in Asia and the Pacific was a health and socio-economic crisis, but also a human rights and governance one. Governance is more important than ever when governments are under pressure to navigate crisis and uncertainty. RBAP provided crucial support to buttress inadequate health and social service delivery systems, helped in vaccine and PPE procurement, supported digital vaccine management campaigns, and advised governments on how to quickly scale up weak social safety nets. Our experience with COVID-19 has yielded lessons that will help governments \u2018build back better\u2019 and in some ways change forever the ways national institutions respond to crisis and interface with the public. For example, digital solutions in administering policies and managing health products, remote work and educational arrangements, rapid response mechanisms for strengthening social safety nets and livelihoods under crisis, management of vaccine delivery systems, safe behavior communications will all be components of national policies that could yield benefits in the future. New digital governance mechanisms, pioneered by RBAP in 2020-2021 are here to stay and will be developed further. Such advances include digital governance in parliaments and the judiciary, citizen inclusion and outreach through electronic means, and anticipatory governance. UNDP in Asia and the Pacific continued to work in 2020-2021 to expand the freedom of citizens and civil society for free expression and participation in the discourse on the decisions and policies that impact their lives and secure the universal rights due to them. Advocacy on tolerance for diversity, on gender bias, gender-based violence and responsiveness, on the importance of a free and independent press, on \u2018right to know\u2019 laws and mechanisms, on the importance of setting up public grievance mechanisms, and a myriad of other topics continued apace. Our programmes, in partnership with programme country governments, have been active in promoting and setting up multi-stakeholder platforms and events that include civil society and the private sector to generate consensus and build coalitions for change. An important example of this is the launch in almost every country, of the global and national Human Development Reports. Young people, typically between 15 and 25 years of age, will have an influence on society and the economy in the 21st century. UNDP is consciously seeking to bring youth into the development discourse and help them realise their potential to shape the future. At the regional level, the UNDP- supported Youth Entrepreneurs network has demonstrated agility and resilience in the face of COVID-19 and contributed to the response to the pandemic to build forward better. The Karma Dialogues, launched by RBAP, helped connect youth in the region through video conversations with inspirational leaders and trailblazers of their generation. An important inter-agency partnership on youth has been established with UNICEF that already shows early results. UNDP has built capacities and provided support to strengthening parliaments in their legislative and oversight functions, as well as in increasing female representation in legislatures. Similarly, UNDP has become a partner of choice for support to the rule of law and the judiciary, and in ensuring legal access to the poor and marginalized. The digitalization of legislatures and judicial institutions to permit remote work showed significant expansion during 2020-2021, in response to COVID-19. Online e-Litigation platforms were set up in several countries in 2021, allowing electronic registration of cases, electronic filing of documents, electronic payments, and remote hearings in courts. This has improved access, greatly reduced time and cost of dispensing justice and allowed uninterrupted service of courts during the pandemic. Gender concerns and gender specific objectives have been mainstreamed throughout programmes in Asia and the Pacific. This starts from the collection of gender disaggregated data and the commissioning of gender assessments as the basis for the design of programmes.

Advocacy, civic education and capacity building of law enforcement, judiciary, parliaments, and women\u2019s groups to prevent gender-based violence have been a critical part of our work. As for other marginalised groups, we have used the power of innovation and our convening role to establish platforms where important gender issues can be discussed. In 2020-2021, work was scaled up on frontier governance issues that have not received much attention or have proven intractable due to their complex and multi-dimensional nature. These challenges have been taken in hand by newly established innovation and digital capabilities across the region, specifically 18 Accelerator Labs and a Regional Innovation and Digital Team which is supported by global teams. These experts have facilitated the adoption of nearly 140 digital and innovative solutions across 18 countries in Asia. In the area of local governance, UNDP experimented with Social Innovation Platforms (SIPs) to dialogue and encourage new forms of collaboration among citizens, governments, and the private sector. RBAP also launched a programme to assess and formulate national policies on the human rights implications of private business. Overall, in 2020 and 2021, the region carried out 340 governance projects in 23 countries, with an RESULTS PAVE THE WAY TO FUTURE-READY GOVERNANCE ANTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE DIGITAL SOLUTIONS IN ADMINISTERING POLICIES AND SERVICE PROVISION; DIGITALIZATION IN LEGISLATURES AND JUDICIAL INSTITUTIONS; CITIZEN INCLUSION AND OUTREACH; [ 52 ] [ 53 ] estimated implementation budget of US $230 million.1 Continuous lockdowns from COVID-19 meant that most of the initiatives took place online. Expanding freedoms in a gradually shrinking space The space for freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and civil society in general is gradually shrinking around the world. Asia and the Pacific is no exception to this trend. To address the decline in civic space, UNDP supports governments in the promotion of tolerance for diversity, an important counterforce to hate- speech, disinformation, and polarization. These trends are among the main threats to democratic space and social cohesion today. In line with this focus, grants and technical support from the project, Partnerships for a Tolerant, Inclusive Bangladesh, assist CSOs in Bangladesh to advocate for tolerance and diversity. One of the partners, Genlab, managed a \u2018peace caravan\u2019 campaign that carried peace messages on public buses. In addition, the project 1 Excluding Afghanistan supports advocacy for digital literacy and digital citizenship to challenge online hate speech and disinformation. The ICT Ministry furthers this work, which is closely aligned with the cyber- crime unit of the police. The aim is to encourage a shift from the policing of digital space to an approach based on prevention through digital literacy and citizenship. Similarly, to reinforce the significant role young people can play in building a united and peaceful nation, UNDP is helping to make parliaments more open and inclusive to youth. The development of youth councils is one approach for engaging young people in civic life and building their understanding of democratic principles. In Fiji and Solomon Islands, UNDP is working with youth councils and youth parliaments to empower young people, build trust and strengthen their participation in anti- corruption efforts. In Timor-Leste, UNDP is assisting youth to develop data analysis and management abilities to enhance their decision- making skills and inclusion in local policymaking. In Thailand, the National Children and Youth Council and local governments are working on Photo: UNDP Bangladesh. Peace caravan. ways to localize the SDGs. With members of the Thai Parliament, a series of dialogues have been organized with LGBTI youth, stateless young people, and those with disabilities. To further civic engagement, UNDP advocates for parliaments to systematically reach out to youth for their ideas in parliamentary agendas and policy alternatives. At the end of 2020, UNDP began to facilitate simultaneous online youth conversations on open-source platforms in Bhutan, Pakistan, and Timor-Leste.

Parliaments meet virtually The role of Parliament in a time of crisis is vital to pass and review emergency laws, allocate and analyze the use of public resources as well as oversee government actions. UNDP worked with 17 governments in the region to deploy technologies, such as video conferencing services and hardware supplies as they moved their critical operations online. As Pacific countries placed safety measures and closed their borders due to the pandemic, state institutions faced the challenge of continuing essential services while respecting social distancing. At the same time, the work of parliaments increased, given their legislative and oversight mandates requiring them to approve government budgets, address the emergency and provide scrutiny of the government response to the pandemic. UNDP deployed hardware and software solutions while also helping parliaments to devise and implement business continuity plans. Such support furthered parliamentary work in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands, and the Solomons Islands. As a result, the FSM Congress became the first Pacific parliament to convene virtual sessions and approve a stimulus package of US $2 million. The Fiji Parliament used UNDP\u2019s support to organize hybrid sessions, which enabled it to approve the annual budget and pass legislation for upcoming elections in 2022.

UNDP also assisted with the digitalization of the national Parliament in Timor-Leste through the provision of 15 Zoom licenses which made it possible for parliamentarians to take part in virtual meetings, discuss and pass new bills and approve plans proposed by the government. Additionally, UNDP supported the production of 20 episodes of civic education television, using MPs and staff as protagonists of these shows, which made them more relatable to the public. Justice served online UNDP responded to the needs of national and local justice systems to continue functioning against a backdrop of lockdowns and social distancing. Online platforms meant justice could be met. Virtual courts with remote court hearings were set up in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka, greatly reducing travel time and costs while picking up the pace of judicial processes. For example, UNDP accelerated virtual courts that allowed a continuation of court hearings, even during the COVID-19 crisis in Bangladesh.

[ 56 ] [ 57 ] Similarly, UNDP and the Judiciary in Bhutan launched an eLitigation platform in 2021 that allows electronic registration of cases, electronic filing of documents, electronic payments, and remote hearings in courts. The eLitigation platform, an innovative and transformational initiative aimed at mitigating disruption in administering justice, is being piloted in seven courts in the country including the Supreme Court. Court officials are receiving training in the use of the digital platform and the case management system to record the virtual hearings. Given Bhutan\u2019s sparsely distributed population and harsh geographic terrain, this project has the potential to reduce lengthy travel and related costs for litigants and provide them with judicial services during and after COVID-19 travel restrictions. Through digitalization of the justice sector that allowed uninterrupted service in Maldives, UNDP enabled 11,000 online court hearings in just four months in 2020, a jump from the 14,451 hearings in the entire previous year. The digitalization effort has meant that all courts are now virtually connected with video conferencing and network connections to ensure quick and easy access to justice for everyone, especially those in remote islands. This digital transformation of the justice sector was the result of UNDP collaboration with the Department of Judicial Administration, the Judicial Services Commission, Attorney General\u2019s Office, Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, Supreme Court of Maldives, High Court, District and Magistrate Courts of Maldives, and the Australian Government. With technical assistance from UNDP in Sri Lanka, the Judicial Service Commission, the Ministry of Justice, the Legal Aid Commission, and the Prisons Department have piloted digital technology for remote hearings, including more than 10,000 bail hearings in 23 courts. Initiated with UNDP in 2020, the pilot hearings resulted in the Cabinet of Ministers granting approval to expand to other courts and prisons to eliminate delays. Technical support to the Legal Aid Commission and the Prisons Department has already enabled remote legal counselling for more than 85 prisoners.

Since its launch in October 2021, UNDP has provided 44,335 paid workdays for 4,560 men and women from vulnerable households in Mazar, Kunduz and Herat through cash-for-work. Simultaneously, UNDP led in the establishment of the Special Trust Fund for Afghanistan (STFA) as an interagency vehicle to foster and fund joint programmes in support of ABADEI, with 13 agencies having joined the Fund to date. UNDP experiments with new ways to help strengthen local governance and find solutions to local development challenges. In Thailand, Pakistan and Indonesia, UNDP has used Social Innovation Platforms (SIPs) to support new forms of collaboration among citizens, governments, and the private sector. Created with the support of ALC, an innovation lab based in Spain, the SIP platforms highlight the power of social innovation and digital tools to enhance inclusive participation, build trust and forge new paths for collaboration and investment between public and private sectors. For instance, in Thailand, a \u2018deep listening\u2019 exercise at the start of the SIP, highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on local populations and the importance of the food sector for recovery from the pandemic. Responding to these needs, UNDP now supports provincial and local governments, farmers, entrepreneurs, fisherman, local artists, and event organizers to co-design a portfolio of solutions that promotes local food products across Thailand.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0251ffc-fb67-4a98-9399-7fb78e471b13": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0251ffc-fb67-4a98-9399-7fb78e471b13", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "043b10b6fd9414b4a70086b28840cb4425e733f82fcd371db442600852aa07e8"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a77c60d-c4e6-4d61-842b-2cfe4c74f458", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5709355fadc723df6e5d4e84aefc31218cea1f08d52d1bdc580c291b29fa955f"}}, "hash": "a821468047bbc3d94f382866f848118c729ec3e7e482b1e6b25f11bb6bdd70f8", "text": "This food system portfolio is helping UNDP strengthen collaboration with other UN agencies, development partners and government agencies.

UNDP experts based in the Bangkok Regional Hub now support dedicated Business and Human Rights initiatives in nine countries. The intensified interest in this arena is reflected in the increase in participation in the flagship Regional Forum on Business and Human Rights for Asia Pacific, which grew from 120 people five years ago to more than 7,000 in 2021. The Regional Forum fostered policy work at country level, including support through UNDP technical assistance resulting in development and official launch of the National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights by the Government of Pakistan. Similar Action Plans are being finalized with UNDP regional and national support in India, Mongolia, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The UNDP regional programme on Business and Human Rights designed a simple and accessible toolkit, Human Rights Due Diligence and COVID-19: Rapid Self-Assessment for Business, to help businesses consider and manage the human rights impacts of their operations. Companies across the region downloaded the toolkit more than 10,000 times. The regional programme on Promoting a Fair Business Environment in ASEAN has boosted transparency in infrastructure procurement in Thailand through a pilot project that discloses data on public procurement contracts to civil society organisations. Known as CoST, the Infrastructure Transparency Initiative has helped the Thai Government reduce its procurement costs by approximately 20 percent. As a result, the Thai Government amended its procurement law to mandate additional data disclosures for all major infrastructure procurement. [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Photo: UNDP Thailand. Pride Month. UNDP and partners step up to address gender-based violence Gender-based violence (GBV) intensified during the pandemic. UNDP and its partners provided support to 10 countries in the region to integrate violence prevention and response into COVID-19 response plans. Advocacy campaigns have raised awareness about this shadow pandemic of violence. UNDP assisted women in seven countries with a breakthrough approach that allows women to report abuse and seek help without alerting perpetrators. UNDP support to six countries has meant that their shelters for victims of violence to protect women and children could stay open. UNDP, the National Police and a prominent university in Indonesia developed a set of Standard Operating Procedures for use by the Youth, Children and Women investigators and the Women and Children Service Unit in handling cases of violence against women and children during the pandemic. The new procedures now include health protocols, such as initial health screening, that protect both officers and victims who are at risk of COVID-19 transmission during the reporting and investigation of domestic violence incidents. Roughly 886 gender-based violence cases were reported in the first half of 2021. The service providers that managed these cases were guided by the new operating procedures. Some of the most effective efforts to address gender-based violence during COVID-19 were carried out as part of the Spotlight Initiative, a global, multi-year partnership between the European Union and the United Nations to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. In Timor-Leste, legal-awareness campaigns informed women of their legal rights and provided free legal consultations. As a result, 310 survivors of gender-based violence received legal assistance. Also, 188 people, mostly from rural areas, were introduced to relevant aspects of the formal justice system and how to respond to gender-based violence. In addition, 152 police officers on the frontline of this critical human rights issue, working at the Vulnerable Persons\u2019 Unit and as Community Police Officers, received training on handling sexual violence and abuse cases. UNDP began providing support in 2021 to community-based organizations that offer shelter, legal and medical assistance to 70 women and children survivors of gender-based violence. Legal outreach campaigns on formal justice system and women\u2019s legal empowerment reached 326 community members, including religious leaders, police officers, veterans, and LGBTI persons. As a result, 36 civil cases were registered, and 14 cases were mediated. In a country with limited access to courts, these legal aid and mediation services to remote areas fulfill a critical gap in access to justice. Furthermore, in partnership with UN-EU Spotlight programme and KOICA-funded Together for Equality initiative, have been able to bring about synergies and scale up legal assistance, counselling and safe spaces to hundreds of GBV survivors while public campaign on GBV prevention", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "246fb812-b3ab-4e2c-a8c2-d0f15bc83b3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "246fb812-b3ab-4e2c-a8c2-d0f15bc83b3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "UNDP Asia Pacific Annual Report 2020-21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b4904251d04a7b1812bba92e37614d8b1ca84f92d97d76a8f8c7c53bc51a8f70"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec0e9458-7cc0-49b0-8632-6b25fe87575c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/undp-asia-pacific-annual-report-2020-21", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "22a7b2f92d04a3549b73e75e9f5028b5991e59d6203fb6dbd2744e0875e25a05"}}, "hash": "5cf6ab6d25bdd48beea34f9131840a03d654e2050fce1d6e1da8228927ef7661", "text": "reached out to over 50 thousands individuals. Working jointly with Australian police development programme and Korean National Police, UNDP helped to build investigative capacities of the police for sexual assault and abuse cases and to share best practices of survivor-centered response to GBV, benefiting health workers, police officers and civil servants. In Samoa, UNDP and the joint EU and UN Spotlight initiative assisted in the development of Samoa\u2019s new Law and Justice Sector Plan in English and Samoan, which recognizes gender-based and domestic violence and the need to improve access to justice services for all vulnerable people. UNDP was instrumental in organizing the first high-level coalition of parliamentarians against gender-based violence in the country, where 46 percent of women in relationships have experienced abuse. At the local level, a Spotlight-supported leadership training for women from 20 villages resulted in social transformation in two villages where women\u2019s committees are now directly part of the village council decision-making process alongside the council chiefs. Building on previous work to establish a Coalition of Parliamentarians to End Gender-based Violence in Papua New Guinea, UNDP further intensified its advocacy to eliminate family, sexual and gender-based violence. Improved law enforcement in GBV, support for family planning and counselling services, and efforts to address the increase in Sorcery Accusation Related Violence are just a few of the targeted initiatives. UNDP established in 2020, the Special Parliamentary Committee on Gender-Based Violence which held its first public hearing in 2021. With UNDP assistance, it delivered a series of recommendations tabled in the national Parliament aimed to eliminate the devastating impacts of violence on Papua New Guinea\u2019s economy and its national development. Such efforts have seen increased government funding to address GBV through the 2022 national budget. Other partners have now pledged support, including the Australian Government. 47 20 300 RESULTS IN SAMOA LEADERSHIP TRAINING IN 2020 SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION IN 2 VILLAGES WHERE WOMEN\u2019S COMMITTEES ARE PART OF VILLAGE COUNCIL DICISION-MAKING WOMEN LEADERS VILLAGES FROM FOR LEADERSHIP TRAINING IN 2021 700 MOBILIZED WOMEN TO FORM LEADERSHIP TEAMS AND ADVOCATE FOR SOLUTIONS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOMEN AND TEENAGERS FOR AGAINST GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE (GBV) [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Eliminating stigma and discrimination towards gender identity To mitigate the impact of the pandemic on racism, xenophobia, stigma, and other forms of discrimination, UNDP provided capacity development to 14 women\u2019s organizations, 38 youth organizations, and 2,686 urban community associations in four countries in the region. Initiatives ranged from preventing and responding to human rights abuses to addressing stigma and discrimination. With increased online violence against women exacerbated by COVID-19 in Pakistan, UNDP conducted extensive research on hypermasculinity and online abuse of women. It analyzed ways in which gender hierarchies, like men\u2019s control of women\u2019s bodies, mobility, and life choices, are transferred from the social to the digital sphere. The study used data mining from Twitter and Facebook, and interviews with parliamentarians to examine topics such as hateful content against women. YouTube productions on honour killings, women\u2019s safety and toxic masculinity were produced, along with an SMS campaign, and digital stories of young men recounting and regretting their previous abusive behaviour towards women. More than 60 percent of surveyed viewers indicated that they agreed with the women\u2019s empowerment messages that the stories reflected. UNDP helped to preserve the pre- pandemic gains that Thailand has made towards gender equality and sexual diversity and continues to promote LGBTI inclusion. UNDP provided grants to the SWING Thailand Foundation, Sisters Foundation, Empower Foundation, and the Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand to procure food and PPE for 3,200 LGBTI sex workers whose livelihoods were affected by the closure of entertainment businesses during the pandemic. UNDP also provided guidance to two private sector companies to adopt a Standard Code of Conduct on diversity and inclusion for LGBTI people in the workplace. Their public commitments have encouraged 15 other companies, largely SMEs, to adopt the Standards of Conduct. In addition, UNDP has been partnering with the Department of Corrections of the Thai Ministry of Justice to improve the standards of managing LGBTI prisoners, particularly transgender prisoners.

Engaging youth Engaging youth through the Karma Dialogues In November 2020 UNDP organized the Karma Dialogues, a six-part series aimed to inspire and motivate youth during the most difficult days of the COVID-19 pandemic that were compounded by lockdowns, quarantines, and curfews. Each one-hour interactive show was designed to engage youth on issues such as leadership, empowerment, and resilience. The dialogues featured conversations with entrepreneurs, actors, scientists, leaders, and innovators who have shown grit and perseverance to beat the odds and achieve success while also changing the world for the better. By bringing together \u2018believers in the good\u2019, the dialogues aimed to help catapult their stories to motivate and inspire others. The Dialogues attracted a large audience from across 36 countries in Asia and the Pacific. They were watched live by over 80,000 people on social media platforms including YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Some of the feedback received from youth in the region included comments on how these stories motivated them to persevere in their endeavors. Catalyzing the largest youth social entrepreneurship movement in Asia and the Pacific Through support from UNDP, the Youth Co:Lab initiative has benefited over 9,500 young entrepreneurs and kept them afloat even during COVID-19. As a result, nearly 1,240 startups have been developed or strengthened to address challenges to the SDGs. How have young entrepreneurs in the region responded to COVID-19? While 92 per cent of assessed businesses were negatively impacted by the pandemic, many young entrepreneurs showed agility and resilience. Eighty-seven per cent pivoted their business strategy, while 86 per cent employed innovation \u2013 from launching new products and services, to transforming their operating models. Furthermore, more than 40 innovative youth-led solutions were developed to address challenges caused by the pandemic. UNDP and UNICEF partnership for youth UNICEF and UNDP are committed to an Asia-Pacific partnership for young people\u2019s empowerment which was undertaken in Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, and Thailand in 2021. More than two million adolescents and youth were reached with online and offline programmes to develop digital skills, foster participation in their communities, and refine their businesses. Over 12,300 young people were engaged in activities promoting climate action, social innovation skills and digital learning through seed funding and regional advocacy. Approximately 32,000 youth were reached through online campaigns associated with these activities. The Youth Environmental Living Lab (YELL) in Malaysia has plans to strengthen youth-led action for the environment and integrate into national schools and universities in 2022. In Pakistan, Thailand, Nepal, and Indonesia, teams are providing technical and organizational support to local youth networks, National Youth Councils, young parliamentarian networks and policymakers. Regional teams launched the Youth Engagement in Climate Action Platforms, a youth-led effort to bring together UNICEF, UNDP, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to enhance climate advocacy. In its inaugural year, the platform hosted more than 210 consultations to build young people\u2019s capacity and bring their voices to regional and global events. 87% 86% 40 PIVOTED BUSINESS STRATEGY INNOVATED INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS CATALYZED RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC UNDP STANDS WITH YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS AS THEY WITHSTAND COVID-19 AND HELP RESPOND TO IT [ 62 ] [ 63 ] 5 Theme Photo: UNDP Cambodia While Covid-19 was the most urgent development challenge in 2020-2021, the impacts of the pandemic were significantly intensified and compounded due to ongoing environmental threats.

The huge transformations required to decarbonize the economy, invest in renewable energy, promote [ 64 ] [ 65 ] more environmentally friendly resource use, and conserve habitats and species holds the promise of millions of new jobs, better energy access, and potential for progress on gender equality. UNDP is ideally placed to assist countries in this critical shift. With expertise in multi-sectoral and multi-dimensional fields, UNDP can help to better understand the systemic linkages and risks between the environment, climate change, poverty and exclusion, governance and the ability of individuals and societies to absorb and rebound from shocks. UNDP is providing countries in the region with critical support to integrate environmental considerations into planning and budgeting frameworks, including in the formulation of National Adaptation Plans. We are amongst the largest implementers of environment projects in the region, and a key interlocuter for programme countries to access environment and climate change funding from multilateral climate funds. Environmental and development benefits are delivered through a portfolio of 131 projects in 33 countries, financed by the Adaptation Fund, GEF, Green Climate Fund (GCF), Least Developed Country Fund (LDCF), Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (REDD+) and bilateral donors. The total portfolio budget for 2020 and 2021 was US $158.3 million and US $161.62 million, respectively. In 2020-2021, Nature, Climate Change, and Energy (NCE) continued to represent a key focus in our comprehensive support to countries to bring environment and climate concerns into national development plans and strategies. The range of programmes helped address the effects of climate change, promote sound management of chemicals and waste, protect biodiversity, valuable land, forests, coastal and marine ecosystems, and water resources, and build resilien
