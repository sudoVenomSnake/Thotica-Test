Typically, these dams are managed in isolation and almost exclusively to maximize electricity production. The need for sustainability and greater inclusiveness requires a different approach whereby dams and reservoirs are considered not in isolation but as critical elements of the landscapes in which they are located. They need to be managed not only for electricity but also to sustain and enhance critical ecosystem services. This requires a systematic approach, considering each reservoir in the context of the basin in which it is located and the associated interconnections with the upstream and downstream aquatic and terrestrial landscape. It means managing the dams in each basin, and indeed across basins, conjunctively. Importantly, it also means giving much greater consideration to the role of reservoirs in livelihood adaptation for local communities coping with dam driven change. In this regard, management of dams in the 3S needs to be better integrated both within countries and across national borders. It is possible that more integrated management of the dams would ensure adequate electricity production whilst simultaneously providing opportunities to: \uf0b7 Enhance reservoir fisheries, through an appropriate mix of physical, biological and natural resource governance interventions, including on inflowing tributaries. \uf0b7 Enhance other reservoir related ecosystem services including, for example, restoration of shoreline vegetation which can enhance fish habitat, reduce erosion, maintain deltas, provide a carbon sink, purify water, improve aesthetics and, in some instances, provide agricultural opportunities (Box 4.2). \uf0b7 Safeguard downstream environmental flows for human use and to support healthy river ecosystems, including downstream fisheries and flood dependent agriculture, as well as, in some instances, downstream irrigation (Box 4.3). In addition, managing sediment is an aspect of dam management in the 3S that needs critical attention. Consideration needs to be given to both enhanced watershed management to reduce sediment deposition within the reservoirs and sediment flushing/sluicing. The former may be linked to payment for ecosystem service schemes (Box 4.4) and the latter needs careful consideration in 53 the context of environmental flows and the direct and indirect impacts on downstream fisheries (Baran et al. 2012). Box 4.1: Cultivation in the Yali hydropower reservoir In some places the drawdown area of reservoirs can represent a significant agricultural opportunity, particularly where there is limited arable land for farming communities that have had to be relocated because of dam construction. In such cases, consideration needs to be given not only to matching agricultural activities and crop cycles to variation in reservoir water-levels but also to issues such as potential fertilizer and pesticide pollution and possible soil erosion and associated sedimentation arising from farming activities. In the Sesan, trials undertaken since 2008 have indicated the feasibility of local communities using 2,600 hectares of the fertile drawdown zone of the Yali reservoir for growing cassava (Senaratna Sellamuttu et al., 2014). Box 4.2: Environmental flows To date, environmental flows have not been widely applied in the region. The key to achieving implementable environmental flows is reaching a compromise that minimizes the potential impacts on downstream ecosystems while ensuring adequate production for reservoir operators. Ideally, this achieved in the planning and design phase of dams but in some instances can be achieved retroactively. Implementing a comprehensive environmental flow program in the 3S will require cross-sector and transboundary commitments. One recent study investigated the cascade of seven hydropower dams on the upper Sesan river in Vietnam, and the impacts of the changes in the flow regime in the habitats and ecosystems in the lower Sesan in Cambodia. Modelling of the hydrological character of the river enabled a comparison of full regulation with a near natural flow regime if all the dams were operated in run-of-river mode.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2886789-c804-49ae-9dc7-b18eedf7a40b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2886789-c804-49ae-9dc7-b18eedf7a40b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Measuring, understanding and adapting to nexus trade-offs in the Sekong, Sesan and Srepok transboundary river basins", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "58ff6d7dc603b29c18d6303f4cee36702240fa97b4c8aae2c88fc5103f78a764"}, "2": {"node_id": "8f4c03ea-5e45-4841-9868-781176464c1e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/measuring-understanding-and-adapting-nexus-trade-offs-sekong-sesan-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51a1279078ae4f7e00529aac2725dfcdf57bf5e8d2ae80b1962161aaa28ed07c"}}, "hash": "aee9450c710ab4a197844a77d0e444536c521cf0cb534762c0002f53450fc57c", "text": "This illustrated that there would be a reduction in the potential electricity production of 13% with a near natural flow regime (Meynell et al. 2014).

Payees may be beneficiaries (i.e., users of the services), or polluters offsetting negative environmental impacts. PES arrangements have been implemented in some places to improve the operation and longevity of hydropower schemes. The idea is that paying to protect forest cover and implement soil and water conservation measures in watersheds upstream of dams, reduces erosion and hence reservoir sedimentation. Thus, investment in improved watershed management can extend the life and economic viability of a hydropower scheme. Vietnam is one of the first countries in Southeast Asia to implement a national PES policy. It is estimated that to date the scheme has generated about $140 million, largely funded by hydropower operators, to protect around 4 million ha of the country\u2018s forest. A study of a proposed hydropower scheme in Cambodia (Pursat 1) estimated that the net present value of forest conservation (attributed to safeguarding hydropower revenue) was $4.7 million (or $42.15/ha of watershed area) (Arias et al., 2011). The viability of such schemes in the 3S should be investigated. For new hydropower dams, careful consideration needs to be given to how they fit within the context of existing ones, how they will add to cumulative total impacts (both upstream and downstream) and how they are best managed in combination with the existing schemes, within each country and across national borders. Equally, given the rapidly evolving nature of the energy sector and the relative economic fragility of large infrastructure schemes (Ansar et al., 2014) careful consideration should be given to whether these schemes should proceed. 5. MINING Current situation Mineral mining and quarrying are important economic sectors in Vietnam and Laos, contributing a significant proportion of national GDP (Table 5.1). Vietnam is the third largest mineral producer in Southeast Asia (Great Mining, 2017). In contrast, although there is significant potential and many exploration licenses have been granted, the mining sector in Cambodia is largely undeveloped. Across Cambodia (including in the 3S) there are thousands of artisanal miners and small-scale quarrying activities but currently no large industrial-scale mining (Open Development Cambodia, 2017).

In response, the government imposed a 4-year moratorium on new mining projects in 2012. Despite pressure from mining companies, the moratorium was extended in 2016 so that investigations in to some mining operators could be completed (Vientiane Times, 2016). In Cambodia, 22 mining licenses have been issued in Rattanakiri Province to 11 companies to extract gold, bauxite, iron, gemstones and granite. The total area of concessions covers 4,000 km2 (Someth et al., 2013). Stung Treng Province contains several mineral deposits but apart from the alluvial gold deposits in the Sekong none are yet exploited (Someth et al., 2013). The first industrial scale mining license for gold was issued in September 2016 to a mining company in Ratanakiri (Open Development Cambodia, 2017). There is significant extraction (much of it illegal) of sand and gravel from river beds in the 3S, especially on the Sesan and Srepok in Vietnam, on the Sekong near Attapeu in Laos, and on the Sesan in Stung Treng in Cambodia (IUCN, 2017). Sand and gravel are used primarily by the construction industry but there are no data on volumes being taken or the extent to which they are exported24. River sand and gravel mining can cause severe turbidity and increase downstream erosion. In the Krong Ana and Krong No, two tributaries of the Srepok in Vietnam, uncontrolled mining has caused significant loss of farmland (VietnamNet Bridge, 2017). Mining impacts depend, to a large extent, on the location, topography and climatic condition as well as the exact nature of operations. As with hydropower, local communities often bear the brunt of negative impacts while the rewards tend to accrue at regional, national and international levels. Within affected communities, some groups are better positioned to benefit from local development due to education or skills or for other reasons. Conversely, others tend to be particularly vulnerable to detrimental impacts (e.g., women, the elderly, poor households or ethnic minorities). These factors can combine in ways that exacerbate vulnerabilities and inequality. For example, well- connected and educated young men often do well while less-educated ethnic minority women tend to be excluded from job opportunities. Poor households, particularly ethnic minorities, depend heavily on forests and rivers. As these resources become scarce, or their access is restricted, households inevitably became more vulnerable with serious implications for poverty, food security and nutrition (World Bank, 2010). Men tend to be the primary beneficiaries of employment opportunities created by mining while women tend to be disproportionately affected by the loss or degradation of forest and water resources. 24At the national level a significant proportion of river sand and gravel mined in Laos is exported to China. Box 5.1: Bauxite mining in the Central Highlands (https://ejatlas.org/conflict/tan-rai-bauxite- mining-in-central-highlands-vietnam) Vietnam is estimated to hold the world's third-largest bauxite ore reserves, after Guinea and Australia (USGS, 2014). Up to 96% of this reserve is in the Central Highlands. In 2006, the government approved plans to begin mining bauxite reserves and in 2007 signed an unusual party-to-party agreement with China to mine bauxite in the Central Highlands. There are two operating mines (one of which is in the Srepok) and plans for four more. The greatest concern with bauxite mining is the impact of the red mud (bauxite residue) and tailing slurry (waste water discharged during the sifting process). Containing high levels of metal oxide and sodium hydroxide, the sludge could damage water supplies and agriculture (primarily coffee), as well as to the health and safety of thousands of people. Moreover, deforestation, relocation and population displacement in a region that is home to ethnic minorities, and the large amount of water and energy required for producing alumina, are also matters of concern, particularly when water scarcity is growing in the Central Highlands. 56 Future direction Given the significant mineral reserves, the considerable financial value and the growing global demand it seems likely that mining activities will increase in the 3S in the immediate future.

A species of forests and woodlands, it is widespread in Central and Southern Europe. \u00a9 Beat Pfarrer LEAST CONCERN LC 1 European Terrestrial Molluscs Europe has one of the most highly fragmented landscapes of all the continents, with only a tiny fraction of its land surface \u2013 largely the Arctic regions \u2013 considered as wilderness. Over the last 5,000 years, much of the European landscape has been shaped by human activity through food, timber and fuel production. Currently within Western Europe, more than 80% of the land area is under some form of direct management (European Environment Agency, 2007). Consequently, European species are to a large extent dependent upon semi-natural habitats created and maintained by human activity, particularly traditional, non-intensive forms of land management. Over the last century, these habitats have come under increasing pressure from agricultural intensification, urban sprawl, infrastructure development, land abandonment, acidification, eutrophication and desertification. Many species are directly affected by overexploitation, persecution, and impacts of alien invasive species, and climate change is set to become an increasingly serious threat. Europe is a vast, diverse region and the relative importance of different threats varies widely across its biogeographic regions and countries. This report is one of a series of reports on the conservation status of animals and plants in Europe, focussing on terrestrial molluscs in the Class Gastropoda \u2013 slugs, snails, and semi-slugs. The Phylum Mollusca (snails, slugs, clams, mussels, chitons, tusk shells, monoplacophorans, polyplacophorans (chitons), Caudofoveata, Solenogastres, squids, cuttlefish and octopuses) contains an estimated 94,000 extant species worldwide. This figure comprises ca. 55,000 marine gastropods, ca. 10,000 marine bivalves, at least 25,000 terrestrial and freshwater snails and 1,300 freshwater bivalve species. The remaining groups embrace considerably fewer numbers of species, ca. 800 cephalopods, 1,100 chitons, 600 tusk shells and 420 Caudofoveata and Solenogastres (currently known and estimated numbers taken from MolluscaBase). The overall number of described species increases each year as more research is undertaken, especially in under-researched regions of the world such as the tropics. However, even within the relatively well-studied European region, new species are constantly being described, and the status of many species names, as either valid species or as synonyms of other species, needs further taxonomic study. The actual number of extant species of Mollusca globally is uncertain. Molluscs can be found in almost all habitats, from the bottom of the oceans to mountain-tops and across tundra regions. They are very diverse, not only in size and shape but also in their lifecycle, lifespan and habitat. They are an important food source for birds, fish, mammals and other invertebrates, and in some cases for humans, too. Together with such groups as the fungi and saproxylic beetles, Mollusca play a key role in soil-generation and the recycling of nutrients in natural ecosystems. Because of their often specific habitat requirements, they can be good indicators of environmental quality, especially for ancient woodlands, grasslands, wetlands and subterranean habitats. Farmers and gardeners usually view terrestrial molluscs as pests that damage plants and the subsequent control of terrestrial molluscs can cause problems from a conservation perspective. However, these \u2018pest\u2019 species actually represent only a very small fraction of the species that occur in the European region. Indeed, many of the globally significant pest species were exported from Europe to other parts of the world. Terrestrial molluscs utilise a very wide range of microhabitats \u2013 taxa have evolved to exploit these niches, with some having very specific ecological requirements, such as interstitial spaces within subsoil, living on trees, found only on rock-faces or restricted to pristine forest habitats.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ca26331-52ca-4112-9ee6-f7db7babfa67": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ca26331-52ca-4112-9ee6-f7db7babfa67", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b8433775421150ec1a338388a9cb0bf7386d8945d0ca5bb97ef63c4c0e7ac5a"}, "2": {"node_id": "446643f6-f208-4992-94e1-ee784c9e2546", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70842d1827862cfe6af7f4623aa00c855a3d042ef4113b337525c9e59443eeb1"}}, "hash": "b6fb5922979c958fb2d66364430db22bf156921215a8c255a98b3d26d1af9f74", "text": "The assemblage of molluscs found at a particular site is influenced by historical geographical isolation and glaciation, altitude, degree and duration of sun exposure, the quantity and duration of rainfall and the frequency of habitat disturbance (i.e., forest fires or clear-cutting, amongst many other factors). 2 Assessment Scope This IUCN European Red List provides an assessment for the 2,480 species of terrestrial mollusc species known to be present in the European region at the start of 2019.

In vertebrates, for example, the reptiles are 52.1% endemic (73 endemic species), mammals 26.9% (61 endemic species), and amphibians are 76.3% endemic (61 endemic species). There are an estimated 100,000 invertebrate species in Europe, with six groups assessed for the European Red List. The dragonflies and damselflies have a low level of endemism (12.2%; 16 endemic species), compared to Orthoptera (69.9%; 742 endemic species), and saproxylic beetles (32.4%; 224 endemic species). There are very few terrestrial mollusc species present in Europe that are not endemic to the European region, and most of these have ranges that do not extend far into North Africa or Asia. Only a few species are proven to have a holarctic distribution pattern. As a consequence, Europe and in particular those countries with single-country threatened species have a responsibility to ensure the long-term conservation of these species. Threat Status Overall, 21.8% and 22.5% of the 2,469 native species of terrestrial mollusc are considered threatened (species assessed as Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable) in Europe and in the European Union Member States (EU 27/28), respectively. These are the mid-point values \u2013 assuming that a similar relative proportion of the Data Deficient (DD) species are likely to be threatened \u2013 and provide the best estimate of the proportion of threatened species (IUCN, 2016). For Europe, the percentage of threatened species ranges between 19.6% (if no DD species are considered likely to be threatened) and 29.8% (if all DD species were to be assessed as threatened). The equivalent figures range from 20.1% to 30.8% for the EU27/28 Member States. For just over one-tenth (250 species \u2013 10.1%) of the species in Europe there was insufficient information to evaluate their risk of extinction and they were assessed as Data Deficient (DD). In the EU Member States, 240 species (10.6%) were assessed as DD, which is considerably lower than the level of data deficiency for the freshwater molluscs (24.7%) (Cuttelod et al., 2011).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6f978d0a-10aa-4dfd-84a7-5b61bc3472ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "6f978d0a-10aa-4dfd-84a7-5b61bc3472ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f3bd504b6acf927cb1346abfc6de416f8829d46fb4495a41d217c546a40a2a0"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ad8407a-0f27-4f28-8d8a-996a76bf3eb9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "707598d81f4670461381158da9c64093f49bdfdaa8f235ca678c5c59c376741d"}}, "hash": "191d85855a55a7a4bcdf7a7872bff96bdaca2a9e83ad50f216c58ed96abfea71", "text": "In Europe, 97 species (3.9%) have been assessed as Critically Endangered, and of these, 23 species are considered Possibly Extinct (CR(PE)).

All five species were small-range endemics from islands; the first two from Madeira and Porto Santo, the remaining three from the Aegean, the islands of Chios (Vitrea storchi), Santorini (Z. santoriniensis) and Sifnos, Sikinos and Folegandros (Z. siphnicus). The large species from the Zonites genus live on many Aegean islands, and often are single- island endemics, or inhabit a small group of neighbouring islands, as with Z. siphnicus. Species from the Zonites genus are known to have undergone seriously declines in recent decades, and many of them have not been found alive in the field. It is not clear whether their rapid extinction reflects a natural process of declining island faunas, whether it is combined with climate change, or has other causes. The complete list of species and their Red List status in Europe and in the EU Member States (EU 27/28) is available as Supplementary Material1. Comparing mid-point values for other European Red List species groups that have been comprehensively assessed (Table 2) for the European region, we find that terrestrial molluscs are one of the more threatened invertebrate groups assessed for Europe so far. Only freshwater molluscs, freshwater fishes, grasshoppers and crickets, and amphibians have a higher percentage of threatened species than terrestrial molluscs; terrestrial molluscs show the highest level of endemism (92%). 1 Supplementary Material available at: https://portals.iucn.org/library/node/48439 Figure 1a.

Bilz pers. comm. 2019). Major Threats A large number of species are threatened due to their restricted range and consequential high levels of extinction risk. The ranges of many of these species do not lie in protected areas and their current conservation status is concerning. An overview of the major threats affecting European terrestrial molluscs is shown in Figure 2. Over 30% of all assessed species are impacted by natural system modifications, including the removal of banks and hedges, changes in fire management practices, quarrying, livestock grazing, wetland conversion and peat extraction, changes in land management practices, logging and other forest management, especially of old- growth forests. Loss of habitats through the conversion of land to residential and industrial use is common on the edges of towns and villages. Habitats at risk include forests, meadows, fens, and marshes. Habitat loss can create additional threats to terrestrial molluscs by fragmenting forest habitats, reducing habitat area and quality; larger species of terrestrial molluscs are likely to be more at risk than 7 smaller species. Terrestrial molluscs tend to occur in meta-populations in marshes and fens, but land drainage can lead to fragmentation of riverine fringing habitats and therefore reduced opportunities for molluscs to recolonise after flooding events. Fire within Mediterranean zones is a natural event, due to lightning strikes. However, in recent decades, the frequency and severity of fires has increased. Fire is known to cause declines in snail diversity and abundance, but given time terrestrial molluscs can recolonise when suitable vegetation re-emerges and where the burn has not destroyed the soil cover and crevices within rocky habitats. The impact of long-term climate change on fire risk and intensity requires more research. Families at particular risk include the Clausiliidae, Helicidae, Geomitridae, Hygromiidae, Enidae and Vitrinidae. Agricultural land use has led to a decline in snail abundance, for example, where land has been drained or ploughed, rough grazing has been converted to improved grasslands, or where field boundaries have been removed to make large fields that are more economic for cultivation. The conversion of heathlands, forest and marshes/fens for agriculture use over the last 30 years further contributes to the loss of habitats for terrestrial molluscs. Families at particular risk include the Helicidae, Geomitridae, Hygromiidae, Vertiginidae and the Succineidae. Many slug species, which are commonly regarded as agricultural pests, are threatened Figure 2. Major threats to terrestrial molluscs in Europe.

Some endemic slug species do not have large ranges, and these species are particularly vulnerable to the use of slug controls; families at particular risk include the Limacidae and the Arionidae. Quarrying of limestone destroys large areas of crags and subterranean habitats. As many terrestrial molluscs are calciphiles, range-restricted endemics are common in limestone habitats, leading to rapid declines in populations, and potentially local or global extinctions. Families at particular risk include the Aciculidae, Cochlostomatidae, Argnidae, Clausiliidae, Lauriidae, Pupillidae, Chondrinidae and Spelaeodiscidae. The larger terrestrial molluscs, such as Helix pomatia, Helix lucorum, Helix figulina, Helix straminea, Helix ligata, Cornu aspersum, Otala lactea, O. punctata, Massylaea vermiculata and Cepaea nemoralis continue to be collected for food within many of the Mediterranean countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0eec1579-b7a2-4874-bc57-0f30be24849e": {"__data__": {"id_": "0eec1579-b7a2-4874-bc57-0f30be24849e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a72dd40ee20861ea2fdf2f597606357df84836d0260e7905655e0d0bb4f9953"}, "2": {"node_id": "523e3e40-bfe1-42a8-bd9a-641baebe57ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afecc900c8643259e26ce93dbefea14c8ea907ee9b4b2f3dba91b2fc1d46989e"}}, "hash": "d9582b99d6be8de8aed5a54225224adf7af2c0ea6fa29a98dd296a2dd854a8de", "text": "Some endemic species, such as the \u2018Chapa\u2019 (Iberus gualtieranus) fetch high prices in local markets, placing increasing pressure on these populations.

In some countries, there are data on general declines over 20-30 years, as distribution atlases have been published at these intervals (e.g. for the British Isles; Kerney, 1999). This is an area where citizen science projects could be launched to increase efforts in monitoring European molluscs. However, it has to be stressed that for most species of invertebrates, it is extremely hard to obtain robust data on population size, and consequently on their long-term trends! In Europe, 6% (138 species) of terrestrial mollusc species are thought to be declining in population size, whilst 42% (1,043 species) are considered to have a stable population, however, the trend is increasing for just 1% of species and the trend is not known for more than half (1,272) of all species (Figure 3). As would be expected, the picture is worse for threatened species, with no populations thought to be increasing, 15% (70 species) stable, but 20% (97 species) with declining population trends and the trend not known for 65% (315 species).

Stable Stable Increasing Unknown Unknown Decreasing Decreasing 42% 15% 1% 51% 65% 51% 20% 10 Protected Areas Many species of terrestrial molluscs are recorded from protected areas (see Figure 4), however, this high figure is misleading, as there are almost no protected areas designated or managed for mollusc species. In general, only those species listed on the Habitats Directive, with a requirement to have designated Special Areas of Conservation (SACs), such as the four Vertigo species (Vertigo angustior (VU), V. genesii (LC), V. geyeri (LC), V. moulinsiana (VU)), Elona quimperiana (LC), and the Kerry Slug Geomalacus maculosus (LC), are species in protected areas with management plans. However, there are many species of terrestrial molluscs that are known from single sites, especially on the islands, such as in Macaronesia or the Aegean Sea, many of them threatened, that do not occur within protected areas. It is likely that the areas where these species occur would qualify as Alliance for Zero Extinction (AZE) sites, or should otherwise come within the protected areas network, and further work is required to confirm this.

The intermediate latitudes of central Europe clearly stand out as areas of high species richness (Figure 5). Biodiversity hotspots are located in mountainous areas such as the Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians and the Balkan Peninsula but also on the Macaronesian Islands. The richness of endemic species is shown in Figure 6 and shows somewhat similar patterns to the overall species diversity. The Mediterranean and Macaronesian islands have many range-restricted endemic terrestrial snails, which can also be seen on the endemic species richness map. The larger of the Canary Islands, Tenerife and Gran Canaria, as well as Madeira and Porto Santo, are densely populated by endemic species, and typically, each particular island has its own set of endemic species. The distribution of threatened species is shown in Figure 7. Here, the pattern does not strictly follow the simple formula \u201cthe higher the species richness, the higher the number of threatened taxa\u201d. This rule may apply for the Macaronesian islands, but certainly not for the continent. On average, the areas of high species richness \u201conly\u201d have a density of 2-3 threatened species per hexagon with rare spot-like exceptions populated by species of the \u201c4-6\u201d category. On the continent, the highest threat level is reached on the southern Pelop\u00f3nnisos in Greece, reaching the maximum level of 17-24 threatened species per hexagon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41add34d-11cf-4e16-a45c-51ed6f4f3814": {"__data__": {"id_": "41add34d-11cf-4e16-a45c-51ed6f4f3814", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ac1098ed6dee2657a07c851e69cfd87f774b86f52a8bc3be92faf9af3de1263"}, "2": {"node_id": "34eb617c-cff8-4425-a4c5-bcb9aea44d30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99184d229bd4393b71e73809afae38921770acdcf0c6435779bc3c9f823e26dc"}}, "hash": "344389540129e3bc3b97b1ed434a9d7a1a341a1d75956274145a5a7160cf9a98", "text": "This area only reaches moderate to slightly elevated values in species richness, endemicity and data deficiency (Figure 8), so the explanation for this exceptional issue is likely due to elevated environmental stress in the area, caused by fire and other factors.

A lot of effort is needed to eliminate the inflationary creation of new taxa introduced by the followers of the \u201cNouvelle \u00c9cole\u201d in the 19th century. Another hotspot of DD species is on the Canary Islands. Despite the enormous efforts during 30 years of research by Spanish malacologists and colleagues from abroad, the knowledge on these islands and their rich malacofauna is still poor. Conservation Actions Legislation for species Despite the high level of threat and endemism, just 14 of the threatened terrestrial molluscs from Europe are listed in the Habitats Directive annexes as requiring strict protection. Most taxa were placed in the Directive annexes based on data from the 1970s and have not been reviewed in recent times, except when a new country becomes a member state. Protected Areas It has been argued that many species will have ranges that overlap the Natura 2000 network of protected areas, which covers more than Figure 8. Distribution of Data Deficient terrestrial molluscs in Europe. 14 Fire, such as shown in this landscape near Trun in western Bulgaria, can completely devastate habitats and pose a significant threat to range- restricted species. \u00a9 Ivailo Dedov 18% of the EU\u2019s land area and hence plays a vital role in protecting species and their habitats. It is clear, however, that in practice, a Natura 2000 designation does not always mean actual protection (at least in the eastern part of Europe). Moreover, there are threatened species in habitats that lie outside protected areas, such as Natura 2000, Ramsar sites and national protected areas. This needs to be reviewed as an urgent action, to determine whether existing protected areas could have their boundaries extended or new sites developed, especially for threatened single-site (AZE) species. Habitat protection is one of the most important conservation actions needed for terrestrial molluscs at the national and international levels. Reducing damaging operations From a nature conservation point of view, the pivotal questions for terrestrial molluscs are the protection of existing habitats and the restoration and/or reconstruction of endangered or lost habitats. This can be seen in Figure 2 where \u201cnatural system modifications\u201d are flagged as the major threat to terrestrial molluscs, followed by \u201cresidential & commercial development\u201d. Future conservation actions have to focus on the protection of areas rather than on individual species, as was the practice with the species listed in Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. The management of habitats for the benefit of terrestrial molluscs, where the major threats are disturbance or destruction of the habitats, is urgently needed. 1) Logging Logging and other forestry activities affect many forest-dependent species in Europe. In all European forest types, excessive logging deeply modifies or even destroys wood habitats. This is particularly true for sensitive species (i.e., species dependent on large standing trees, for example, or on a diverse and stable functioning forest ecosystem); forestry policy has to follow sustainable management of areas. Forest certification schemes, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), promote the 15 responsible management of the world\u2019s forests, and many European and EU countries have certified areas, and the process is supported by the European Union Forestry Strategy. Certified forest areas must ensure the protection of threatened species in order to comply with the certification requirements, and can, therefore, play an important role in terrestrial mollusc conservation. 2) biodiversity-friendly forest management Forest management is also important, as it is not just logging that can impact native species of terrestrial molluscs and slugs. Dead wood is often a favoured habitat, hence removal of large trunks can be detrimental, and any woodland habitat plan should ensure that the habitats maintain a range of suitable trees of different ages, that large trunks are allowed to decay in situ and that clearings, and that hedges and boundary areas retain some understory vegetation and where possible link across agricultural areas. Another completely underestimated factor is the continuity in forest habitats: decaying ground litter is an important habitat, particularly for small terrestrial mollusc species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc8f3e7c-b38b-44b3-a29f-197def63b08a": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc8f3e7c-b38b-44b3-a29f-197def63b08a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d3edd144fb3faa61d42d6b9d50992a998c36dca2cdc3d05af0ac3b18e4fbd4c7"}, "2": {"node_id": "b5edde46-485b-4f64-bb79-f4d442b8fb57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9236728edd40a9e36473f051e7f6a2557c677ae469b41bcf1874c1306d533d64"}}, "hash": "f293737ffd3d403d4f3b86b0b23e559738b9b49fef7d6fa5688b5c36db8af766", "text": "For example, species in the Vertiginidae family, and the valloniid species Acanthinula aculeata and Spermodea lamellata, are strongly dependent on ground-litter continuity in forests, especially so in Scandinavian woodlands.

However, many snails disperse passively using migrating vector species (smaller or larger mammals, fowl, human transport), so corridors may have a positive dispersal effect as well. Size, structure, and maintenance of corridors are also possible factors influencing their suitability for conservation purposes. Summarising, it can be said that biological corridors are mainly designed to serve the conservation of vertebrates, but their role for land snail dispersal and conservation needs further intensive study. 3) biodiversity-friendly grassland management Grassland areas host many species of endemic terrestrial molluscs. Better land management practises, such as preventing over- and under- grazing, reducing the density of stock to reduce trampling, retaining boundaries such as hedges and banks, not mowing or harvesting too frequently, and not burning off the grass and brush at inappropriate times of the year. For species-rich grassland sites, the focus should be on extensive management practices. Grassland enrichment through the introduction of nutrients (artificial fertilisers and animal manures) results in the reduction of plant species richness that then affects mollusc diversity. 4) Reducing habitat destruction by quarrying Many terrestrial molluscs are restricted to rocky crags and hillsides, which are often sites that have the potential for limestone extraction. Planning approval for quarrying usually requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for biodiversity impacts, however, these frequently do not take account of invertebrate species, or only look at those listed in the EU Habitats Directive annexes. Recommended actions include undertaking an EIA if an endemic terrestrial mollusc is suspected to be present, prior to quarrying of limestone resources to ensure that these take into account biodiversity loss, especially in regions of high terrestrial mollusc endemism. It is possible to create areas that are set aside as mini-reserves within the range of a quarry region to protect the species and serve as a refuge from where terrestrial molluscs can recolonise once quarrying operations cease. However, such a fragmented landscape cannot protect subterranean or cave-dwelling species, as their subterranean habitat and especially its microclimate will be severely altered by quarrying and mining; even road construction in limestone areas is able to damage this fragile environment. 5) Reducing habitat destruction by drainage and water extraction Many terrestrial molluscs are restricted to small calcareous fens and bogs, which 16 Ilh\u00e9u de Cima: a small island southwest of Porto Santo in the Madeira Archipelago, showing the effect of vegetation recovery after eradication of the feral goat population. A dense and species- rich plant community is again found on the islet, a vital prerequisite for terrestrial snail fauna. \u00a9 Dinarte Teixeira are often sites identified as suitable for agricultural improvement. Once drainage has commenced, it is impossible for these species to recolonise, unless it is along the margin of rivers. Small areas of suitable habitat can protect these species. Wetland habitats are often fed by springs that are identified as suitable for offtake of water for villages and agricultural purposes. Once offtake has commenced, it creates areas of dry habitat and vegetation quickly changes, such that the species sensitive to drying habitats quickly are lost in these sites. Small areas of suitable habitat can protect the species provided that the water supply is maintained at minimum levels all year around. 6) Erosion and habitat restoration Erosion caused by a variety of factors is a widespread phenomenon all over Europe. However, it may become a critical issue where erosion affects extremely small-range endemic species. This is, for example, the case on the Desertas, a small island group off Madeira, and the other satellite islands, as well as many of the small islands and island-groups in the Aegean Sea. Trampling and massive overgrazing of vegetation by non-native species (goats) had led to serious erosion across large areas on the Madeiran islands. Consequently, mollusc populations crashed so low that they were not recorded during field surveys in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, the goat population has been eradicated, and the vegetation is now recovering slightly; recent surveys showed that many of the highly threatened terrestrial mollusc species may have survived at very low density in small pockets, and a restoration process has begun supported by the EU LIFE Programme.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ba1478e-f6fe-49b3-8395-4fd9021385b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ba1478e-f6fe-49b3-8395-4fd9021385b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3f81fb71beda051ec575fe0b046a556a2b42e2e86ea4e0dfa1b5c6e544fb31d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf152ed1-a573-47e7-8429-6f65f69e24b3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e12d02a6f0c151ab2a3a09dc80d754d06b82afea89731cda9db00ae29b554354"}}, "hash": "56ab85e51b2bac87e3291c1e71c1748ea4723b3deac806ca266af077f4572af0", "text": "Species conservation action LIFE is the EU\u2019s financial instrument supporting nature conservation in projects throughout the EU and can, therefore, provide an important tool for conservation of terrestrial molluscs in Europe.

Least is known about the status of species where diversity is greatest\u201d. The opposite is true in terrestrial molluscs: as can be derived from the distribution pattern of the DD species, the least known species and the highest deficit in research is concentrated in considerably wealthy countries like France, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria. Identification of KBA and AZE sites for terrestrial molluscs The IUCN European Red List can be used to help prioritize sites (KBAs) and species for conservation action. At present, a KBA exercise has not commenced for terrestrial molluscs. However, given the high proportion of endemic and threatened species, it is considered that terrestrial molluscs would make ideal case studies to extend the currently identified KBAs in Europe as a whole and for the Mediterranean region specifically (Darwall et al., 2014; M\u00e1iz-Tom\u00e9 et al., 2017). AZE sites should also be identified for threatened (Endangered and Critically Endangered) single-site endemic species that meet the AZE thresholds. 18 On the ground island conservation of snails through LIFE Since 2010, three European Union LIFE projects (LIFE Ilh\u00e9us do Porto Santo, LIFE Maci\u00e7o Montanhoso, and LIFE Recover Natura) have contributed to land snail conservation in the Madeira Archipelago, focusing on species listed on the EU Habitats Directive. Many of these species occur in areas where intensive habitat degradation has occurred in the form of fires, erosion, human activities, or the impact of invasive species (e.g. mice, rabbits, the Argentine Ant, or invasive plants). Through each project, complete species inventories were produced, and accurate species distributions and populations estimates produced for the target species. The research also identified two new species of Discula snails, and rediscovered \u2018Lazarus\u2019 species (e.g. Geomitra coronula and Discula lyelliana) that had previously been considered extinct. Conservation actions such as ex situ reproduction for population reinforcement (e.g. Atlantica calathoides), the establishment of new subpopulations of priority species based on habitat modelling (e.g. Wollastonaria turricula), and the introduction of artificial shelters for species protection, have contributed to the conservation of the target species. Indirect measures have played an important role in the restoration of the ecosystem equilibrium, resulting in habitat recovery and enhancing the lifecycle of the species. Interventions have included habitat recovery through the reduction or complete removal of invasive plants (e.g. Nicotiana glauca and Phalaris sp.) and animals (e.g. rabbits), which hugely impact the species habitat, and the elimination or mitigation of the impact of predators such as mice and Argentine Ant for example. One of the most important outputs of the LIFE projects has been the implementation of monitoring schemes focused on the Habitats Directive species. For these species, a capture-mark-recapture monitoring scheme is ongoing, along with climate monitoring within each subpopulation through data loggers, and this work provides important information about the species, such as lifecycle and ecology data. In addition, ten-year species action plans were produced, encompassing the necessary measures, conservation actions and plans to ensure a good conservation status for the EU Habitats Directive species.

Individual species should be reassessed whenever new data become available, for example on their distribution and novel threats, or as a result of taxonomic changes and the description of new species. \u2022 Measures should be promoted at the EU-level to ensure the conservation of key habitats, for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b01bb83b-5455-4135-8784-0b9bea2a4214": {"__data__": {"id_": "b01bb83b-5455-4135-8784-0b9bea2a4214", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of terrestrial molluscs: snails, slugs, and semi-slugs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ba1018da951be1716bff87c42da9f97b50416229edd28c330ec6e29548f2f92"}, "3": {"node_id": "0cf900d1-4b96-4292-a56a-51b3c93d9b04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-terrestrial-molluscs-snails-slugs-and-semi-slugs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "36aeb147482678c9a611b88f11839a7bfe0f422d2ce45ace92a7d57623c9c763"}}, "hash": "6a38c3879ef8584c9bc44784e603e194ccafc36f2e47f50434d962e5615d75fd", "text": "example, limestone habitats above and below ground, fenland areas, ancient woodlands, ancient banks and hedges and intact forest ecosystems. \u2022 The Common Agricultural Policy should promote the appropriate management and protection of wood pasture habitats and chalk grasslands across Europe. \u2022 Council of Europe Recommendations No R (88) 112 on ancient natural and semi-natural woodlands and R (88) 103 on the protection and management of saproxylic organisms and their biotopes 2 Available at: https://rm.coe.int/090000168090a6bc 3 Available at: https://rm.coe.int/090000168090a6ba Wollastonaria turricula (VU) is an example of an extreme small-range snail species, endemic to the Ilh\u00e9u de Cima, Madeira. \u00a9 Dinarte Teixeira VULNERAbLE VU 20 of the Council of Europe to the Member States should be fully implemented. \u2022 Measures should be put in place to prevent illegal logging and ensure control of wood collecting. \u2022 Guidance should be developed on best practices for terrestrial mollusc conservation in Natura 2000 sites. Threatened molluscs should be specified as species of conservation interest when they exist in Natura 2000 sites or other national/local nature reserves. Species and habitat conservation \u2022 Conservation strategies for European terrestrial molluscs identified to be of elevated conservation concern should be developed and implemented, especially were they are under-represented within protected areas (Trochet and Schmeller, 2013). \u2022 Habitat fragmentation should be reduced by creating ecological networks and corridors. \u2022 The best habitat management practices for European terrestrial molluscs should be broadly adopted and relevant stakeholders and land managers should be made more aware of the available sources of information. \u2022 Terrestrial mollusc inventories in Natura 2000 sites and other protected areas should be made to identify priority species in order to develop strategies for their protection. \u2022 Veteran trees should be preserved throughout Europe, in forests, pastureland, orchards, and urban areas. \u2022 Identify those species that are known from single sites, especially those that are phyletically distinct as these are candidate species for priority actions in terms of designating KBAs and AZEs. \u2022 EU states should review that EIA processes include evaluation of invertebrates, especially terrestrial molluscs, prior to quarrying of limestone resources to ensure that these take into account biodiversity loss, especially in regions of high terrestrial mollusc endemism. \u2022 Environmental Impact Assessments for large dam projects should take into account biodiversity loss, in subterranean habitats especially in limestone regions that have high levels of endemism. \u2022 Review impacts of wildfires on the loss of Mediterranean grassland species and instigate better habitat management practices for recovery of European terrestrial molluscs in regions of frequent fires. Research \u2022 Specific research on species that have not been recently recorded in Europe or have been assessed as Data Deficient should be conducted to clarify their status. \u2022 The effects of poorly understood threats (e.g., climate change) on terrestrial molluscs need further study. \u2022 Effective monitoring tools and improved research efforts on terrestrial mollusc species should be developed and promoted, particularly in the Natura 2000 network, in order to understand population trends and the impacts of implemented actions. \u2022 Further research is needed to identify and protect old growth habitats in the cultural landscapes of Europe. 21 Acknowledgments This project would not have been possible without the enthusiastic cooperation of a large number of people throughout Europe and further afield who have helped and supported this project in many different ways over the last ten years. Many of them shared their knowledge of autecology, distribution, abundance and threats to terrestrial molluscs in their region of specialism. Others provided access to the data held within their private collections. Some contributed by reviewing the species accounts once they had been compiled.

Ongoing monitoring of the species and its habitat is required in order to better understand its conservation status and the effectiveness of enforcement of current legislation, especially, over illegal dumping, land reclamation and the introduction of alien species. \u00a9 Stephen Mifsud 1 European Endemic Shrubs Shrubs are evergreen or deciduous woody plants with multiple stems branching from or near the ground. Shrub species grow all across the world, including in areas where trees cannot survive. Shrubs are widely distributed across European habitats ranging from coastal heathlands up into alpine and oromediterranean habitats with only areas exposed to extreme conditions, such as strong winds or shallow rocky soil, limiting shrub survival. In habitats across Europe, shrubs define important vegetation types, for example the Arctic tundra, lowland heathlands or Mediterranean shrublands, highlighting their importance in communities across many different climatic regions (Janssen et al., 2016). Some of these habitat types require disturbance (such as fire or grazing) to maintain this shrub dominant state. Shrubs also make up an important part of forest ecosystems providing understorey vegetation as well as dominating the forest edges. Shrubs play an important role in maintaining ecosystem services especially through contributions to soil stabilisation, nutrient cycling and water management. Shrubs also play an important role to a great range of organisms in provision of food, habitat and shelter. The exact number of shrub species present in the world remains unknown. Even within Europe \u2013 a well-studied region of the world \u2013 there are limited data relating to the diversity of shrubs species, and conflicting taxonomic approaches and growth-form definitions. Further to this, conservation assessments of European shrubs highlight the variety of conservation actions needed to prevent shrub species from going extinct. The long-term survival of these species depends on the protection of habitats from livestock grazing, the control of alien invasive and problematic species, reducing the widespread and growing pressure from fires and landslides, as well as increasing targeted conservation research focused on this group of plants. Assessment Scope This report encompasses the conservation status of 262 selected endemic European shrub species. These shrubs were selected because they are large (over 0.5 metres in height) and endemic to Europe. The report does not include 24 species endemic to Macaronesia (Madeira Archipelago or in some cases Madeira and the Canaries) because the expertise was not available to finalise their assessments within the timeframe of the project. All the assessments were made following the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN, 2012, 2001) and peer-reviewed through expert workshops or email consultation. The conservation assessments of these species are found on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (www.iucnredlist.org). All assessments were carried out on two levels: pan-Europe, and the Member States of the European Union (EU). The pan-Europe assessment is also the global assessment for these species as all species are endemic to Europe. Of the 262 species included in the assessment, 219 species are endemic to the EU region. The scope extended from Iceland in the west to the Urals in the east, and from Franz Josef Land in the north to the Canary Islands in the south. The Caucasus region is not included. 2 Threat Status Overall, 48.5% and 48.3% of European endemic shrub species that have been assessed are threatened in Europe and in the EU, respectively. These mid-point values assume that a similar relative proportion of the Data Deficient (DD) species are likely to be threatened (the mid-point value), and provides the best estimation of the proportion of threatened species (IUCN 2011). For almost a tenth (25 species) of the species included in the assessment, there was insufficient information available to evaluate their risk of extinction and they were assessed as DD. In the EU, 20 species (7.6%) were also assessed as DD. When more data become available, it is possible that many of these species may also prove to be threatened. Thus, the proportion of threatened species could lie between 43.9% (if all DD species are not threatened) and 53.4% (if all DD species are threatened) for Europe, and between 44.5% and 52.4% for the EU.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8681c16-a3f2-4c9a-b434-33de4b24b2fd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8681c16-a3f2-4c9a-b434-33de4b24b2fd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-selected-endemic-shrubs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "European Red List of selected endemic shrubs ", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-selected-endemic-shrubs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad00b684c17c41efbd8221c029e3e9c28c6462f2cdbcc6a788683e645ba5d6ce"}, "2": {"node_id": "62af92bc-e03b-4077-8d81-be0ffabd4ae3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/european-red-list-selected-endemic-shrubs", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "507e3c7980085b58cab5b6a8480a6981555805c6caafe3eba53db05dc73139de"}}, "hash": "437bc0398ab0ef3f8dadafe040bc5fc735e641672fb40159521a8689a07157fa", "text": "In Europe, 15.6% of species have been assessed as Critically Endangered, 17.2% as Endangered and 11.1% as Vulnerable (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Additional European Red Lists assessing a selection of species showed that 57% of policy plants (Bilz et al., 2011), 22% of terrestrial molluscs (Cuttelod et al., 2011), 18% saproxylic beetles (C\u00e1lix et al., 2018; Nieto and Alexander, 2010), and 16% of crop wild relatives (Bilz et al., 2011) are also threatened. Thus, the European endemic shrubs represent one of the most threatened plant groups in Europe assessed so far, with only a smaller percentage of threatened species than the freshwater molluscs (58%) and the \u201cpolicy plants\u201d (57%; species that are listed under the four European or international policy instruments of relevance to plants; the Habitats Directive, the Bern Convention, CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), and Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora). This high level of threat of endemic shrubs is in part explained by the high number of species with restricted ranges, restricted population sizes (number of mature individuals), or both (see Figure 6). For example, of the 115 species assessed as threatened, 75 are island-endemics species (i.e., restricted to one or more islands in the European Macaronesian and Mediterranean islands). Another example are the 20 species within the Sorbus genus, where 13 of the 14 species for which sufficient data exist qualify as threatened due to their small population size. Figure 1.

Landslides, which can be exacerbated by vegetation clearance, as well as by increased rainfall and changes in rainfall occurrence, clear large areas of top soil affecting nutrient distribution and soil depth as well as physically damaging shrubs that are in the way of flows. In addition, an important threat that requires further research is climate change which currently affects 13.7% of all shrub species (36 species), but this may have a growing impact as weather extremes become more common. Climate change effects can interact with other threats leading to cumulative negative consequences. These types of relationships are important to understand especially with respect to existing major threats such as invasive alien and problematic native species, fire, and landslides. It is clear from these analyses that the threats facing shrub species are diverse. There is marked overlap between the threats to threatened and not threatened species, but the differences between species also highlight the need for context specific conservation initiatives required to protect endemic European shrubs. Sorbus pauca (CR) \u2013 is a shrub endemic to northern Bohemia in the Czech Republic. It grows on dry stony slopes and cliffs within xerophilious vegetative areas. The species has been assessed as Critically Endangered because it has a very small range as it only occurs in one location where habitat is declining in both extent and quality. \u00a9 Martin Lep\u0161i CRITICALLY ENDANGERED CR 7 Population Trends Population trend data provides key information when assessing the Red List status of a species. Therefore, as part of the Red List process, the trend of the overall population was assessed as either declining, stable, increasing or unknown. Over a third of species in this report have an unknown population trend highlighting the need for increased monitoring and research surrounding European shrubs. Of the assessed species, 24.6% (64 species) of shrub populations are thought to be in decline, while 36.7% are considered stable (97 species), and 4.2% (11 species) are increasing (Figure 4). For over a third of the species (90 species), the population trend is unknown, and 36.6% of these (33 species) are threatened. Figure 4. Population trends of selected European endemic shrub species. Decreasing Unknown Increasing Stable 34.5% 24.6% 4.2% 36.7% Spatial Distribution Patterns The spatial distribution patterns of the selected European endemic shrubs are shown in Figures 5 (overall species richness), 6 (threatened (VU, EN and CR) species) and 7 (Data Deficient species). As might be expected, mountain areas exhibit the highest levels of overall species richness (Fig. 5). For example, the Cantabrian and Central Sierra ranges in Spain, the Alps, and the Apennines in Italy, and to a lesser extent the Carpathians. The European Macaronesian archipelago islands and the larger Mediterranean islands also have high levels of range-restricted endemic species. 8 Figure 6.

In southern Ukraine and South European Russia, the circumscription of Crataegus karadaghensis has recently undergone revision and its distribution is not well known. On Cyprus, Phlomis brevibracteata and P. cypria are both impacted by a range of threats, but with inadequate information on population size and trends. Figure 7. Distribution of selected European endemic shrubs assessed as Data Deficient. 10 Conservation Action The conservation assessments of the selected 262 endemic shrub species are critical to understanding the threats and status of shrubs across Europe. Increasing the information available on European shrub species enhances the capacity of conservation organisations to target action and resources. Increased targeting ensures more effective initiatives and a greater chance of successfully protecting biodiversity. This report highlights that the core effort of future conservation action to protect endemic European shrub species must target invasive alien and problematic native species. This threat affects almost a third of all assessed shrub species (31.7%, 83 species) analysed in this report. Understanding the dynamic nature of invasive species will be critical in developing eradication or control actions. Species- specific effects may highlight the complexity of these circumstances and highlight the detailed research needed to overcome these challenges. Invasive alien species need to be tackled in certain areas to prevent replacement of native flora by exotic species. The majority of the assessed shrubs that have been found to be threatened are present within Natura 2000 sites, however significant parts of their distributions do not occur within this protected area network. For example, the highly range-restricted species Coronilla talaverae has three known subpopulations, however only two of these occur within Natura 2000 sites. Across the European region, only one assessed species, Sideritis cypria (VU), has no part of its known range within a formal protected area. This species is endemic to the Kyrenia (Pentadaktylos) Mountain Range on Cyprus, and occurs within a proposed Important Plant Area, and the mountain range has also been proposed for inclusion within the Natura 2000 system. Livestock farming is causing widespread severe declines in shrub habitat extent and quality. To counteract this, improved management of protected areas should be implemented to prevent land use change as well as grazing damage within shrub habitat. In contrast, some species, such as Sorbus pauca and Genista cupanii, require management interventions to maintain open habitats to allow in sunlight or to encourage regeneration of the species. Further protected areas could be designated where threatened shrub diversity is high and to ensure that significant proportions of the distribution of range-restricted species are included within protected areas. Furthermore, livestock management policies outside of the protected area network must be carefully adapted to take into account shrub biodiversity. Policies must be put in place to guide and manage tourism activities and urban development, which also pose a significant risk to shrub populations. There is a clear need to promote further research into European shrubs especially concerning their population trends. Currently, over a third of shrub population trends remain unknown. It is therefore critical to continue to collect data to address the knowledge gaps surrounding endemic European shrubs. This extends to threats as well especially those that are likely to change over time. Climate change already affects a number of threatened species and continued research is needed to maintain a firm understanding of climate change and other threats to limit the risks they pose to endemic European shrubs. It is also important to note the fact that 41.2% of shrub species have populations that are either stable or increasing, showing that many species populations remain heathy. Many endemic shrub species have strong populations. These need to be monitored to ensure that expanding threats do not lead to declines in currently stable or growing populations. 11 Genista cilentina (EN) \u2013 is endemic to the Cilento National Park in southwestern Italy.

and Governance (BRIDGE) programme is a global programme of IUCN implemented in 15 shared river basins across the globe. The programme supports the capacities of countries sharing river or lake basins to implement effective water management arrangements through a shared vision, benefit-sharing principles and transparent and coherent institutional frameworks. In the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) region, the programme is funded by the Transboundary Rivers of South Asia (TROSA) programme of Oxfam Novib. The objective of the BRIDGE and TROSA programme is to support the development of inclusive government policies and practices at all levels through the application of hydrodiplomacy and international water law (IWL). The Ganges River Basin is shared by four countries: Bangladesh, China, India and Nepal. It is endowed with rich natural and human resources but is also one of the poorest regions in the world and vulnerable to natural disasters. The population density is high, and per capita water availability is among the lowest in the world. The Ganges Basin lacks a regional basin-level cooperation agreement to facilitate its joint management and address common challenges such as floods and climate change. However, there are four bilateral agreements on the Ganges River and its tributaries: the Kosi Agreement (1966), the Gandak Agreement (1964) and the Mahakali Treaty (1996) between India and Nepal; and the Ganges Treaty (1996) between Bangladesh and India. A number of studies appraising the provisions and implementation of these bilateral agreements are available online and some argue the need to strengthen them through the inclusion of international water law principles. None of the available literature, however, assesses the degree to which IWL principles have already been integrated into the existing agreements. This paper uses the 1997 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (UNWC) as a reference point to provide qualitative arguments and insight on the degree to which IWL principles have been mainstreamed. The UNWC is widely considered the most important IWL principle and has been in force since 2014. It is envisaged that this paper will help strengthen the existing legal framework for cooperation in the Ganges Basin through improved understanding of IWL principles among stakeholders, and by highlighting gap areas and opportunities to mainstream IWL into existing agreements in the Ganges Basin. The paper will be discussed and disseminated during capacity-building events and dialogues on hydrodiplomacy, and used a tool to build regional consensus for strengthening existing basin agreements and institutions in the GBM. It will be widely disseminated in the South Asian region, with particular focus on government departments, particularly those engaged in policymaking and negotiations on shared water governance. Considering that the principles of international water law, such as equity and no harm, have wider applications to conflict resolution at all levels, from regional to local, this paper will be disseminated to key government institutions linked to water resource planning and management and civil society organisations (CSOs) working at the provincial level in Bangladesh, India and Nepal. vi EXECUTIVE SUMMARY In 1997, the United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of International Watercourses (UNWC) entered into force. This was a milestone for the global management of transboundary waters and was a significant opportunity for countries and regions lacking cooperative management frameworks for shared waters. As a framework convention, the UNWC\u2019s central objective is to provide a flexible legal framework within which more specific basin and/or watercourse treaties can be developed, providing more nuanced governance mechanisms via context-specific provisions. None of the countries from the GBM Basin and/or South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) regions ratified the UNWC.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84f673de-c0c7-4638-9276-d8f834c34565": {"__data__": {"id_": "84f673de-c0c7-4638-9276-d8f834c34565", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "549524690a543e3083d50b3dd9a4e3efe2c5ca53cab9e3693a5c89e0d76ed647"}, "2": {"node_id": "04849aeb-c08a-43ea-b22c-257c5e65d767", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78a057ce02513d3917ae2530d4f0ebc5193b3424e341ecc00a3099ea2da1ab78"}}, "hash": "05f8fb66a9433e2a17ceccfad60b7572632c6a286233002faad7547c87f97cd3", "text": "The reasons for this include the perceived inability of the Convention to tackle the region\u2019s water problems, the low level of awareness about the Convention and its key substantive and procedural aspects.

Despite these challenges, the UNWC is widely regarded as the key document on international water law and provides clear guidance for the development of new water cooperation agreements.

Based on this comparative analysis, a conclusion and recommendations are provided in the final chapter. Among all the treaties analysed in this paper, the Ganges Treaty and the Mahakali Treaty, both signed in 1996, are contemporary to the UNWC and encapsulate the principles of cooperation, equitable and reasonable use, prior notification, no significant harm and other accepted IWL principles. However, this study has determined that they do not appear to be backed by the clear procedures and guidelines for operationalisation. Several weaknesses in the treaties have been found to lead to unilateral decision-making on shared river resources. The agreements between India and Nepal on the Gandak and Kosi Rivers are specific to infrastructural projects, and the Ganges Treaty between Bangladesh and India does not include all the countries in the Basin. Furthermore, this analysis also indicates that dispute resolution mechanisms are generally weak, and in many cases neither include a fixed timeline for resolution or are binding on the parties. Overall, this analysis suggests the UNWC could be a tool for strengthening existing agreements on the Ganges River and could support the development of basin-level agreements. vii ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS IUCN would like to thank Mr Shawahiq Siddiqui and Ms Shilpa Chohan, Advocates at the Supreme Court of India and founding Partners of the Indian Environment Law Organization in New Delhi, for undertaking the legal analysis.

The term is used interchangeably with \u2018treaty\u2019. Treaties are also known by a variety of differing names, ranging from International Agreements, Pacts, General Acts and Charters, through to Statutes, Declarations and Covenants. Customary laws: Long-established practices commonly accepted as correct rules of action at local, national and international levels. (see opinio juris). Customary water management laws: Group of non-formal norms and behaviours that are accepted by the community and that have endured over time in the society. Due diligence: The steps taken (including financial, legal, technical and administrative) by a state to reach a legal standard of care recognised in order to reasonably avoid committing harm to another state.

As a global convention, its central objective is to provide a flexible legal framework within which more specific basin and/or watercourse treaties can be developed, providing context-specific governance mechanisms. With the UNWC now enforceable, it is widely \u201canticipated to have a significant impact on water governance in trans-boundary river basins around the globe by bolstering the strength of regional treaties already in force, supporting the development of new agreements which are aligned to the internationally accepted water law principles, and by enhancing cooperation between states by inciting new states to accede to the Convention.\u201d1 1.1 BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW The UNWC is a pivotal convention for a number of reasons: it creates a strong framework for water governance arrangements and a basic common ground that enhances predictability and encourages reciprocity; codifies and clarifies existing norms and develops emerging principles of customary international water law; constitutes a model that can guide the interpretation of other treaties and the negotiation and drafting of future ones; and has informed the judgments of international and regional courts. One of the key accomplishments of the UNWC is the codification of the general principles and procedures of international water law that interact with each other in their implementation. The UNWC is the first legal instrument adopted at the universal level that clearly spells out the \u201cduty to cooperate\u201d as a core principle of international water law. 1.2 EVOLUTION The UNWC represents the culmination of nearly four decades of work on the codification of the progressive development of international water law. In 1959, Bolivia requested the United Nations (UN) General Assembly to examine legal problems relating to the utilisation and use of international rivers, leading to UN Resolution 1401(XIV). In 1963, the International Law Commission (ILC)2 was tasked with studying and codifying progressive development of the law on non-navigational uses of international watercourses, which became UN Resolution 2669(XXV). Following 20 years of work and 15 reports by eminent international jurists, the \u2018draft articles\u2019 for the UNWC were approved in 1994. Upon receiving the ILC\u2019s draft articles, the UN General Assembly decided to convene a working group to negotiate a convention on the basis of these articles. The 1 Litke & Rieu-Clarke, 4 Feb 2015 2 http://www.un.org/law/ilc/ working group met on two occasions in 1996 and 1997, prior to the UNWC being adopted on 21 May 1997 by 103 votes in favour, 26 abstentions and 3 votes against. It entered into force once the Convention was ratified by 35 countries. Viet Nam became the 35th country to ratify the Convention on 17 August 2014. 1.3 OVERVIEW The main purpose of the UNWC is to codify international norms relating to non-navigational uses of international watercourses. This is encapsulated in the Preamble with its stated aim to \u201censure the utilisation, development, conservation, management and protection of international watercourses and the promotion of the optimal and sustainable utilisation thereof for present and future generations\u201d and taking into account \u201cthe special situation and needs of developing countries.\u201d International rivers and transboundary ecosystems under the UNWC are referred to as \u2018watercourses\u2019, which has been legally defined to include all the connected surface and groundwater flowing into a common terminus.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6586169-e8d9-495e-8254-91610c48ab57": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6586169-e8d9-495e-8254-91610c48ab57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b87c403b321e8dc7deb255287544a277a350a884000a284d3404841820b9091a"}, "2": {"node_id": "9eb59e10-cfd1-4fa1-9886-378cfc0a49eb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ec042e632a94e0da1cd8eeb319d4cfef191baf0cff1b013811d6071f0c2fed61"}}, "hash": "302abde1ca14033a89030caa68b998896c78177ea90c199109ca2c7db150e643", "text": "This means the \u2018watercourse\u2019, as derived from Article 2(a) and (b) of the Convention, applies to rivers that cross international boundaries, including major and minor watercourses, their tributaries, and connected lakes and groundwater, even when these individual components are entirely located within a single state.

Ultimately, the term \u2018watercourse\u2019 was chosen and supported by states. However, many academics argue that the scope of \u2018watercourses\u2019 as defined by Art. 1(1) of the UNWC indirectly applies to land-based activities within a river basin, to the extent that such activities might be relevant for the use, protection and management of an international watercourse.3 1.4 PRINCIPLES The core of the UNWC Part II sets out general principles and includes what is regarded as the most significant provision in the whole text: \u2018Equitable and Reasonable Utilisation and Participation\u2019 (Articles 5 and 6). The Convention provides a detailed set of criteria for determining equitable and reasonable use irrespective of context, which include: (a) geographic, hydrographic, hydrological, climatic, ecological and other factors of a natural character; (b) the social and economic needs of the watercourse states concerned; (c) the population dependent on the watercourse in the watercourse state; (d) the effects of the use or uses of the watercourse in one watercourse state on other watercourse states; (e) existing and potential uses of the watercourse; (f) conservation, protection, development and economy of the water resources of the watercourse and the cost of measures taken to that effect; and (g) the availability of alternatives of comparable value to a particular planned or existing use. 3 http://www.unwatercoursesconvention.org/the-convention/part-i-scope/article-2-use-of-terms/2-1-2-international- watercourse/ Significantly, the UNWC is the first legal instrument adopted at the universal level that clearly spells out the duty to cooperate as a general principle of international water law (Art. 8). It further defines that cooperation shall be based on principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, mutual benefit and good faith. To support cooperative development of the basin, states are obligated \u201cto take all appropriate measures\u201d (Art. 7) to utilise an international watercourse so as not to cause significant harm to another riparian state. 1.5 PROCEDURES Part III of the UNWC provides procedural guidelines, including an obligation of prior notification that must be followed when initiating any new planned measures in one state that may have significant detrimental impacts on other riparian states sharing the watercourse. It then outlines the environmental provisions by laying out the unqualified obligation for states to \u201cprotect and preserve the ecosystems of international watercourses\u201d (Art. 20). The UNWC also outlines duties whereby states must immediately notify other states of emergency situations that pose an imminent threat to the basin states. These include both natural threats such as floods, ice breakage, landslides or earthquakes, and manmade threats such as industrial accidents (Articles 27 and 28). Finally, it provides for dispute resolution procedures, allowing a state to pursue judicial and/or administrative procedures against another, and makes automatic dispute resolution procedures compulsory if negotiations are not settled within six months (Articles 32 and 33). Annexes to the UNWC outline specific processes such as Arbitration (Annex II). 1.6 ADOPTION AND ENTRY INTO FORCE The UNWC was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1997 as a total of 103 UN Member States voted in its favour. Only three countries voted against: Burundi, China and Turkey. Among the countries sharing the Ganges River, Nepal and Bangladesh (upper and lower riparian respectively) voted in favour of the UNWC, while India (a middle and upper riparian state) abstained from voting. It took 17 years, until 2014, for the Convention to get the minimum of 35 ratifications required for it to come into force. There are various reasons for this delay. First, the Convention has no secretariat or any specific entity to push for its ratification. The timing of its adoption is also a factor; the 1990s are referred to as the \u201cdecade of treaty congestion,\u201d with the global focus around the ratification of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the Kyoto Protocol.

The agreements on the Kosi and Gandak Rivers were first signed in the 1950s, and the Mahakali Treaty was ratified in 1996. These Agreements were not inspired by any visions of basin-level cooperation; they were conceived by India and Nepal to solve specific problems, such as those related to flooding, or to jointly develop multipurpose dam projects. 2.1 THE REVISED AGREEMENT ON THE KOSI PROJECT BETWEEN NEPAL AND INDIA, 1966 2.1.1 EVOLUTION The Kosi is a transboundary tributary of the Ganges River. It is 720km long from its origin to confluence with Ganges River, and drains an area of about 74,500km2, which includes part of China (Tibet), India (Bihar) and Nepal. The Kosi River Basin is prone to flooding and is a highly meandering river. The Kosi Project was sanctioned by the government of India in 1953 and then endorsed by the government of Nepal, followed by the signing of the agreement in 1954.5 The Kosi Project was the first joint venture between India and Nepal on a shared river and was presented as a mutually beneficial Multipurpose Scheme for both countries on flood control, irrigation and hydropower. However, due to criticism of the Kosi Project Agreement, particularly in Nepal, it was amended in 1966. 2.1.2 OVERVIEW The Amended Agreement between His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal and the Government of India concerning the Kosi Project, 1966, (the Revised Kosi Agreement) defines the understanding between India and Nepal on implementing the Kosi Project for flood control, irrigation, generation of hydroelectric power and erosion control by India in the territory of Nepal. Consisting of 16 Articles and the letters exchanged between the Parties, the Revised Kosi Agreement defines the terms and conditions for the surveys, investigations, construction, maintenance and operations of the Kosi Project, thus limiting the application of the Agreement to the rights, responsibilities and obligations of Parties with respect to the requirements of the project. 2.1.3 PRINCIPLES The Revised Kosi Agreement is based on the principles of \u2018cooperation\u2019 and \u2018common benefits\u2019. The Agreement clearly stipulates the rights and responsibilities of India and Nepal regarding the implementation of the Kosi Project. The Agreement implicitly recognises the concept of the \u2018river basin\u2019 when it refers to the soil conservation measures and afforestation in the catchment of the river 5For details on the origin of the Kosi Project, see Dinesh Kumar Mishra\u2019s \"Refugees of the Kosi Embankments,\" https://www.indiawaterportal.org/sites/indiawaterportal.org/files/refugees-of-kosi- embankments_dinesh-kumar-mishra.pdf in view of the \u201ccomplete solution to the \u2018Kosi problem\u2019 in future.\u201d Furthermore, Article 4 mentions the \u2018Kosi Basin\u2019 in reference to Nepal\u2019s right to withdraw water for irrigation or any other purpose. The Agreement is grounded in the well-established IWL principle of sovereignty. Although the Agreement allowed India to undertake construction and maintenance of the Kosi Project, there is clear recognition of Nepal\u2019s right to withdraw water for irrigation and to use the river and its tributaries for navigation and fisheries. 2.1.4 PROCEDURES The Agreement defines the procedures regarding the implementation of the Kosi Project, such as the authority of execution, royalties, land lease and compensation for use of land and the mechanism for dispute resolution. As per the Agreement, the land and properties acquired as part of the \u2018Kosi Project Area\u2019 were leased to India for 199 years. The Agreement also provides that in case of intentional (public or private) land submergence, India will need to secure the prior approval of the government of Nepal. The Agreement requires compensation be paid for four classes of land: a) cultivated land, b) forest land, c) village land and d) immovable property. Under the Agreement, Nepal is entitled to 50% of the total hydropower generated by any powerhouse situated within a 10 mile (16km) radius of the barrage site.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bbb0ce6-8f2a-4a97-9f21-2d125bada125": {"__data__": {"id_": "4bbb0ce6-8f2a-4a97-9f21-2d125bada125", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7284cd15f37220e538c413818b1b3466ac9bf439657629b92d51f60b4821dcee"}, "2": {"node_id": "0f6ef7bb-5e3e-4fa5-b15a-3787c09cbadf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "064ab876278c25ce80f582ed33e702354b69c903b11d6d425106d982d680e88a"}}, "hash": "2d8f8a5bf9bf35be0b2bdeef655432c8a91cf88e4b194a2442bb9daef6090c83", "text": "The construction of transmission lines up to a mutually agreeable point on the India-Nepal border is also the responsibility of the Indian government.

However, the Agreement does not mention any timeline for resolving disputes. 2.1.5 ENTRY INTO FORCE The Kosi Agreement came into force soon after it was signed in 1954. By the time it was revised in 1966, most of the works related to the Kosi Project had already been completed, a fact noted in the Preamble of the Revised Agreement. The Kosi Project and the Agreement had been contentious since the very beginning and were criticised in both India and Nepal. The objections raised in Nepal were on the grounds of the extraterritorial nature of the project, submergence of fertile land in Nepal, and unfair compensation. Though the Kosi Project (the main barrage) is under the territorial jurisdiction of Nepal, the Agreement does not envisage any role for the government agencies and institutions of Nepal in project implementation. All practical and operational measures, from project surveys to soil conservation and afforestation programmes to solve the Kosi flood problem, are to be decided by the State Government of Bihar (India) through a designated Chief Engineer of the Kosi Project. In India, the Kosi Project has been criticised for its inability to solve the flood problem in the state of Bihar. The Kosi Agreement is therefore not regarded as progressive or adequate to manage such a dynamic river system as the Kosi for the permanent solution of flooding. There is a clear need to broaden the focus of the Agreement to include a basin-level approach and foster cooperation between India and Nepal to implement integrated river basin management approaches. 2.2 THE AGREEMENT ON THE GANDAK IRRIGATION AND POWER PROJECT, 1959 (REVISED 1964) 2.2.1 EVOLUTION The Gandak River, also known as the Narayani or Gandaki, is one of the major rivers in Nepal and a left bank tributary of the Ganges in India. It has a total catchment area of 46,300km2, most of it in Nepal. The Agreement between His Majesty's Government of Nepal and the Government of India on the Gandak Irrigation and Power Project, 30 April 1964 (the Gandak Agreement) was concluded to operationalise the Irrigation and Power Project on the Gandak River in Nepal. The Gandak Agreement was approved by the Planning Commission of India and endorsed by the government of Nepal, leading to its signing on 4 December 1959. The Agreement was revised to address the concerns raised by Nepal and the revised Agreement was ratified in 1964. 2.2.2 OVERVIEW The Gandak Agreement concerns the surveys and investigations for the construction, maintenance and operations of the Gandak Project. This includes the construction of a barrage and a system of irrigation and water distribution canals in Nepal where the Gandak River forms the boundary with India. The Gandak Agreement also includes provisions for India to construct a 15,000kW hydro-dam and transmission lines to share power between the two countries. 2.2.3 PRINCIPLES Similar to the Kosi Agreement, the Gandak Agreement is based on the principles of enhancing the \u2018common interests\u2019 or \u2018common benefits\u2019 derived from the Gandak River by developing a barrage, irrigation canal infrastructure and hydropower. Significantly, Nepal\u2019s riparian rights and prior use rights to the Gandak River are respected so long as they do not give preference to the water requirements of the Gandak Project. The sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Nepal with respect to the lands made available to India for survey and investigation remains unimpaired under the Agreement. 2.2.4 PROCEDURES The Gandak Agreement mentions procedures related to surveys, investigations, authorisation, land acquisition, land transfer, compensation and maintenance of primary, secondary and tertiary canal systems. The land acquired by the government of Nepal for the Gandak Project was to be transferred to the government of India for a one-time fee and additional land required for maintenance work etc. would be compensated on a case-by-case basis and mutually agreed upon. The Gandak Agreement includes a provision to deal with accidents caused by damage to any Gandak Project structure (Art. 2(ii)).

The second is the low level of involvement by Nepalese institutions in the design, development and the maintenance of the project, except for the tertiary canal system, which had been handed over to Nepal after the project was completed. On the Indian side, the Gandak project is regarded as obsolete; it supplies water when it is not needed and does not serve the areas which are most water scarce. 2.3 THE MAHAKALI TREATY, 1996 2.3.1 EVOLUTION The Treaty of His Majesty's Government of Nepal and the Government of India concerning the Integrated Development of the Mahakali River Including Sarada Barrage, Tanakpur Barrage and Pancheshwar Project, 12 February 1996 (the Mahakali Treaty) was negotiated against the backdrop of the 1920 Agreement on Sarada Barrage (Mahakali is known as \u2018Sarada\u2019 in India) and the 1991 Agreement on Tanakpur Barrage between India and Nepal on the Mahakali River System. Nepal was not satisfied with its share of water under the Sarada Agreement. To address Nepal\u2019s concerns, and to find an alternative to the aging Sarada barrage, India and Nepal signed an Agreement for the construction of Tanakpur Barrage in December 1991. As per the Agreement, Nepal would provide India with land for the construction of Tanakpur barrage. In exchange, India agreed to share water with Nepal for irrigation. India also agreed to supply 10mW of electricity from the Tanakpur power station to Nepal, free of charge, as a \"goodwill\" gesture. 2.3.2 OVERVIEW As indicated in the preamble, the Mahakali Treaty represents the desire of India and Nepal to jointly develop the Mahakali River\u2019s water resources. The Treaty defines the obligation of parties and their corresponding rights and duties. The Treaty addresses the concerns in the Agreements on the Sarada Barrage (Art. 1) and defines the modalities for land transfer for the construction of the Tanakpur Barrages (Art. 2). The Treaty also provides a framework for the joint development and implementation of the Pancheshwar Multipurpose Project (PMP) on the stretch of the river forming the boundary between the two countries. The Treaty can be regarded as an improvement on earlier treaties between India and Nepal, as it acknowledges the need for integrated development of the Mahakali Basin and provides a mechanism to establish a Mahakali River Commission. 2.3.3 PRINCIPLES The Treaty\u2019s preamble highlights the determination of the parties to cooperate to develop the Mahakali River\u2019s water resources, stated as a \u201cduty to cooperate.\u201d The Treaty includes principles of reasonable and equitable utilisation, expressed through the provision of equal entitlement to Mahakali water and through the joint development of the PMP to enhance hydropower, irrigation and flood control in each country. The Mahakali Treaty is the only treaty in South Asia that acknowledges the significance of river ecosystems (Art. 1(2)) and includes a provision for maintaining minimum flow in the Mahakali River (Art. 7). In addition, the water needs of communities is acknowledged (Art. 7), and the Treaty clarifies that maintenance of minimum flow shall not preclude the use of water by communities. There is explicit recognition of the no harm principle. The Treaty also provides for the establishment of a Mahakali River Commission guided by the principles of equality, mutual benefit and no harm to either party. 2.3.4 PROCEDURES The Treaty defines the procedures linked to Nepal\u2019s rights to the water from the Sarada Barrage (Art. 1) and to the transfer of 2.9ha of land (in Jimuwa Village) by Nepal to India for the construction of the eastern afflux bund of the Tanakpur Barrage (Art. 2). However, the major focus of the Treaty is on defining the modalities linked to the joint development of the PMP on the stretch of river forming a boundary between the two countries. The Pancheshwar Development Authority (PDA) has been established as a dedicated institutional mechanism composed of an equal number of members from each country, responsible for the joint development of the PMP (Art. 10).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc7f4788-39f3-489c-9a1c-29c0e8333716": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc7f4788-39f3-489c-9a1c-29c0e8333716", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e342632e15f2370831bb4858de7a3acf82b1309e024c0b788eeac1427bd4afbc"}, "2": {"node_id": "953554b6-3afd-4c92-988b-3c54bd0abc84", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a15d9de83c595527ff71ed392f891c4b983543f81819d514043b16013cd76d0d"}}, "hash": "7a3c906a07cb563d66c886438e12ebc81338ea814b2dcbe600cfa3afd2837d9f", "text": "10).

The implementation of the PMP has recently increased with the establishment of the PDA under Article 10. The PDA has been tasked with the preparation of a detailed project report (DPR) for the implementation of the PMP, but little has been discussed on the need for a Joint River Commission to support the integrated development of the basin. 3 AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BANGLADESH AND INDIA 3.1 THE GANGES TREATY, 1996 3.1.1 EVOLUTION Bangladesh and India signed a Treaty of Friendship in 1972 and established the Joint Rivers Commission (JRC). A statute defining the composition and functions of JRC was agreed and signed by two countries in Dhaka on 24 November 1972.. In 1977, both countries signed a five-year agreement to share the Ganges waters at Farakka and to augment the river\u2019s flow in the dry season (1 January to 31 May). In the 1978 JRC meeting, both India and Bangladesh shared their proposals for augmenting dry season flow. Bangladesh\u2019s proposal was to store water by constructing dams and reservoirs in upper parts of the Ganges Basin, mostly in Nepal; India\u2019s proposal was to make an inter-basin transfer6 of water from the Brahmaputra to the Ganges River system through canals, based on the assumption that the Brahmaputra had plenty of water and was mostly untapped. Neither of these proposals materialised, but the devastating floods of 1988 in Bangladesh re-emphasised the need for bilateral cooperation and the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty was signed in 1996. 3.1.2 OVERVIEW The Ganges Treaty marks an important advancement in the water governance relationship between the two countries, as the Treaty resolved the long-standing dispute over Ganges River water use during the dry season and was also the first time that a long-term (30-year) water governance agreement was signed by India and Bangladesh. The Treaty includes 12 Articles and two Annexes. Articles I to III are concerned with the division of volumes of water based on a formula described in Annex I. Articles IV to VII provide for the establishment of a joint Committee (JC) consisting of an equal number of representatives nominated by both governments. Articles VIII and IX highlight the desire of the two countries to work together on a water-sharing agreement. Articles X to XII are concerned with the periodic review of the Treaty, the water-sharing formula when no agreement is in force and the Treaty\u2019s entry into force. 3.1.3 PRINCIPLES The preamble mentions the term \u2018river basin\u2019 but the Treaty is for sharing volumes of water and does not account for the other values and uses of the river. It does not even take into consideration the uppermost riparian nation, Nepal, meaning that it neither takes a basin-level approach to river management nor factors in the effects of upstream use of the Ganges on water availability at the Farakka Barrage. There is no mention of basin-wide approaches to finding integrated solutions and increasing dry season flow. However, the Treaty under Articles IX and X clearly mentions that any future agreement on shared rivers between Bangladesh and India and future revisions of the Ganges Treaty shall be based on the principles of equity, fairness and no significant harm. 6 http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/profile_segments/gbm-IntIss_eng.stm 3.1.4 PROCEDURES Articles I, II and III and two Annexes of the Treaty define the formula for sharing quantities of water between India and Bangladesh during the dry season, from 1 January to 31 May. Article IV defines the main responsibility of the JC, which is to support the implementation of the Treaty. The JC is entrusted with ensuring the availability of daily water flow data from the Farakka Barrage (India) and the Hardinge Bridge (Bangladesh).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "decf510c-206b-44a4-bfa3-b9c2c1b7c51b": {"__data__": {"id_": "decf510c-206b-44a4-bfa3-b9c2c1b7c51b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a6b14969eaf3562f15c0e65aab8f194f78c3f3ee2b81cc73674797b40a98581"}, "2": {"node_id": "1c670399-773a-4490-9a80-875297fa6beb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b7ce2a0e34577bf105db0e5068899d1e66d351666c2f9b3fbcdb50fa53dc7fe1"}}, "hash": "3ea425206e48dc17d051fdc38b41f73225f7fb47f5996052fc24475ae80c917b", "text": "The JC is required to submit all data collected from the two locations and provide annual reports on the implementation of the Treaty to both governments.

Watercourse uses which affect navigation or which are affected thereby also fall within the scope of the Convention. Under the UNWC, \u201cwatercourse\u201d is defined as a river system including both surface water, which incorporates a river\u2019s tributaries, as well as groundwater, flowing into a common terminus (Article 2(a)). An \u201cinternational watercourse\u201d is one which falls within or touches the boundary of two or more states (Article 2(b)). A \u201cwatercourse state\u201d is a \u201cState Party to the present Convention in whose territory part of an international watercourse is situated or a Party that is a regional economic integration organization, in the territory of one or more of whose member states part of an international watercourse is situated\u201d (Article 2(c)). A \u201cregional economic integration organization\u201d is any regional inter-governmental institution which operates for the purposes of economic integration and development (Article 2(d)). The Kosi Agreement is for the implementation of the Kosi Project and not one that reflects an understanding between the countries to jointly manage the entire Kosi watercourse. The Agreement is about procedure and protocols to be followed for constructing the Kosi Barrage and for carrying out other civil works in the area acquired for the Kosi Project in Nepalese territory. Though its primary objective is to achieve flood control and other non-navigational uses of Kosi waters such as irrigation and hydropower, the Agreement does not define navigational rights in the Kosi in Nepal. The Agreement focuses on the Kosi Project rather than the Kosi River throughout its text and does not define the river and its tributaries as the Indo-Nepal Kosi Basin. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The scope of the Kosi Agreement is very limited compared to the UNWC definition of watercourses and nowhere defines the Kosi River Basin or the Kosi system. There is no mention of groundwater in the entire text of the Agreement, though there is mention of the tributaries of the Kosi River in Nepal with regard to Nepal\u2019s rights to this water. 4.1.2 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT The UNWC refers explicitly to the principle of sustainable development in its text. Article 24, which concerns the management of international watercourses, stipulates that \u201cWatercourse States shall, at the request of any of them, enter into consultations concerning the management of an international watercourse, which may include the establishment of a joint management mechanism.\u201d Articles 24(1) and 24(2) then state that \u201cfor the purposes of this article, \u2018management\u2019\u201d refers, in particular, to: (a) Planning the sustainable development of an international watercourse and providing for the implementation of any plans adopted; and (b) Otherwise promoting the rational and optimal utilization, protection and control of the watercourse.\u201d In this regard, the UNWC provides a legal reference point for the practical application and utilisation of the principle of sustainable development as it pertains to the planning and adoption of plans in the overall management of an international watercourse. The Agreement on the Kosi Project makes no explicit or implicit reference to the principle of sustainable development of the Kosi River or Kosi Basin.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e554646-d52a-496c-bc9e-b1cdafc15f43": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e554646-d52a-496c-bc9e-b1cdafc15f43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dd712cd6d103d093331f043675e67a5184c66e197238c56588b6202661c744a"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf7c3450-d41b-4e9a-bb2e-6e74e41add5b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2a3e0a705f1fa4f4e386bb43a407e399e6cdc8da6881662f4dca730c70fec284"}}, "hash": "5ce63e4e26b57c93c3a52a931c345eb5dff749e5ce7fbeb4f049d87beb5188b9", "text": "The Chief Engineer of the Kosi Project is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Treaty, carrying out surveys and investigations on storage dams or detention dams on the Kosi, and taking the soil conservation and afforestation measures required to completely solve flood problems in the Kosi Basin.

Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Kosi Agreement nowhere refers to \u2018sustainable management\u2019 of the Kosi Basin, whereas in the UNWC, the focus is on integrated basin-level development. \u2022 There are no control measures that would ensure the protection of the Kosi River. Soil conservation and afforestation, which are necessary for silt management and which ideally require joint planning and execution with upstream stakeholders (Nepal, in this case), were completely left to the Chief Engineer of the Kosi Project. As a result, the parties completely lack the obligation to ensure de-silting of the barrage and flood protection embankments. 4.1.3 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: EQUITABLE AND REASONABLE UTILISATION In the context of international watercourses, legal experts have determined that the term \u201cequitable\u201d within the UNWC and customary international law can be understood to mean \u201cthe equal right to use the water for beneficial purposes, rather than division into equal portions.\u201d The UNWC does not define what \u201cequitable and reasonable\u201d means in specific legal terms; instead, it provides guidance on how equitable and reasonable utilisation is to be determined in a practical sense by listing the major indicative factors to be considered when evaluating whether or not a new or increased use is consistent with the principle in Articles 5 and 6. The Kosi Agreement does not provide a framework for sharing or allocation of water. However, the Agreement seeks to acquire the benefits from the Kosi Project equitably. The Agreement also does not interfere with Nepal\u2019s prior usage rights of the Kosi River. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 There is no clear mention of equitable and reasonable criteria for determining the benefits from the Kosi Project within the context of Article 6 of the UNWC. This can be attributed to the lack of guidance and scientific calculation of benefits from the Kosi Project at the time of conception and implementation. The Kosi Agreement would benefit from guidance provided by Article 6 of the UNWC to reassess the uses of the Kosi Basin resources and the Kosi Project. 4.1.4 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: OBLIGATION NOT TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM (AND RELATED DUTY TO PROTECT ECOSYSTEMS) Article 7 of the UNWC deals in detail with the general obligation not to cause significant harm. It begins by stating that \u201cWatercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States\u201d (Article 7(1)). Directly related to this general obligation, Article 7(2) goes on to specify that \u201cwhere significant harm nevertheless is caused to another watercourse State, the States whose use causes such harm shall, in the absence of agreement to such use, take all appropriate measures, having due regard for the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, in consultation with the affected State, to eliminate or mitigate such harm and, where appropriate, to discuss the question of compensation.\u201d It is this explicit reference to \u201chaving due regard\u201d that many legal experts consider as giving ultimate legal primacy to the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation over the obligation not to cause significant harm. Indeed, this direct reference \u201cin effect recognizes that, where it can be shown that significant harm occurs, but it can also be proven that such harm is equitable and reasonable, a State will be in compliance with international law\u201d and inter alia customary international law as codified within the UNWC. The Agreement does not include any type of \u2019no harm\u2019 rule. However, Article 3 includes safeguards in the implementation of the Kosi Agreement. Major construction work not envisaged in the amended plan (Amended Annex A) under the Agreement referred to in Clause 1(ii) requires the prior approval of the government of Nepal. After approval is received, then construction can be allowed to start Thus, in effect, the Agreement imposes an obligation of prior notification for new measures and puts in place a clearance mechanism by way of prior approval of the government for whose territory new construction measures are planned. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The references to safeguards are in Article 3 of the Kosi Agreement, which requires the prior approval of Nepal. The consultation mechanism, though weak, is present. However, the element of due diligence to eliminate or mitigate threats or imminent danger resulting from the planning and implementation of the Kosi Project is missing.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c67fdb7-ffea-4a21-9b0d-f397ebfe733d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c67fdb7-ffea-4a21-9b0d-f397ebfe733d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba689e90beaa0604dde12553277f415363fbb626a98c233d05d6101235fe7748"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a3f30be-249f-40aa-9d35-ab7ef45d8ca2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c7eb9ed2ad05928ff3feebae6b3eee41216d449b266e33b4e4cac7fdd4116156"}}, "hash": "2dd750f2f77023409246e6f7bd3ba30ea10d3481c9420ad4ec2c0a68f3e62819", "text": "\u2022 Compensation under the Kosi Agreement remains a very controversial issue.

The Kosi Agreement includes several provisions on cooperation and information exchange. However, this is specific to the Kosi Project and not any planned measures. The sovereignty rights and territorial jurisdiction of the government of Nepal, including the application and enforcement of the law of Nepal on issues linked to leasing of land, are unimpaired (Art. 5(5)). Regarding information exchange, the Agreement requires that all data, specimens, reports and other results of surveys and investigations carried out by or on behalf of the Government of India shall be made available to Nepal. In turn, Nepal is also obligated to share any relevant data upon India\u2019s request. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The sovereign equality of Parties is clearly mentioned in the text of the Kosi Agreement, and the data and information-sharing mechanism is detailed. However, the requirements for data sharing are narrow, only focusing on the project area in Nepal with no obligation for data sharing from any other part of the river in either India or Nepal. Information exchange under the Kosi Agreement is therefore reciprocal in a true sense. 4.1.6 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF PRIOR NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION AND NEGOTIATION (OVER PLANNED MEASURES) Article 11 of the UNWC requires Parties to exchange information, consult each other and, if necessary, negotiate plans with regard to their possible effects on the condition of a given international watercourse. Article 13(a) dictates that the state providing notification must allow six months for the notified state(s) to evaluate this information, carry out their own studies, and ultimately reply. With regard to consultations and negotiations, Article 17(1) dictates that where the notifying state has communicated via reply that they determine the planned measure is inconsistent with Articles 5 and/or 7, both the notifying and notified states are bound to \u201center into consultations and, if necessary, negotiations with a view to arriving at an equitable resolution of the situation.\u201d In this regard, all states must engage in any consultations and negotiations \u201cin good faith [and] pay reasonable regard to the rights and legitimate interests of the other State\u201d (Article 17(2)). Obligations for notification and consultation can be found throughout the Kosi Agreement, but they pertain to the planned measures already agreed upon by the Parties. As per Article 3 of the Kosi Agreement, any major construction work which is not mentioned in the Agreement requires prior approval from Nepal. There is an obligation under the Agreement to acquire prior approval, notify Nepal and include them in various activities during the construction phase of the Project. However, no such obligation exists for the post-construction phase, which leaves a considerable gap in the implementation framework. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 Similar to the UNWC, the Kosi Agreement includes provisions for prior notification and approval for unplanned measures not listed in the Annexes of the Agreement. However, the scope of the prior notification and consultation clause of the Kosi Agreement is limited to the construction phase and for areas and territory not included in the plan, whereas the UNWC sets the overall procedural obligation to provide information and notification for all planned measures on a shared watercourse. 4.1.7 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES Article 33 of the UNWC, supported by the only Annex to the Convention\u2019s text, provides the UNWC legal framework for the settlement of disputes. Article 33(1) stipulates that in the absence of an applicable agreement, in the event of a dispute between two or more parties concerning the interpretation or application of the UNWC, states are obligated to \u201cseek a settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.\u201d State parties to the UNWC are bound by the subsequent provisions under Article 33.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b8df2c3-ea88-4594-97ba-943986d19392": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b8df2c3-ea88-4594-97ba-943986d19392", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf0325811130aafcfd76afcc35d7c85c96f9fac92b5493349b22f0bff4b2685b"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0ae4754-3c3b-42ea-a67a-8cef1d1eeac3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "09b2bf3a96ba79e8b7f5b12970eb8383bd6135940612fa4390f9667c6da910f1"}}, "hash": "edc7c47ef6e759fd643aa4f2413a1db227eb967ef4f2cea9b465891e35846772", "text": "Article 33(2) dictates that if such parties to a dispute fail to reach an agreement via negotiation = they can then \u201cjointly seek the good office, or request mediation or conciliation by, a third party, or make use, as appropriate, of any joint water course institutions that may have been established by the agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration or to the International Court of Justice.\u201d Article 33(3) provides detailed timelines and procedures whereby, if after six months from the time a state party requests negotiations the parties to the dispute have failed to negotiate a solution, the dispute must \u201cbe submitted, at the request of any of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1dc93a1-e6ec-41b9-a653-d0b6aeade0e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b1dc93a1-e6ec-41b9-a653-d0b6aeade0e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f01da0bd4c6d85b47ec317c7048a189d15bb4842d94f435fa29cc3bfd5ea804d"}, "3": {"node_id": "f9649a57-8b5f-4519-9ee2-274830546477", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8e07bb0c3d0268d69b9a646720c4bd0fbad69a6876880d428dfbf9196138d43a"}}, "hash": "b5b780ec55ddb6a66fdf3ba07113b235314275dd9e7dbca5da13bca52b13a11a", "text": "parties to the dispute, to impartial fact- finding in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 9, unless the parties so otherwise agree.\u201d The legal role and relevance of impartial fact finding in the overall scheme of the UNWC dispute resolution procedures cannot be underestimated because it is largely unique to this framework agreement within the field of international water law and transboundary basin or river agreements. Furthermore, given the range of dispute settlement mechanisms provided by Article 33(2), it remains the only truly non-negotiable, binding procedure within the UNWC. The Kosi Agreement envisages that disputes be settled peacefully but does not clearly stipulate the level at which parties need to engage for settlement of such disputes. The Agreement states that \u201cin the event of disputes arising out of the construction of the Kosi Project or the interpretation of the meaning of this Agreement, or with respect to rights and liabilities of the parties hereunder, has to be first settled by discussion and then arbitration.\u201d The Agreement also stipulates how arbitration be carried out. If a dispute arises, any of the parties may give notice in writing to the other party of its intention to refer the dispute to arbitration. Upon the delivery of such notice, within 90 days, the two parties shall nominate an arbitrator. If the dispute is not resolved, the Agreement requires an umpire be appointed through mutual consultation. The umpire\u2019s decision shall be final and binding. The mechanism appears to be three-tiered but has inherent weaknesses. Firstly, the parties are not obligated to inform each other of their intention to go to arbitration. Secondly, the precise wording is that a dispute is to be \u201cdetermined,\u201d not resolved. If the parties fail to appoint arbitrators, then they are not obligated to settle the dispute by any other means. If an issue requires urgent attention, 90 days to nominate an arbitrator is too long. Failure of arbitration can lead to a total failure of the dispute mechanism, as it can be completely defeated if the two parties do not agree on the umpire they want to appoint. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Kosi Agreement does provide for a dispute settlement mechanism. With inherent weaknesses in the process as highlighted above, the mechanism is almost insignificant as the dispute can only be \u2018determined\u2019 and not necessarily resolved. The parties have no obligation to appoint an umpire in case of disagreement. Another major gap compared to UNWC is that countries under the Kosi Agreement have no locus standi to seek third party help if harm has been done. 4.2 THE UNWC AND THE GANDAK IRRIGATION AND POWER PROJECT, 1964 4.2.1 SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS UNWC, 1997 The Agreement between India on the Gandak Irrigation and Power Project, 1964 The UNWC applies to uses of international watercourses other than navigation and to measures for the purposes of \u201cprotection, preservation and management related to the uses of those watercourses and their waters\u201d (Article 1(1)). Watercourse uses which affect navigation or which are affected thereby, also fall within the scope of the Convention. Under the UNWC, \u201cwatercourse\u201d is defined as a river system including both surface water, which incorporates a river\u2019s tributaries, as well as groundwater, flowing into a common terminus (Article 2(a)) ; \u201cInternational Watercourse\u201d is one which falls within or touches the boundary of two or more states (Article 2(b)) ; \u201cwatercourse state\u201d is a \u201cState Party to the present Convention in whose territory part of an international watercourse is situated or a Party that is a regional economic integration organization, in the territory of one or more of whose member states part of an international watercourse is situated\u201d (Article 2(c)) ; and a \u201cregional economic integration organization\u201d is any regional inter- governmental institution which operates for the purposes of economic integration and development (Article 2(d)). The Gandak Agreement is for the implementation of the Gandak Irrigation and Power Project with no basin focus.

Article 24, concerns the management of international watercourses. It stipulates that \u201cWatercourse States shall, at the request of any of them, enter into consultations concerning the management of an international watercourse., which may include the establishment of a joint management mechanism\u201d (Articles 24(1) and 24(2)), and then states that \u201cfor the purposes of this article, \u2019management\u2019 refers, in particular, to: (a) Planning the sustainable development of an international watercourse and providing for the implementation of any plans adopted; and (b) Otherwise promoting the rational and optimal utilization, protection and control of the watercourse.\u201d In this regard, the UNWC provides a legal reference point for the practical application and utilisation of the principle of sustainable development as it pertains to the planning and adoption of plans in the overall management of an international watercourse. The Agreement on the Gandak Project does not make explicit or implicit reference to the principle of sustainable development of the Gandak River Basin. Quarrying in the Project area for the construction and maintenance of the Project can be carried out after obtaining permission from Nepal and paying rental fees on the area (Art. 4). Though the Agreement includes post-project maintenance it does not envisage any sustainability plan for the development of integrated basin management approaches. Compatibility and gaps The Gandak Agreement nowhere refers to \u2018sustainable management\u2019 of the Gandak River Basin and its resources. 4.2.3 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: EQUITABLE AND REASONABLE UTILISATION In the context of international watercourses, legal experts have determined that the term \u201cequitable\u201d within the UNWC and customary international law can be understood to mean \u201cthe equal right to use the water for beneficial purposes, rather than division into equal portions.\u201d The UNWC does not define what \u201cequitable and reasonable\u201d means in specific legal terms; it instead provides guidance on how equitable and reasonable utilisation is to be determined in a practical sense by listing the major indicative factors to be considered when evaluating whether or not a new or increased use is consistent with the principle in Articles 5 and 6. The Treaty nowhere defines equitable and reasonable utilisation but does include an agreed- upon formula for sharing irrigation and hydropower benefits. However, due to the limited scope of the Treaty, the focus of benefit-sharing is limited to those from the Gandak Project itself. Under the Gandak Agreement, the beneficial uses of water for consumptive and non-navigational uses arising from the Project should be shared equitably. The Agreement also does not interfere with upstream Nepal\u2019s prior usage rights in the Gandak River. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 Article 6 of the UNWC provides practical guidance for determining equitable and reasonable use, but in the Gandak Agreement, the scope of benefit sharing is limited to benefits derived from the Gandak Project. 4.2.4 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: OBLIGATION NOT TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM (AND RELATED DUTY TO PROTECT ECOSYSTEMS) Article 7 of the UNWC deals in detail with the general obligation not to cause significant harm. It begins by stating that \u201cWatercourse States shall, in utilising an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States\u201d (Article 7(1)). Directly related to this general obligation, Article 7(2) goes on to specify that \u201cWhere significant harm nevertheless is caused to another watercourse State, the States whose use causes such harm shall, in the absence of agreement to such use, take all appropriate measures, having due regard for the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, in consultation with the affected State, to eliminate or mitigate such harm and, where appropriate, to discuss the question of compensation.\u201d It is this explicit reference to \u201chaving due regard\u201d that many legal experts consider as giving ultimate legal primacy to the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation over the obligation not to cause significant harm. Indeed, this direct reference \u201cin effect recognizes that, where it can be shown that significant harm occurs, but it can also be proven that such harm is equitable and reasonable, a State will be in compliance with international law\u201d and inter alia customary international law as codified within the UNWC.

There is also no mention of a post-project compensation mechanism. Only compensation for the lands acquired has to be given at the time of acquisition. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Gandak Agreement has much to learn from the UNWC on the no harm principle and its substantive and procedural dimensions. 4.2.5 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF COOPERATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE The overarching duty to cooperate is encapsulated in Article 8 of the UNWC where it obliges watercourse states to \u201ccooperate on the basis of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, mutual benefit and good faith in order to attain optimal utilisation and adequate protection of an international watercourse\u201d (Article 8(1)). The principle of \u2018cooperation\u2019 runs throughout the text of the Gandak Agreement in various activities linked to the implementation and operation of the Gandak Project, such as investigation and surveys (Art. 1), execution and maintenance (Art. 2), land acquisition (Art. 3), communication (Art. 5), and irrigation and power development (Articles 7 and 8). Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Gandak Agreement promotes cooperation between the states on the issue of joint investigation, as well as during the construction and operation of the Project. Comparing the provisions of the Treaty with the elements of cooperation as envisaged under the UNWC, the territorial integrity of the Parties is unimpaired, and the mutual benefits are articulated as common interest and common benefit. 4.2.6 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF PRIOR NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION AND NEGOTIATION (OVER PLANNED MEASURES) Article 11 of the UNWC obliges states to: exchange information, consult each other and, if necessary, negotiate on the possible effects of planned measures on the condition of an international watercourse. Article 13(a) dictates that the state providing notification must allow six months for the notified state(s) to evaluate this information, carry out their own studies, and ultimately reply. With regard to consultations and negotiations, Article 17(1) dictates that where the notifying state has communicated via reply that they determine the planned measure is inconsistent with Articles 5 and/or 7, both the notifying and notified states are bound to \u201center into consultations and, if necessary, negotiations with a view to arriving at an equitable resolution of the situation.\u201d In this regard, all states must engage in any consultations and negotiations \u201cin good faith [and] pay reasonable regard to the rights and legitimate interests of the other State\u201d (Article 17(2)). In the Gandak Agreement, notification and consultation runs concurrent to the implementation of planned measures during the construction phase. Following construction, there is very little scope for notification, consultation or negotiation. A majority of issues that would ordinarily require notification are agreed upon in the Treaty itself with the responsibility of prior notification resting with the Chief Engineer of the Gandak Project. For post-construction and maintenance of the Project, all activities, even in the instance of an anticipated accident, are already authorised by Nepal, negating any need or possibility for any kind of prior notification. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 There is no obligation on either party to notify or consult each other on any aspects of the Gandak River after the Gandak Project is completed. The only platform to raise any issue remains the Joint Kosi and Gandak Committee, which meets from time to time. 4.2.7 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES Article 33 of the UNWC, supported by the only Annex to the Convention\u2019s text, provides the UNWC legal framework for the settlement of disputes. Article 33 (1) stipulates that in the absence of an applicable agreement, in the event of a dispute between two or more parties concerning the interpretation or application of the UNWC, states are obligated to \u201cseek a settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.\u201d State parties to the UNWC are bound by the subsequent provisions under Article 33.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbce2de7-f1b1-4099-a06b-9df8ad235a02": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbce2de7-f1b1-4099-a06b-9df8ad235a02", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a5b4397dd6b9a574384119d64c99876870e41ee18a5bb27aa147f70194d2302"}, "2": {"node_id": "01986726-138c-4881-900a-ae55495eaa1b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b8a731fb3c2131eeee40abf10a3f6cad956505b1d454145f7d167ebcac7602eb"}}, "hash": "61944762cb10450a8638d84139be0441fa813002cb9867cb90b907aa557240b9", "text": "Article 33 (2) dictates that if such parties to a dispute fail to reach an agreement via negotiation requested by one (or more of them in the case of multiple parties) they can then \u201cjointly seek the good office, or request mediation or conciliation by a third party, or make use, as appropriate, of any joint water course institutions that may have been established by the agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration or to the International Court of Justice.\u201d Article 33 (3) provides detailed timelines and procedures whereby, if after six months from the time of a state party requesting negotiations the parties to the dispute have failed to settle through negotiation or other means, the dispute must \u201cbe submitted, at the request of any of the parties to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c28a5c27-7174-4248-945e-fa0a918f61ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "c28a5c27-7174-4248-945e-fa0a918f61ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "244d4bc0f478f785f35b91d191df495d3bd3320155939064bebf0bb2e25fa0c4"}, "3": {"node_id": "399301d5-e55e-41ff-8498-14fc447d5018", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6a4a8fb038d33a1ec98c56e9e4895675574b3ae0f5e98aca036814b9b99cd2ed"}}, "hash": "afee1fddbc7905b36d82b9582bda789379c7b2b91786c055b4b893847ae4e3b6", "text": "the dispute, to impartial fact-finding in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 9, unless the parties so otherwise agree.\u201d The legal role and relevance of impartial fact-finding in the overall scheme of the UNWC dispute resolution procedures cannot be underestimated because it is largely unique to this framework Agreement within the field of international water law and transboundary basin/river agreements. Furthermore, given the range of dispute settlement mechanisms provided via Article 33 (2), it remains the only truly non- negotiable, binding procedure within the UNWC. The Gandak Agreement provides for resolution of disputes concerning the construction of the Project or interpretation of the Treaty through discussion (peaceful means). In case the dispute is not resolved, either party can inform the other in writing about their intention to refer a dispute for arbitration. If the case is selected for arbitration, each party must nominate its arbitrator, whose decision would be final and binding. In case the arbitrators are unable to agree, then the parties, after due consultation, would appoint an umpire, whose decision would be final and binding. The provision of a neutral arbitrator is similar to the independent fact-finding mission as defined under the UNWC. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 Unlike the UNWC, the Gandak Agreement has no binding dispute-settlement mechanism. Any dispute between the Parties on the construction, effect or meaning of the Agreement needs to settle it by discussion or arbitration. However, there is no time limit defined within which the parties should resolve the dispute. 4.3 THE UNWC AND THE MAHAKALI TREATY, 1996 4.3.1 SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS UNWC The Mahakali Treaty, 1996 The UNWC applies to uses of international watercourses other than navigation and to measures for the purposes of \u201cprotection, preservation and management related to the uses of those watercourses and their waters\u201d (Article 1(1)). Watercourse uses which affect navigation, or which are affected thereby, also fall within the scope of the Convention. Under the UNWC, \u201cwatercourse\u201d is defined as a river system including both surface water, which incorporates a river\u2019s tributaries, as well as groundwater, flowing into a common terminus (Article 2(a)) ; \u201cinternational watercourse\u201d is one which falls within or touches the boundary of two or more states (Article 2(b)) ; \u201cwatercourse state\u201d is a \u201cState Party to the present Convention in whose territory part of an international watercourse is situated or a Party that is a regional economic integration organization, in the territory of one or more of whose member states part of an international watercourse is situated\u201d (Article 2(c)) ; and a \u201cregional economic integration organization\u201d is any regional inter-governmental institution which operates for the purposes of economic integration and development (Article 2(d)). The Mahakali Treaty is for non-navigational uses and the integrated development of the Mahakali River. The Treaty\u2019s preamble clearly acknowledges the transboundary nature of the Mahakali River by recognising it as a boundary river between the two countries. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The scope of the definition of watercourses is very limited under the Mahakali Treaty. There is no acknowledgement of the tributaries of the Mahakali River, and the focus is on the stretch of river forming the boundary between India and Nepal. 4.3.2 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT The UNWC refers explicitly to the principle of sustainable development in its text. Article 24, which concerns the management of international watercourses, stipulates that \u201cWatercourse States shall, at the request of any of them, enter into consultations concerning the management of an international watercourse, which may include the establishment of a joint management mechanism\u201d (Articles 24(1) and 24(2)), and then states that \u201cfor the purposes of this article, \u2019management\u2019\u201d refers, in particular, to: (a) Planning the sustainable development of an international watercourse and providing for the implementation of any plans adopted; and (b) Otherwise promoting the rational and optimal utilization, protection and control of the watercourse.\u201d In this regard, the UNWC provides a legal reference point for the practical application and utilisation of the principle of sustainable development as it pertains to the planning and adoption of plans in the overall management of an international watercourse.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "399301d5-e55e-41ff-8498-14fc447d5018": {"__data__": {"id_": "399301d5-e55e-41ff-8498-14fc447d5018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "244d4bc0f478f785f35b91d191df495d3bd3320155939064bebf0bb2e25fa0c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "c28a5c27-7174-4248-945e-fa0a918f61ac", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afee1fddbc7905b36d82b9582bda789379c7b2b91786c055b4b893847ae4e3b6"}}, "hash": "6a4a8fb038d33a1ec98c56e9e4895675574b3ae0f5e98aca036814b9b99cd2ed", "text": "The Mahakali Treaty refers to the ecological needs of the river and acknowledges the need to preserve the river ecosystem (Art. 1(2)).

The Commission is tasked with making recommendations to both Parties for the conservation and utilisation of the Mahakali River. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 In effect, the Mahakali Treaty does have very clear provisions to ensure sustainable development of the river basin within the meaning of Article 24 of the UNWC. There are elements within the Treaty that can be collectively interpreted to provide a framework to address ecological aspects of the river. For example, there is an acknowledgement of the need to preserve the river ecosystem and not to obstruct or divert the natural flow of the river. However, these are not supported by clear procedural guidelines. 4.3.3 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: EQUITABLE AND REASONABLE UTILISATION In the context of international watercourses, legal experts have determined that the term \u201cequitable\u201d within the UNWC and customary international law can be understood to mean \u201cthe equal right to use the water for beneficial purposes, rather than division into equal portions.\u201d The UNWC does not define what \u201cequitable and reasonable\u201d means in specific legal terms; it instead provides guidance on how equitable and reasonable utilisation is to be determined in a practical sense by listing the major indicative factors to be considered when evaluating whether or not a new or increased use is consistent with the principle in Articles 5 and 6. Under the Mahakali Treaty, the Parties are equally entitled to utilise the Mahakali River without prejudice to their respective existing consumptive uses of the waters (Art. 3). In addition to the equal entitlement clause, the Treaty also provides for a joint approach to the development and utilisation of the water resources through the establishment of the Mahakali River Commission (Art. 9). As per the Treaty, the water requirements of Nepal are given priority consideration (Art. 5). However, it is not clear whether this priority consideration is to be given with respect to existing or future utilisation. The Treaty entitles each Party to draw an equal share of water from specified and mutually agreed- upon points (Art. 5). Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The UNWC and Mahakali Treaty are compatible as far as the \u2018equal rights\u2019 of watercourse states to consume water for beneficial use is concerned. The Mahakali Treaty respects the consumptive use of both countries but does not mention whether it is the consumptive use at the time of ratification or also includes future use, making it difficult to apply the criteria for determining equitable and reasonable utilisation as defined by Article 6 of the UNWC. 4.3.4 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: OBLIGATION NOT TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM (AND RELATED DUTY TO PROTECT ECOSYSTEMS) Article 7 of the UNWC deals in detail with the general obligation not to cause significant harm. It begins by stating that \u201cWatercourse States shall, in utilising an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States\u201d (Article 7(1)). Directly related to this general obligation, Article 7(2) goes on to specify that \u201cWhere significant harm nevertheless is caused to another watercourse State, the States whose use causes such harm shall, in the absence of agreement to such use, take all appropriate measures, having due regard for the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, in consultation with the affected State, to eliminate or mitigate such harm and, where appropriate, to discuss the question of compensation.\u201d It is this explicit reference to \u201chaving due regard\u201d that many legal experts consider as giving ultimate legal primacy to the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation over the obligation not to cause significant harm. Indeed, this direct reference \u201cin effect recognizes that, where it can be shown that significant harm occurs, but it can also be proven that such harm is equitable and reasonable, a State will be in compliance with international law\u201d and inter alia customary international law as codified within the UNWC. The Treaty obligates the Parties to protect the ecosystem of the Mahakali River. Firstly, downstream flow shall be maintained to protect the River ecosystem (Art. 1). Secondly, in order to maintain the flow and level of the waters of the Mahakali River, each Party has an obligation not to obstruct or divert its waters, except by agreement (Art. 7).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "431ff069-3a7d-494b-8a9c-f1f72ba769f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "431ff069-3a7d-494b-8a9c-f1f72ba769f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "51f864035787303cd6e6127a6aa2dddce5b17e62db00bb18ce0ea78760f7c659"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c06baaa-9c23-496b-b971-7c5128e7ebfa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9b56d160e06b2ab4acd678e42801e2ab33aad0b9f4bcb7eb89a7c5856fedd51"}}, "hash": "f74fa02df64786bccdb98a92cbb7002767e04d1b3afdee1d328fe09286036b42", "text": "7).

However, the provisions linked to the establishment of Mahakali River Commission has not been operationalised, leading to limited applicability of no harm principles at the basin level. There exists a joint platform in the form of the PDA, but it has a limited mandate that focuses on the implementation of the Pancheshwar Multi-purpose Project (Art. 9). 4.3.5 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF COOPERATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE The overarching duty to cooperate is encapsulated in Article 8 of the UNWC where it obliges watercourse states to \u201ccooperate on the basis of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, mutual benefit and good faith in order to attain optimal utilization and adequate protection of an international watercourse\u201d (Article 8(1)). All planned measures under the Mahakali Treaty are to be undertaken in the spirit of equal partnership. For the Pancheshwar Multi-purpose Project, the Treaty provides for a joint body, the Pancheshwar Development Authority, for the development of a detailed project report and the mobilisation of finances (Art. 3). Any measures on the stretch of river that forms the boundary between the two countries have to be implemented through a mutual agreement between the Parties (Art. 6). The Treaty provides for the Mahakali Commission to coordinate efforts between the governments for the integrated development of the basin. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 Both the UNWC and the Mahakali Treaty provide for information exchange as one of the measures to adhere to the overall obligation to cooperate. All the planned measures under the Mahakali Treaty are to be executed through joint efforts right from the planning stage. However, cooperation is only limited to the stretch of the river forming a boundary between India and Nepal. Both countries are free to unilaterally develop other parts of the river and its tributaries within their respective territory. 4.3.6 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF PRIOR NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION AND NEGOTIATION (OVER PLANNED MEASURES) Article 11 of the UNWC obliges states to: exchange information, consult each other and, if necessary, negotiate on the possible effects of planned measures on the condition of an international watercourse. Article 13(a) dictates that the state providing notification must allow six months for the notified state(s) to evaluate this information, carry out their own studies, and ultimately reply. With regard to consultations and negotiations, Article 17(1) dictates that where the notifying state has communicated via reply that they determine the planned measure is inconsistent with Articles 5 and/or 7, both the notifying and notified states are bound to \u201center into consultations and, if necessary, negotiations with a view to arriving at an equitable resolution of the situation.\u201d In this regard, all states must engage in any consultations and negotiations \u201cin good faith [and] pay reasonable regard to the rights and legitimate interests of the other State\u201d (Article 17(2)). The Mahakali Treaty promotes joint planning and implementation which inter alia requires notification, consultation and negotiations over planned measures. The parties are at liberty to form project- specific joint entities for the planning and execution of mutually beneficial projects (Art. 10). The Treaty also provides mechanisms for prior consultation and notification through the establishment of project- specific joint bodies (Art. 3) and the Mahakali Commission (Art. 9). Any future project on the stretch of the Mahakali River forming a boundary between the two countries needs to be designed and implemented by an agreement between the parties under the principles established by the Treaty (Art. 6). Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Treaty provides for operationalisation of the principles of notification and consultation through the formation of a Joint Commission. However, the scope of the Treaty is limited to the stretch of the river forming the boundary between India and Nepal and does not apply to the Mahakali Basin as a whole. The two countries are allowed to unilaterally develop the tributaries of the Mahakali River within their territory. 4.3.7 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES Article 33 of the UNWC, supported by the only Annex to the Convention\u2019s text, provides the UNWC legal framework for the settlement of disputes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ccfc786b-b2de-466e-9cf8-8a054af86212": {"__data__": {"id_": "ccfc786b-b2de-466e-9cf8-8a054af86212", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f89ea43a5d4bf83d01050b2bbf9c823c57f3277efb9f1fbff30c75f6f2ff80f6"}, "2": {"node_id": "604c0b08-8f33-4113-a06c-2857c0b97f8d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba771df3b49936e7b330c7ab8863784d1fe271a3da122691ec26398d59b718fa"}}, "hash": "f17c8f7a00c57b40e2691fa4a4d4609a9b64306b084800c2afab25be080a64f5", "text": "Article 33 (1) stipulates that in the absence of an applicable agreement, in the event of a dispute between two or more parties concerning the interpretation or application of the UNWC, states are obligated to \u201cseek a settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.\u201d State parties to the UNWC are bound by the subsequent provisions under Article 33.

Furthermore, given the range of dispute settlement mechanisms provided via Article 33 (2), it remains the only truly non- negotiable, binding procedure within the UNWC. The Mahakali Commission as an advisory body is given the responsibility to examine the differences between the Parties (Art. 9(3e)) and if it fails to resolve disputes then it is taken to a tribunal composed of three arbitrators (Art. 11), one nominated from each country and a neutral arbitrator nominated jointly but from different country. In the event of disagreement on the appointment of the neutral arbitrator, either party can, within 90 days, request the Secretary General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague to appoint a neutral arbitrator. The inclusion of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in this Article strengthens the dispute resolution mechanism of this Treaty. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The dispute settlement mechanism under the Treaty is more evolved and robust than all the previous Agreements on water resources between India and Nepal. However, the Treaty does not specify a timeline for resolving disputes by the Tribunal. Moreover, the proposed Mahakali River Commission, responsible for examining any disputes before sending them to the Tribunal, has yet to be established. 4.4 THE UNWC AND THE GANGES WATER SHARING TREATY, 1996 4.4.1 SCOPE AND DEFINITIONS UNWC The Ganges Water Sharing Treaty, 1996 The UNWC applies to uses of international watercourses other than navigation and to measures for the purposes of \u201cprotection, preservation and management related to the uses of those watercourses and their waters\u201d (Article 1(1)). Watercourse uses which affect navigation or which are affected thereby, also fall within the scope of the Convention. Under the UNWC \u201cwatercourse\u201d is defined as a river system including both surface water, which incorporates a river\u2019s tributaries, as well as groundwater, flowing into a common terminus (Article 2(a)) ; \u201cinternational watercourse\u201d is one which falls within or touches the boundary of two or more states (Article 2(b)) ; \u201cwatercourse state\u201d is a \u201cState Party to the present Convention in whose territory part of an international watercourse is situated or a Party that is a regional economic integration organisation, in the territory of one or more of whose member states part of an international watercourse is situated\u201d (Article 2(c)) ; and a \u201cregional economic integration organisation\u201d is any regional inter- governmental institution which operates for the purposes of economic integration and development (Article 2(d)). The Ganges Water Treaty is primarily concerned with the sharing of Ganges waters using average historical flows at the Farraka Barrage as the reference point. The preamble of the Treaty indicates the desire of the two countries to work together on the optimum utilisation of the Ganges River for non-navigational purposes such as flood management, irrigation, generation of hydropower and integrated development of the river basin for the mutual benefit of the people of the two countries (preamble). Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Ganges Treaty does not define the watercourse of the Ganges River as a system of surface and groundwater. The scope of the treaty is limited to the sharing of surface water, even though the preamble mentions the need for developing strategies to augment the flow of the Ganges river as a log-term solution for water scarcity in the mutual interests of the peoples of both Bangladesh and India.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "30d04358-31a0-463b-b3f4-8b51ce8aac08": {"__data__": {"id_": "30d04358-31a0-463b-b3f4-8b51ce8aac08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "851840c12d9f2946417f6ce22427efe372a9a42d9e451640fec0ca1003f0277a"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ff9c731-af37-433d-ab20-5fbfa89b4397", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c42dd08ad8c029bfab2172c97b63f612c06181d30d50d5febe0e8740c05fe68"}}, "hash": "1316b07e2ab15bb1c73475eba4604debdcc146d10bc32ef994531ab1ef9063ad", "text": "4.4.2 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT The UNWC refers explicitly to the principle of sustainable development in its text.

There is no mention of sustainable development in the text of the Ganges Water Treaty. However, the preamble indicates the desire of the two countries to work toward optimum utilisation of water resources in flood management, irrigation, river basin development, and hydropower generation for the mutual benefit of the people of both countries. The Ganges Treaty is primarily a water-sharing agreement for the volumetric allocation of water in the dry season. The Treaty establishes India\u2019s right to withdraw up to 40,000 cusecs of water at the Farakka Barrage between 1 January and 31 May every year. If availability at Farakka falls below 70,000 cusecs, the water will be divided equally between the two countries, while guaranteeing a minimum of 35,000 cusecs to each over alternating 10-day periods between 11 March and 10 May. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Ganges Treaty is primarily a water-sharing agreement. The preamble indicates the desires of the two countries to develop the basin for mutual benefit, though this is not backed by any provision or guidance on how to operationalise the joint and sustainable development of the basin. 4.4.3 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: EQUITABLE AND REASONABLE UTILISATION In the context of international watercourses, legal experts have determined that the term \u201cequitable\u201d within the UNWC and customary international law can be understood to mean \u201cthe equal right to use the water for beneficial purposes, rather than division into equal portions.\u201d The UNWC does not define what \u201cequitable and reasonable\u201d means in specific legal terms; it instead provides guidance on how equitable and reasonable utilisation is to be determined in a practical sense by listing the major indicative factors to be considered when evaluating whether or not a new or increased use is consistent with the principle in Articles 5 and 6. The preamble of the Ganges Treaty mentions the desire of the countries for \u2018fair and just\u2019 decision-making on entitlement and rights to the Ganges River. The countries also seek to ensure optimum utilisation of water resources for mutual benefit. The sharing arrangements and any revisions, if required by the Parties, are required to be guided by the principles of equity, fairness and no harm to either party (Art. X). Equity is explicitly the guiding principle for writing treaties or agreements with regard to other common rivers (Art. IX). Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Ganges Treaty does make explicit mention that the parties shall be guided by the principles of equity and fairness but falls short of defining the means and mechanism to do so at the basin level to support the augmentation of flow. The application of these principles is limited to the sharing the decision linked to sharing of quantum of waters. 4.4.4 SUBSTANTIVE PRINCIPLES: OBLIGATION NOT TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT HARM (AND RELATED DUTY TO PROTECT ECOSYSTEMS) Article 7 of the UNWC deals in detail with the general obligation not to cause significant harm. It begins by stating that \u201cWatercourse States shall, in utilizing an international watercourse in their territories, take all appropriate measures to prevent the causing of significant harm to other watercourse States\u201d (Article 7(1)).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc23d571-031e-4849-b9eb-f7bb85533baf": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc23d571-031e-4849-b9eb-f7bb85533baf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0bba580c6cee9dd59ac3c525cdfe938ee4e200aeeabc9f3d559d683bb3371ac7"}, "2": {"node_id": "587c98ad-4f3e-4810-805f-44c9e693e3a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dcd56415238bf732c09005b131c6077095421e0cb620a67c6a6d8b72d982cf8"}}, "hash": "7272eb0208a3c741d2c4f113657a64078cbd2fda9981bd8a7afb2e659beb9591", "text": "Directly related to this general obligation, Article 7(2) goes on to specify that \u201cWhere significant harm nevertheless is caused to another watercourse State, the States whose use causes such harm shall, in the absence of agreement to such use, take all appropriate measures, having due regard for the provisions of Articles 5 and 6, in consultation with the affected State, to eliminate or mitigate such harm and, where appropriate, to discuss the question of compensation.\u201d It is this explicit reference to \u201chaving due regard\u201d that many legal experts consider as giving ultimate legal primacy to the principle of equitable and reasonable utilisation over the obligation not to cause significant harm.

The Ganges Treaty encapsulates the no harm principle. In case of an emergency, such as less water reaching Bangladesh than is required by the Treaty, the immediate consultations on restoring water flow should be based on the fair play and no harm principles (Art. II). No harm principles are also mentioned as the guiding principle for Treaty review and renewal. The Treaty, however, does not have any mechanism to ensure the protection of transboundary ecosystems or joint development of shared rivers within the basin. It allows for unilateral development of rivers in each one\u2019s territory for the optimum utilisation of the water resources of their region in the fields of flood management, irrigation, river basin development and generation of hydropower for the mutual benefit of the two countries The only reference to the duty to protect ecosystems can be linked to the desire of the two countries to achieve river basin development for the mutual benefit of the people of two countries (preamble), which could be interpreted as a duty to safeguard natural resources. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Ganges Treaty mentions the no harm principle. The major difference is that there is no procedural guidance under the Ganges Treaty on how to eliminate or mitigate any potential harm. There is also no mention of the duty of the Parties to protect the ecosystem. Thus, there is immense scope for improvement on the Ganges Treaty, particularly by expanding it to foster basin-level management and by including procedural guidance on the principle of no harm and related duty to protect the ecosystem. 4.4.5 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF COOPERATION AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE The overarching duty to cooperate is encapsulated in Article 8 of the UNWC where it obliges watercourse states to \u201ccooperate on the basis of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, mutual benefit and good faith in order to attain optimal utilization and adequate protection of an international watercourse\u201d (Article 8(1)). The principle of cooperation is enshrined in the pursuit of finding just and fair solutions to problems without affecting the existing rights and entitlements of the Parties (preamble). The direct reference to the principle of cooperation is contained in Article VIII of the Treaty wherein the two governments recognise the need for cooperation in augmenting the dry season flow of the Ganges River. The provisions for setting up a Joint Committee as an institutional mechanism for implementing the Treaty and for annual reporting underline the principle of cooperation and information exchange (Art. IV). Information exchange is ensured through the mandate of the Joint Committee to share data on river flow from selected locations and to submit annual reports to the members\u2019 respective governments. Following this information exchange, the two governments have a duty to decide on further action as needed (Art. VI). Thus, information exchange is also associated with a duty to take action based on information exchange. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The UNWC and the Ganges Treaty both contain the principle of cooperation and information exchange. There are clear institutional and procedural mechanisms for the exchange of information and there is an associated duty to take action based on the information. However, cooperation is limited by the scope of the Treaty, which is to ensure volumetric sharing of water. 4.4.6 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: PRINCIPLE OF PRIOR NOTIFICATION, CONSULTATION AND NEGOTIATION (OVER PLANNED MEASURES) Article 11 of the UNWC obliges states to: exchange information, consult each other and, if necessary, negotiate on the possible effects of planned measures on the condition of an international watercourse. Article 13(a) dictates that the state providing notification must allow six months for the notified state(s) to evaluate this information, carry out their own studies, and ultimately reply. With regard to consultations and negotiations, Article 17(1) dictates that where the notifying state has communicated via reply that they determine the planned measure is inconsistent with Articles 5 and/or 7, both the notifying and notified states are bound to \u201center into consultations and, if necessary, negotiations with a view to arriving at an equitable resolution of the situation.\u201d In this regard, all states must engage in any consultations and negotiations \u201cin good faith [and] pay reasonable regard to the rights and legitimate interests of the other State\u201d (Article 17(2)). The Treaty was signed to formalise the sharing of water quantities, with the flow at Farakka Barrage as the reference point. The Treaty provides for the establishment of a Joint Committee (JC) to implement the Treaty, collect data and exchange information.

Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The obligation of prior notification and negotiations are limited by the scope of the Treaty. The preamble mentions the need to cooperate on finding long-term solutions to Ganges water flow and on the development of the river for the benefit of people in each country. However, it does not include any provisions to operationalise these needs. The role of the JC established by the treaty is limited to information sharing and reporting on the flows in the river at the two selected points. 4.4.7 PROCEDURAL OBLIGATIONS: DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES Article 33 of the UNWC, supported by the only Annex to the Convention\u2019s text, provides the UNWC legal framework for the settlement of disputes. Article 33(1) stipulates that in the absence of an applicable agreement, in the event of a dispute between two or more parties concerning the interpretation or application of the UNWC, states are obligated to \u201cseek a settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.\u201d State parties to the UNWC are bound by the subsequent provisions under Article 33. Article 33(2) dictates that if such parties to a dispute fail to reach an agreement via negotiation requested by one (or more of them in the case of multiple parties) they can then \u201cjointly seek the good office, or request mediation or conciliation by a third party, or make use, as appropriate, of any joint water course institutions that may have been established by the Agreement to submit the dispute to arbitration or to the International Court of Justice.\u201d Article 33(3) provides detailed timelines and procedures whereby, if after six months from the time of a state party requesting negotiations the parties to the dispute have failed to settle through negotiation or other means, the dispute must \u201cbe submitted, at the request of any of the parties to the dispute, to impartial fact-finding in accordance with paragraphs 4 to 9, unless the parties so otherwise agree.\u201d The legal role and relevance of impartial fact-finding in the overall scheme of the UNWC dispute resolution procedures cannot be underestimated because it is largely unique to this framework Agreement within the field of international water law and transboundary basin or river agreements. Furthermore, given the range of dispute settlement mechanisms provided by Article 33(2), it remains the only truly non- negotiable, binding procedure within the UNWC. The Joint Committee has the mandate to examine any dispute under the Treaty. If the Committee fails to settle the dispute, it shall be referred to the Indo- Bangladesh Joint River Commission. If the dispute is still unresolved, it is referred to the two governments who meet, at the appropriate level, to resolve the dispute by mutual discussion (Art. VII). Thus, the dispute settlement mechanism under the Ganges Treaty is ambiguous. If the Commission fails, it becomes unclear at what level and in what time frame the dispute should be resolved, which is especially pertinent to matters that require immediate resolution, such as drought and floods. Compatibility and gaps \u2022 The Ganges Treaty does not have well-defined dispute settlement mechanisms. To strengthen them, the Parties could use the UNWC provisions on dispute resolution as an example. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS None of the bilateral agreements and treaties on the Ganges River or its tributaries have a basin focus or reflect the same understanding or scope as defined under the UNWC. As discussed in Chapter 1, the definition of \u2018watercourses\u2019 under the UNWC includes all physically connected ground and surface water flowing to a common terminus. The Mahakali Agreement can be considered the most advanced of the treaties this paper has analysed in terms of the application of international water law principles and its recognition of joint development of Mahakali River. However, like all other bilateral agreements in the Ganges Basin, the scope of the Mahakali treaty is limited to a stretch of river forming a boundary between India and Nepal and the two countries are free to unilaterally develop the tributaries of the Mahakali that fall within their territory. Therefore, despite the presence of a basin-level cooperation vision, potential basin-wide application is limited by the treaty\u2019s scope. The existing bilateral agreements and treaties in the Ganges Basin could be categorised into two groups. The Kosi and Gandak Agreements were negotiated in 1950s and \u201960s, when international water law was at a nascent stage of development, and these treaties therefore do not promote equity and reciprocity in water cooperation in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a165bf6-02bd-4da1-a96e-0380ae94da81": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a165bf6-02bd-4da1-a96e-0380ae94da81", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Governance of the Ganges River Basin", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/governance-ganges-river-basin", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70aa41cf122a7076e0b7595a4ef99a14609c5af7c6a4cd30ebed51c0b14c9d91"}}, "hash": "70aa41cf122a7076e0b7595a4ef99a14609c5af7c6a4cd30ebed51c0b14c9d91", "text": "a way that ensures joint protection and management of the river system itself. These treaties are project-centric, so there is no scope for the full-scale application of modern international water law. However, these two agreements acknowledge principles of national sovereignty and provide the mechanism for sharing benefits from the project. The Mahakali and Ganges Treaties, both signed in 1996, are contemporary to the UNWC. These two agreements reflect a higher level of IWL principle mainstreaming, which indicates a clear desire for cooperation and collaboration in shared water governance. Both agreements mention the principles of equity, fair play and no harm, and also recognise the need to develop basin-level approaches as long-term solutions to flooding and the effects of drought. The higher level of compatibility between the UNWC and the Ganges and Mahakali Treaties indicates an attempt by the countries to mainstream internationally agreed-upon principles related to shared water governance. However, the lack of elaboration on the procedural aspects has led to challenges in implementation. This analysis suggests that there is scope for the improvement of existing regional agreements and treaties in the Ganges Basin through expansion of scope and strengthening of procedures. Based on the comparative analysis of these treaties in relation to the UNWC, it can be concluded that the UNWC framework provides a tool to reinforce and strengthen existing agreements and also to promote the harmonisation of water laws regionally. This could create an environment of regional peace and trust and help countries better adapt to common local and global challenges such as climate change and floods. Some specific points are detailed below: Protection of the river: Commonly missing in all bilateral agreements and treaties in the Ganges Basin is a mechanism to protect the international watercourses from environmental pollution. None of the bilateral treaties analysed have binding provisions regarding the prior notification and consultation on shared river basin issues related to environmental degradation. The UNWC offers ample guidance on aspects of ecological conservation and communication on planned measures on the shared river, so the adoption of uniform procedural measures based on UNWC principles would enhance the level and standard of river protection by holding riparian countries accountable for their obligation to cooperate and communicate on ecological protection. The UNWC will reinforce and not replace existing bilateral agreements: The UNWC7 is a framework convention that allows states to continue with or have new water cooperation agreements that are tailored to their needs. Therefore, even if the UNWC is ratified by the GBM countries, it will not replace existing water agreements or treaties. However, it could help strengthen existing agreements by providing guidance on the development of basin-level joint planning and binding mechanisms for the timely resolution of disputes. For example, the dispute resolution mechanism under the Ganges Treaty (India and Bangladesh) is ambiguous and non-binding; if a dispute is not resolved by the Joint Committee it is referred to Bangladesh-India Joint Commission, but no timeframe for complete resolution of the dispute is provided by the Treaty. Ratification of the UNWC, which includes strong dispute resolution mechanisms and guidance on timelines and procedures, would be the first step in strengthening some of the existing mechanisms within the GBM\u2019s bilateral arrangements. The UNWC will promote regional harmonisation of water agreements and national policies: Collectively, the water cooperation instruments in the Ganges Basin present a scattered and sometimes contradictory legal regime. Each treaty or agreement seeks to fulfil its own limited purpose, without regard for other agreements. For example, although the Ganges Treaty\u2019s focus is on sharing volumes of water, it also indicates a desire and acknowledges the need to augment water flow as a long-term solution to water sharing issues \u2013 yet does not include Nepal, where the Ganges headwaters are located. The Kosi Agreement, which does include Nepal, has not achieved flood control or irrigation benefits to the extent that it promised. Different set of rules and regimes apply to different parts of the same river, resulting in a fragmented approach to its management and sustainable utilisation. Therefore, the UNWC as a framework and a regional umbrella agreement has the potential to foster regional cooperation for the development of integrated basin-level approaches in the Ganges Basin. This standardisation of transboundary river system governance is required to deal with the destructive impacts of climate change on river flows and its annual water distribution. 7 Art. 3 UN Watercourses Convention REFERENCES Aguilar Rojas, G. and Iza, A.

The Project will involve construction of a 130m high dam on the Rufiji river, creation of a 100km long, c.914km2 reservoir plus a power plant, a transmission line, workers camps and access roads. The c. 50,000km2 Selous Game Reserve (SGR) is an IUCN category IV protected area. It has been a natural World Heritage Site since 1982 but has been on the List of World Heritage in Danger since 2014 due to intensive poaching. In 2018, the threat from the Project was added to the justification for the continued inclusion of SGR on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The review assesses the degree of alignment of the EIA with 1) IUCN guidance on impact assessment in World Heritage sites, and 2) international good practice, as set out in the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards and associated technical guidance. Notwithstanding that recent IFC guidance is that projects in World Heritage sites should in most cases not go ahead at all, the review finds that the EIA falls considerably short of both IUCN guidance on impact assessment and IFC performance standards. The EIA is therefore not appropriate for a large-scale development like the Stiegler\u2019s Gorge hydropower project. In particular, the EIA: \u2022 Is based on an inadequately detailed description of the project, notably the planned flow regime (including the possibility of hydropeaking), the expected level of seasonal variation in flows and the expected constraints to flows, for example in cases of prolonged drought. \u2022 Largely lacks baseline data on biodiversity, the social context and the physical environment. The information used does not provide a credible evidence base for assessing impacts or for identifying appropriate mitigation. Fundamental hydrological data is more than 30 years old, which is inappropriate given the scale of land-use change in the Rufiji basin in that period. Some critical information is missing entirely, including information on aquatic biodiversity, a modern environmental flows (eFlows) assessment and an assessment of the effects of land- use and climate change in the Rufiji basin on flow regimes. \u2022 Does not include a systematic, logical, spatially explicit or quantified assessment of ecological, social or physical impacts. Much of the assessment seems to be based on guesswork or wishful thinking rather than careful evidence-based analysis. In particular, the assessment of an overall positive impact of changes in the flood regime on the livelihoods of thousands or tens of thousands of people downstream is not based on credible reasoning or evidence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d76d9057-956c-4ca9-b028-5717fcba312a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d76d9057-956c-4ca9-b028-5717fcba312a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11b7dd306e81f992eb94d89a6c23de2a1481167294c12f70a40e3eb82fc8d61c"}, "2": {"node_id": "edaf889e-0909-44b4-b886-41febd1dd802", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "844b3f489b76f19e036e34fb5daa503cda62581485d46679aa6418aca5e447d3"}}, "hash": "4ff6ba88d8f78b82117bd6de898a05c6a2a246e5fa0488295190b46372230d32", "text": "In addition, some potentially significant impacts are not considered at all, such as the barrier effect to migratory fish which may have significant negative consequences for both biodiversity and for the livelihoods thousands or tens of thousands of people dependent on the fisheries of the Rufiji Basin. \u2022 Includes a piecemeal set of mitigation measures that are 1) not clearly linked to impacts, and/or 2) vague, and/or 3) not demonstrably feasible, and/or 4) insufficiently resourced, while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db43f046-a0ab-4d98-899f-c603b4f1dfeb": {"__data__": {"id_": "db43f046-a0ab-4d98-899f-c603b4f1dfeb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eb6cb4770a44c96e035e00f91d591d2ad075e6055dfa1f62ce26c23c663077c"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e613ba0-94cc-4390-89c9-6f68403a01f7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d328f780857d60fc8f608017bd459b3e241418148b6a52f595b9a966dfe8d307"}}, "hash": "dd656c4509f5eedca3c43513c718425e5dc2db859ee87b656e180f884290c3d0", "text": "many basic good practice mitigation measures (e.g., fish ladders, fish screens) are not evaluated. The proposed mitigation therefore does not provide confidence that impacts can or will be minimised. \u2022 Appears to have included very limited stakeholder consultation. No Informed Consultation and Participation is documented, a major gap for a project that appears likely to significantly affect critical components of the livelihoods of thousands or tens of thousands of people. iv \u2022 The EIA contains no serious consideration or justification of how the Project can deliver a net gain or no-net-loss of biodiversity nor how impacted livelihoods will be restored. The reviewed EIA therefore does not provide a credible evidence base to provide confidence that social and environmental impacts have been assessed with a level of resolution and precision appropriate for the potentially large, long-term and irreversible ecological and social impacts, nor that all feasible and appropriate mitigation has been identified. In consequence, the EIA does not provide a credible assessment of potential impacts on the Outstanding Universal Value of the SGR. Given the large footprint of the project in the heart of the SGR, the potential barrier effect from a 100km long and 12km wide reservoir, and the need to create and maintain access roads, supporting infrastructure and a permanent human presence it is clear that the undisturbed and wild character of the area will be severely affected. Negative impacts on individual features contributing to the presence of OUV seem inevitable; however, from the information in the EIA it is not possible to determine which specific qualifying features will be compromised nor to what extent. Over and above the impacts on the SGR itself, the description of the project in the EIA suggests that: \u2022 It is highly likely that the Project will have significant negative impacts on the livelihoods of many thousands or tens of thousands of people dependent on the downstream Rufiji River for agriculture and fishing; \u2022 It is highly likely that there will be significant negative impacts on freshwater biodiversity in the Rufiji River (especially on migratory fish) which may in turn result in potentially significant impacts on the livelihoods of thousands of people dependent on fisheries in the catchment, including the upstream Kilombero Valley Floodplain Ramsar Site; \u2022 Significant and lasting impacts on the physical environment of the downstream Rufiji delta cannot be ruled out, which may in turn result in significant negative impacts on the biodiversity of the Rufiji-Mafia-Kilwa Ramsar site and the ecosystem services it provides. These potentially highly significant impacts are not credibly evaluated in the EIA. The EIA\u2019s conclusion that \u2018the development of the project should not be a matter of serious concern\u2019 is therefore untenable based on the evidence provided. The numerous gaps and non-sequiturs in the EIA, from the scope, through the project description, the baseline characterisation and the impacts assessment itself to the identification of mitigation measures, means that the EIA is far from aligning with IFC performance standards, or with IUCN guidance on impact assessment in World Heritage sites. Under both IFC performance standards and IUCN guidance on impact assessment in World Heritage sites, EIA is a process that should be fully integrated into all aspects of project conceptualisation, design and execution. Improving alignment of the EIA for this project with these standards would require starting with a complete and thorough re-assessment of the basic assumptions underpinning the project, informed by an up-to-date and credible set of baseline data on the physical, social and ecological environment. 1 Background and approach Scope and context This rapid technical review assesses the \u201cUpdated Environmental Impact Assessment Report for 2100 MW Power Generation from the Rufiji Hydropower Project in Selous Game Reserve, Pwani and Morogoro regions, Tanzania\u201d of 18 October 2018 (\u201cthe EIA\u201d) that relates to a planned hydropower project to be built at Stiegler\u2019s Gorge in the north of Selous Game Reserve (\u201cthe Project\u201d). The c. 50,000km2 Selous Game Reserve (SGR) is one of the oldest protected areas in Africa. It is an IUCN category IV protected area in which managed sport hunting is allowed in certain zones. It has been a natural World Heritage Site since 1982 but has been on the List of sites World Heritage in Danger since 2014 due to intensive poaching.

The review assesses the degree of alignment of the EIA with 1) IUCN guidance on impact assessment in World Heritage sites, and 2) international good practice, as set out in the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards and associated technical guidance. The review focuses on Performance Standards 1 and 6 which are the most applicable for a natural World Heritage Site. A recent update to IFC guidance states that projects in natural World Heritage Sites may not be acceptable for financing, with the possible exception of projects specifically designed to contribute to the conservation of the area. The Stiegler\u2019s Gorge HPP is not designed to contribute to the conservation of SGR and therefore could never fully align with this recent IFC guidance. Nevertheless, the rest of the provisions of the IFC Performance Standards remain recognised international good practice and so are an appropriate benchmark for reviewing the EIA. Although no formal assessment has been conducted, the SGR would likely be considered Critical Habitat under Performance Standard 6 due at least to the presence of a significant population of the Endangered African Wild Dog (Lycaon pictus) and a remnant population of Critically Endangered Black Rhino (Diocerus bicornis). Notwithstanding the SGR\u2019s World Heritage status, a project aiming to align with international good practice in this situation would be expected to provide a very high degree of confidence that impacts have been appropriately identified and mitigated. Documents reviewed Three documents were provided for this desktop review: 1. \u201cEnvironmental Impact Assessment for the Stiegler\u2019s Gorge Hydropower Project, Tanzania\u201d: draft report, 4 May 2018; 2. \u201cUpdated Environmental Impact Assessment Report for 2100 MW Power Generation from the Rufiji Hydropower Project in Selous Game Reserve, Pwani and Morogoro regions, Tanzania\u201d: 18 October 2018; 3. IUCN\u2019s analysis of the draft EIA transmitted to the State Party of Tanzania by the UNESCO World Heritage Centre on 18 July 2018. In practice, the updated EIA version of 18 October 2018 supersedes the previous version and was therefore the focus of the review. The documents provided for review did not include all the EIA Annexes, notably Annex D \u201cSignatures of consulted stakeholders\u201d and Annex E \u201cSpecialist studies cited in this report\u201d; this review is therefore based on the summaries of these annexes that are presented in the EIA. The review was complemented by reference to available scientific and third-party literature, which is cited where relevant. 2 Benchmarks for the review As set out in the TOR, the benchmarks for the review were: \u2022 IUCN\u2019s Wo rld Heritage Advice Note o n Env ironm ental Assessm ent. \u2022 The IFC Performance Standards (IFC 2012a) and associated guidance notes (IFC 2012b, 2012c), as relevant for an EIA. The IFC Performance Standards are complex with many nuances, so this rapid review focused on key aspects of PS1 and PS6 which are the most relevant for a natural world heritage site1. \u2022 Where relevant, the review also considers alignment with sector-specific good practice guidance for hydropower projects, specifically IFC\u2019s Goo d P ractice Note on environmental, health and safety approaches for hydropower projects (IFC 2018) and the World Bank Group\u2019s Goo d P ractice Handbo o k on Environmental Flows for Hydropower Projects (World Bank Group 2018)2. The approach used was to first review the EIA against key relevant requirements of the IFC Performance Standards, with additional review against sector-specific good practice guidelines where appropriate. This review was then used to assess the EIA against the IUCN World Heritage Advice Note on Environmental Assessment, with additional evaluation of the sections on Outstanding Universal Value. Review team expertise The review was conducted by a team of three biodiversity specialists and one social specialist. The biodiversity specialists have extensive recent practical experience of applying international good practice, in particular IFC performance standards, to large-scale hydropower projects in Africa and world-wide, from project-, lender- and government-advisor perspectives. The social specialist is familiar with applying IFC social standards and IUCN\u2019s Environmental and Social Management System (ESMS). All the team are familiar with protected area management in Africa, and two have experience of evaluating and managing impacts of large-scale extractives and infrastructure projects on natural world heritage sites in Africa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4f4df98-206b-41e5-a028-454b77eeba1a": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4f4df98-206b-41e5-a028-454b77eeba1a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d90372d02bf962a49f8bcb5dced1ddc39d55f8a30d4571e99272cbda6accefa"}, "2": {"node_id": "54ed48ef-0537-4382-b7df-7e5dffd58b38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce10637d753eee26d5929a1c8c0f2e94a732c1c5fa944c9ee0e7a7a6237556cc"}}, "hash": "88ffe3433cbd17056823b8dc707c15fc1f50fd5de5dfe89f53bcca3e3be1cab1", "text": "1 IFC\u2019s Guidance Note 6 was updated in November 2018 and a final corrected version published in early 2019 (IFC 2019).

It was therefore not possible to assess whether the ESMS is \u2018commensurate with the level of environmental and social risks and impacts\u2019. Overarching policy defining the environmental and social objectives and principles \u2022 Although there is reference to many external policies, including IFC Performance Standards, no specific policy established by the project is identified in the EIA. \u2022 Intended environmental and social objectives are not specified. Identification of Risks and Impacts based on recent environmental and social baseline data at an appropriate level of detail \u2022 Three 'spatial' areas of the project are defined as; a 'core impact area', 'immediate impact area', and the 'area of influence'. The core impact area includes areas that will be directly impacted by the dam and reservoir - the Stiegler\u2019s Gorge area, the reservoir and downstream the Lower Rufiji floodplain and delta. Areas upstream of the reservoir are not considered. \u2022 A clearly defined boundary for the 'core impact area' is not provided and there is no ecological justification for the extent of the area making it difficult to determine if all potential impacts to biodiversity, and in particular impacts to mobile species and indirect impacts, are likely to be captured within it. \u2022 The immediate impact area is said to be outside the core area and includes villages that will be positively or negatively impacted by the project. However, Affected Communities are not clearly identified and no reference map is provided. \u2022 The area of influence is based on the locations of influential stakeholders and is not used further in the EIA. 4 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings \u2022 There is no consideration of potential impacts from associated facilities (notably the transmission line and associated roads). Assessment of viable alternatives \u2022 Alternatives analysis is limited and focuses on different construction options; it does not consider different project designs, for example, there is no evaluation of the potential to reduce reservoir impacts through alternative heights for the dam. Identification of priority biodiversity features and ecosystem services \u2022 The EIA reports that scientific secondary data to provide baselines on ecology and flora and fauna of the SGR are limited. However, a rapid internet search turns up freely-available published studies on lions (Spong 2002; Spong et al. 2002; Brink et al. 2013), elephants (Zafra-Calvo et al. 2018) and freshwater species (Darwall et al. 2005) that all contain relevant information. There are also numerous studies on the ecosystem services of the Rufiji floodplain, delta and the upstream Kilombero Valley that are of relevance and which are not cited, or only cited in passing (for example: Turpie 2000; Duvail & Hamerlynck 2007; Duvail et al. 2017; Kolding et al. 2017; Moreau & Garaway 2018). While the TAWIRI aerial surveys are referenced, the only data used appear to be a few maps and overall counts of selected species. \u2022 The IUCN Red List (accessible via IBAT) does not seem to have been consulted systematically, and several statements in the EIA contradict IUCN Red List accounts. For example, contrary to the EIA, the ranges of Sanje crested Mangabey and Udzungwa Red Colobus do not overlap SGR, and the fish Alestes stuhlmannii is reported on the Red List as being widespread in Tanzanian basins and recorded from Mozambique rather than being endemic to the Rufiji basin. \u2022 Annex C provides information on stakeholder groups that were consulted, but consultations (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e053b1a6-cb58-42c8-90de-dd04ba134e05": {"__data__": {"id_": "e053b1a6-cb58-42c8-90de-dd04ba134e05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ef0b3660d36e731ceb0063ae92f4c44c7c0bbddd67059ae9f10f977ac61b5f4"}, "2": {"node_id": "31a9e58e-e5f0-48f4-8700-35d20ef2bba8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fbe61e4dead7d0f9c6f5c6c8c6e581ca4e31004d94decf90994d62016e6b011"}}, "hash": "62cd535e965bef370e72c0b151b6bf355bbfd6b637a453ae4fb4428f2bab34e7", "text": "with the Country Director of WWF and the Minister of Tourism), took place in March/April 2018 after ground surveys (see below) and it is therefore unclear if or how the biodiversity concerns of stakeholder groups were included into the survey phase of work.

Given the large -scale, long-duration and potentially highly significant impacts of this project, an IFC-aligned EIA would be expected to be based on comprehensive and fine-grained baseline data, collected where necessary over multiple seasons. The following points highlight particular issues with the baseline data presented in the EIA: \u2022 Data on social context and ecosystem services appear to be based entirely on secondary data sources (such as District- and Ward-level national statistics) with no primary data collection. The Project is described as being located within the most 'extensive and pristine' part of the SGR, which challenged access for biodiversity survey work.

Downstream impacts that may be important for biodiversity in the floodplain and deltas include sediment trapping and loss of seasonal water flows and nutrients. Hydrological changes are likely to affect breeding success of some aquatic species and impact the ecology of the floodplain and the delta area which in turn will impact the livelihoods of people dependent on agriculture and fishing in these areas. \u2022 Cumulative impacts are not fully assessed for biodiversity and ecosystem processes, e.g. the cumulative impact section does not include assessment of the combined impacts of the existing upstream hydropower projects with the Project on sediment flow/nutrients downstream to the floodplains and delta. Assessment of impacts to the physical environment \u2022 The EIA identifies several potential impacts as a result of changed flow rates and flow regime and changes in water quality, particularly due to reduced sediment load: loss of sand rivers (which we take to mean sections of river that are seasonally dry on the surface), downstream oxbow lakes, flooding regimes on the lower Rufiji floodplain, and changes in salinity and other aspects of water quality in the Rufiji delta. While in several places in the EIA these impacts are mentioned as being 4 Note that figures on the diagram of the proposed filling regime (p143) are illegible in the version of the EIA reviewed and so could not be evaluated. 9 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings potentially severe, the overall conclusion is that they will be unlikely or even positive, which is not well-supported by the available evidence. \u2022 Given that the Project may have effects on ecosystems other than the river itself, that there are many people dependent on the river for ecosystem services, and that it is the most downstream dam in a cascade (with upstream dams at Mtera and Kidatu on the Great Ruaha) and that the Project is likely in Critical Habitat, good practice would normally require a high-resolution eFlows assessment to inform the impact assessment (World Bank Group 2018). No such study is presented and the cited models of flows are many years old. Details of available data are not presented in the EIA, but a scientific third-party review of the hydrological data available at the time of the cited studies suggests that 1) data were very patchy, and 2) projected peak discharges from the planned dam may not be able to replicate extensive natural flooding of the main agricultural areas of the floodplain. Such replication would require discharges of at least 4,000 m3/s (Duvail & Hamerlynck 2007), approximately double the maximum discharge from the turbines mentioned in the EIA and close to the maximum discharge from all outlets5. The EIA provides no evidence that more recent data or modelling are available that would support a different interpretation; neither does it provide a convincing case that artificial irrigation will be able to mitigate impacts on floodplain agriculture if extensive flooding can no longer occur. Neither does the EIA provide evidence that such high-level discharges are feasible or likely given the planned power regime and design constraints (for example, if a minimum reservoir height is required for dam stability). \u2022 Impacts on river structure downstream of the dam, in particular increased river depth due to erosion by discharge of pulses of water at high velocity, are identified as potentially serious and of significant stakeholder concern. The EIA acknowledges that the level of potential impact is unknown. \u2022 The EIA acknowledges that sediment trapping behind the dam could significantly affect the Rufiji floodplains and delta since the main source of sediment is now the Kilombero and Luwega catchments as sediment from the Great Ruaha is already reduced due to upstream dams of Mtera and Kidatu. The EIA states 16 M tonnes is the current average annual sediment inflow; of this, 12.8 M m3 will be trapped annually (i.e. 4.4 M tonnes or 1/4 of yearly sediment).

The EIA seems to conclude that a more regular flow regime will reduce salinity, which it considers will favour human activities in the delta but would negatively impact biodiversity.

Whether salinity levels will actually be reduced is not clear from the data presented, and the assessment that positive impacts on human uses will outweigh negative impacts on biodiversity is not substantiated by any evidence. \u2022 The EIA does not mention whether the dam will operate with hydropeaking and so the potential impacts of peaking flows (such as scouring) are not assessed.

The integrity of the values was a key component of the justification for Outstanding Universal Value. \u2022 The EIA identifies potential negative impacts on key components of the qualifying features for criterion (ix), notably: \u201c\u2026 a network of normally 11 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings dry rivers of sand that become raging torrents during the rains; these sand rivers are one of the most unique features of the Selous landscape. Large parts of the wooded grasslands of the northern Selous are seasonally flooded by the rising water of the Rufiji River, creating a very dynamic ecosystem\u201d. Depending on the flow regime adopted, the dam will prevent flooding of wooded grasslands, potentially leading to very significant changes to this key feature. The dam is likely to eliminate significant number and lengths of sand river and their \u2018raging torrents\u2019, either where they are inundated by the reservoir, where dry season flow is maintained downstream, and, depending on the adopted flow regime, where they are scoured due to pulses of high velocity water. Whilst some negative impacts seem inevitable, the EIA does not provide quantification of the proportion of this component of the OUV that will be impacted, so it is impossible to evaluate whether the conclusion that large quantities of sand rivers will persist is warranted. \u2022 As discussed above, the EIA does not provide individual assessments on the reference species cited under the justification for meeting World Heritage criterion (x) - contains the most important and significant natural habitats for conservation of in-situ biodiversity based on the diversity of Miombo woodlands vegetation and the diversity and density of fauna supported by it and the aquatic habitats. It this therefore impossible to evaluate the significance of Project impacts on the OUV at an appropriate level of resolution. Some negative effect appears inevitable. However from the information in the EIA it is not possible to determine which qualifying features under criterion (x) will be compromised nor to what extent. \u2022", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e93e920c-9255-4309-b5f2-6ffaf0e4d027": {"__data__": {"id_": "e93e920c-9255-4309-b5f2-6ffaf0e4d027", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94ca48fa8ecabdd1bcf58be4bd0c0a869c867c0a1a3324244da2a58835575192"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca1b57b8-a4ff-4749-92ac-f26f391fd47a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11f207b139b62ecb3336ab36bda416866b9d832830490dab29439b643dc1a292"}}, "hash": "f1ca96f1f01c05fcf358b1d90129baf4eca377d8d1be42c26b696fec84e0d662", "text": "The EIA does not provide a detailed assessment of the consequence of the Project for the integrity of SGR\u2019s OUV, which is a core part of the justification for World Heritage status (for example under criterion (ix) \u2018wilderness\u2019 and \u2018undisturbed\u2019 are key aspects: \u201cThe Selous Game Reserve is one of the largest remaining wilderness areas in Africa, with relatively undisturbed ecological and biological processes\u201d). Given the large footprint of the project in the heart of the SGR, the potential barrier effect from a long and wide reservoir and the need to create and maintain access roads, supporting infrastructure and a permanent human presence it is clear that the undisturbed and wild character of the area will be severely affected, even if individual features can persist. \u2022 The EIA considers that the Project will lead to an overall positive impact on the SGR\u2019s OUV compared to recent trends, presumably referring principally to recent high levels of poaching. Given the issues with the assessment of impacts on biodiversity and the physical environment described above, and the weak mitigation measures proposed and the 12 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings absence of a clear plan for delivering net gain (see below), this conclusion is not credible based on the evidence provided. Application of the mitigation hierarchy, with a focus on avoidance \u2022 Consideration of avoidance measures is very limited. This is the most important step in reducing impacts and therefore this is a significant deviation from good practice. This is particularly the case for projects in natural and mixed World Heritage sites where for example, recent guidance from IFC states that projects should be avoided entirely unless they are specifically designed to bring conservation benefits. \u2022 Various minimisation measures for social and environmental impacts are suggested but, as impacts are not appropriately identified and prioritised in terms of significance, mitigation measures are not clearly aligned with the most significant potential impacts and lack sufficient detail to assess their feasibility or effectiveness. For example, the mitigation measures include: \u2022 measures that are not clearly linked to impacts. For example, it is not clear how the measures \u2018Designate Oxbow lakes as a fish sanctuary\u2019 could actually address the impact \u2018Impaired fish migration along the Rufiji River\u2019. \u2022 measures that are vague, for example \u2018develop optimum reservoir operation policy to sustain downstream demands\u2019 (page 202, enhanced floodplain irrigation agriculture), \u2018follow weather forecasts\u2019 (page 195 River bed/bank Degradation of the Lower Rufiji) or \u2018ensure controlled fishing and improved market outside\u2019 (page 203). \u2022 Mitigation measures that are unlikely to be feasible in short time frames, whereas impacts may occur very rapidly once construction begins (e.g., there is evidence that agricultural yields in the floodplain decline significantly even three years after the previous flood ; Duvail & Hamerlynck 2007). For example, \u2018establish modern community-based irrigation schemes in Lower Rufiji floodplain\u2019 (page 202). Shifting farmers from traditional floodplain-based agricultural techniques to modern irrigation schemes is a considerable and time-consuming challenge, and no evidence base is provided for where this has been achieved elsewhere. \u2022 The estimates of resources required to implement many of the mitigation measures are unrealistically low. For example, the entire budget for measures to address the impact \u201cLoss of wildlife\u201d is approximately $10,000 (30m TSH) \u2013 seemingly as a one-off cost. According to cost estimates from the Ruaha 13 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings Carnivore Conservation Project, this would only cover the salary and rations (but not equipment, training, management or vehicles) for 4-5 anti-poaching scouts for one year. This would be insufficient to ensure permanent staffing of a single control post, let alone to manage risks of increased poaching during construction and operations, and this budget is also expected to cover land-use planning activities outside the SGR which will also be costly. This budget therefore seems tiny compared to the potential severity of this impact. As a further example, the measure \u201cImprove land use practices in upstream catchment areas\u201d to address reservoir sedimentation is considered a \u2018no cost\u2019 item, which is simply not realistic. \u2022 Many mitigation measures, in particular for social impacts, hinge on the evidence base for water release regimes to mimic the conditions in the natural regime/maintain ecosystem services, which is not convincingly demonstrated.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca1b57b8-a4ff-4749-92ac-f26f391fd47a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca1b57b8-a4ff-4749-92ac-f26f391fd47a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94ca48fa8ecabdd1bcf58be4bd0c0a869c867c0a1a3324244da2a58835575192"}, "2": {"node_id": "e93e920c-9255-4309-b5f2-6ffaf0e4d027", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1ca96f1f01c05fcf358b1d90129baf4eca377d8d1be42c26b696fec84e0d662"}}, "hash": "11f207b139b62ecb3336ab36bda416866b9d832830490dab29439b643dc1a292", "text": "The EIA recognises that (for example) timings of releases might not coincide with key agricultural periods, and will be reliant on lake levels rather than downstream user needs, but no detailed alternative measures are provided if this does occur. \u2022 Some potential mitigation measures that are widely considered good practice (e.g., IFC 2018) do not seem to have been considered at all, including:", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "04cc216f-f19f-41ad-acad-860c1c6fcc15": {"__data__": {"id_": "04cc216f-f19f-41ad-acad-860c1c6fcc15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e9c55040c8177f6339dbab7b06bdffa7b6de0c73fed4c6fdb1caee2f3187359"}}, "hash": "3e9c55040c8177f6339dbab7b06bdffa7b6de0c73fed4c6fdb1caee2f3187359", "text": "fish ladders, mechanical or hydraulic fish lifts, trap and transport programs, mechanisms for downstream fish passage, such as increased spill bypass channel, and trap and transport programs, fish exclusion or guidance devices (such as screens) for both upstream and downstream passage that will prevent entry of fish into dangerous areas and guide them into bypass facilities and \u201cfish friendly\u201d turbine technology. \u2022 The EIA does not discuss whether river flow may be stopped completely at any time during construction or operations. If complete cessations of flow are not part of the normal cycle of river levels, this can lead to extinction of species, such as those endemic to riffles or rapids downstream of the dam, so it a is a critical consideration. \u2022 Mitigation measures for indirect impacts are particularly vague. For example, there is no discussion of the level of extra anti-poaching effort that will be required to address the risk of increased hunting. Quantification of significant residual impacts \u2022 The only quantification that is undertaken for biodiversity impacts is to state that the Project footprint of c.914km2 will be only 1.8% of the area 14 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings of SGR6 and hence the impact will be limited. This is an insufficiently detailed level of resolution for a project with such a large footprint in such a sensitive environment and may mask significant impacts to some biodiversity features. For example, the area impacted could well represent a much higher proportion of specific habitat types or of critical seasonal resources for wildlife such as water availability in the dry season. This possibility is supported by available data that show, for example, that 1) lion densities vary by a factor of 5 between different areas of SGR (Brink et al. 2013) and that they show a strong preference for riverine areas (Spong et al. 2002) and 2) that elephant distribution is seasonally very patchy (Figure 1). \u2022 The simplistic quantification that is included only considers footprint impacts \u2013 indirect impacts and fragmentation impacts due to the potential barrier effect of a c.12km wide reservoir could make the impacts much larger. \u2022 There is no quantification of potential negative or positive social impacts or impacts on ecosystem services. Establish management programs that identify mitigation and performance improvement measures and actions, including operational procedures, practices, plans, and related supporting documents that are managed in a systematic way \u2022 There is no discussion of the management programmes that will be required to ensure that identified mitigation measures are implemented. A good practice EIA would normally include a list of the management plans that will need to be developed along with their scope and objectives, and an overview of the process and timeline for developing them. \u2022 Mitigation measures are assigned to a wide variety of organisations and will cover a very wide geographical area. There is no discussion about how the actions will be co-ordinated to ensure they will be implemented as intended. This is not appropriate for a highly complex project with potentially significant impacts. Credible plan to deliver no-net-loss or net gain for biodiversity and livelihood restoration for adverse impacts on Affected Communities \u2022 No plan for delivering no-net-loss or net gain is included in the EIA \u2022 Livelihood restoration measures are mentioned, but with no reference to scale, scope, and type, and measures seem to be based on the unlikely assumption that farmers/fishers can easily shift to modern/different techniques and areas. 6 The draft EIA (dated May 2018) states that the reservoir\u2019s maximum area will be 1,250km2 or 3% of the area of SGR, whereas the revised version (October 2018) states that the reservoir\u2019s maximum size will be 914km2 or 1.8% of the area of SGR. No explanation for the different estimates is provided, but presumably the earlier figure (which seems to be 100 km length x 12.5 km average width) is a crude approximation and the 914km2 is more precise. 15 Key PS1 + 6 requirements Review findings Stakeholder Engagement: Identify the range of stakeholders; Stakeholder Engagement Plan, tailored to the characteristics and interests of the Affected Communities; Disclosure of relevant project information. \u2022 Stakeholder identification emphasises interested parties who stand to gain (primary stakeholders), and secondary stakeholders who can influence decision-making.

Consultation with potentially Affected Communities in the lower Rufiji area seems to have lasted five days for a population of >100,000 people spread across >50 villages, some of them remote.

It is also unclear what pre- project baseline data would be used for the indicators (as noted above, there is a lack of data for the Project) or if it will be collected, when this would happen. It is also unclear which institution listed in the Environmental Monitoring Plan tables is responsible for collecting and reporting each of the monitoring indicators; clear roles and responsibilities and budget lines would be required for each party undertaking monitoring work. \u2022 There is no description of the proposed evaluation system so it is unclear how monitoring results would be used to inform adaptive management of mitigation activities. 17 Figure 1 : Results from TAWIRI's aerial surveys show that elephant distribution in the Selous-Mikumi ecosystem is seasonally patchy. This is a dry-season snapshot from 2013. This illustrates why it is not appropriate to simply use surveys from one season, and why the proportion of the area of the entire SGR impacted is not a sensible basis for assessing the significance of reservoir impacts; it also illustrates the rich datasets that are available and which could be used to refine the assessment of impacts.

Table 2 : Review against the principles of IUCN's World Heritage Advice Note on Environmental Assessment. For further details please see Table 1 above. Principle Review findings 1: Rigorous EIA early in decision-making process \u2022 As described above, the EIA has too many gaps and inconsistencies in all components to be considered rigorous. It has also not been conducted early in the decision-making process as it appears that construction may already have begun. 2: Appropriate experts \u2022 Although a list of experts is included, insufficient information is provided to assess whether they had appropriate World Heritage, protected area and biodiversity knowledge. 18 Principle Review findings \u2022 For project of this nature, global and regional experts would be expected to be consulted, but no list of such experts is provided. 3: Impacts on OUVs assessed, including direct, indirect and cumulative impacts \u2022 The data used to assess impacts is at an inappropriately low level of resolution. Significant sources of secondary data do not seem to have been used (or not used to an appropriate extent), and primary data is very limited. \u2022 Impacts on the OUV are assessed, but not at an appropriate level of resolution: impacts to individual features contributing to the OUV are not assessed individually; neither are they quantified. \u2022 Several potential impact types are not assessed at", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "20196cd4-1a9e-4309-9d53-b4d06bfc5671": {"__data__": {"id_": "20196cd4-1a9e-4309-9d53-b4d06bfc5671", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Technical review of the environmental impact assessment for the Rufiji hydropower project in Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/technical-review-environmental-impact-assessment-rufiji-hydropower", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fb1365e33c8b02eb423337cd6e754c256182f5e4a465d032d88b5bd8d1f1233"}}, "hash": "1fb1365e33c8b02eb423337cd6e754c256182f5e4a465d032d88b5bd8d1f1233", "text": "all, including the barrier effect of the dam for migratory fish, and of the reservoir for mobile terrestrial species. \u2022 Assessment of indirect and cumulative impacts is limited. 4: Analysis of alternatives \u2022 The analysis of alternatives is weak and focuses principally on different construction options, not on different ways to generate power or design choices that could reduce impacts (such as adjusting the dam height to reduce reservoir size). 5: Mitigation Hierarchy \u2022 As discussed above, the mitigation hierarchy does not seem to have been systematically followed. In particular, there is limited attention to avoidance, and even some basic minimisation measures that are good practice for hydropower projects have not been assessed. \u2022 Mitigation measures are generally 1) not clearly linked to impacts, and/or 2) insufficiently detailed, and/or 3) not demonstrably feasible, and/or 4) insufficiently resourced. They therefore do not provide confidence that identified impacts will be avoided and minimised as far as feasible. 6: Chapter on World Heritage with clear conclusions about impacts on OUVs \u2022 A separate chapter on World Heritage status is provided, however the conclusions about impacts on the OUV are vague and in some cases contradict assertions elsewhere in the EIA (for example about impacts on sand rivers). \u2022 No quantification of impacts to individual biodiversity features that are cited as contributing to listing under criteria (ix) and (x) is provided, so the overall conclusion of a positive effect cannot be substantiated and is not credible. 19 Principle Review findings 7: Public disclosure and thorough public consultation \u2022 No information on public disclosure is available, so this cannot be assessed. \u2022 Public consultation was limited, especially given the number of potential Affected Communities, and does not meet international good practice standards. No process of Informed Consultation and Participation was undertaken. 8: Environmental Management Plan \u2022 An environmental management plan is presented but details of how it will be implemented, including the scope of requirement operational management plans is not provided. \u2022 No description of the overall monitoring, evaluation and assurance process is provided, and no provision for independent auditing is made. Conclusions and implications Key findings The analysis documented above identifies many significant gaps in terms of project description, baseline information, impact assessment, mitigation design and implementation planning. The reviewed EIA therefore falls considerably short of international standards for a project with potentially significant impacts in an area of such high biodiversity and social sensitivity. It is therefore not appropriate for a large- scale development like the Stiegler\u2019s Gorge hydropower project. In particular, the reviewed EIA does not provide confidence that: \u2022 potentially highly significant negative social and environmental impacts have been assessed with a level of resolution and precision appropriate for the nature and scale of the impacts; \u2022 relevant and effective avoidance and minimisation measures have been identified; \u2022 residual impacts will be addressed to ensure that negatively-affected livelihoods will be restored and that an overall net gain or no-net-loss of biodiversity will be delivered. The most significant areas of divergence from international standards are: \u2022 An inadequately detailed description of the project activities. In particular, there is insufficient detail on the planned flow regime, including both the likelihood or frequency of implementation of a hydropeaking regime, the expected level of seasonal variation in flows and the expected constraints to flows, for example in cases of prolonged drought. \u2022 Insufficient consideration of associated facilities, notably the required transmission line and access roads. \u2022 Baseline data are largely lacking and are frequently based on insufficient, out of date or irrelevant information, with significant gaps. \u2022 Insufficient modelling of downstream flows and the absence of an environmental flows (eFlows) assessment. 20 \u2022 Insufficient justification that no viable alternatives exist: there is very limited consideration of different projects or of technical modifications (such as floating solar) that could be used to reduce project impacts. \u2022 An insufficiently detailed assessment of impacts on the physical environment. \u2022 An overly vague assessment of ecological impacts, with significant gaps in coverage, an insufficiently fine-grained assessment with little primary data, insufficient use of secondary data, and insufficient quantification for the impacts that are considered. \u2022 An overly vague assessment of social impacts, that did not include Informed Consultation and Participation, does not seem to be based on primary data and does not include a quantitative assessment of the number of households or individuals potentially impacted. \u2022 Mitigation measures that are 1) not clearly linked to impacts, and/or 2) vague, and/or 3) not demonstrably feasible, and/or 4) insufficiently resourced and therefore do not provide confidence that ecological or social impacts will be minimised.

Implications and impacts on the Outstanding Universal Value of the Selous Game Reserve World Heritage Site was identified based on criterion (ix) - outstanding example of ongoing ecological and biological processes and criterion (x) - the most important and significant natural habitats for conservation of in-situ biodiversity. Given the many deficiencies in the EIA described above, it does not provide a credible assessment of potential impacts on the OUV of the SGR. This applies both to the values and to their integrity: \u2022 The EIA identifies potential negative impacts on key components of the qualifying features for criterion (ix), notably: \u201c\u2026 a network of normally dry rivers of sand that become raging torrents during the rains; these sand rivers are one of the most unique features of the Selous landscape. Large parts of the wooded grasslands of the northern Selous are seasonally flooded by the rising water of the Rufiji River, creating a very dynamic ecosystem\u201d. Depending on the flow regime adopted, the dam will prevent flooding of wooded grasslands, potentially leading to very significant changes to this key attribute. The dam is likely to eliminate a significant number and length of sand river and their \u2018raging torrents\u2019, either where they are inundated by the reservoir, where dry season flow is maintained downstream, and, depending on the adopted flow regime, where they are scoured due to pulses of high velocity water. Whilst some negative impacts seem inevitable, the EIA does not provide quantification of the proportion of this component of the OUV that will be impacted, so it is impossible to evaluate whether the conclusion that large quantities of sand rivers will persist is warranted. \u2022 As discussed above, the EIA does not provide individual assessments for the species cited under the justification for meeting World Heritage criterion (x). It is therefore impossible to evaluate the significance of Project impacts on the OUV at an appropriate level of resolution. Some negative effect appears inevitable. However, from the information in the EIA it is not possible to determine which qualifying features under criterion (x) will be compromised nor to what extent. \u2022 The EIA does not provide a detailed assessment of the consequence of the Project for the integrity of SGR\u2019s OUV, which is a core part of the justification for World Heritage status (for example under criterion (ix) \u2018wilderness\u2019 and \u2018undisturbed\u2019 are key aspects: \u201cThe Selous Game Reserve is one of the largest remaining wilderness areas in Africa, with relatively undisturbed ecological and biological processes\u201d). Given the large footprint of the project in 21 the heart of the SGR, the potential barrier effect from a long and wide reservoir and the need to create and maintain access roads, supporting infrastructure and a permanent human presence it is clear that the undisturbed and wild character of the area will be severely affected, even if individual features can persist. In addition, outside the Selous Game Reserve: \u2022 It is highly likely that the Project will have significant negative impacts on the livelihoods of many thousands or tens of thousands of people dependent on the downstream Rufiji River; \u2022 It is highly likely that there will be significant negative impacts on freshwater biodiversity in the Rufiji River (especially on migratory fish) which may in turn result in potentially significant impacts on the livelihoods of thousands of people dependent on fisheries in the upstream catchment, including the Kilombero Valley; \u2022 Significant and lasting impacts on the physical environment of the downstream Rufiji delta cannot be ruled out, which may in turn result in significant negative impacts on the biodiversity of the Rufiji-Mafia-Kilwa Ramsar site and the ecosystem services it provides. The EIA\u2019s conclusion that \u2018the development of the project should not be a matter of serious concern\u2019 is therefore untenable based on the evidence provided. 22 References Brink, H., Smith, R.J. & Skinner, K.

Purpose and context of this paper This policy brief examines the existing Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) and ratified National Determined Contributions (NDCs) with regard to the inclusion of specific efforts addressing blue carbon ecosystems, namely mangroves, tidal saltmarshes and seagrasses, as climate mitigation or adaptation solutions. Prior to and during the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), 163 INDCsi have been submitted and 81 Parties have submitted their NDC 1,2. The INDCs are meant to outline Parties\u2019 fair and ambitious contributions to addressing climate change and achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2 and further strengthened in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement. Amongst other infomration, Parties were requested to include information on the scope and coverage i In this number, the individual Member States of the European Union (EU) are all represented by a single NDC. In this paper, each EU Member State is treated individually. of their mitigation and adaptation efforts, as well as on methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and removals.3 As part of the Paris Agreement, Parties are now committed to regularly submit revised NDCs every 5 years, with a review process that is intended to continually increase ambition (Art 4.3 and 4.9 of the Paris Agreement). For the time being, the INDCs submitted by a country prior and during COP21 will automatically count as its first NDC when the country ratifies the Paris Agreement, unless decided otherwise.4 While the current NDCs are a significant contribution, the existing commitments will not reach the 2\u00b0C target necessary to combat climate change. Scientists have calculated that the NDCs collectively will lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but will still allow for a warming of 2.6\u20133.1 degrees Celsius by 2100.5 This reality is recognized in the Paris Agreement, and this policy briefs aims to highlight the opportunity for countries to consider nature- 6 Blue Carbon and NDCs based solutions beyond what was originally submitted, including recognizing blue carbon as an opportunity to fill this emissions gap.

In many coastal nations these ecosystems provide a significant mitigation and adaptation value, as a carbon sink and as coastline protection and food security, respectively. Thus, the inclusion of coastal ecosystems can be considered an important asset in a more ambitious revision of the NDC for many Parties. 7 Introduction 2.1 The Paris Agreement and Nationally Determined Contributions The Paris Agreement was adopted by all 196 Parties to the UNFCCC at COP21 in December 2015. This landmark agreement marked a turning point with nations now striving for a low-carbon economy using innovation in technology, energy, finance, and conservation sectors. The Agreement entered into force on November 4th 2016,6 less than one year since its adoption. This is considered extremely fast for an international treaty and signals the overall sense of urgency to address climate change.7 One of the most important elements of the Paris Agreement is that countries can independently decide how to lower their emissions through its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). These national level climate action and emissions reduction plans are prepared to reflect countries economic and environmental differences. Each successive NDC is to represent a progression from the previous one, representing the highest possible ambition (Art. 4.3 of the Paris Agreement) and each party shall communicate a revised NDC every five years (Art 4.9 of the Paris Agreement). One of the principles that will be applied to ensure enhanced ambition of these commitments over time includes the principle of \u201cno backsliding.\u201d While it is a non-legal aspect of the Agreement, it indicates that the current level of ambition is the baseline, and that for each review period countries should increase their ambition accordingly. 2.2 Using nature to support climate change mitigation and adaptation. The contribution of conservation and restoration of ecosystems to climate change mitigation and adaptation are often referred to as nature-based solutions for climate change8 or natural climate solutions.9 Sustainably managing natural extractive resources and agricultural lands along with restoring natural or modified ecosystems and conserving the intact systems offer opportunities to address the societal challenges of climate change. Simultaneously these actions provide human well-being and biodiversity co-benefits.10 Parties can develop their NDC mitigation actions and priorities based on a portfolio of measures including nature-based solutions. The role of ecosystems has been integrated in the UNFCCC since its adoption in 1992, in Art 4.1(d), when referring to the commitments of Parties in the Convention when \u201ctaking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities and their specific national and regional development priorities, objectives and circumstances.\u201d11 Promote sustainable management, and promote and cooperate in the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including biomass, forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial, coastal and marine ecosystems; As well as the need to address coastal areas through appropriate coastal zone management, in Art 4.1(e): Cooperate in preparing for adaptation to the impacts of climate change; develop and elaborate appropriate and integrated plans for coastal zone management, [\u2026]. The Paris Agreement reiterates \u2018the importance of the conservation and enhancement, as appropriate, of sinks and reservoirs of the greenhouse gases referred to in the Convention\u2019 (Art.5.1) and \u2018noting the importance of ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including oceans, and the protection of biodiversity\u2019 (preambula). 2 Introduction 8 Introduction sediments accrete vertically in response to rising sea level, when ecosystem health is maintained.18 Therefore, the rate of carbon sequestration and the size of the carbon sink may continue to increase over time. Adaptation Coastal wetlands play a unique role in protecting coastlines from the increasing impacts of climate change by absorbing incoming wave energy, providing storm surge protection, and preventing erosion. In some cases, coastal wetlands have proven to be more cost-effective than hard infrastructure like seawalls and levees, as they require less maintenance and may keep pace with sea level rise.19,20 Protecting coastal wetlands also comes with a suite of other co-benefits such as spawning grounds for commercial fish, water purification, and local livelihoods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f752221-e7e3-42e7-b7ce-de8ffe7de207": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f752221-e7e3-42e7-b7ce-de8ffe7de207", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Coastal blue carbon ecosystems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d678cd718ae5a048037c6eda2a47d2e62780ef679995d8af8c4182e26f1dd699"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd9dae77-8570-49c2-bc5e-182cb221fa85", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e94f195ad0f1b49f2e114728c088d76551e2e66a0840a2970b0bdb44bdadc4c"}}, "hash": "cc360ea88c1062d2c72bb695131dcfd758f88d079f71653e7ef495c41061d9e6", "text": "Climate impacts of coastal wetland losses Wetlands are being lost an alarming rate\u2014 faster than almost any other habitat on Earth\u2014primarily due to human activity.

Many interventions such as establishing protected areas, improving land tenure, and enforcing land-use laws can be put into place immediately and yield significant climate benefits. If we stopped loss of coastal wetlands today, we could prevent the release of over 0.45 Gt CO2 per year. Realistically, if we halted half of annual loss using interventions mentioned above, we would reduce emissions by a 0.23 Gt CO2 A significant nature-based solution comes from the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. Within this context and specific to the LULUCF sector as part of the UNFCCC, the role of coastal and marine ecosystems for climate mitigation, especially mangroves, has been described over the last couple of years.12,13 Other papers have already looked at NDCs in the context of nature-based solutions. Laurans et al. 201614 for example, indicated that 40 NDCs \u201chave placed nature-based solutions in a highly visible position. Most NDCs still fall very short of truly coherent mitigation and adaptation policy programs. The diversity and heterogeneity of the commitments made by the different countries mean that the question of the effective organisation of policies capable of implementing these commitments is still unresolved.\u201d 2.3 Coastal blue carbon. Mitigation and\ufffdadaptation\ufffdbenefits Conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems, specifically tidal salt marshes, seagrass meadows and mangrove forests, are excellent examples of nature- based solutions for climate mitigation and adaptation. These coastal ecosystems sequester and store huge amounts of carbon from our atmosphere, and are often referred to as blue carbon ecosystems. Coastal wetlands draw in carbon as they grow and transfer much of this into the rich organic soils held by their roots. 15 Mitigation Unlike terrestrial soils, the soils of blue carbon ecosystems are largely anaerobic (without oxygen). This means that the carbon incorporated into the soils decomposes very slowly and can be stored for hundreds or even thousands of years.16 Additionally, the high salinity in many blue carbon systems limits methane production, a potent GHG.17 Unlike their terrestrial and freshwater counterparts, blue carbon systems do not become saturated with carbon because 9 per year. This is equivalent to offsetting the 2013 emissions of Spain.24 Another significant opportunity for coastal wetlands is restoration. If coastal wetlands were restored to their 1990 extent, it would have the potential to increase annual carbon sequestration by 160Mt CO2 yr-1 or roughly equivalent to offsetting the burning of 77.4 million tonnes of coal.25 Additionally, it is estimated that it only takes 100 meters of mangroves to reduce wave height by 66%, providing a significant adaptation benefit.26 The loss of coastal habitats is often driven by development, which engenders sustainable development and environmental Introduction integrity challenges. The re-establishment of natural areas often means removing or abandoning existing development and related activities (such as aquaculture). Such initiatives require community support as well as providing economic alternatives for those communities affected. One example is that restoring coastal wetlands will increase fish populations and other extractive resources and could provide jobs as a viable alternative. 10 Blue carbon ecosystes in NDCs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "950d92ed-1e26-46de-9474-8a7718a7c893": {"__data__": {"id_": "950d92ed-1e26-46de-9474-8a7718a7c893", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Coastal blue carbon ecosystems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d9075abc6b99c7e21fd39764c39ca717dbcc48268e9f4d33d2e343f09bea899"}, "2": {"node_id": "09bbbba6-8dcc-4872-a3f8-c6e84a16542c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ce71913f260b18768d187685abc1811384458f569e93eae1ce109c5b5e7d522"}}, "hash": "9e8a289dc861a9cd99e99e613d737f7254bfea6aebbf7a302e92a09d7b872032", "text": "10 Blue carbon ecosystes in NDCs.

Given the lack of official standing and definition of blue carbon within the UNFCCC, the commitments made by these countries when referencing \u201cblue carbon\u201d in some cases could use further description and detail for implementation and broader understanding (e.g. does blue carbon refer to the mitigation potential, or does blue carbon refer to the three coastal carbon ecosystems\u2014mangroves, seagrasses, and saltmarshes\u2014and their broader benefits, including adaptation). It is important to note that many countries refer to coastal ecosystems, or the coastal zone in general, without using the term blue carbon or highlighting specific coastal ecosystems. In some cases, this may include coral reefs or bivalve ecosystems that are not considered coastal blue carbon ecosystems given their lack of mitigation potential. The report does not include countries that may have domestic programs or other international commitments that include blue carbon, but do not explicitly state these in their NDCs (see section 4). 3.1 Climate Mitigation Coastal wetlands as part of LULUCF and other forest commitments Human activities in coastal wetland ecosystems, whether leading to the sequestration and storage of carbon and acting as carbon sinks (e.g. through conservation efforts), or leading to GHG emissions and acting as carbon sources (e.g. through shrimp farms), can and should be included in countries\u2019 climate change mitigation efforts, and national GHG reports, respectively. Depending on a countries\u2019 national definition of \u2018forests\u2019, mangroves may be included in its overall forestry related activities, including Afforestation / Reforestation (A/R) or Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). Typically, countries talk about \u201cforests\u201d within the context of natural climate solutions for mitigation, without listing specific activities for individual forest types. Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) is a GHG inventory sector for countries to quantify and account for the emissions and removals of GHGs from terrestrial lands.

The 2013 IPCC Wetlands Supplement writes: \u201cCoastal wetlands generally consist of organic and mineral soils that are covered or saturated, for all or part of the year, by tidal freshwater, brackish or saline water and are vegetated by vascular plants. The boundary of coastal wetlands may extend to the landward extent of tidal inundation and may extend seaward to the maximum depth of vascular plant vegetation. Countries need to develop a nationally appropriate definition of coastal wetland taking into account national circumstances and capabilities. The coastal chapter (chapter 4) refers specifically to tidal freshwater and salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and mangroves\u201d. 12 Blue carbon ecosystes in NDCs.

An overview definition of terrestrial land, this may include coastal wetlands. The IPCC has issued guidance on including coastal wetlands but it is not mandatory (see Box 2). While many countries address LULUCF and REDD+ activities in their NDCs, reviewing these submissions does not give a clear indication whether coastal wetlands are actually included or not, unless a country specifies the ecosystem. Africa Angola in its LULUCF description, includes mangrove and wetlands. Afforestation and Reforestation of degraded forest lands and mangrove habitats have a strong potential for mitigation purposes and are part of Angola\u2019s Forest Carbon Options. Brunei includes mangroves as mitigation contributions from the Forestry and Land Use Sectors, as they sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The Republic of Guinea will reduce the anthropogenic deforestation pressures on mangroves (i.e. intensification of existing rice agriculture and alternative technologies to reduce wood as an energy source) to foster sustainable management and a more systematic reforestation effort, as part of a revised mangrove management plan (sch\u00e9ma directeur d\u2019am\u00e9nagement de la mangrove (SDAM). Senegal identifies mangrove restoration as a key part of their forestry activities. Specifically, Senegal commits to protecting and restoring 4,000 ha of mangrove each year starting in 2017. Americas The Bahamas discusses its Forestry Act, which allows for dedicated management areas, which will be subject to a management plan for environmental conservation. Proper management is expected to improve the functionality of their mangrove ecosystems and increase their carbon sink ability. The Bahamas may be considered for inclusion in REDD+ activities, pending further study. El Salvador has a goal to establish and manage one million ha of forest, including mangroves. Guyana Includes mangroves in its Avoided Deforestation section under the Emission Reduction Programme. Haiti, in terms of mitigation, commits to protect, conserve and enlarge 19,500ha of mangrove forests from now until 2030. Suriname, under its Forest Mitigation section, highlights its Readiness efforts on REDD+, including the preparation of a draft law for the protection of the mangrove forest along the North Atlantic coast of Suriname. Promoting the dual role of adaptation/mitigation, it is looking to promote sedimentation and subsequent mangrove regeneration to increase mangrove forest stock and carbon sequestration. The United States intends to include all categories of emissions by sources and removals by sinks, and all pools and gases (which would include wetlands), as reported in the Inventory of United States Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks; to account for the land sector using a net- net approach; and to use a \u201cproduction approach\u201d to account for harvested wood products consistent with IPCC guidance. Asia Bangladesh list the \u201ccontinuation of coastal mangrove plantation\u201dii as part of their LULUCF Mitigation actions. However, it is important to note that in this commitment they do not specify how the plantation will be constructed. The Philippines recognize that marine ecosystems can play a crucial role, including through blue carbon, as joint mitigation and adaption efforts. Some of these ecosystem contributions are articulated in the Philippine ii Mangrove ecologists warn that just planting man- groves will not mimic a natural forest without addi- tional interventions. So while plantations will increase sequestration they may be detrimental to the natural ecosystem around the mangrove plantation. 14 National REDD Plus Strategy and the recently updated Philippine Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. Sri Lanka is increasing their forest cover, including the conservation and management of mangrove and wetland ecosystems. Oceania Australia intends to apply the IPCC 2006 Guidelines and IPCC 2013 Revised Supple- mentary Methods, which include coastal wetlands to lower CO2 emissions by 26 to 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Europe Iceland includes wetland restoration as part of its climate change efforts, and pos- sibly other LULUCF activities, but whether this includes coastal wetlands is unknown and would need further analysis of national activities.27 Coastal wetlands as part of general miti- gation aims In the broader context of \u201cprotection of carbon sinks,\u201d 15 countries mention wet- lands as an opportunity to enhance carbon sequestration and/or protect carbon sinks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "352b611d-acfb-4aaf-9c5f-d0271454cb78": {"__data__": {"id_": "352b611d-acfb-4aaf-9c5f-d0271454cb78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Coastal blue carbon ecosystems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed518862615998f6e89abe452cf94f4663c9ab68472c241a11f2dda347cd61c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ea0b9de-4cef-434d-8459-4ab3e1a66f88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff03bc006893fd5be6aaee0a99b82f77ac524a46dfdf65de4c2ddf074250ab3b"}}, "hash": "e352da0885cf0c849ee079604967caacee6363f93c72f6a9a6a71c6774987a0b", "text": "It\u2019s important to note the term \u201cwetlands\u201d does not necessarily specify the inclusion of mangroves, seagrasses and saltmarshes.

The Seychelles, while not including the offsetting capacity of ocean biomass and marine ecosystems (or blue carbon) in their mitigation assessment and calculation, the Seychelles acknowledge blue carbon and leave ample room for enhancing their efforts and ambition in their next NDC. Americas Antigua and Barbuda under their conditional mitigation targets committed by 2030, all remaining wetlands and watershed areas with carbon sequestration potential are protected as carbon sinks. Belize will protect existing mangroves from deforestation and restore lost mangroves. The restoration and protection will avoid current emissions of around 11.2Gg CO2 per year and remove additional 2.2 \u2013 35Gg CO2 per year between 2020 and 2030. The expected cumulative emissions reduction would be up to 379Gg CO2 between 2015 and 2030. In Ecuador, ecosystem and forest protection as well as the strengthening of the national protected areas systems are seen to play a crucial role for the combat of climate change. (Note: The INDC is not clear if these activities are primarily for adaptation or mitigation action.) Mexico describes the need to increase carbon capture and strengthen coastal protection through conservation and recovery of coastal and marine ecosystems, such as coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass and dunes in its Ecosystem-Based Adaptation section. Asia Bahrain identifies a Mangrove Transplantation Project to rehabilitate degraded coastal areas by cultivating and planting mangrove seedlings, which began in 2013, as an adaptation action with mitigation co-benefits. Bahrain recognises the need for proper management of particular habitats that act as critical natural carbon sinks, and notes that seagrass beds, which constitute an important carbon sink, are distributed along Bahrain\u2019s southeast and west coasts and specifically describes them with the term \u201cblue carbon\u201d.

An overview China aims to increase carbon sinks and sequestration in natural environments, including through the stronger protection and restoration of wetlands, but whether this includes coastal wetlands is unknown and would need further analysis of national activities. The United Arab Emirates dedicates a section of its NDC to \u201cWetlands, Coastal and Marine Environment Conservation (Blue Carbon).\u201d The UAE is also undergoing significant restoration and plantation efforts of both mangroves and seagrass, supporting ecosystem-based adaptation as well as climate mitigation. The Abu Dhabi Blue Carbon Demonstration Project, which quantified, mapped and identified policy applications for blue carbon in the Emir of Abu Dhabi, has been expanded to a National Blue Carbon Project. Oceania The Cook Islands include actions in coastal protection, forestry and marine conservation as those which will reduce and offset carbon emissions as well as strengthen resilience. Kiribati is looking at mangrove forest enhancement with a mitigation potential of 7,080 tCO2e in 2025. Marshall Islands considers mangrove rehabilitation to be an adaptation action with mitigation co-benefits, including enhancing carbon sinks.

The paper reflects on those countries which support specific efforts in the coastal zone. Some countries speak in broader terms about biodiversity or ecosystems. Those references are not reflected here. To date 53 countries have included the conservation and restoration of coastal ecosystems as an adaptation strategy. Some refer to ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) (see Box 3) in coastal areas, other talk more specifically about restoration or rehabilitation efforts in mangroves or seagrasses. While blue carbon ecosystems are featured explicitly (especially mangroves) in some countries\u2019 adaptation portfolios and priorities, the type and form of application varies. In the NDCs, countries mainly refer to coastal ecosystems or the coastal zones as a whole. Although, 22 countries make reference more specifically to planning or zoning related efforts such as coastal zone management. Conserved and restored coastal blue carbon ecosystems also play an important role for sustainable fisheries management. While the NDCs are not very clear how blue carbon ecosystems are used for adaptation solutions in the fisheries sector, the paper nevertheless lists those 17 countries highlighting the fisheries sector as a priority adaptation sector as there could be co- mitigation benefits. Some countries are listed in this adaptation chapter in more than one category if they have, for example, provided extensive details on their adaptation measures and plans in their NDC. Coastal wetlands as part of conservation, protection and restoration efforts Several countries recognize in general terms the value of coastal and marine ecosystems, or wetlands, without identifying a particular coastal ecosystem, or providing specific examples or plans of how to manage these systems for climate change adaptation. Other countries provide more specific information regarding on-going plans around conservation and management, protection, and reforestation or rehabilitation measures of coastal ecosystems. Such countries include Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belize, Benin, Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Republic of Congo, Cook Islands, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Cuba, Djibouti, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Lebanon, Liberia, Madagascar, Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Myanmar, Nauru, Niue, Oman, Philippines, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Seychelles, Singapore, Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Uruguay, Venezuela and Vietnam.

Blue carbon ecosystes in NDCs. An overview 18 Blue carbon ecosystes in NDCs. An overview Egypt recognizes that adaptation options for coastal zones are highly site-dependent. However, changes in land use, integrated coastal zone management, and proactive planning for protecting coastal zones are necessary adaptation policies. Asia Bangladesh outlines community based conservation of wetlands and coastal areas as an adaptation measure, and intends to work on Coastal Zone Management. India has demarcated vulnerable areas on the coasts and declared them as Coastal Regulation Zones (CRZ) with restrictions imposed on setting up and expansion of industries, operations and processes. India is also implementing programmes including Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM); protecting coastal livelihoods through \u2018Mangroves for the Future\u2019 (coordinated by IUCN); an Island Protection Zone (IPZ) which focuses on disaster risk reduction through bio shields with local vegetation (mangroves) and other soft protection measures; and the conservation of beaches and sand dunes.

A specific program listed in several NDCs is (Integrated) Coastal Zone Management (CZM), a process for the management of the coast that considers all aspects of the coastal zone, including geographical and political boundaries, to achieve sustainability. In several NDCs, countries have referenced CZM or similar processes in relation to land- use planning, creation of ecological buffer zones, and establishing protected inland zones to accommodate coastal wetlands. Such countries include Bangladesh, Belize, Cambodia, Cameroon, Egypt, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Georgia, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Liberia, Malaysia, Morocco, Myanmar, Niue, Saint Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Vanuatu. Country Highlights (see Appendix for all countries): Africa Morocco identifies protection of populations through risk-prevention, particularly in the most vulnerable areas such as coastal zones, as an ultimate objective, and plans to implement this through the National Strategy for Integrated Coastal Management, amongst others. 19 Blue carbon ecosystes in NDCs. An overview Country Highlights (see Appendix for all countries): Africa Cape Verde seeks to promote an ocean- based (\u201cblue\u201d) economy by, among others, supporting new techniques of aquaculture, improving quality of fishery products through ecolabelling, and promoting sustainable coastal and maritime tourism and sports. Mauritius is looking into climate smart fisheries through the development and implementation of sustainable fishing management plans, the strengthening of institutional capacity and adaptation of infrastructure to climate change . Asia Oman wants to address adaption needs in the fisheries and marine environment. Americas For Haiti sustainable fisheries management is a priority adaptation sector. 3.3 Mitigation and adaptation. Coastal wetlands to create synergies While tropical forests and other forest types, besides mangroves, tend to be highly \u201cvalued\u201d in terms of their mitigation potential, coastal ecosystems have been more widely recognised for adaptation\u2013 see above section. The synergies, or co-benefits, between mitigation and adaptation using nature- based solutions have become increasingly clear. This is represented at different levels throughout the NDCs. For coastal systems, these synergies have overlapping benefits. This is particularly relevant for countries that are already including the value of coastal ecosystem zone management for adaptation. If habitats are being restored for adaptation there is associated natural carbon removal, and thus direct mitigation benefits. In recognition of this, a few countries include coastal ecosystems as examples of synergies between mitigation and adaptation approaches. For countries that only consider adaptation benefits of coastal habitats, there is an opportunity to include relevant activities in their coastal (blue) carbon ecosystems (mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses) in their mitigation ambitions, if relevant and as appropriate (see for recommendations in chapter 5). Countries that have identified blue carbon ecosystems as adaptation opportunities with mitigation co-benefits include: Such countries that have acknowledged coastal synergies include: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahrain, Belize, Cook Islands, Madagascar, Marshall Islands, Mexico Philippines, St Lucia, Saudi Arabia, Suriname and Togo. 21 Beyond NDCs. Other blue carbon efforts around the world. Some UNFCCC Parties with large blue carbon ecosystems have not specifically mentioned related ongoing or planned mitigation and/or adaptation efforts in their NDC. However, this does not mean that these countries are not pursuing nature- based solutions for coastal mitigation and/or adaptation. Countries might have chosen deliberately to broadly talk about \u201cecosystems\u201d and not call out specific ones. Or it could reflect that these countries have not put an emphasis on blue carbon efforts. In many cases, these countries have used blue carbon ecosystems within other climate reporting and planning mechanisms such as National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), or National Adaptation Plans of Actions (NAPAs), or are trying to develop National Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs) on Blue Carbon, for example the Dominican Republic. Work done by several stakeholders on the national, sub-national or local level shows activities, both in terms of policy development and implementation, are well underwayiii. iii To read about more carbon related projects see: UNEP/GEF Blue Forests Project and the Blue Carbon Initiative The list below is simply to highlight those Parties that have made official commitments to coastal wetlands in terms of mitigation using other mechanisms besides NDCs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dfac988d-2411-47f1-acb3-847176b8b69b": {"__data__": {"id_": "dfac988d-2411-47f1-acb3-847176b8b69b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Coastal blue carbon ecosystems", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d846fd4fe8504d181e5b9d5e3e1177cb92e2829e78ffec7664aba5a477326ef2"}, "2": {"node_id": "b564dd3e-ccb9-4284-9c91-84969fcf1187", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/coastal-blue-carbon-ecosystems", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5f5f2f248aa1b64ac50c3d6b8f878257595aeb6371c131dfac1f76b5ac3b6c5"}}, "hash": "39094f6e309f3c7ab06bfafda92cbbcca72e77dbf5842d7661eb714a08ff821e", "text": "Countries include: Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Canada, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Iran, Japan, Kenya, Mozambique, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Panama, Qatar, Samoa, Tuvalu, Trinidad and Tobago, Yemen. 4 Beyond NDCs.

In adaptation it is 39% of Parties with coastal wetlands ecosystems. Enhancing ambition by ending conversion and restoring coastal wetlands to their 1990 distributions could reduce emissions by 0.6 GtCO2e. Using the growing knowledge of various policy applications, from project findings and sources of finance for blue carbon activities, Parties now have an opportunity to include such actions into their revised, and more ambitious, future NDCs (see Table 2). Mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses not only play a significant role for coastal EbA, but if managed properly, contribute to climate change mitigation. Conversly, if mismanaged or destroyed, they contribute to increased GHG emissions. To date, coastal wetlands are typically featured or referred to very visibly and clearly in an adaptation context, including in the existing NDCs.

While single projects can lead to much bigger programmatic efforts, and are useful to pilot ideas, future NDCs would benefit from outlining coastal adaptation and mitigation efforts in the broader policy contexts of, for example, coastal zone management or, in the case of mangroves, including efforts within national REDD+ strategies.

Guidance in the IPCC 2013 Wetlands Supplement details how to account for these systems including default values for emissions and removals. Efforts are underway in several countries and will provide feedback on the Supplement in 201730. In future NDCs and national GHG inventory submissions, Parties could highlight whether coastal wetlands, as part of the IPCC Wetlands Supplement, are part of their inventories. Mangroves in forest mechanisms: Mangrove conservation and restoration efforts are already incorporated in UNFCCC forest mechanisms such as REDD+ and as part of LULUCF activities if a country defines mangroves as a forest. If soils are a significant source or sink as defined using IPCC key category analysis, like in mangrove forests, soil carbon will be included in REDD+ or LULUCF. As Parties review opportunities for the revised NDC, there is an opportunity to highlight mangroves in this context. NAMAs: NAMAs (Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions) are opportunities for developing countries to conduct climate mitigation projects that also have a focus on social benefits. NAMAs include blue carbon efforts in land-use change, conservation and restoration activities in coastal ecosystems. 5 Where next with blue carbon within the NDC process 24 Available\ufffdclimate\ufffdfinance\ufffdmechanisms\ufffdand\ufffdapplications Given the multiple social benefits provided by coastal wetlands, these ecosystems are well positioned to be included. Parties that embark on developing a NAMA with blue carbon elements could use the opportunity during the consideration of a revised NDC to reference these efforts. Adaptation NDC Opportunities. NAPs/NAPAs: Nationally Adaptation Programs for Action (NAPAs) provide a process to respond to urgent and immediate needs of Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to adapt to climate change. National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) enable Parties to identify medium- and long-term adaptation needs and develop and implement strategies and programmes to address those needs. Coastal wetlands are already considered by many Parties within their NAPs/NAPAs. In future NDCs, Parties could use the opportunity to highlight how their NAPs/NAPAs are already, or will manage coastal ecosystems for climate adaptation. 25 A refned look for blue carbon efforts in future NDCs. A conlsusion This review of the existing NDCs has shown that coastal ecosystems, and the use of nature-based solutions, already figure into Parties\u2019 submitted climate change ambitions, particularly with regards to addressing climate adaptation. Looking ahead, there are significant opportunities highlighted in this report that exist for further inclusion of coastal carbon ecosystems (mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrasses) into NDCs. As countries increase their ambition in future commitments, a bigger effort should be made to promote the integration of coastal carbon systems as part of (1) mitigation ambitions and (2) in a synergistic and programmatic coastal management approach with adaptation and mitigation considerations. To date, coastal carbon systems have not been uniformly integrated into climate change plans, especially within mitigation actions, as demonstrated in this analysis. In general, the three blue carbon systems \u2013 mangroves, seagrasses, and saltmarshes \u2013 exist in the UNFCCC mitigation context within multiple definitions and categories, and related climate actions are implemented differently per country. Given the lack of a common definition of blue carbon mitigation activities it is not always easy to decipher when its included in the NDC. In this regard, more work is needed to clearly articulate work on coastal carbon ecosystems into the NDCs and more broadly. In several Parties\u2019 NDC adaptation sections, blue carbon ecosystems are referred to as carbon sinks or noted for their high carbon sequestration ability. This, combined with the multiple references to the recognition of adaptation and mitigation synergies in nature-based solutions to climate change, show the dual importance of coastal ecosystems for addressing climate change but also the combination of adaptation and mitigation objectives.

In each place MAVA has helped build extensive conservation capacity, to create and support conservation institutions and influence policy. The fourth programme, the Sustainable Economy, provides opportunities to affect global trends and have an impact that goes beyond MAVA priority regions. The programme explores how to ensure economic prosperity, within the resources of one planet, addressing the issue of overconsumption of natural resources beyond their capacity to regenerate.

The Ministry of Environment is the main responsible institution for nature conservation, with the mandate to develop and implement policies related to conservation of nature, environmental protection and sustainable use of natural resources including sustainable management of forests and pastures. The Ministry\u2019s Directorate for Biodiversity and Protected Areas employs seven experts. In January 2014, the Albanian government established the State Inspectorate of Environment, Forests and Waters as a structural agency of the Ministry of Environment. The State Inspectorate consists of twelve regional branches. With 130 forestry police experts and about 300 employees, the State Inspectorate is responsible for inspections related to prevention and control of pollution. The National Agency of Protected Areas is the youngest state institution in Albania, founded in 2015 by the Decision of Council of Ministers No.102. It reports to the Ministry of Environment and its mandate is the protection of biodiversity through protected area management, collection and distribution of information, environmental education, public awareness raising, Meandres of river Drin, Albania \u00a9 Foto-Migawki MD_Shutterstock.com 2 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE and providing support to sustainable activities in protected areas. Direct management of protected areas is practiced by the newly established Regional Administration of Protected Areas, which reports to the National Agency of Protected Areas. The National Environmental Agency, established in 2014, employs one expert in protected areas and ten experts in forestry and pastures. Its key mandate is to monitor the state of the environment, prepare relevant reports, including reporting to the European Environment Agency, obtain scientific research and gather and distribute environmental information. With the new reform, the Regional Directorates of Forestry Service, responsible for forest and wild fauna administration and control, were transferred from the Ministry of Environment to the local government (municipalities) during 2016.

Transposition of EU Nature Directives As the EU Candidate country, Albania has worked on the alignment of its laws with the EU legal regulations, namely the EU Habitats and Birds Directives. Approximately 98% of the Habitats Directive has been transposed into the national legal framework through Law no. 9868 (2008) (which amends the 2002 Law \u2018On protected areas\u2019) and Law no. 68 (2014). Full transposition is expected soon, since a set of bylaws has already been prepared by the Ministry of Environment. The EU Birds Directive has been transposed at about 92%, mainly through the Law no. 10006 \u2018On the protection of wild fauna\u2019 and the Law no. 10253 \u2018On hunting\u2019 and bylaws.

The Ministry of Environment has been coordinating the preparation of the new National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2014\u20132020), following the guidance of the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 and the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, and ensuring also full alignment with other sectoral strategies, including spatial planning, water, energy, forestry, agriculture, transport and infrastructure. This document, formally known as the Document of Strategic Policies for the Protection of Biodiversity in Albania, was officially approved by a Decision of the Council of Ministers in January 2016. The Action Plan includes national objectives such as designating 17% of terrestrial and 6% of marine and coastal protected areas by 2020, fully transposing the EU acquis on nature conservation by 2020, and rehabilitating at least 15% of degraded areas through restoration and implementation of management plans for protected areas. However, the lack of efficient coordination among sectors remains a major threat to the integration of biodiversity policy into other sectoral policies and strategies. 1.3 Protected areas Protected area coverage Protected areas in Albania cover 4,775.65 km\u00b2 or 16.6% of the country\u2019s territory (Figure 1). There has been a significant increase in the surface of protected areas compared to 2005, when only 5.2% of the Albanian territory was protected. Albania has 800 protected areas, with a large majority designated as nature monuments (750), while the largest territory is under the category of national park (7.32%). Other protected areas are categorised throughout the remaining four national protected area categories, i.e. strict nature reserve, nature managed reserve, protected landscape, and multiple use area (Table 2). Table 2 shows the surface of protected areas in each protection category, indicating a large underrepresentation of marine protected areas, covering about 2% of the marine area. As highlighted in the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2014\u20132020), the government foresees expansion of the protected area network to cover 17% of the Albanian territory by 2020.

Meanwhile, inspection tasks remain under the Forestry Police of the Ministry of Environment\u2019s State Inspectorate on Environment and Forests.

Karavasta Lagoon, Butrint and Albanian Prespa Lakes are all national parks, while Lake Shkodra is a nature managed reserve and Buna River is a landscape protected area. Apart from the international recognition through the Ramsar Convention, Prespa is also included in the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The Ohrid-Prespa Transboundary Biosphere Reserve (Ohrid is located in Macedonia) was established in 2014 to recognize cooperation between Albanian and Macedonian authorities in the management of the site. Twelve protected areas are listed as Birdlife\u2019s Important Bird Areas. 1.4 Ecological networks Natura 2000 As a non-EU Member, Albania is not part of the Natura 2000 network. However, being recently accepted as a Candidate State, Albania has been undertaking all legislative action relevant for setting up the Natura 2000 network. The IPA 2013 project, \u2018Strengthening national capacity in nature protection\u2014Preparation for Natura 2000 network\u2019 commenced in 2015 to help Albanian authorities start the process of identification of Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation, to form part of the future Natura 2000 network. Emerald Network Identification of Areas of Special Conservation Interest to form part of the Emerald Network took place from 2002\u20132008. The result was a list containing 25 proposed Areas of Special Conservation Interest, covering 17.8% of the country\u2019s territory. The proposed sites were accepted by the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention in 2011 (Figure 2). Shkodra, Albania \u00a9 B.Erg IUCN Photo \u00a9 B.

Even within the higher vertebrates such as mammals, data on some species are scarce and incomplete (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97187c8e-719f-48d2-a4a3-8c1e93674dea": {"__data__": {"id_": "97187c8e-719f-48d2-a4a3-8c1e93674dea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summary of national assessments of the state of nature conservation systems in South-Eastern Europe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db448a7bbedbc68a8695d67aeeffc836500c3a61e5fb30a6c89e1957c2e15fa0"}, "2": {"node_id": "274cfde0-162e-408b-98f5-4643a8ece320", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "224ab7f118c10795dc4284043a717c5f4e6c40580da505a0fcf8e67882c77b97"}}, "hash": "ce489a8ae2a43a1a3037641cd1ab9f60491a17a1e873503874da431dfb34c675", "text": "bats) and many species have been given the status \u2018Data Deficient\u2019. Available Red Books are: Red Book of Threatened and Rare Plants of Albania (1995), Red Book of Threatened Plants, Plant Associations and Animals (1997) and Red Book of Threatened Fauna of Albania (2006). Species management and action plans There are a number of species action plans, while some species conservation programmes and projects are under implementation. The action plans for brown bear (Ursus arctos), lynx (Lynx lynx), Pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmaeus), marine mammals (cetaceans) and Neptune grass (Posidonia oceanica) were all prepared in 2007, while the action plan for marine turtles and their habitats was approved in 2012.

Some of the critical threats to biodiversity are prohibited activities, such as illegal hunting, fishing, and overexploitation of natural resources leading to deforestation. Illegal hunting has led to a declining trend of the population of wild species, in particular birds, which for the most part are migratory birds. For almost two decades, the government has been working to find a means of efficient control. Finally, in 2014, the Parliament of Albania passed the law \u2018On moratorium of hunting\u2019 to last for two years, with the aim of minimising pressures on biodiversity. Controlling illegal fishing and overuse of marine resources remain some of the priority issues. In order to better control the overexploitation of forests, a series of measures were introduced, such as the prohibition of timber exports from Albania. Urbanization, including illegal building of infrastructure, remains a significant problem in some parts of the country, and poses a threat to the environment. Together with industrial development, uncontrolled development of the energy sector and mining, alteration of river courses and hydro-technical works, development of the transport network, pollution generated by diverse sources, soil erosion, and uncontrolled tourism development, are among the more recent threats to biodiversity. Tourism related infrastructure has had adverse impact on the fragile coastal and marine areas in the country. 1.7 Valuation of ecosystem services Ecosystem valuation in Albania is almost non-existent. However, certain initiatives have been undertaken to map and assess ecosystems and their services (the following overview is based on Burbidge et al., 2015). One of them is the introduction of payment for ecosystem services, started in 2014 by the Ministry of Environment and involving the Institute of Nature Conservation. This initiative aims to develop carbon sequestration projects and develop payment for watershed services schemes. Another initiative is linked to the project \u2018Afforestation and reforestation project activities: Assisted natural regeneration of degraded lands in Albania\u2019, started in 2004 by the Albanian Ministry of Environment, with the Forestry and Water Administration, Italian Ministry for the Environment and Territory, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as the trustee of the BioCarbon Fund. The planned duration of the project is 60 years and it focuses on ecosystem services, carbon storage and grazing. 10 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE \u2018Transboundary Mountain Massifs of Prokletije/Bjeshk\u00ebt e Namuna in Montenegro and Albania: Assessment of the Most Valuable Areas for Biodiversity\u2019 was developed as part of the IUCN\u2019s project \u2018Sustaining rural communities and their traditional landscapes through strengthened environmental governance in transboundary protected areas of the Dinaric Arc\u2019 financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Finland. The ecosystem services covered were grazing, erosion control, non-timber forest products and cultural services. The project \u2018Support to local communities to establish regional protected areas: Assessment of the most valuable areas for biodiversity within Uleza commune and opportunities for ecotourism development\u2019, coordinated by the Institute for Nature Conservation in Albania, aimed to identify areas important for human well-being depending on biodiversity and thus to collect information on different ecosystem services provided in the study area (e.g. wood production and non-timber forest products). 1.8 Nature information system Data on nature conservation in Albania is contained within the Environmental Information Monitoring System, managed by the National Environmental Agency. This system was built through the project \u2018Consolidation of environmental monitoring system in Albania\u2019; however, it is currently non- functional. The Ministry of Environment expects to have a functional protected area database system in place in 2017. It will serve mainly for data concerning the network of protected areas, but will also host other relevant information on nature conservation in the country. 1.9 Financing nature conservation Nature conservation in Albania is largely financed by the state budget and donor contributions (Table 5). Despite the latest increase in financing from the state budget, as seen in Figure 3, donor contributions still represent the majority of overall financing.

However, frequent changes, removal and replacement of staff engaged in nature conservation and protected area administration caused by political rotations, make the progress in capacity building rather weak and unsustainable. Furthermore, the employees of nature conservation institutions are limited both in number and qualifications. To date, almost all employees have been foresters and forest technicians, with limited qualification for working in nature conservation sector. There are almost no conservation biologists, terrestrial and marine ecologists, communication officers, managers or similar professions to efficiently address nature conservation issues inside and outside of protected areas. Therefore, a holistic approach is needed in the reform of the nature conservation sector and administration and management of protected areas in Albania. Some of the main capacity development needs relate to the following areas: \u2022\ufffd Management of protected areas, with special focus on marine protected areas \u2022\ufffd Establishment of effective protected area administration and staffing \u2022\ufffd Zoning of protected areas \u2022\ufffd Monitoring of biodiversity and data management \u2022\ufffd Visitor management and protected area interpretation \u2022\ufffd Establishing partnerships in the management of protected areas \u2022\ufffd Financing nature conservation \u2022\ufffd Raising public awareness and media relations \u2022\ufffd Nature conservation and wildlife management in areas beyond protected areas. 12 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE 2 Bosnia and Herzegovina Azra Velagi\u0107, Dejan Rado\u0161evi\u0107, Sara Todorovi\u0107 2.1 Overview of institutions BiH consists of two entities, Federation of BiH and the Republic of Srpska, and one district, Br\u010dko, while Federation of BiH is further administratively structured through ten cantons. According to the BiH Constitution, jurisdiction over environmental issues is responsibility of the institutions within the two entities. However, based on the Law on Ministries and Other Administration Bodies of BiH (2003), jurisdiction over certain tasks related to nature conservation was allocated to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of BiH, which functions at the state level. This report provides an overview of institutions responsible for nature conservation at state, entity, and cantonal levels. The overview does not include the district of Br\u010dko as it has no designated protected areas. State institutions The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of BiH is the central institution that defines policies, coordinates activities and harmonizes plans of entity bodies with relevant plans at the international level in the fields of agriculture, energy, environmental protection, development and use of natural resources, and tourism. Two institutions function within this Ministry, which deal with nature conservation to a greater or lesser extent: \u2022\ufffd Administration of BiH for Plant Health Protection\u2014responsible for coordination of policy regarding protection of plant species and coordination of alignment of the state legislation with the provisions of the International Plant Protection Convention Photo \u00a9 Republi\u010dki zavod za za\u0161titu kulturno-istorijskog i prirodnog nalje\u0111a 13 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE \u2022\ufffd Veterinary Office of BiH\u2014works on the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of the overall veterinary medicine service in BiH and partially regulates conservation by preventive veterinary medicine. The Agency for Statistics of BiH is responsible for providing and maintaining statistical data on the environment. According to Federal Ministry of Environment and Tourism (2014), there is no single institution responsible for collecting, keeping and analysing biodiversity-related data at the state or entity level.

Its Environment Sector employs two nature conservation experts. The Ministry carries out administrative and professional tasks related to air, water and soil protection, monitoring and setting environment standards, development of environmental strategies and policies and tourism development. The Environmental Protection Fund is the central institution for collecting and distributing financial resources for nature conservation in the Federation of BiH. It provides support for the preparation, development and implementation of programmes and projects in nature conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, among other areas. Although there is no institute for nature conservation at the entity level, there is an institute whose scope of work includes the protection of natural heritage at the cantonal level\u2014 the Institute for the Protection of Cultural-Historical and Natural Heritage of Sarajevo Canton. However, the Institute lacks capacity for nature protection activities as indicated by only one employee working on the protection of natural heritage. Nevertheless, significant activities and projects have been undertaken in recent years in the Sarajevo Canton, such as the development of a Management Plan for the Trebevi\u0107 Protected Landscape, development of the expert analysis for protection of the Bentba\u0161a Protected Landscape, and implementation of the projects \u2018The situation analysis and review of the protected areas of the Sarajevo Canton (in line with the new Law on Nature Protection of the Federation of BiH)\u2019 and \u2018Analysis and measures for the protection for all individual natural monuments\u2019.

Laws at the entity level The central law governing nature conservation in the Federation of BiH is the Nature Protection (2013).

In the Republic of Srpska, the Law on Nature Protection was adopted in 2014. Some of the other acts relevant for nature conservation are: Law on Water (2006), Law on Freshwater Fisheries (2006), Law on Hunting (2006), Law on Forests (2008), Law on the Environmental Protection (2012), Law on Sutjeska National Park (2012), and Law on Kozara National Park (2012). Both entities have also passed Natura 2000 Regulation to guide the definition of the status of areas that are not protected but are important from the biodiversity point of view. There are discrepancies in the legislation between the two entities, and between the federal and cantonal levels, hindering effective planning and management of protected areas in BiH. Transposition of the EU Nature Directives BiH has transposed 78% of the EU Birds Directive and 82% the Habitats Directive. There is a substantial set of sub-legal acts prepared and pending adoption.

The Action Plan identified short- and long- term priorities in the field of environment, recognizing biodiversity conservation as one of the priorities in BiH. The first National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan of BiH was prepared for the period of 2008\u20132015, and adopted only in 2011. In 2013, BiH started preparing the second National Strategy for the period 2015\u20132020, which is planned to be aligned with the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020. Currently, there are 21 national targets drafted, while a set of indicators is proposed for each national target. All national goals are clearly defined, including the action plan for their implementation and achievement. The goals and indicators might still be amended by the time the Strategy is completed and adopted by the Council of Ministries in BiH.

The Federal Strategy also adopted the ecosystem approach. No information is available on the degree of compliance between adopted strategies and other sectoral strategies (e.g. spatial planning, water, forestry, agriculture, etc.). Republic of Srpska In addition to the regional strategic document (Strategy for the Implementation of the Framework Agreement on the Sava River Basin), other strategic documents at the level of the Republic of Srpska include: \u2022\ufffd Amendments to the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Srpska to 2025 \u2022\ufffd Strategies for the protection of nature of the Republic of Srpska \u2022\ufffd Development Strategy of the Republic of Srpska (in progress). These strategies are mostly not aligned with other sectoral strategies and there seems to be limited motivation and capacity to use the ecosystem approach in planning. 2.3 Protected areas Protected area coverage There are 30 protected areas in BiH, covering 1,062.82 km\u00b2, which is 2.07% of the BiH territory (Figure 4).. According to the former legal regulations, 153 protected areas were designated in BiH, though the majority were left without legal protection after the adoption of new nature protection laws in both entities. More detailed information on the number and surface of protected areas in each entity is provided in Table 8 and Table 9. According to the Environmental Protection Strategy of the Federation of BiH and the draft Spatial Plan of the Federation of BiH (2008\u20132028), the authorities in the Federation of BiH plan to establish 12 new protected areas and thus enlarge the surface of the protected areas to 17% of the entity\u2019s territory in total (see Figure 5). New protected areas in plan include four national parks, five nature monuments and six protected landscapes. In the Republic of Srpska, the authorities also envisage enlarging the area covered by protected areas. Based on the Spatial Plan of the Republic of Srpska, plans are in place to protect 15% of the entity\u2019s territory. The protected area management category system is complex, as it is based on the legal regulations in each entity. Both systems have six categories that are relatively easily comparable (Table 10).

STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Procedure for designating protected areas Federation of BiH According to the Law on Nature Protection, the procedure for designating protected areas in the Federation of BiH depends on the management category of the protected area and its location within the administratively divided units (Table 11). Each protected area is expected to be designated by an individual law, ensuring the geographic boundaries are precisely described and determined and the category of the protected area is assigned. The boundaries should be determined in accordance with the draft Spatial Plan of Federation of BiH (2008\u20132028) and the Law on Physical Planning and Land Use of Federation of BiH. If the proposed protected area straddles both entities of BiH, the proposal for the protection must be submitted by the two ministries, the Federal Ministry of Environment and Tourism and the Ministry for Spatial Planning, Civil Engineering and Ecology, in accordance with the Inter-Entity Steering Committee for the Environment. The establishment of protected areas at the entity or cantonal levels can be carried out with the consent of the municipal councils where the protected area is located (Table 11). Table 11 Authorities responsible for the establishment of protected areas in the Federation of BiH Protected area category (Federation of BiH) Responsible authority Ia Parliament of the Federation of BiH Inter-entity Steering Committee (if the protected area straddles two entities) Ib II IIIa IIIb Cantonal Assembly Parliament of the Federation of BiH (if the protected area straddles two entities) IV Va Vb VI Republic of Srpska National parks in the Republic of Srpska are proclaimed by the Assembly of the Republic of Srpska. The government proclaims protected areas in the categories Ia, Ib, IV and V at the proposal of the relevant ministry and after having obtained the opinion of other competent ministries. Municipalities, after the competent ministry\u2019s approval and opinion by the Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage, may proclaim protected areas in the categories III and VI. Protected area management planning Federation of BiH In the Federation of BiH, 6 of the 10 protected areas have adopted management plans, including the only national park, Una (Table 12). There is a new management plan under development for the Trebevi\u0107 Protected Landscape, while \u2018Temporary Control Guidelines for Trebevi\u0107 Protected Landscape\u2019 currently acts as the guiding document until the the management plan is officially adopted. 22 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Table 12 Protected area management plans in the Federation of BiH Management plan for protected area Timeframe Una National Park 2011\u20132021 Blidinje Nature Park 2011\u20132021 Hutovo Blato Nature Park 2014\u20132024 Skakavac Nature Monument 2011\u20132021 Vrelo Bosne Nature Monument 2007\u20132017 Bijambare Protected Landscape 2008\u20132018 Republic of Srpska In the Republic of Srpska, management plans are currently effective for four protected areas (Table 13).

This project marked a significant contribution to raising knowledge and public awareness about nature in BiH and the importance of Natura 2000. Emerald Network The identification of the Emerald Network sites in BiH was carried out through two projects funded by the Council of Europe. The pilot project \u2018Establishment of the Emerald Network in BiH\u2019 (2004\u20132006) resulted with identification of 11 Areas 23 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE of Special Conservation Interest, covering 1.8% of the country\u2019s territory. The list of sites, including its habitat types was developed as one of the results of the project. The Council of Europe decided to extend the pilot project with a second project which resulted in a detailed overview of species in the Areas of Special Conservation Interest. During this project, 17 more potential areas were identified to be part of the Emerald Network. The most recent updated list of candidate Emerald Sites includes 29 nominated sites, covering 4.04% of the country\u2019s territory. 2.5 Conservation of species Red List Considering that the biodiversity monitoring system in BiH is inadequate, it is a major challenge to provide any analyses or reports on the status of biological diversity. The main problems encountered in relation to the development of Red Lists relate to the lack of data on the status of species, their populations and habitats, and insufficient expertise to perform the work (lack of knowledge about methodology). Nevertheless, several Red Lists were developed, but only at entity level and without alignment at the national level. The Federation of BiH adopted the Red List of Endangered Wild Species and Subspecies of Plants, Animals and Fungi in 2004, while the Republic of Srpska officially adopted its Red List of Protected Flora and Fauna Species in 2012, but without the provision of separate threat categories. The Republic Institute for the Protection of Cultural, Historical and Natural Heritage is currently working on development of a bylaw on protected and strictly protected species. 2.6 Main pressures Some of the main pressures to biodiversity in BiH are caused by habitat conversion, resources overexploitation, pollution, and uncontrolled introduction of invasive species. Intensive processes of habitat conversion are evident primarily in karst habitats which are transformed into agricultural lands. Overexploitation affects diverse ecosystems, including oak forests in continental areas, Pannonian oak forests, upland beech-fir tree forests, upland deciduous forests, arable land, and freshwaters. Dozens of invasive fish species are present in BiH\u2019s freshwaters, but there are no detailed data on their numbers and distribution. BiH faces many other threats to biodiversity, including water pollution, forest fires, transmission of plant diseases and other pests near protected areas, excessive exploitation of natural resources (including medicinal herbs and fungi), use of chemicals in agricultural production near protected areas and expansion of agricultural areas, fragmentation of forests due to existence of open quarries, poor water and forest management, excessive urbanization in planned protected areas, uncontrolled development of the energy sector based on the construction of hydropower plants, and global climate change and acidification of habitats. Furthermore, the Federation of BiH detected the following key institutional problems that impact successful management of protected areas: \u2022\ufffd Lack of financing \u2022\ufffd Insufficient number of employees (experts and technical staff) \u2022\ufffd Insufficient scientific research and fieldwork \u2022\ufffd Lack of promotion of protected areas on domestic and foreign markets \u2022\ufffd Low level of public awareness about the values of protected areas \u2022\ufffd Poor legislative framework for nature conservation \u2022\ufffd Weak road infrastructure linking protected and non-protected areas \u2022\ufffd Illegal activities such as illegal hunting, logging and waste disposal in protected areas. 2.7 Valuation of ecosystem services There has been little research on the valorisation of ecosystem services in BiH.

On the southern side of Livanjsko Polje, traditional agriculture, production of milk and famous brands of delicacy cheese support the sustainability of these diverse and unique habitats. There are many communities of rare and endangered species living here including hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), Jack snipe (Lymnocryptes minimus), and great bittern (Botaurus stellaris). \u2022\ufffd Neretva and Trebi\u0161njica Rivers The Neretva River basin hosts more than 50% of the total number of species and lower taxonomic units of flora in BiH, and encompasses some 170 endemic and relict species. Additionally, the Neretva and Trebi\u0161njica Rivers have the key role in energy production, in drinking water supply and in agriculture. The threat to the ecosystem is caused by plans to construct seven hydropower plants in addition to the ten already in place. \u2022\ufffd Una National Park The economic value of Una National Park was evaluated within the study \u2018Development of economic transferability study of Plitvice Lakes National Park in Croatia to Una National Park in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019, funded by UNEP and published in 2016. \u2022\ufffd Medicinal plants, mushrooms and forest products The Foreign Trade Chamber of BiH reported that more than 3 million kilograms of medicinal plants and forest fruits were exported in 2010, amounting to an increase in revenue of no less than 68% in comparison to 2009. Medicinal and aromatic plant collection is primarily performed by local middle age population or elderly persons, mostly in rural areas, where the revenues from the sale of medicinal herbs their only source of income. They usually find and pick medicinal and aromatic plants in forests, on mountains and non-cultivated meadows and fields across BiH. 2.8 Nature information system Information on biodiversity and its status in BiH is scarce and not consolidated in a database system. The major challenge for the country is a lack of an adequate and permanent biodiversity monitoring system, and the absence of a coordination body that would be in charge of monitoring biodiversity. 2.9 Financing nature conservation The main source of financing nature conservation in BiH mainly come from the entity budgets. This specifically relates to the support generated through the relevant ministries and two environment funds, the Environmental Protection Fund of the Federation of BiH, and the Environmental Protection and Energy Efficiency Fund of the Republic of Srpska. International donors have been financing the implementation of projects in the field of environmental protection, agriculture and forestry sectors, with an important effect on biodiversity conservation. Some of the key donors are: the EU, UNDP, The World Bank, and governments of Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Norway, The Netherlands, USA, Sweden, and Japan. Additionally, protected areas in the Sarajevo Canton receive limited revenues from tourism. 2.10 Capacity building In the Federation of BiH, training workshops for nature conservation officials have been focused mainly on the issues of protection of water resources and climate change.

The Ministry of Environment and Energy is the central executive authority responsible for environmental protection, including nature conservation. Two structural units function within the Ministry, namely: 1. Nature Protection Directorate The mandate of the Nature Protection Directorate relates to the implementation of the Nature Protection Act, international conventions and agreements, and coordination of administrative and expert tasks in the field of nature conservation. It is the main authority directly responsible for the overall planning and management of the national protected area system, species protection and sustainable use of natural resources, provision of regulatory, administrative and financial supervision Photo \u00a9 IUCN 27 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE of national public institutions, designation of new protected areas, reporting and maintenance of the protected area registry. There are 31 staff working on administrative and expert tasks within the Directorate. 2. Directorate for Inspectional Affairs The Directorate for Inspectional Affairs is responsible for the enforcement of all relevant legislative, regulatory and permitting requirements and conditions in protected area control and supervision. It employs 17 inspectors. The State Institute for Nature Protection (currently part of the Croatian Agency for Environment and Nature) is the key agency responsible for technical issues related to nature conservation. It carries out expert tasks including: collection and analysis of data connected to the nature conservation, development and maintenance of appropriate database on the wild and invasive alien species, habitat types, geodiversity, ecosystems, protected areas and ecological network as the parts of Nature Protection Information System, assessment of the vulnerability of components of biological diversity and development of national Red Lists, standardization and organization of monitoring biodiversity and geodiversity and proposing measures for their protection, preparation of background studies for legal protection of new protected areas and ecological network, development of standards and systems related to management planning, implementation of plans and assessment of protected area and ecological network management effectiveness, technical preparations for wildlife management planning, preparation of national reports on the state of nature and reports in accordance with the EU regulations, evaluation of influence, control and eradication of alien species, reintroduction and repopulation of wild species in nature, and organization and implementation of the capacity building programme for employees in the nature protection public sector. The State Institute employs a total of 48 people, of whom 42 are nature conservation experts. In June 2015, the Croatian government adopted a decree on merging of the State Institute for Nature Protection and the Croatian Environment Agency in the newly established Croatian Agency for Environment and Nature. The new Agency will take over all the tasks and responsibilities of existing institutions related to nature conservation in the coming period. The key mandate of all public institutions (19 national, 21 county and 5 local) is to manage protected areas and ecological network (Natura 2000) sites. Each national public institution is directly responsible for the development and implementation of a ten-year plan and an annual management plan, and daily management of the national and nature parks under its jurisdiction. County and local public institutions perform the same activities for protected areas other than national and nature parks.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17c4b650-20db-4140-9050-3f9161b97e52": {"__data__": {"id_": "17c4b650-20db-4140-9050-3f9161b97e52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summary of national assessments of the state of nature conservation systems in South-Eastern Europe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5e25c3fd1950dbb9985a408dc9691a3c6bbbdcf720c9d45469294150f83adaa1"}, "2": {"node_id": "cda4d08e-c87d-4f14-abee-f514e84b8970", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "739ee08f3d106b66ec6f72b82acbdba9e265d7ba2ddb7f535e95531277b6c2ed"}}, "hash": "11bd196b25e3bf2b732ac63c495d326039eba1667fda28d82f4ff32a8f3f01ad", "text": "Of the 1,499 employees in public institutions at all levels, 268 work in Conservation and Nature Supervision Services.

NGOs About 30 NGOs are engaged in diverse activities ranging from the promotion of nature conservation, policy influence, to conducting expert activities such as research and monitoring of biodiversity. Most of them operate on a voluntary basis in their local communities and are often engaged in children education programmes, raising public awareness and specific environment or nature matters. They are normally linked through formal and informal networks of associations, such as the Green Forum, Blue Forum, Green Telephone Network, that serve as a platform for information and experience exchange. NGOs are well networked with the international organisations and NGOs, such as IUCN, CEEWEB for Biodiversity, Birdlife International, WWF, MedPAN, AdriaPAN and the European Environmental Bureau.

With the related bylaws, this law governs nature conservation in the country and incorporates the provisions of the EU Nature Directives and international conventions. A number of other key legal provisions regulate conservation of nature, such as: \u2022\ufffd Act on Genetically Modified Organisms (70/2005, 137/2009, 28/2013, 47/2014). \u2022\ufffd Ordinance on wildlife crossings (5/2007) \u2022\ufffd Ordinance on the conditions for keeping, methods of marking and records on protected animals in captivity (70/2009) \u2022\ufffd Ordinance on strictly protected species (144/2013) \u2022\ufffd Act on the Transboundary Traffic and Trade of Wildlife (94/2013) \u2022\ufffd Ordinance on the list of habitat types, habitat maps and threatened and rare habitat types (88/2014). There is a need for more efficient coordination with other cross-sectoral national laws concerning the environment and utilization of natural resources, such as the Forests Act, Hunting Act, Water Act, Construction and Physical Planning Act, Mining Act, Waste Act and others.

Since it precedes the CBD Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011\u20132020 and the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, the National Strategy is not aligned with the objectives featured in these international instruments. However, in mid-2014, the government initiated a review of the National Strategy. Five national strategic objectives have been defined, all aligned with the above mentioned global and EU strategies. The ecosystem approach and landscape scale analysis have been taken into consideration throughout the planning process. The draft National Strategy is currently in the adoption procedure foreseen for 2017. Due to poor cooperation among sectors at the national level, alignment of the National Strategy with other relevant sectoral strategies remains a challenge. In terms of regional strategic documents, there are several strategies, such as the Danube Strategy and Adriatic-Ionian Strategy, which are marginally dedicated to nature conservation. However, there are no official regional strategies related strictly to nature conservation. 30 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE 3.3 Protected areas Protected area coverage According to the Croatian Nature Protection Act, a protected area is defined following IUCN\u2019s definition (Dudley, 2008). Croatia has designated 407 protected areas divided into nine national protected area categories, totalling 6,914.22km\u00b2 in land surface and 617.62km\u00b2 sea surface (Figure 6). This accounts for 8.55% of the total country surface protected (Table 15). If compared to the global and European levels, Croatia is significantly behind in protecting the marine ecosystems, as less than 2% of the marine area is protected.

Although IUCN category V is the most represented in Europe, none of the countries have such a prevailing proportion of this category, while Croatia has more than 80%. Considering it is a very demanding category to manage, the effectiveness of existing protected area network in Croatia largely depends on human and financial management capacity. Procedure for designating protected areas The procedure for proclaiming a protected area in Croatia follows the guidelines laid down in the Nature Protection Act. Depending on the management category, the area is proclaimed by the Croatian Parliament (for national parks and nature parks), the government (for strict and special reserves), or a regional self-government body (for regional parks, monuments of nature, significant landscapes, park-forests, and monuments of park architecture). The role of the State Institute for Nature Protection (within the Croatian Agency for Environment and Nature) in the designation of new protected areas at the national level relates to drafting the expert analysis background document, following the request of the Ministry of Environment and Energy and containing all necessary information, i.e. a detailed description of the area\u2019s characteristics and values, an assessment of the state of the area, proposal for the most effective management regime, and an assessment and proposed source of the required funds. A protected area Proclamation Act is then drafted based on two documents: the Institute\u2019s expert analysis and a Statement of the governing body adopting the Proclamation Act. During a 30-day public hearing period, the public is given access to the proposed law/bylaw and the expert analysis with the complete cartographic documentation. Following this, the Proclamation Act and public responses are put to a vote by the competent authorities. Protected area management planning All Croatian protected areas have a designated management body. According to the Nature Protection Act, the immediate management of protected areas is delegated to public institutions founded by the state, county or local authorities. Each national and nature park is managed by a national public institution and it is at least partially financed from the state budget. All other protected area categories are managed and funded by county public institutions. 32 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Management plans last for ten years, with an option for amendments after five years (see Table 17 for existing management plans). In Croatia, 16 protected area management plans have been adopted, including for seven of the eight national parks. There is only one adopted management plan for the North-western Dugi Otok Significant Landscape. Management plans for several other protected areas and Natura 2000 sites have been drafted, although none have been adopted. Management plans for the following protected areas are in the development phase: Mljet National Park, \u017dumberak-Samoborsko Gorje Nature Park, Lastovsko Oto\u010dje Nature Park, and Biokovo Nature Park.

All habitat types are represented in protected areas. In all but one category (monument of park architecture), forests are the most represented habitat type, while marine ecosystems have the lowest protected area coverage (only about 2% of habitat type surface). Marine habitats are considered as an absolute priority in conservation planning, although the desired percentage is not yet clear. Protected area governance and management Governance is not a clear and frequently used term in Croatia. Referring to the IUCN governance types, Croatia largely practices governance by government, characterized by a relatively centralized system in which one or more bodies of the government have authority and responsibility for establishing public institutions and determining their conservation goals. Governance of national and nature parks follows the management plan and annual protected area protection, maintenance, conservation, promotion and utilization programme. This programme is adopted by the Governing Council of the Public Institution responsible for certain protected area with the consent of the Ministry of Environment and Energy and following the expert opinion of the State Institute for Nature Protection. The adoption of annual programmes for other protected areas requires the consent of the regional self-government body, along with the expert opinion of the State Institute. According to the Management Effectiveness Tracking Tool questionnaire in national parks and nature parks for 2012, the ratio of government owned protected area land versus privately owned land was 65:35, which clearly shows the need to implement more varied governance regimes. Legal mechanisms for partially delegating governance responsibility exist in that the decision-making authority can be given to a third person under certain conditions, although formal responsibility 33 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE always remains with the state\u2019s institutions. In the last few years, this model of delegated jurisdiction and management has de facto been implemented in Gajna Significant Landscape, which is managed by an NGO and with decisions taken by the County Council and the NGO. International recognition of protected areas Plitvice Lakes National Park has been on the UNESCO World Heritage List since 1979 and it is the only World natural Heritage Site in the country. Velebit Mountain Nature Park is a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve (1977), while the Regional Park Mura-Drava-Danube was designated as the Mura Drava Danube transboundary Biosphere Reserve in 2012, shared with Hungary. Five Ramsar Sites in Croatia include four sites designated in 1993; the nature parks Kopa\u010dki Rit, Lonjsko Polje and Mokro Polje including Krapje \u0110ol, Crna Mlaka, Neretva River Delta; and one site designated in 2013; Vransko Lake. Furthermore, international recognition of Papuk Nature Park as Papuk UNESCO Global Geopark adds to the network of diverse internationally designated sites in Croatia since 2015 (Figure 7). A number of protected areas are under consideration for applying for international recognition. Kornati National Park, Velebit Mountain Nature Park and Tela\u0161\u0107ica Nature Park are on the Tentative List of World Heritage Sites. The Lika field and the Ogulin-Pla\u0161ki plateau are being evaluated as possible Ramsar Sites. Mljet and Kornati national parks, and Tela\u0161\u0107ica and Lastovo oto\u010dje nature parks are also being considered for the List of Specially Protected Areas of Importance for the Mediterranean, under the Barcelona Convention. At the regional level, Croatia is currently engaged in preparation of a nomination \u2018Dinaric karst\u2019 for inclusion on the Tentative List of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, jointly with BiH, Italy, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia. Another similar initiative currently in realization is related to the European beech forests serial site.

The proposed Sites of Community Importance listed in the 2013 Regulation on ecological network were officially adopted by the European Commission as Sites of Community Importance in December 2014. Amendments of the government\u2019s Regulation were adopted in 2015 to incorporate the conclusions of the Biogeographical Seminar. Emerald Network The Council of Europe financed the implementation of Emerald Network pilot-projects in a number of European countries, including Croatia, in the period 2001\u20132003. In 2005 and 2006, thanks to financing from the European Environment Agency and in coordination with the Council of Europe, the implementation of phase II of the project resulted with the list of proposed Areas of Special Conservation Interest, including more than 90% of the area of estimated future final proposal for the Emerald Network sites. Throughout phase III in 2011, proposals of Areas of Special Conservation Interest for Croatia (and Albania, BiH, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) were analysed by the European Environment Agency. As an EU Member State since 2013, Croatia established its Natura 2000 network upon accession. This proposal was somewhat revised comparing to the initial proposal from 2011. Other ecological networks In 2007, the Croatian government designated the National Ecological Network, composed of important sites for conservation of rare and endangered species and habitat types at the national and international level. The National Ecological Network covered 47% of the land and 39% of marine areas, as well as two corridors; corridor for sea turtles and the Palagru\u017ea- Lastovo-Pelje\u0161ac corridor for migratory birds. According to the Nature Protection Act from 2013, the National Ecological Network proclaimed in 2007 is no longer in force and was substituted by the Natura 2000 network. 3.5 Conservation of species Red List In Croatia, 21 Red Lists have been developed to date, for: vascular flora (2005), mammals and freshwater fish (2006), sea anemones, ground beetles and stoneflies (2007), fungi, saltwater fish, dragonflies and lichens (2008), cave fauna (2009), freshwater and brackish water crustacean (2011), and terestrial and freshwater snails and sea algae and sea grasses (proposals completed in 2011, with categories for some species revised in 2012); and revised Red Lists for reptiles and amphibians (2012), butterflies (2013) and birds (2013). In all the Red Lists, a total of 2,954 threat assessments were conducted, which does not cover all species known in these groups in Croatia, but certainly covers the most threatened ones. The most threatened groups regarding the proportion of threatened species are freshwater fishes (42%) and cave fauna (37%), followed by terrestrial and aquatic snails, dragonflies and breeding birds (each 23%). Based on the most recent assessment of the status of lynx population in 2011 and 2012, it can be concluded that this species changed its IUCN Red List category from Near Threatened to Critically Endangered. Species management and action plans Management plans and action plans were developed for wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx) and brown bear (Ursus arctos), while a number of other species management plans are in draft version. The first management plans for wolf and lynx were each adopted in 2004, revised after five years, and officially adopted as management plans with action plans for the period 2010\u20132015.

This strategy was the result of the Interreg IIIA project \u2018Transboundary cooperation in management, conservation and research of the Dinaric lynx population (DinaRis)\u2019 started in 2005. Since 2005, brown bears in Croatia have been managed according to the Brown bear Management Plan, revised in 2008. Implementation of the plan is supervised by the National Committee consisting of the representatives of different stakeholders (hunters, foresters, scientists and state institutions). Hunting quota and hunting season are regulated by yearly action plans. An operational bear emergency team was formed, operating according to a protocol and trying to prevent the appearance of all bear related issues, react in any unusual situation and help monitor all bear related issues. Also, there is active transboundary cooperation with Slovenia. Draft management plans with action plans have been prepared for Croatian dace (Telestes polylepis), karst meadow viper (Vipera ursinii macrops), European otter (Lutra lutra) and saker falcon (Falco cherrug). Management plans for cetaceans and sea turtles are currently under development within the IPA Adriatic CBC project \u2018Network for the conservation of cetaceans and sea turtles in the Adriatic (NETCET)\u2019, that started in 2012. Croatia has also participated in the preparation of a conservation plan for migratory shark species. Protocols A Protocol on the reporting and actions in the case of encountering dead, sick or injured strictly protected marine animals was established in 2010. Since then, intensive activities have been ongoing on the expansion of the network of collaborators, the establishment of a comprehensive system for information gathering and preparation of a plan of activities in case of encountering dead, sick or injured strictly protected marine species. Protocols for wolf and lynx were also prepared, and preparations have started for the drafting of the Protocol for monitoring of lethal bat fungal infections and the Protocol on the reporting and actions in case of encountering bats in residential buildings. 3.6 Main pressures The main pressures on habitats are caused by human activities, such as watercourse regulation, water regime modifications, construction and tourism, while species are mostly threatened by direct habitat destruction. Excessive use through commercial harvesting of plants and fungi, or through fishing, exposes the populations of a number of wild species to danger. Intensive agriculture and tourism, pollution of water, soil and air, and poaching constitute significant threats to wild species. A decline in traditional low-productivity agriculture has also been identified, causing transformation of previously large pastures and meadows into wooded groves, with their loss of biodiversity. The impacts of climate change, with recorded influences on reproductive periods and success, migrations, and changes in species distribution, should not be disregarded. Most of these pressures are relevant for protected areas. Further threats in protected areas are related to construction and tourism development. Also, protected areas note a constant decrease of financing by the state. In recent years, this has resulted in insufficient employment of new nature conservation experts and a lack of continuous education for existing staff. Such a situation calls for the need to find alternative funding sources. 3.7 Valuation of ecosystem services The most recent study of ecosystem services, the Study of Freshwater Ecosystem Services in Croatia, prepared within GEF/UNDP project \u2018Support to the implementation of the CBD Strategic Plan 2011\u20132020 in Croatia\u2019, evaluated the benefits of freshwater ecosystems in the Danube basin implemented in a pilot-area of the Drava River. Detected ecosystem services relevant for the Sava-Drava-Danube floodplains include: provisioning services (timber production, biomass energy, fish production and angling, game and hunting, drinking water supply, agriculture production, energy production), regulating services (flood mitigation, sediment deposition, water self-purification, carbon sequestration-storage, local climate regulation, air quality, erosion prevention, drought mitigation and water storage), supporting services (habitats for species, 37 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE biological corridors) and cultural services (aesthetic value, recreation/tourism, naive art, local crafts-willow baskets, traditional architecture, indigenous breeds).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56e3e148-7688-4315-a203-475eff766f59": {"__data__": {"id_": "56e3e148-7688-4315-a203-475eff766f59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summary of national assessments of the state of nature conservation systems in South-Eastern Europe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "733cb795c27f2ccdcef15f8c551be861448cb3e01bea7ab0ec6d78fcd1eec8a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c936bd1-a3fb-45e5-ad79-18bae8e457c0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "955ecfb8da9c9172e5b7531b4bf183d475f691b516083cdde61440ab46e39499"}}, "hash": "df00db1a2ae39f05bc76d3a904185fe87c6a8a5ee15f4f21962ca45654ddcb9f", "text": "In recent years, there have been several projects and studies related to the assessment of economic values of biodiversity.

This system contains various thematic databases, applications and web services for storage, maintenance and exchange of data related to nature conservation in Croatia. The main Nature Protection Information System\u2019s components include: \u2022\ufffd CRO Fauna\u2014operational and partially publicly available \u2022\ufffd CRO Flora\u2014operational and partially publicly available \u2022\ufffd CRO Speleo\u2014under development \u2022\ufffd CRO Habitats\u2014operational and publicly available \u2022\ufffd Natura 2000\u2014operational and publicly available \u2022\ufffd Protected areas\u2014operational and publicly available. Three databases containing information on habitats, Natura 2000 and protected areas, are publicly available via a specialized web portal2. Efforts are being made on achieving compliance with relevant national and international standards, including the EU INSPIRE Directive which aims to create an EU spatial data infrastructure for the purposes of the EU environmental policies and activities that may have impact on the environment. 3.9 Financing nature conservation Nature conservation in Croatia is primarily funded by the state budget and to a lesser extent by county and municipality budgets. Since the late 1990s, the EU and other international funds have played a significant role. From 2008 to 2012, funds from the state budget were declining (Figure 9). Figure 9 State budget allocations for nature conservation in Croatia (2008\u20132012) The amount of allocated funds for national parks from the state budget differs for each park, depending on alternative sources of income (Figure 10). National parks with the highest revenues from alternative sources of funding receive the least support from the state budget. For example, Plitvice Lakes National Park is nearly entirely self-financed park, followed by the Krka and Brijuni national parks. These national parks also have the most developed visitor infrastructure and the highest number of visitors on a yearly basis. In most national parks, the largest expenditure goes to overhead and salaries (between 2 Please see http://www.iszp.hr 38 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE 62% and 96% of the overall expenditure). National parks with the largest revenue from alternative sources allocate only a small percentage of their revenue to nature conservation programmes (less than 2.5% of the overall revenue), while those with smaller budgets invest a higher percentage of their budgets in nature conservation programmes. Figure 10 Sources of annual revenues in Croatian national parks (2008\u20132012) The average yearly budgets of nature parks are significantly lower than those of national parks, although their management activities may require more funding than national parks. They are also more dependent on the state budget than national parks, the exception being Tela\u0161\u0107ica Nature Park with only 36% of funding coming from the state budget (Figure 11). About 9% of the overall budgets in nature parks is returned to nature conservation programmes, and most of the budget is spent on overhead and salaries.

Table 19 Main funding sources for nature conservation in Croatia Funding source Institution Comment State budget Ministry of Environment and Energy, State Institute for Nature Protection (under the Agency for Environment and Nature), public institutions, NGOs National and nature parks are funded by the state budget, while other protected areas are funded by county, city or municipality budgets.

Tourism Potentially all public institutions Although tourism is one of the main sources of revenue from protected areas, in general it does not fund nature conservation activities. The income of public institutions generated by tourism is mostly used for investing in further tourism activities.

In 2016, the draft was prepared in alignment with the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 and Aichi Biodiversity Targets. According to the Law on Nature Protection, in July 2016, MEPP developed draft National Strategy for Nature Conservation with Action Plan. This is a 10-year planning document and includes the long-term foundations for nature protection policy. The draft Strategy was prepared within the frame of the project \u2018Programme for Nature Conservation in Macedonia\u2019, funded by the Swiss Development Cooperation and coordinated by Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation and Farmahem in cooperation with MEPP. The project also resulted with preparation of The Study of Geodiversity and Geological Heritage of the Republic of Macedonia and Other Components of Nature (Biological and Landscape Diversity).

The National Strategy and Action Plan for the Protection of Biological Diversity from 2004 (covering the period 2004\u20132008) includes elements connected to the ecosystem approach, such as key information on the main ecosystems and protected area network. Priority activities relating to further implementation of the ecosystem approach are: \u2022\ufffd Preparation of case studies featuring the ecosystem approach \u2022\ufffd Implementation of the principles and guidelines of the ecosystem approach to achieve integrated conservation and management of land, water and living resources \u2022\ufffd Integration of the ecosystem approach into agriculture, fisheries, forestry and other sectors that affect biodiversity \u2022\ufffd Capacity building \u2022\ufffd Revision of the National Biodiversity Strategy with Action Plan \u2022\ufffd Development and adoption of the National Nature Protection Strategy \u2022\ufffd Establishment of Transboundary Protected Areas \u2022\ufffd Development of ecological networks \u2022\ufffd Development of management plans for protected areas. 4.3 Protected areas Protected area coverage Protected areas in Macedonia cover 2,300.83 km\u00b2, which makes 8.97% of the country\u2019s territory (Figure 12 for protected area distribution). Of the 86 protected areas, 67 are designated under the category of monument for nature, although the largest area falls under the category of national parks (4.5%; Table 21). The Sectoral Study of the Preservation of Natural Heritage prepared for the Spatial Plan of Macedonia until 2020 envisages an increase of the percentage of protected areas to cover 11.5% of the whole territory.

Protected area categories I-IV must be proclaimed by law, while protected area categories V and VI are proclaimed by the national government. The proposal to declare a protected area can be submitted by the state administration, municipal councils (including the City of Skopje), scientific institutions or other agencies, organizations and associations. The proposal needs to include the expert analysis, cartographic information and a technical study on valorisation or revalorisation of the area, and it is submitted to the state administration responsible for nature conservation. Protected area management planning According to the Law on Nature Protection, management plans for protected areas must be adopted within two years from the proclamation of a protected area. The duration of each management plan is ten years, while the assessment of preliminary results is done prior to the expiry of the fifth year from the adoption of the plan. Management plans for the following protected areas have been adopted: \u2022\ufffd Pelister National Park Management Plan (2006) \u2022\ufffd Gali\u010dica National Park Management Plan (2011) \u2022\ufffd Ezerani Nature Park Management Plan (2012). The management plans for the following protected areas are in draft version: Tikve\u0161 Strict Nature Reserve, Canyon Matka, Smolare and Kole\u0161ino waterfalls, Prespa Lake, and Markovi Kuli Monuments of Nature, Jasen Multi-Purpose Area and Mavrovo National Park. For national parks, public institutions are formed as the main responsible bodies for day-to-day management and conservation. Each public institution consists of the National Park Management Board, Director, expert collegium and the Board for control of finances. The National Park Management Board consists of five members: two staff members of the relevant national park, two representatives of MEPP and one representative of the relevant municipality. Macedonian law provides for the involvement of non-governmental stakeholders in a National Park Management Board through the establishment of a Council of Stakeholders, thus entitled to provide an opinion on the draft management plan for the park and implementation of certain programmes in the management plan, and to propose a review of the management plan. However, there has not been one case yet where the Council of Stakeholders was established. The law also provides for the establishment of Scientific Councils for national parks.

International recognition of protected areas Four areas in Macedonia have international recognition. Ohrid Lake was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979 as a natural heritage site, followed by the recognition of the cultural heritage of part of the old town of Ohrid in 1980. Today, the Natural and Cultural Heritage of the Ohrid Region is a mixed World Heritage Site. Macedonia hosts two Ramsar Sites, Prespa Lake (1995) and Dojran Lake (2007). The youngest international recognition is that of Ohrid-Prespa UNESCO transboundary Biosphere Reserve (2014), established by Macedonia and Albania. 4.4 Ecological networks Natura 2000 Identification of potential Special Protection Areas and Special Areas of Conservation of the Natura 2000 network has been conducted within the project IPA TAIB \u2018Strengthening the capacities for implementation of Natura 2000\u2019, implemented in 2016\u20132017. The project aimed to achieve further alignment of the national legislation on nature protection with the EU acquis, i.e. the Habitats and the Birds Directives, and began with the inventory of data on natural habitats and species of conservation interest of the EU and the initial selection of potential areas for inclusion in the Natura 2000 network. The project also entailed development of a GIS map for Natura 2000, strengthening of administrative capacity, and activities to raise public awareness about the Natura 2000 network. Emerald Network From 2002 to 2008, four projects with the aim of development of the national Emerald Network containing Areas of Special Conservation Interest were implemented in Macedonia. The national Emerald Network, officially nominated to the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention, includes 35 areas, covering 29% of the country\u2019s territory (Figure 13). Of the total number of 187 endangered habitat types listed in Resolution No. 4 of Bern Convention, 33 were identified in Macedonia, while of 927 European species requiring specific habitat conservation measures listed in Resolution No. 6, 167 are present in Macedonia, including 7 invertebrates, 13 fish species, 3 amphibians, 7 reptiles, 115 birds, 17 mammals and 5 plant species. The development of the Emerald Network represents a basic tool for preparing the Natura 2000 network. It also represents a useful instrument for the conservation of areas of great ecological value and a framework for cooperation within a homogenous network of areas covering the whole of Europe. 48 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Figure 13 Emerald Network of Macedonia Source: MEPP (2008) Other ecological networks National Ecological Network (MAK-NEN) proposal A proposal for the National Ecological Network (MAK-NEN) as a coherent network of core areas, corridors, buffer zones and restoration areas, was developed in the framework of the MAK-NEN project which was implemented by Macedonian Ecological Society, European Centre for Nature Conservation, MEPP, and financed by the Dutch Government. Brown bear was chosen as the flagship species of the ecosystems for defining the ecological corridors, and the Brown Bear Corridors Management Plan was prepared in 2011. Representative network of protected and potential protected areas A draft Representative network of protected and potential protected areas was developed within the UNDP/GEF/MEPP project (2008\u20132011).

Assessments based on the annexes of the EU directives Macedonia completed the List of Bird Species as per Annex I of the EU Birds Directive, within the framework of the UNDP/ GEF/MEPP project \u2018Strengthening the environmental, institutional and financial sustainability of the system of protected areas in Macedonia\u2019. The overall number of Annex I bird species identified in Macedonia is 117, of which about 82 regularly occur on the territory of Macedonia. After the completion of the List, full systematic analysis of these bird species was carried out within the EU co-funded project \u2018Wings across the Balkans\u2019, implemented by Macedonian Ecological Society, MEPP, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Economy. There is a further need to assess the location of sites hosting the habitats and species listed in Annex I of Birds Directive and to identify potential Special Protection Areas. Within the framework of the same project, the National Check List of Plant and Animal Species in Protected Areas was completed in 2010. In terms of the EU Habitats Directive, a draft list of Annex I natural habitat types, Annex II and Annex IV species present in Macedonia were prepared in the framework of the project for the development of the Emerald Network. The current assessments for important EU habitats, species and birds are being performed within the IPA TAIB project \u2018Strengthening the administrative capacity for implementation of Natura 2000\u2019. Species management and action plans Only a few species have been regularly monitored in Macedonia, including the Balkan lynx (Lynx lynx balcanicus) and Prespa trout (Salmo peristericus). In 2012, action plans were prepared for brown bear (Ursus arctos), mountain tea (Sideritis raeiseri), stinking juniper (Juniperus foetidissima), Prespa barbel (Barbus prespensis), reed beds (Phragmites sp.) and caves (focus on bats) in the transboundary context of the Prespa Park, while in 2008, an action plan was developed for Prespa trout. Additionally, three Local Biodiversity Action Plans include measures for conservation of important species and habitats at the local levels for the municipalities of Gostivar, Mavrovo, Rostu\u0161e and Debar. 4.6 Main pressures The main pressures affecting the integrity of protected areas in Macedonia relate to the following: \u2022\ufffd Energy demands (environment pollution, building hydropower accumulations and energy transportation infrastructure, mining of minerals, coal and other materials) \u2022\ufffd Transportation (roads, railways) \u2022\ufffd Urbanization and development (conversion of land for construction) \u2022\ufffd Tourism (infrastructure development) \u2022\ufffd Excessive wood-cutting (unsustainable forestry practices) \u2022\ufffd Illegal fishing \u2022\ufffd Agriculture (livestock grazing, cultivation of crops). 4.7 Valuation of ecosystem services Initial application of the concept of ecosystem services and the related economic valuation of nature was performed in the study \u2018Evaluation of the Natural Values of the Shar Mountain and Assessment of their Market Value\u2019 in 2008, prepared by the Macedonian Ecological Society and funded by the MEPP\u2019s Programme for Environmental Investments.

In other years since 2007, nature conservation, scientific research and activities related to public awareness raising and environmental education, have been streamlined through this Programme. Nevertheless, the state budget has been decreasing considerably in recent years. Figure 14 State budget allocations for nature conservation in Macedonia (2007\u20132014) According to the provisions of the Law on Nature Protection, public institutions for national parks are eligible for financing by the state budget, local municipalities and by compensation through diverse fees (e.g. entrance fee, parking fee, fee for sustainable use of resources in protected areas). So far, public institutions for national parks have been largely self-financed through revenues generated by timber harvesting (sanitation harvest, firewood collection), collection of medicinal plants and forest products. As to provide easier access to alternative sources of funding, in 2013 the government approved the decision of public institutions of the Pelister, Gali\u010dica and Mavrovo national parks on the levels of compensation from tourism related services. 3 http://biodiverzitet-chm.mk 51 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE International donors (EU, bilateral donors, GEF) have traditionally played an important role in funding Macedonia\u2019s protected areas (Table 23). It is recommended that continuing efforts are made to access international funds and where possible to expand the range of funds utilized. Table 23 Main funding sources for nature conservation in Macedonia Funding source Institution Comment State budget MEPP Programmes for environmental investment. Sustainable tourism Public institutions Fees Public institutions Entrance fees are restricted to national parks. Fees are also charged for sustainable use of natural resources and for conducting business activities in protected areas. Other sources MEPP, public institutions, NGOs Projects funded by: German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Swiss Government, Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund, EU, MAVA Foundation. It is recognized that there is a need to diversify sources of income and introduce alternative financial instruments on a short- and medium-term basis. For example, possible sources of funding that could generate higher and more stable income to Macedonian protected areas would be: carbon offsets, debt-for-nature swap projects, establishment of various forms of trust funds, establishment of a \u201cRenewable Fund\u201d for protected areas, redistribution of the existing revenues from taxes, duties and charges levied on fossil fuel production and trade, vehicle registration, water management, tourist tax, biodiversity offsets (for damages inflicted on ecosystems in protected areas), and the establishment of public-private partnerships. In 2016, a step forward was taken by promoting the establishment of the Fund for Nature Prespa-Ohrid which will further strengthen transboundary cooperation in conservation of the Prespa-Ohrid region shared by Macedonia, Greece and Albania. The Fund for Nature Prespa-Ohrid is expected to start operating in 2017. Furthermore, in the frame of the EU/UNDP/MEPP project, \u2019Improving the management of protected areas\u201d (2017\u20132018), a grant scheme will be established to finance the implementation of pilot measures that have three main goals: to address priority needs in improving the management of protected areas, where possible including those proposed as Natura 2000 sites, to promote more sustainable use of natural resources, and to demonstrate through practical examples that nature protection and economic development of local communities can go hand in hand. 4.10 Capacity building A number of capacity development workshops and seminars for management of protected areas, environmental networks and transboundary cooperation were held in Macedonia in recent years.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7444e5cf-5be9-4664-92bf-6ee6db1e9277": {"__data__": {"id_": "7444e5cf-5be9-4664-92bf-6ee6db1e9277", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summary of national assessments of the state of nature conservation systems in South-Eastern Europe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d1a44643f55495c69ed5df7592468ab9cf0b94a74618ce6fa487fefd8afea490"}, "2": {"node_id": "c9b3f237-755d-4dea-8329-bfec1780fab4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f2bafdb9b438bb3b8873047e522e2d01acbded2627c72b9b3c24fcb2e97f437"}}, "hash": "3b612a116c18293d4746a6b7bf6361b852ed140f557357a54cabc9ecd1d02476", "text": "As part of the UNDP/GEF/MEPP project \u2018Strengthening the ecological, institutional and financial sustainability of Macedonia\u2019s protected area system\u2019 (2008\u20132011), representatives of local self-government, NGOs, the MEPP\u2019s Sector of Nature, national parks, public enterprises and other institutions managing protected areas attended the following training workshops: \u2022\ufffd Legislative and institutional aspects of the valorisation, proclamation, planning and management of protected areas \u2022\ufffd Biodiversity research and skills for monitoring and managing nature conservation in protected areas \u2022\ufffd Communication, awareness raising and public relations \u2022\ufffd Financing, donations and effects on the local economic development with emphasis on tourism \u2022\ufffd Communication, technology and elementary GIS training.

By adapting the Aichi Targets to the national context, a total of 17 national objectives structured around five strategic goals have been proposed, together with indicators to monitor progress towards their achievement. The Action Plan is strongly focused on the value of protected areas for providing ecosystem services and goods. The most recent strategic document is the National Strategy on Sustainable Development until 2030 that determines priorities and measures to achieve smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, paying particular attention to the development of green economy. It recognises nature protection as an important objective. There is generally a lack of harmonisation with sectors such as energy, infrastructure, water, forestry, transport and agriculture. For example, the Strategy for the Development of Energy Sector (2014\u20132030) and spatial plans for the development of large energy generating facilities failed to provide for the inclusion of assessment of important biodiversity. This in particular refers to planned utilisation of hydropower. Similarly, detailed spatial plans in the coastal region allowed for excessive construction of infrastructure without due considerations of impacts on coastal ecosystems. Mainstreaming of biodiversity in fishing and hunting strategies and plans is not satisfactory and is largely impeded by lack of reliable baseline data. In the transport sector, there has been significant improvement compared to previous practices; however, much remains to be done to adequately address negative impacts of transport on biodiversity, in particular for marine ecosystems. Measures to protect autochthonous plant and animal species are integrated in relevant agricultural plans and programmes though their implementation needs to be improved, and the same applies for measures to control pollution from agriculture. The highest progress with mainstreaming biodiversity into other sectoral policy is evident in tourism and forestry sectors, even though the progress is more visible at strategic than at the operational level. 5.3 Protected areas Protected area coverage Protected areas in Montenegro cover 1,721.12 km\u00b2, which is 12.46% of the country\u2019s territory (Table 25). Five national parks (Durmitor, Skadar Lake, Lov\u0107en, Biogradska Gora and Prokletije) comprise the largest surface under the protected area regime (7.3%).

Procedure for designating protected areas The procedure for designation of a protected area in Montenegro is initiated with the ministry or local self-government\u2019s request for a study on nature protection. This study encompasses the following information: description of the natural values and characteristics, the state of resources and estimated valorisation, opinion on protecting the area, proposal of a national protected area category, a map with geographical boundaries or location signage based on the data from the property cadastre, consequences deriving from the proclamation act, particularly concerning the ownership rights and ongoing business activities, and sources of financing. National parks are proclaimed by the Parliament, strict and special nature reserves, nature parks and strictly protected and protected species and habitats by the government, while regional parks, nature parks and natural monuments and landscape with outstanding features located in the area of local self-government are proclaimed by the local self-government. In this process, local self-government always needs to seek approval of the competent ministry and the opinion by the ministry in charge of agriculture, forestry and water management. Protected areas within the Public Maritime Domain and protected areas whose territory spans more than one municipality are proclaimed by the government. Protected area management planning Management Plans for Durmitor, Skadar Lake, Lov\u0107en, Biogradska Gora and Prokletije national parks cover the period from 2016\u20132020. The responsibility of the day-to-day management of the parks resides with the public enterprise established for each park. Apart from the national parks, a management plan has also been developed for one other protected area, Piva Regional Park, for the period 2016\u20132021. 58 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Protected area governance and management Governance of protected areas in Montenegro is highly centralized. Governance of national parks is through the state by the Public Enterprise for National Parks. For other protected areas, there are examples of government-delegated management. For example, Lipska Pe\u0107ina Monument of Nature is managed by the Lipska Pe\u0107ina private company, while Piva Regional Park is managed by a private company established by the municipality. International recognition of protected areas Durmitor National Park has been a UNESCO World natural Heritage Site since 1980. Together with the Tara River canyon, it forms the Tara River Basin Biosphere Reserve, established in 1976. Montenegro has two Ramsar Sites: Skadarsko jezero (1995) and Tivat Saline (2013). 5.4 Ecological networks Natura 2000 The preparatory activities related to Natura 2000 network establishment started in 2009 within the scope of the project \u2018Montenegro and Natura 2000: Strengthening the capacity of government and civil sector to adapt to EU nature protection acquis\u2019, through cooperation with WWF, the then Institute for Nature Protection of Montenegro and Daphne-Institute of Applied Ecology. The project resulted with a draft Reference List of Natura 2000 Habitats and Species in Montenegro, using previous knowledge from the Emerald Network project and desktop data analysis. The draft version of the Catalogue of Natura 2000 Habitats for Montenegro was also prepared. Nevertheless, the results did not allow for full identification and mapping of potential Natura 2000 sites. This is one of the objectives of the IPA project \u2018Strengthening of the environmental protection system in Montenegro\u2019, which began in mid-2016. Emerald Network The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Physical Planning, in cooperation with the experts, initiated work on the development of the Emerald Network in Montenegro within a project funded by the Council of Europe (2005\u20132008). Standard forms for most of the Emerald Network sites were completed. The proposal of the Emerald Network\u2019s Areas of Special Conservation Interest consisting of 32 areas was officially nominated to the Standing Committee of the Bern Convention. 5.5 Conservation of species Red List The Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism and the Nature and Environmental Protection Agency regularly prepare the annual State of Environment Reports.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f6b4376-ae35-4342-a564-423903cff4e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f6b4376-ae35-4342-a564-423903cff4e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summary of national assessments of the state of nature conservation systems in South-Eastern Europe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c9c6e995c799d286e3dc80ae619173062cee606a8f9197e28224a4f9f8e45c43"}, "2": {"node_id": "5431d3a2-3872-49e1-84e2-8bbb06e8c14e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4b6afe37368cbab44640f28771ccb67f4ff51893a2e52692ad2388d6fd184ec"}}, "hash": "b3c6c06a9ad046ae9f41d5366f85512169a18581fc5709648bd1fb5eb2e23647", "text": "Information for the State of Environment Report is based on the data and results collected through the implementation of the Monitoring Programme for the Environment and collaboration with institutions responsible for different thematic areas.

The scope of annual biodiversity monitoring programmes, conducted since 2000, has been reducing from year to year due to financial restrictions and lack of human resources, resulting with incomplete and unreliable assessments of the status of biodiversity. The overall result is that so far, no Red Lists have been developed. 59 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Species management and action plans Only one species Action Plan, for the Dalmatian pelican, has been adopted (2004). 5.6 Main pressures Relative economic expansion in Montenegro in recent years has resulted in a range of new pressures on biodiversity, with intensification of some of the existing pressures. Economic sectors, such as tourism, forestry, construction, industry, and transport, all act as underlying causes of biodiversity decline. Growth of the tourism sector brings challenges related to the protection of environment and biodiversity. Urbanization has accelerated, including planned and illegal construction, primarily in the narrow costal belt, across the central plain area and around the natural lakes. Illegal infrastructural development has been occurring both in and around protected areas, thus controlling urbanisation is the main priority for addressing the root causes of biodiversity loss. Overexploitation of forests, rivers and lakes, including illegal logging, extraction, hunting and fishing is another critical challenge, due to inadequate enforcement of regulations. Illegal hunting and fishing often occur in protected areas such as Tara River, Skadar Lake, Ulcinj Long Beach and others. Pollution of freshwater, marine and forest ecosystems coming from urban, industrial sources, and agricultural run-off, relates to the problems of inadequate management of communal waste and wastewater, and control of pollution. Land use change, including conversion of agricultural land into built areas and abandonment of traditional land use practices such as grazing and haying, also lead to the loss of biodiversity. Generally, some of the main reasons for insufficient progress in implementing measures to address underlying causes of pressures on biodiversity reside in the low awareness about biodiversity conservation at all levels, including among decision- makers and citizens (Montenegro Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism, 2014). Lack of data and sound approaches to decision-making, insufficient level of coordination and cooperation among various sectors, and weaknesses in the management of protected areas add to inefficient dealing with pressures and challenges concerning biodiversity. 5.7 Valuation of ecosystem services Awareness of the value and importance of ecosystem services for human welfare is at a low level in Montenegro, including among the general public and decision-makers. Ecosystem services, as important contributors to socio-economic development and human wellbeing, have been recognized by Montenegro Ministry of Sustainable Development and Tourism (2014), though the valuation of ecosystem services and integration of the value of biodiversity in decision making is rare. Examples of economic valuation of ecosystem services in Montenegro include the studies \u2018Economic Evaluation of the Tara River\u2019, developed by WWF in 2005, \u2018The Economic Value of Protected Areas in Montenegro\u2019, prepared by UNDP and the Institute for Strategic Studies and Prognoses in 2011, and \u2018Montenegro: The Economic Value of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\u2019, prepared within the GEF/UNDP project \u2018National biodiversity planning to support the implementation of the CBD 2011\u20132020 Strategic Plan in Montenegro\u2019 in 2013. The latter report estimated that the value of selected biodiversity and ecosystem services in Montenegro is about 982 million EUR, 55% of which is associated with socio-cultural services such as recreation and tourism. If compared with Montenegro\u2019s GDP in 2011, at 5.24 billion EUR, the estimated value of biodiversity and ecosystem services is almost a fifth of the overall GDP. Interestingly, the value of these services is more than twice the estimated value of agricultural, forestry and fisheries sectors. 5.8 Nature information system Since 2008, the Environmental Protection Agency has been working to develop a comprehensive database on biodiversity that would be part of the central information system. However, due to major obstacles such as the lack of available, relevant biodiversity information, it has not been possible to develop an adequate database yet. Data on biodiversity is generally characterized by significant gaps in determining the number of species, population dynamics, ecology and degree of genetic variations for most species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a733ad2-3b6f-44cc-9454-b74a1cbc371f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a733ad2-3b6f-44cc-9454-b74a1cbc371f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Summary of national assessments of the state of nature conservation systems in South-Eastern Europe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "829b1e68f2f007b9c609f81bdb6c41551777397bc3b044a507802e5de799be84"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e842783-a928-4632-a957-df330e93523c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/summary-national-assessments-state-nature-conservation-systems-south", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8917ed56cbe2f18138aec70d34a34b0b786a4523e050ab6398a7504c141c3163"}}, "hash": "499285f9dc9453ad29afae1c5e40828d72d5133fc4156d4b2b367d57340cdde2", "text": "60 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE Recently, there has been progress on the development of the Central National Information System on the Environment.

Adding to that, the state budget participated in the overall budget of all national parks with a little over EUR 500,000 divided among all the national parks.

One of the issues is lack of resources, both human and financial for nature conservation. State budget allocations are limited and there is no participation of the private sector in conservation. A very small number of educational and research institutions provides specialised training for biodiversity conservation and management measures. Protected area management capacities continue to be weak, while public support for nature conservation remains limited, causing low political support. In previous years, training workshops have mainly focused on developing knowledge and skills in protected area management, identification and mapping of Natura 2000 sites, preparation of project proposals and GIS techniques, financial planning in national parks, and strengthening the skills of rangers, primarily in law enforcement. 61 STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE SUMMARY OF NATIONAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE STATE OF NATURE CONSERVATION SYSTEMS IN SOUTH-EASTERN EUROPE There is a need for further strengthening of the following capacities: \u2022\ufffd Project management cycle (with special attention to financial reporting and project implementation) \u2022\ufffd Methodology for the development of Red Lists \u2022\ufffd Management plans and specific measures for the most vulnerable species \u2022\ufffd Methods for valorisation of ecosystem services \u2022\ufffd GIS techniques in mapping of species and habitats \u2022\ufffd Compensatory measures in protected areas and raising public interest for conservation \u2022\ufffd Public relations (relationship with visitors and the public) and promotion of protected areas \u2022\ufffd Structural organisation of biodiversity database \u2022\ufffd Methodology for the assessment of protected area management effectiveness \u2022\ufffd Planning of short- and long-term monitoring of species and habitats \u2022\ufffd Skills of rangers in national parks.
