ates ranges from zero in Pacific island nations to 14 percent (Table 11). Thus, similar to the region\u2019s scorecard for women in parliament, Asia and Pacific nations have been less successful than those in other regions of the world to have women serving as national ministers.

Prime Ministers were included when they held ministerial portfolios but Vice-presidents and heads of government or public agencies are excluded. 5 As ranked by the IPU, Op.Cit. 6 Sourced by the IPU from Governments or Permanent Missions to the UN, or Public Documents What comprises the areas of concern of women ministers? The top four portfolios held globally by women are generally focused on socio-cultural affairs, including family concerns, health, education, science, culture, labour and sports (WEDO 2008; Table 12, UNDP 2009). Hence, there appears to be a high degree of gender stereotyping in assigning women to ministerial or cabinet positions in governments. Davis (1997) attempts to explain this by citing the fact that prior to achieving ministerial office, more women ministers had been assigned to family, social affairs, health and education committees rather than to finance and defence. The question, however, is whether women choose to work in these areas, or are channeled into stereotypical roles, from the moment they are elected into parliament (Stokes 2005). Nonetheless, women in Europe, North and Latin America have held portfolios addressing foreign and internal affairs, defence, justice, communications, transportation and environmental affairs. So have women ministers in New Zealand, the Philippines and other States of the Asia-Pacific region. Representation of Gender Minorities in Governance While gender quotas exist, these have really been quotas for women and do not represent affirmative action for gender minorities. Thus, if individuals from sexual and gender minority communities stand for elections or are voted in, they often do so as men or women, or as representing other classifications of minority groups. Nonetheless, in the Asia and the Pacific region, at least three nations have explicit provisions on the individual rights of sexual or gender minorities \u2013 New Zealand, Australia and Nepal (Matzner 2007, Gay411.Org 2009, Ireland 2008; BDS 2009 ). In December 2007, Nepal's Supreme Court Friday ordered the government to 83 enact laws to guarantee the rights of gays and lesbians, who have long complained of discrimination in the highly conservative Himalayan nation (Ireland 2008; BDS 2007). Portions of the High Court\u2019s ruling are reproduced in Box 14. Box 14. Neither Male nor Female- but Natural The Blue Diamond Society and three other groups brought a lawsuit before Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court in April 2007, challenging the law against \u2018unnatural\u2019 sex and demanding equal rights and an end to discrimination sexual and gender minority communities.

These individuals have been politically visible either in government or as rights activists (or as both). The majority of them are from Australia or New Zealand, where the acceptance of gender minority groups is most favourable. Yet even in India and Nepal, where culture and society are not as open to gender minorities as the first two, there have been persons with gender minority identities involved in politics. There are undoubtedly many more persons from sexual and gender minority communities sitting in different parliaments or legislative bodies, but they still have to find the courage make their identities public, whilst also being good politicians. In some cases, gender minority members are elected to positions as avowed lesbians, gay, transsexuals, bisexuals or intersexuals. In other instances, they revealed their gender only after elections. In all cases however, these politicians and other public officials have had legitimate claims to their seats in government by virtue of their experience, ability and education.

When the government cut funding for unemployment, she became an ardent advocate for the community. She \u201cshocked herself and the country\u201d when she was elected mayor of Carterton. Later, she ran for Parliament under the Labour Party, becoming the first transsexual in the world to be elected to the position. While in parliament, she introduced a bill which intended to include gender identity as a ground under the New Zealand Human Rights Act of 1993. She also sponsored other bills to promote the rights of gender minorities (Beyer and Casey 1999). In a moment of reflection, Beyer noted that \"becoming a pioneer was a great honour and a burden. The expectations are immense\" (Sutherland 2006). Donald Allan Dunstan was the Premier of South Australia from 1967-68 and again from 1970-79. He was a bisexual, and was married twice before taking on a partner (after the death of his second wife). He had a long illustrious record as Premier, being well-known for his reformist acts. During the so-called \u2018Dunstan Decade\u2019, aboriginal land rights were recognised, homosexuality was decriminalised, and the first female judge was appointed. He created a ministry for the environment, enacted anti-discrimination legislation, and implemented electoral reforms in South Australia. He was also heavily involved in federal moves for the abolition of the White Australia Policy. He is wellremembered for his efforts to encourage the social, artistic and cultural life of South Australia (Yeeles 1978; Dunstan 1981; Spoehr 2000). Dunstan succumbed to cancer in 1999. 87 Aya Kamikawa was the first transsexual person to openly seek political office in Japan. She stood for elections to the Setagaya Municipal Assembly in Tokyo in 2003, leaving blank the space for \u2018sex\u2019 in her application. In 2005, she was allowed to change her sex from male to female in the national register, after the enactment of the law concerning special rules regarding the sex status of a person with gender identity disorder. As member of the Setagaya Ward Assembly, she worked for the welfare of various groups of minorities in society: people with visual and/or hearing disabilities, ostomates, single-parent families, homeless people, evening junior high school students, as well as LGBTI people (Rainbow Setagaya 2006). Sunil Pant, 35 years old, is a Belarus-educated computer engineer who founded the Blue Diamond Society (BDS) in Nepal in 2002, an organisation working for the rights of sexual and gender minorities. In the April 2008 elections, he was named to a seat in the parliament by the Communist Party under a proportional representation system (Ireland 2008). Two developments in Nepal benefited Pant. The first was the significant change in the attitudes of the Maoists towards sexual and gender minorities, such that all three parties vying for elections included gender minority rights in their election manifestos. The real breakthrough however, came when Nepal\u2019s Supreme Court declared that sexual minorities were \u2018natural persons\u2019 deserving of protection against discrimination (see Box 14). Several organisations, including a private bank, the Education Ministry and the Home Ministry, have added a third box for the third gender in their forms. The Home Ministry is also working on a policy that will soon be circulated in the districts to give citizenship identity papers to third genders all over Nepal (Larssen 2008). Pant estimates that it will take at least five more years however, to have effective policies, laws and a constitution that respects the rights of sexual and gender minority communities in Nepal, and another 20 years to change the real situation on the ground and to change livelihoods for the better (from an interview with Larssen 2008). As in the case of women, allowing gender minority groups to claim their places in structures of governance provides the possibility for them to work for the 88 promotion of the rights of their genders. It has also been an opportunity to take up the cudgels on behalf of other disadvantaged and discriminated groups. The struggle of gender minorities for the recognition of their right to political participation still requires much more active advocacy \u2013 in the halls of parliament and in global conventions, as well as in the streets and neighbourhoods they occupy.

In this section, we shall examine the interplay between political participation and some of these implicated factors. The Political is Personal In South Asia, patriarchy, seclusion, and the power of the family to exercise social control over male and female activities mean that most women are unaware of their rights and lack the means to realise them (Heerah 2006; Asia Foundation 1999; Frankl 2004). Women are told that \u201cthey are not intelligent enough to participate in politics\u2026 [They] are generally encouraged to believe that politics is much too complicated for them to understand and so it is best left to men\u201d (Ghimere 2006, 7). India, for instance, has one of the oldest and most active women\u2019s organisations. Numerous laws exist to protect women\u2019s rights. The Government has often been unable to enforce these laws however, especially in rural areas in which traditions are deeply rooted. Women remain underrepresented in governance and politics, especially in the national legislature, although no legal impediments hinder their participation in the political process. Attitudinal, institutional, cultural and social restrictions are often seen as the impediments to women\u2019s political participation 89 (Geetha 2005). In places where women have made inroads to public life, it has mainly been through the so-called \u201cmale equivalence or kinship link\u201d (OneWomen 2008). Moreover, the participation of women in national politics is highly dependent on party decisions, which selects the candidates and provides campaign funds. Even in parties led by women, the participation of women remains abysmally low (Geetha 2005). In Malaysia, the formulation of the NationalPolicy on Women in 1989 marked a turning point, enunciating forthe first time clear guidelines for the effective participation of women inthe country\u2019s development(ADB 1998). Despite the progress that has been made in education and employment, concerns regarding the status and position of women prevail (Ahmad 1998). Malaysian women aver that the challenges, constraints and opportunities to their political participation emanate from \u201ca complex tapestry\u201d of factors situated in a multi-ethnic society that has a \u201cheterogeneity of religious orthodoxies, traditional values, political ideals, economic strengths, ethnic loyalties and demands of modern day living\u201d (Hassan 2005, 94). Despite this, the common thread that women have a limited role in politics, remains across the social fabric. In Iran, the few women who get elected to parliament are severely constrained by normative views that they are inferior, and by society\u2019s demands on them to be modest, silent and invisible. Azam Taleqani, who gained a seat in the first post- revolutionary Majlis, explained that women were expected to be \u2018naturally modest\u2019 and this prevented them from \"saying too much in the Majilis\u201d (Afshar 1996, 133). In 2008, the percentage of women in the Islam Consultative Assembly was only 2.8 percent (see Table 6), one of the lowest rates in the region. In the Pacific Island states, women are often denied their rights to decision- making. Thus, they are among the least politically represented in the world, second only to Islamic-Arab women (Gregory 2006; Huffer 2006). Ms. Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Samoan Minister of Parliament, observed that most Samoan women did not see themselves in a political role, especially because it was also necessary under electoral law to have a chiefly matai title to stand for Parliament, a position traditionally occupied by men. Ms. Ekari Malani, a member of the Fijian Senate, said that time and the expenses needed to run campaigns were barriers to women\u2019s involvement in politics. Women candidates were particularly disadvantaged in 90 conservative rural areas where it was expected that their place was in the home (Gregory 2009).

Women\u2019s disempowerment extends to government and politics. Only 21.3 percent of the members of the National Congress are women, and they occupy only a few positions of significant influence at the highest rungs of the party or government structure (see Table 6). Mongolia\u2019s so-called \u2018Secret History\u2019 contains many direct and indirect examples of the Mongol\u2019s traditional high regard for women. Mongol women were routinely given extensive military training, and the strongest and most skilled of these fought in wars together with the men (Women in World History 1996; Oestmoen 2009). New economic relations and the destruction of traditional communities however, have altered relations between the sexes and adversely affected women (Worden and Savada 1989). Politically, only three of 75 seats in the State of Great Hural are held by women (see Table 6). As of 2001, there were no female ministers, but one female vice-minister. However, women and women's organisations are vocal in local and national politics and actively seek greater representation by women in government policymaking (US Dept. of State 2002). The UN considers the Republic of Korea a model country in women's development (OneWomen 2001). Due largely to the collective efforts of the women\u2019s organisations, a gender quota of 50 percent in the proportional representation system was instituted in 2004 for both national and metropolitan elections (Hong Chun Hee 2005). Despite this, women have made up only a small percentage of those voted into 91 parliament across several elections (Table 6). The traditional nature of Korean society accounts for the low level of women's political participation. Legislation to help increase and facilitate women's political participation has been insufficient in addressing women's needs. Many women have also remained indifferent to politics and are naive in their political consciousness (OneWomen 2001). These short narratives on women\u2019s situation across Asia and the Pacific illustrate continuing social expectations across the region that women should place primary importance on their domestic roles. This serves as a deterrent against their involvement in public life. Many capable women shun participation in governance activities because they are straddled by \u2018husband, hearth, and home\u2019. Scores of women as well as men continue to think in this way: that marriage and motherhood make up a woman\u2019s existence, so that politics is man\u2019s business. A woman politician from Central Europe competently expresses this opinion: In spite of a long tradition of active participation in the work force by a vast majority of women, both women and men see motherhood and marriage as the most important goals in a woman\u2019s life. A common standpoint is that \"politics is a man\u2019s business,\" and that women are too emotional to deal with affairs of the State. The reasons for this are not to be found in education, with women in [my country] being as educated as their male counterparts. It is simply because of the stereotyped and traditional structure of society \u2013 northern [part of the country] having a typically Central European and the southern part a typically Mediterranean tradition, both quite patriarchal (Waring, Greenwood & Pintat, 2000, 20). Women who realise the importance of their public life in the face of these circumstances may struggle with these gender stereotypes and negotiate with their families in terms of sharing household chores and other demands of domestic life. Women politicians with spouses and children who support and share their political commitments are the ones best able to carry on their work in public office. Yet, when all else fails, some women may opt to leave their husbands in order to continue with their political commitments. Pintat (2001) notes, however, that despite the persistence of traditional roles, women of Asia, unlike their sisters in Europe or the Americas, may have greater freedom to enter public life. This is because \u2018other women\u2019 in developing nations are 92 often available to take on the domestic roles left behind by the woman politician \u2013 through the extended family system or by hiring domestic workers. Such a situation, while convenient, may hinder processes towards gender transformation and equality. The Social Exclusion of Gender Minorities If women face tremendous difficulties in seeking political representation because of gender constructions, so do other minority gender sectors. Radhika Coomaraswamy, former UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women, commented that the cost of transgressing rigid gender roles can be severe (2003). She noted: Gender-based violence is rooted in the social construct of what it means to be either male", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1f2678d-883a-4125-89ca-5acc3aba9b8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1f2678d-883a-4125-89ca-5acc3aba9b8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c42292d35582f3760b3d667037d234b82170483307828f875f9d0754e1ec86c"}, "3": {"node_id": "bfdc3155-7bc0-461b-a1d2-88c41fa45838", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c2fb6d2582cb626f3ae4c35f73d683051a56d79d456b0a4cdbb3583e422e872"}}, "hash": "00349aca2b7d4c56f7ee982efb0dbd3be83f95099485f9e8b06da26230908bf8", "text": "or female. When a person deviates from what is considered \u201cnormal\u201d behavior they are targeted for violence (IGLHRC 2003). Discrimination against individuals belonging to gender minorities can take many forms, including the following (Samelius and Wagberg 2005, 21): o Criminalisation of homosexuality, o Institutionalised homophobia, o Abuse in state institutions, o Pathologising, forced medication and cruel treatments, o Neglect of the existence and needs of LGBT people with disabilities, young LGBT persons and elderly LGBT persons, o Diminished access to healthcare, o Work place discrimination, o Violence and harassment from official state representatives, including execution. In addition, LGBTs are subjected to violence and social repression in the form of verbal abuse, silence, ridicule, hate crimes, corrective rape of lesbians, honour related violence and forced marriage. Overt homophobia in political discourse is not uncommon in some countries. Homosexual, bisexual and transsexual persons who traverse the public domain of politics are probably more vulnerable to gender-based violence than other persons from gender minorities (see Box 14). 93 Box 14. Violence against Homosexuals and Lesbians in Public Life Manavendra Gohil is the Prince of the Indian state of Rajpipla. He was disinherited after coming out as gay, but was later welcomed back into the family, and had his titles restored. As of 2008, he is the only known person of royal lineage to have publicly come out as gay. Effigies of the Prince were burnt in the state of Rajpipla, and demands were made to strip him of his title (Knowles 2006). John Maurice Scott was the Director General of the Fiji Red Cross and received a Red Cross award for his role in the hostage crisis during the 2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat. Scott was among the members of the gay community that lobbied to keep the constitution because it protected their civil rights as homosexuals. He was murdered on 1 July, 2001 in Suva along with his partner, Gregory Scrivener, in an apparent homophobic attack with a possible political motive (IFRC 2001) Pegah Emambakhsh is a 40-year-old Iranian lesbian. She became a refugee in the United Kingdom in 2005 to escape Iranian prosecution against homosexuality, after her partner was arrested, tortured, and sentenced to death by stoning. At first, her demand for asylum was refused by the UK government, and she was arrested by the authorities. After a global campaign and a protest involving several homosexual and human rights organizations like Amnesty International, Emambakhsh was freed and has recently been granted asylum in the United Kingdom (Gammell 2009). Jorge Armenta Penuelas was president of the Lesbian and Gay Collective in Sonora, Mexico and a candidate for a local legislative seat. He was found murdered together with his partner Ramon Armando Gutierrez Enriquez in their apartment. Although the bodies showed signs of torture, a local prosecutor called the murders \u201ccrimes of passion\u201d (IGLHRC 2005). Many cases from Asia and the Pacific vividly portray how culture muzzles the voices and marginalises the interests of women and gender minorities. If women are to overcome the constraints to political participation brought about by their domestic roles, then gender stereotypes have to be transformed. Women\u2019s agency and capabilities need to be developed outside of the confines of domesticity, given value and allowed to flourish. If the political rights of sexual and gender minorities are to be promoted, then the cultural and social biases against their gender identities will have to be transformed. Underlying these changes should be a deep respect for individual rights and a robust commitment to gender equality in all areas of society. Politics: \u2018A Man\u2019s World\u2019 The dominance of masculine values in politics is another gendered experience that affects the nature of women\u2019s participation in governance. The world of politics has been shaped by masculine norms, values and lifestyles (Shvedova 2005). It is characterised by competition for dominance rather than cooperation, de- personalisation of critical issues rather than empathy, and in extreme cases, violence 94 and confrontation rather than negotiation and compromise.

As a result of gender ideology, women fail to be as vocal and expressive as men whilst in chambers, and are unfairly rated as \u2018weak\u2019 and ineffectual leaders. Women with little or no education who are elected to positions may be unable to fully grasp issues unfamiliar to them. In consequence, they are silenced, mocked, marginalised, or even subjected to harassment and violence (Basu 2003; Tambiah 2003). Day Day Paw, the first and only female Central Executive Committee member of the Karenni National Progressive Party in Myanmar experienced such discrimination. She said, \u201cI regret that I didn\u2019t get a higher education. Even though I am now a leader in the main Karenni political organization, it can be difficult for me to have my voice heard\u201d (Cho and Lae 2008, 2). Women\u2019s tighter financial circumstances and lower educational attainments relative to men also figure in the political world. Political parties may be unwilling to share their funds with neophyte women candidates, who run the risk of not being elected. For these reasons, women who have successfully entered politics are often members of the elite, associated with politically influential families, wealthy on their own account, highly educated and with vast social networks they can count on during their candidacies and terms as politicians. The profiles of women heads of state that we compiled illustrate these observations (see Boxes 3 to 6). Sharma notes that even the quota system for representation can work against women\u2019s interests due to women\u2019s subordination (Sharma 2000). She observes: 95 Most of them become mere puppets in the hands of their male relatives [who] act on their behalf and they have no say in the process of decision making. They remain totally ignorant about the facts. It is generally observed that their husbands work on their behalf \u2026 thus making a mockery of the entire process of empowerment (Sharma 2000, 5). Nevertheless, the experience of taking part in discussions regarding their villages and regions, and making decisions for persons other than those in their immediate families, may serve to eventually transform women politicians\u2019 beliefs, priorities, and inner-selves towards espousing rights and equality. Due to such discrimination, some women who have attained prominence in politics have donned the \u2018robes\u2019 and mimicked the actuation of men in their bid to be heard and respected in legislative bodies. As one woman politician put it: \u201cIf you don't have the muscles you cannot get in or stay in\u201d (Daisy Fuentes in WEDO 2001). She traces the obstacles to women\u2019s political participation to gender roles and stereotypes, male domination of political parties, and the rigid electoral system. At the time of this writing, 50/50 in political representation remains an elusive goal, especially in Asia and the Pacific. While there has been progress in many nations, the obstacles to gender parity identified by Ms. Fuentes continue to beset women candidates and gender equality advocates. These are the circumstances which make it important to institute both governmental and voluntary measures to empower women in the political sphere of human development. A Failure of Development In the nations of Asia and the Pacific, a direct link between measures of human development and political representation in formal politics is difficult to establish. The \u2018poor fit\u2019 between the Human Development Index (HDI) as a measure of national achievement in human development and a measure of women\u2019s representation in parliament (from their share of seats in parliament) is particularly insightful (Table 13). 96 Table 13.

Australia and Japan attained the highest HDI ranks in the region, and were among the top ten on human development worldwide. Regardless of this, the percentage of women in Australia\u2019s upper house has exceeded the critical threshold, whilst the obtained result in Japan is only 18 percent, giving it a rank of only 106 in IPU\u2019s table (see Table 5). On the other hand, New Zealand, which has exceeded the critical level and has the highest rank in terms of women in parliament, has an HDI rank of only 19. It is outranked on the HDI by the United States (HDI Rank of 12), but the latter ranks only 69 on the IPU classification (UNDP 2007; Table 13). Both Singapore and the Republic of Korea (ROK) have good HDI ranks but while Singapore belongs to the firstquartile in terms of women in parliament, ROK belongs to the secondquartile (Table 5). More striking is the fact that Nepal, with 33 percent women in its Constituent Assembly and Timor-Leste, with 29 percent women in parliament, are among the countries classified as enjoying only \u2018medium human development\u2019. In addition, Rwanda, ranked first on gender parity, is classified among those countries with \u2018low human development\u2019 (UNDP 2007). Hence, there is no clear association that emerges between the level of development and quality of gender equity in Asia-Pacific nations. Factors imbricated with gender biases and stereotypes intervene to diminish the gains of other indices of human development (Norris and Inglehart 2000). Similar Development, Disparate Political Participation Australia and Japan have enjoyed economic progress for a long time, and both have consistently had high HDI ratings in the past decade, belonging to nations that enjoy \u2018high human development\u2019 (Table 14). Nevertheless, Australian women have enjoyed greater equality when compared to Japanese women (from the Human Development Reports, 1997, 2001, 2007/2008). Moreover, throughout the years, the percentage representation of Australian women in parliament has consistently been higher than in Japan (Table 6; IDEA 2008). 98 Table 14.

NY: UNDP. Within the rubric of gender and culture, differences in the political empowerment of Australian and Japanese women can be traced to the following factors: o Organization of women around issues of political participation. Australian women have a long history of advocating for their political rights, and most of its women won the right to vote, or to be voted as candidates, in 1902. Early suffragists framed their call for equality in citizen\u2019s rights within the social norm of women\u2019s roles and spoke of \u201chousekeeping the state\u201d (OneWomen 2004). This portrayal of women in the private-public realms remained till contemporary times, with \u2018Steel Sheilas\u2019 being depicted alongside \u2018Superstar Housewives\u2019 in the media. While this image may have pigeonholed women into ministerial positions deemed \u2018feminine\u2019, it contributed to the understanding of women\u2019s potential contribution to politics (Savage 2009). By contrast, Japanese women emerged from the shadows of a highly patriarchal society only after the Second World War. They won the right to vote in 1946, as part of the provisions of a revised constitution. Voting for the first time, 38 women were elected into the House of Representatives, occupying 8.4 percent of the total seats. Until that time, Japan was still largely a rural economy. Being a \u2018housewife\u2019 emerged only in the 1970s, with the rapid industrialisation of Japan (Iwamoto 2001). Improved economic standards, coupled with technological advancements and small family sizes, freed the Japanese women from household drudgery in the seventies.

Eventually, they realised that entry into politics would enable them to get better and more sustainable results.

In both countries, the gender ideology on the domestication of women is part of culture and tradition. Australian women have however, been able to struggle against these restrictions more actively than Japanese women. A vibrant women\u2019s movement continues to demand equal rights for women, as well as for other minority groups (OnlineWomen 2004). The Women\u2019s Electoral Lobby (WEL) is a feminist political organisation founded in 1972 as a non-sectarian and non-party-political women's political lobby that surveyed all candidates for the 1972 federal election on their attitudes to feminist issues. It evolved into a lobby organisation for all Australian women with the stated aim of achieving social, economic, educational, political, and sexual equality for women. WEL lobbies politicians, unions, employers, educationalists, and others on behalf of women, and seeks to change social attitudes, and practices, which discriminate against them (Preddey 2008). In Japan, deeply-entrenched values concerning the family, with strict definitions ofwomen\u2019s reproductive roles and responsibilities, defines the lives of many Japanese women (Iwao1998). Women are still expected to stay at home, look after the house and children, and be modest and passive. While more women now take part in political movements, they tend to organise around such issues as care facilities for the elderly and waste management. Some women say they are tired of the intense focus on economic issues and want to give attention to other domestic concerns (PBS 2009). A stereotypical view that women are not interested in politics is still shared by the general public (Takao 2006). o Quotas for Women. Members of the House of Representatives in Japan are elected through a mixed system. In 2000, the Diet presented a bill to reduce 100 proportional representation (PR) in the House of Representatives by 20 seats. The cut in PR seats will lead to fewer women being represented in politics.49 women\u2019s organisations expressed their opposition to this reduction in proportional representation (US Dept. of State 2001). In Australia, Federal and State election for lower house seats is generally done through a plurality/majority system and upper house seats by proportional representation. As a result, there are higher numbers of women sitting in the Senate (See Table 6). In addition, the Australian Labour Party introduced a voluntary party quota of 40 percent for women candidates in 200. Since then, the number of its women candidates has more than doubled (see Box 12). Active advocacy for political rights, organised action of women, and a gender- friendly electoral system have made the difference. Human (Woman\u2019s) Poverty Cagatay uses the term \u2018human poverty\u2019 to describe the relationship between gender, inequality and poverty (Cagatay 2001). Gender inequalities make women and gender minorities more vulnerable to poverty: that is, the deprivation of individual rights that enable a person to enjoy even just a basic or tolerable human life (UNDP 1997). She notes that women are more vulnerable to chronic poverty because of gender inequalities with respect to income distribution, access to credit, control of property and income from work, as well as gender bias in the labour market. As a result, women tend to work more hours than men, have lower education, lower incomes, less capital and less access to credit, information and knowledge (Cagatay 2001, 14). The unequal participation of women and men in political institutions is also seen as a symptom of poverty. It is linked to discrimination in accessing other individual rights, such as being fully educated and mobile, two factors important for participation in governance (Tambiah 2005). These attributes also influence their ability to obtain employment outside the household, to seek proper healthcare, to access public services and to interact with other women on issues of common concern. 101 Women\u2019s education is essential to their ability to partake of decision-making processes in governance. Unfortunately, 83 percent of the world\u2019s men, but only 69 percent of its women, are literate (UNESCO Institute for Statistics 2005). This gap in education deprives many women of the opportunity to assume a political role, since the cultural and social capitals that come with education are unavailable to them. It also results in a lack of access to a favourable economic position in the world of work. Khaing Mar Kyaw Zaw, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Karen National Union (KNU), and a leading figure in the Karen Women\u2019s Organization of Myanmar, believes that the most important factor limiting women is their lack of education. She says, \u201cwomen don\u2019t participate in the economic, social and political arena because they haven\u2019t had a chance to study.

This means that women have limited knowledge compared to men\u201d (Cho and Lae 2008, 1). Education may also continue to reinforce traditional gender stereotypes (Nilan 2008). In Indonesia, women marry later than they used to and are now much better educated. Nevertheless, the discourse of kodrat wanita \u2013 the traditional subordinate role of women, still dominates media representations of women and political rhetoric. Knowledge needed for political participation is not confined to having access to formal education. Women\u2019s participation in public life and decision-making depends on several knowledge factors, including awareness of their rights and how to claim them, and access to information about laws, policies and the institutions and structures which govern their lives (WOMANKIND 2008). Mobility and Women\u2019s Organising Social and cultural norms that stress women\u2019s domesticity tend to limit their mobility outside of the spaces usually defined as \u2018women\u2019s place\u2019. Both CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action articulate the importance of providing spaces for women to participate in non-governmental organisations and associations concerned with public and political life. Local associations tackling issues related to daily life may resonate better with women desirous of improving their living conditions and those of their families (UN DAW 1997). Involvement in a women\u2019s organisation provides the opportunity for a 102 potential woman politician to interact with others outside of her home and to recognise the common problems of women and their families. Participation in non- governmental associations (NGOs) affords the experience, skills and perspectives that women may need to take their citizenship a step further from their doorstep. Working in a group also removes a woman\u2019s isolation from her community. Working within an organisation becomes a training ground for women desirous of pursuing a political role. Civil society provides the opportunities to hone the requisites for effective political participation: the development of confidence, self- esteem and the skills to challenge and confront existing power structures; and the development of support networks and positive role models (WOMANKIND 2008). Working collectively through an organisation dispels the notion that women are powerless and incapable of attending to anything but domestic concerns. At the same time, organised action from women provide the avenue for men to \u2018sit-up and take notice\u2019, to recognise the special concerns of women as they fulfill their multiple roles, and to admit that women, too, can effectively assume power and authority. Entering the public domain through a local organisation inevitably brings many women face-to-face with men in positions of power. Organised action for citizen rights becomes an exercise in what it is like to tread into the masculine realm of politics, a sphere where men may choose to ignore or brutalise women. NGOs provide the organisational framework, build the capabilities and develop the resources for women to succeed in local or national elections. NGOs have also been a catalyst for organising women into constituency groups that lobby for women\u2019s issues in government or act as pressure groups vis-\u00e0-vis other sectors (CAPWIP 1999). Most importantly, a credible and well-organised NGO, trade union, or women\u2019s party serves as the \u2018mass base\u2019 for its selected women candidates. Religion as Politics A study of women\u2019s political participation would not be complete without a section on religion. Religion has often been an ally of power, and local religious themes and symbols have been used to imbue legitimacy to the authority of political leaders (Demerath and Straight 1997). Yet power in many nation-states has been in the hands of males, as is power in religious groups. Religion therefore, has brought legitimacy to patriarchy. In many instances, religious teachings have been 103 embellished with local cultural norms, so that an \u2018indigenised religion\u2019 may have modified, emphasised or even reversed the essential meanings underlying original religious teachings to make them compatible with culture and tradition (Bhargava 2007). Since priests, rabbis, imams and other religious leaders are generally men, the \u2018sacred interpretations\u2019 of religious precepts are often influenced by their patriarchal perspectives, so that patriarchy is mistaken for infallibility. In this way, the patriarchal features of religious ideologies have been used to provide legitimacy to oppressive and discriminatory practices in gender relationships within the family and community. It has served as a deterrent to the participation of women in governance.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48090d0c-deb5-4f70-a2e8-6fb19605dd12": {"__data__": {"id_": "48090d0c-deb5-4f70-a2e8-6fb19605dd12", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdedcf3cfb0aa003b8beb6d4ff286770da0d9a133d5d09e24df49cb7c8dec6b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "44374cef-6994-4779-b1b9-2cbc7eeb180d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8c2562064da0233d9d667ca371361ef754d2e10f1a87959a99f0b266c5701ce"}}, "hash": "fcde80ad42e7b6700b7cd79b60c7c25691854a31dbe1bfdfd1cdc732b7130365", "text": "It has served as a deterrent to the participation of women in governance.

Among 180 nation states, the highest percentages of women in legislative positions were in a country where the majority adheres to Taoism (21.8 percent). The second highest representation of women in the legislature is in a country where Confucianism is a minority religion (20.1 percent; see Table 20; Reynolds 1999; Norris and Inglehart 2000). Christian nations, on the average, have close to 13 percent of women in legislative seats and 11 percent in cabinet posts. Moreover, although the differences in women\u2019s representation between Catholics and Protestants are low, women in Catholic countries enjoy a slight advantage in terms of being voted into the legislature or being appointed to cabinet positions (13.5 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively), contradicting the stereotypical view on Catholicism as disfavouring women\u2019s visibility in public life. Lowest percentages were obtained from a country 106 that believes in Shintoism (4.5 percent), 46 Islamic countries (6.4 percent) and 15 nations with Orthodox Christian beliefs (6.6 percent). Since religion is so closely associated with other aspects of culture and tradition, it is difficult to determine to what extent the first factor is responsible for these findings. Using Bhargava\u2019s thesis, women may be excluded from political participation internally by religion, as when they are not allowed to partake of certain religious practices on account of gender (Figure 5; from Bhargava 2007).

In Hinduism, there are restrictions on their participation in religious rituals at the time of menstruation. Entry to temples is similarly restricted during this period (Bhargava 2007, 71). Women may also endure external forms of exclusion, discrimination which is not directly sanctioned by religion, but which would not occur if the religiously- sanctioned exclusion did not exist in the first place. Roman Catholicism for instance, teaches that marriage is ordained by God and cannot be dissolved by men (the state). For this reason, many women are forced to endure violent marriages rather than seek legal recourse, and allow the continuing denial of their individual rights. By the same token, religious precepts have been cited to dissuade women from entering public life, when in fact, these are merely religion-related cultural norms. Figure 5.

In Malaysia and Indonesia, religion has also been instrumental in voicing discontent as well as shared ideals, in the context of claims for Reformasi. Concepts such as \u2018democracy\u2019, \u2018human rights\u2019 or \u2018civil society\u2019, are being co-opted by Malaysian and Indonesian Islamists and reinterpreted within Islam (Van Wassenhove 2003). Women who have embraced Islamic fundamentalism in West Asia argue that Islam has always recognised women\u2019s specific needs. They claim that 14 centuries ago, Islam recognised women's legal and economic independence as separate from that of their fathers, or of husbands and sons (Afshar 1994, 123): Islamic marriage was conceived as a matter of contract between consenting partners (Koran 4:4, 4:24), and one that stipulated a specific price (mahre) payable to the bride before the consummation of marriage. Women must be maintained in the style to which they have been accustomed (2:238, 4:34) and paid for suckling their babes (2:223). Thus, if fundamentalism is about returning to the golden age of Islam, Muslim women contend that they have plenty of reasons for optimism and much room to maneuver. Moreover, some Muslim fundamentalist women dismiss Western feminism as one of the main instruments of colonialism, and despise the kinds of freedoms that are offered to women in the Western patriarchal setting (Afshar 1994). Such a view is contrary to those of other political scientists who reason that Islamic fundamentalism prevents women from enjoying their civil and political rights (Molyneux and Rasavi 2006; ICWIP 2005; Sharma 2003). Egalitarian Values and Women\u2019s Political Participation Another aspect of culture and society is political ideology. The links between democracy, good governance and political participation have been articulated time and again. In the IPU Survey of women parliamentarians, a majority of the women in its sample represented ideologies to the \u2018left\u2019 or \u2018center\u2019 of the political spectrum (33 percent and 31 percent, respectively). 16.6 percent located themselves on the \u2018right\u2019, 108 while 4.3 percent identified themselves as \u2018centre right\u2019 or \u2018centre left\u2019 (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat2000). Consistent with their liberal values, these women value equal partnership between men and women as the basis of political freedom. Other studies confirm a correspondence between democratic beliefs and positive values for women\u2019s political participation. For instance, left-leaning politicians and governments with more liberal ideologies are often the ones who work for the passage of laws that promote women\u2019s rights and gender equality (UNDP 2000). Women\u2019s Participation in Movements for Democracy In many nations of South Asia, the women\u2019s movement arose from the anti- colonial movement. Unfortunately, even if women played important roles during the struggle for democracy, their participation in public life remained minimal after liberation (Ghimere 2006). Several electoral reforms in different countries, led by women\u2019s groups, have paid attention to increasing women\u2019s participation in local governance. As a result, South Asian women have increasingly been able to take part in local governance (Hamadeh-Banerjee 2000; Tambiah 2003; Basu 2005). In India for example, the increased political representation of women emerged as the single most significant demand of the women's movement in the last several decades (see section on Legislated Quotas in Sub-National Elections; Basu 2003). Participation in local governance provided lower class women the opportunity to conquer their own inhibitions, gain self-confidence, overcome prejudices regarding women\u2019s capacity to lead, and to take their rightful share of responsibilities on public issues (Pintat 2001). The recent outstanding results of the Nepalese elections in 2008, where women occupied 33.2 percent of the seats in the Constituent Assembly, is a feat that can also be attributed to the efforts of the women\u2019s groups (see section on Women\u2019s Representation in Houses of Parliament). Nepali Congress leader Uma Adhikari said, \"we will bring hundreds of thousands of women to the streets if parties fail to ensure 33 percent seats for women in the CA\" (ZeeNews 2007). That did not have to happen however, since a third of the 200 women deputies who now sit in the Constituent Assembly are Maoists (The Advocacy Project 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2c709e2-5cfe-4e0f-ae46-f9b1d808e0f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2c709e2-5cfe-4e0f-ae46-f9b1d808e0f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/12", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18549628ef3339a5bc97c09422719e08706357d6e4dd06e3be6e3d7201ef5248"}, "2": {"node_id": "4970bd65-f1ba-4bca-bae3-69bc8bd51433", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/12", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c787c4aee7aef7959f937c7e1804f24e16f22d994146cbdf9ffc420f168c2d5a"}}, "hash": "9410aa7f7b0b591bfc5a0416d5193106201511331bc61ce184df50d9f8c374f7", "text": "109 Similarly, in other nations where civil society organisations have become increasingly drawn into issues of self-governance, women leaders have become the logical choices of their associations to represent women\u2019s interests in local councils or local governments (Ramli 2005).

In Iran, the Islamic Republic's Women's Organisation, a non-governmental activist group, succeeded in having some of its members elected to the Majilis or to the Assembly of Experts, which is responsible for nominating the national leader (Afshar 1996). In Vietnam, the Women\u2019s Union (WU) is a mass organization of Vietnamese women. The Women\u2019s Union in the local levels actively nominates women for election to Party Committees, the National Assembly, and People\u2019s Councils at all levels. It has successfully worked for laws, policies and programs related to poverty reduction, education, and reproductive health care. It has played a significant role in advocating for votes for women nominees among its constituencies. WU also collaborates with NGOs to organise training courses on skills needed by women\u2019s nominees to win in the People\u2019s Committee elections (Vuong Thi Hanh and Doan Thuy Dung 2006). Eventually, organised women see the need to broaden the base of their mobilisation and raise their voices in legislative bodies, as has happened in Japan. The political group, Seikatsusha Nettowaaku (Consumers\u2019 Network) originated from the Seikatsu Club Cooperative (see section onSimilar Development, Disparate Political Participation). Participation in the Seikatsu Club\u2019s activities and community-based volunteer work raised the political consciousness of the housewives. As women began winning elections to public office, they became more actively engaged in both private and public matters, and redirected their concerns from simple issues of family and 110 community life to women\u2019s issues. By April 2003, Seikatsusha Nettowaaku had produced 144 female local assembly members (Ogai 2004). Economic Development and Attitudes on Women\u2019s Political Participation Norris and Inglehart (2000) selected data from the World Values Surveys, taken in 55 societies from 1995 to 1999, to study attitudes towards the political participation of women. They examined the relationships between level of socio- economic development, attitudes towards women\u2019s political leadership, and the proportion of women elected to parliaments. One of their findings is that there is a \u201cstriking relationship between levels of socioeconomic development and support for egalitarian or traditional gender roles in politics\u201d such that more developed states also express more positive values for women\u2019s political leadership\u201d (Norris and Inglehart 2000, 6-7). In the World Values Surveys, the Scandinavian countries (highest in HDI) are located at the forefront on both indicators in the top right-hand corner of the regression line (see Figure 6). At the bottom corner are Jordan, Egypt, Pakistan and many of the Central Asian post-Communist states (Georgia, Belarus and the Ukraine). Australia, Spain and the United States are above the regression line, and display more egalitarian attitudes than are reflected in the proportion of women elected to their parliaments. Japan, Taiwan, Province of China and the Republic of Korea cluster together below the regression line, showing lower support for women in politics than would be predicted by their level of socioeconomic development alone. Many Latin American countries with moderate levels of development are clustered together in the middle of the graph, along with South Africa and the Philippines. Post-Communist societies like Armenia and Belarus are clustered together displaying more traditional attitudes towards male leadership (Norris and Inglehart 2000, 6-7). While the relationship between economic development and positive attitudes towards women\u2019s political participation is evident, differences across the countries indicate that there are other variables that influence positive views for women to become represented in national legislative bodies. We have identified these gendered factors in earlier sections. They include structural features of electoral systems, legal provisions and procedures for elections, and the patriarchal nature of social relationships and institutions. 111 Figure 6.

CROSSING THE BAR: WOMEN IN POLITICS Breaking the Chains of Domesticity It is difficult to generalise the characteristics of the small percentages of women in elected positions, considering the diversity of cultures, political mechanisms and democratic processes within which they function. However, a bird\u2019s- eye view of women in parliament is provided by a global survey undertaken by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. In 1999, it collected individual testimonies from women of all cultures and different political backgrounds regarding their experiences in politics, in a survey of Women\u2019s Political Experience and their Contribution to the Democratic Process (Waring 2000). The discussion in this section is largely derived from this study. 112 A total of 187 women from 65 countries replied to the 1999 IPU questionnaire survey (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000).

Almost half of all the surveyed women politicians were only serving their first terms in 1999, and a little over a fourth were in their second terms of office. Only three women had served for either five or six terms, and only one was in her seventh term of office. The ages of the women politicians ranged from 31 to 70 years (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 7-8). 60 percent of the respondents were married, similar proportions were either single or divorced, and a smaller proportion had been widowed. Those assigning themselves to the \u2018other\u2019 category may have been engaged, separated or in a de facto relationship. Some of these \u2018other\u2019 categories may also have described lesbian relationships, but the study fails to surface this information. Close to three-fourths of the parliamentarians had children, and over half had only one or two offspring. Only nine of the 187 women in parliament had seven or more children (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 9). Across Asia and the Pacific, it is not unusual to see that women in politics are made of the same fabric: relatively mature and free from responsibilities of childcare. Like the women politicians we featured in earlier sections (see Boxes 3-6, 7- 8), all of the women parliamentarians in the IPU Survey had access to education, and a majority completed an undergraduate degree. For the rest, seven percent had a high school diploma, six percent had tertiary training, and 14 percent held postgraduate degrees. All of the women had also been employed or practiced a profession, with almost half of them having been public or civil servants in the past. The next most common occupation among the respondents was teaching, with a majority having been engaged in higher education. Others were doctors, lawyers, journalists, nurses, social workers, farmers, engineers, and an accountant (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 9). The profile of the women parliamentarians in the IPU Survey closely mimics some findings in separate country reports on women in politics, or supports certain hypotheses regarding factors that favour women\u2019s participation in governance. The 113 finding that all these women had completed at least secondary school supports the claim that education is a precondition to political involvement. All of the respondents have also been employed, mostly as public servants, professionals, or educators, confirming the fact that education privileges women to find employment. The nature of their occupations has also been such as to enable them to understand the workings of government, and almost half of them had directly experienced it as public sector employees. The profile of women in national legislatures differs from that described for women sitting in local councils of governance. In South Asia, for instance, even illiterate women have been able to break into local councils such as the Union Parishad in Bangladesh (UNDP 2008; UNDP 2000), the district, tehsil, and union councils in Pakistan (Reyes 2002), or the Gram Panchayat in India (UNDP 2008). Reyes drew on the results of several studies to draw a profile of women elected to local councils of Pakistan. She reports that most of the women were younger than 45 years of age (57 percent); more than half were illiterate (53 percent); the majority were housewives (73.7 percent); very few owned land; and an overwhelming majority had never contested elections before that time (79 percent) (Reyes 2002). A case study of Bangladeshi women elected to local councils highlights these features (Democracy Watch 2002): o Most female members of the Union Parishad (UP) come from relatively lower income groups, most likely as a result of the extensive social mobilization that NGOs have done among poor women in Bangladesh; o Most members were encouraged to participate in the election by their husbands, fathers and relatives; o Most of the interviewed members were housewives before they were elected; o Most of the female members were elected for the first time, and had prepared for election through training. o Most of the female members admitted to a confrontational relationship with their respective chairpersons and male members, 114 and do not get much support or cooperation from the men in the UP (WB 2008). More than 80 percent of the parliamentarians surveyed by IPU asserted that one method of guaranteeing democracy was by ensuring gender equality in shaping democratic governance and assuming its leadership (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 18).

Almost four-fifths of the parliamentarians pointed to prevailing values about gender roles as responsible for the lower participation of women in national politics (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 25). The gap between law and practice was ascribed to women\u2019s lack of political status. It was noted that, even in nation states where there was broad political participation, women did not always hold powerful positions of authority. A Nordic politician observed: \u201cWe have the highest women\u2019s representation in the world (43 percent) but men still dominate as party leaders and in the most \u2018heavy positions\u2019\u201d (Waring, Greenwood and Pintat 2000, 19). In addition, respondents consistently reiterated that historical and cultural values perpetuated inequality. Do Women in Politics Make a Difference? \u201cA woman who enters politics changes; a thousand women who enter politics change politics\u201d, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet (quoted by Gutierrez 2008). After being elected or appointed, the more difficult task for women in public office begins: to make a difference on behalf of gender equality, human rights and development. According to some observers, women appear to bring distinctive styles to leadership and the specific kinds of issues they choose to champion (UN-DAW 1997). These similarities can be traced to the different positions women hold in society, the ways in which different societies constrain women or enable them to fulfill their human potential and the distinct roles that society expects them to play in relation to men. Although their particular concerns and styles may vary from one society to another (and within societies), they tend to bring to 115 governance and other public-sector affairs a perspective that in some measure reflects their social and cultural position and the prevailing gendered division of power (UN-DAW 1997, 7). Given this \u2018feminine\u2019 style, the participants at a United Nations Expert Group Meeting on Women in Public Life report that women bring the following attributes to public life (cited in UN-DAW 1997:7-8): o A particular concern for justice and the ethical dimension of politics, derived in part from their experience of injustice; o A talent for setting priorities and accomplishing complex tasks learned in the course of balancing competing demands for their time and attention in the family, at work and in the community; o An awareness of the value of consensus and agreement, because of their central role in social relationships; o A concern for future generations. According to women in local government, their leadership style is characterised by being more inclusive, consultative and collaborative. They are more tolerant of different points of view, are people-oriented and encourage participation. They are in constant communication with their constituencies and favour democratic forms of decision-making. They lead by example and focus on issues rather than personalities. They are assertive, innovative and conscientious leaders (UN ESCAP 2001). As a result of these so-called feminine attributes, women (more than men) are said to be transparent in their transactions, interact frequently with their constituencies, including women NGOs and other interest groups. They are also said to be less prone to corruption. Women in parliaments are usually the ones to propose bills related to child care and welfare, improvements in labour and employment conditions, pension systems; oppose nuclear weapons, capital punishment and racial discrimination; are more pacifist than men; and, focus on environmental concerns. They have also been the ones who have pushed for the ratification of CEDAW in their respective countries; introduced the establishment of structures to promote and protect gender equality, such as women\u2019s machineries and commissions on gender equality; and introduced legislation that will ensure the mainstreaming of gender in 116 governance, such as through the institution of gender budgets and enabling laws (Ballington and Karam 2005; UN-DAW 2000). Making an Impact in Parliament Women\u2019s presence in governance machineries will make the difference, first of all, if they attain sufficient numbers to constitute a \u2018critical mass\u2019. Hence, it is important to introduce enabling procedures that will increase opportunities for women\u2019s representation in parliament (Karam and Lovenduski 2005). As elected representatives, women legislators ought to be able to plan together, define a women\u2019s agenda, and be heard as a bloc in parliament to introduce bills that improve the situation for themselves and other women. They can initiate changes in parliamentary structures and procedures to include the introduction of proportional norms for men and women\u2019s membership in legislative committees. They may act as \u2018women\u2019s whips\u2019 and be responsible for organising the parliamentary votes of women in a particular party, as well as initiating the institution of formal or informal quotas for women in their respective parties.

They have to use their parliamentary platform to \u201calter public attitudes and to change the discourse of politics so that a political woman becomes as frequent a fixture of the political space as a man\u201d (Karam and Lovenduski 2005,189-190). Women in legislative positions need to constantly apply gender analysis to local, national and international issues, so that appropriate legislation can be devised to address the differential impacts of these circumstances on the men and women in the citizenry. Women in politics must ensure that they are in constant interaction with the different agents of change, including governments, other women MPs, women\u2019s organisations, and other members of civil society. They should be able to develop their networks for gender equality legislation at local, regional and international levels. These partnerships and networks will be enhanced if male parliamentarians are also engaged and brought into gender legislative efforts, especially because political structures remain dominated by men. 117 Finally, women in political positions have to become positive role models for other women. They need to show other women that \u2018women can!\u2019 Parliamentarians, namely women in executive and other government positions, should enable other women to believe that they can effectively assume positions of responsibility and visibility in aid of good governance. They need to demonstrate that there is no real cleavage between the public and private domains of a woman\u2019s life. They need to be models of a transformative, egalitarian and gender-responsive government. Unshackling Patriarchal Chains The prospects for increasing women\u2019s visibility in political decision-making hinge on a complex web of factors linked to women\u2019s lives, national development and the nature of governance. The framework for understanding the roots of gender discrimination in Asian and Pacific nations identifies traditional gender identities linked to the gender division of labour as the factor that initially dissuades women and gender minority groups from entering the political arena (see Chapter I, Examining Political Participation through Gender Lenses). The political participation of women and gender minorities in Asia and the Pacific has been examined within this context throughout this paper. The conclusions inferred from the data circumscribe women\u2019s role in the region as belonging to the private, that is, the domestic domain of human activity and responsibility, while that of men is located within the public (productive) domain. Hence, women who cross over into the realm of politics are judged to be unconventional and unable to meet socio-cultural expectations of the feminine role. By the same token, gender minorities are viewed unfavourably because they do not conform to the male-as-masculine or female-as-feminine norms and stereotypes, and are adjudged to have little or no rights to become paragons of political power and authority. Social institutions, including schools, the media, religious organisations and political structures, spread and perpetuate traditional stereotypes of gender roles and identities. The gender division of labour that privileges men in political life means that political institutions generally perpetuate male dominance and other patriarchal features. Asian and Pacific women\u2019s perceived place in domestic work and social reproduction also leads to the misconception that they do not possess the qualities 118 necessary to be political leaders, an assumed leadership style that draws heavily from masculine attributes such as authoritativeness, decision-making skills, control of and dominance over people and resources. There is also the notion that men make better leaders than women because they are \u2018objective\u2019 rather than \u2018emotional\u2019 (supposedly a feminine trait). Men\u2019s privileged status in public life leads to gender inequality in governance. Gender inequality in the profile of influence and political power across the region has resulted in the outcome that women\u2019s concerns, as well as those of gender minorities, remain invisible or marginalised in laws and state policies. Thus, inequities in economic assets, income and employment, knowledge and information are reinforced. The interrelationship between gender identity, gender inequality in governance, and women\u2019s continuing experience of poverty, becomes a continuous, vicious cycle. Figure 7 is an attempt to illustrate the interconnectedness between these different factors that serve as obstacles to the political participation of women and gender minorities. Figure 7. Obstacles to the Political Participation of Women and Gender Minorities 119 VI. THE WAY FORWARD If women\u2019s full and equal participation in governance is to be attained, a strategic framework is needed to overcome the cultural and structural barriers to gender balance in political representation. Research and gender analysis of these conditions points to the following key areas of action: 1.

Gender stereotypes and electoral processes serve as hindrances to gender- responsive governance, for various reasons. Hence, empowering measures from government, women\u2019s groups, social movements and other sectors need to be put into place. Among these are: o Institutional mechanisms to free women from domestic labour, such as childcare facilities, pre-schools, affordable ready-to-eat food choices and adequate health services for family members; o Improved policies for women to complete their education and to join the work force, as opportunities which serve to broaden their understanding of women\u2019s potential contribution to decision-making and governance; o Gender-sensitisation of families, especially male members, to transform unequal gender relations to more equitable ones; o Gender-sensitisation of families, the community, and the public, on gender identities and the disadvantaged position of gender minorities; o Institution of legal and policy reforms that recognise, respect and protect the rights of women and gender minorities, especially those that will prevent discrimination and violence against these persons; o Respect for individual rights to freely associate with others, as a precondition for enabling women and minorities to join organisations that address their practical interests and concerns, and to allow them to mobilise around their strategic need for gender equality; 120 o Mobilisation of gender-sensitive support from governance structures for gender-friendly processes and facilities that enable women to cope with their practical needs as women, such as avoiding late parliamentary sessions, and the provision of breastfeeding and childcare facilities while attending to their public duties; o Gender-sensitisation of men in parliament, the cabinet and other government institutions on the importance of a gender and development perspective in national life and in the realm of global politics, which requires the full and equal participation of women and gender minorities in governance; o Gender mainstreaming in policy and legislative structures, including the installation of a sex-disaggregated database, institution of gender- fair language in debates and proceedings, gender equity in legislative committee work, and the infusion of gender-responsive perspectives in the content of policies and legislations; o Institution of voluntary party quotas and reserved seats for women in the legislature, to increase the chances of women to be included in party slates and in proportional representation seats; o The establishment of women\u2019s parties that can serve as the \u2018vanguard\u2019 for women and gender concerns. 2. Provision of capabilities for effective participation in governance and legislative work. Many women who wish to enter politics are inexperienced neophytes in legislative processes. Thus, NGOs and government should introduce programs that will educate women on the different aspects of legislative work, public administration and governance: o Assertiveness training that includes communication and presentation skills, advocacy skills, networking, and use of media for proposed policies and legislations; 121 o Seminars on drafting bills and other legislative processes, within the framework of human rights and development, and gender-responsive governance; o Development of perspectives and skills on participatory processes: consultations with constituencies and the public; negotiations, networking and alliance-building; and consensus-building on desired reforms in governance; o Raising the awareness of candidates and elected women on issues related to poverty, gender, sustainable development, national and global concerns, and their impacts on the situation and status of women and gender minorities; o Training in effective mechanisms for party work: from seeking candidature, developing a political platform, campaigning, raising financial resources, garnering support from leaders and constituencies, to protecting votes. 3. En-gendering political parties and other political support groups. Political parties have constantly been named as the gate-keepers of political participation and representation. Specific strategies need to be developed to make them allies in the quest for equality of representation: o Gender equity campaigns should be addressed to political party leaders, to enable them to comprehend the significance of putting women in elective positions. o The support of other influential actors \u2013 such as the media, academics, and leaders of civil society \u2013 should be actively solicited as part of gender-responsive governance. 4. Cross-national research on the political participation of women and gender minorities to take into account differences across regions and cultures. Studies have shown that women across different regions and cultures experience similar forms of disadvantage on account of gender. However, 122 gender relations occur within particular cultural, political and socio-economic settings. o The diversity of inter-related factors that discriminate against women and gender minorities in the realm of political participation needs to be further identified and analysed. o Appropriate electoral systems, relevant political issues and political processes need to be pinpointed in relation to these contextual factors.

Conclusion The Chinese say \u2018women hold up half the sky\u2019. Governance and democracy would totter, or be upended altogether, if women were left out. They need to have the opportunity and the resources to uphold, with men, the structures and institutions that provide the citizenry the right to be part of decision-making processes. In this way, they can be directly involved in shaping their present situations and determining their future (as well as those of other vulnerable women and minority groups). Gender parity in political representation is essential to the achievement of gender equality. Without it, there can be no real progress in human development. [[[[[ 123 REFERENCES 1.

The Head of State is the chief public representative of the nation, federation or commonwealth that he/ she represents (Economicexpert.com. 2008). iii Legislative assemblies may be unicameral or bicameral. A unicameral legislature has only one structure while a bicameral legislature is composed of two-chambers. The lower house is usually based proportionally on population with each member representing the same number of citizens in each district or region. The upper house varies more broadly in the way in which members are selected: such as through inheritance, appointment by various bodies, or through direct and indirect elections. The authority of the two houses or chambers varies broadly in each country. In many cases, however, one chamber (usually the lower house) has the final say in determining the composition of a bill (UNDP 2009-b). iv The classification of states into quartiles was constructed by the researcher from the original table of IPU. v For instance, voters elect the members of the legislature, but the latter convene to elect their officers, such as the Prime Minister, Speaker of the House, or President of the Senate. As another example: in the Republic of Korea, there are 245 single member constituencies elected through simple majority direct votes. There are also 54 seats allotted through proportional allocation. These seats are divided proportionately among the political parties based upon the votes obtained in the districts, on condition that they have obtained at least three percent of the total valid votes cast or secured five district constituency seats or more (IPU 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a68369cd-7217-4d74-b6ef-9a5d6d37fa35": {"__data__": {"id_": "a68369cd-7217-4d74-b6ef-9a5d6d37fa35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d6dfd29801419b5b6b870c45e02babecab78b7038a68a853caa59920f869117"}}, "hash": "1d6dfd29801419b5b6b870c45e02babecab78b7038a68a853caa59920f869117", "text": "Unequal power and voice: Discrimination against people who challenge normative Sexualities in Asia-Paci\ufb01 c Asia-Paci\ufb01 c Human Development Report Background Papers Series 2010/13 1 Asia-Pacific Human Development Report Background Papers Series 2010/13 Unequal power and voice: Discrimination against people who challenge normative sexualities in Asia-Pacific Sunila Abeysekera Sunila Abeysekera is a Sri Lankan feminist activist and human rights defender.

The original formulation of masculinity and femininity as being socially constructed had taken into consideration the fact that there need not be a direct co-relation between the biological body of any human being and her or his expressions of sex/gender identity. Although the articulation and manifestation of these identities vary greatly according to cultures and contexts, there is a common thread that runs through history that provides examples and evidence of discrimination and violence against groups of people, including women, who are perceived to express their sexual and gender identities in ways which are seen as transgressing dominant social and cultural norms. These norms, which constitute heteronormativity, are in turn rooted in traditions and customs that are based on ideas and ideologies of male superiority and male control of political and economic power, and are often discriminatory of women and other marginalized communities. It is this dominant discourse that is being challenged today by those who espouse an inclusive vision of rights and development that treat all human beings as equals. Key words: gender equality, gender identity, sexual orientation, human development The views expressed in this publication are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or the UN Member States.

Human Development, Equality and Non-Discrimination Issues of equality and non-discrimination, which are key human rights principles, have been crucial to the articulation of human development since social inequalities contribute to the lack of equal opportunities and denial of access to services that are essential if the full potential of every human being is to be realized. Thus, equal and equitable access to health and education, and to employment and ownership or control over productive resources, are critical factors in determining human development. Understanding the role played by unequal relations of power in creating and perpetuating structures of discrimination and inequality has also led to a focus on \u2018empowerment\u2019 at all levels of the design and implementation of programmes aimed at achieving human development in the past decades. Shifting the balance of power and enabling sectors of the world\u2019s population who are subject to discrimination and unequal treatment, including women, indigenous peoples, migrants and refugees and people living with HIV/AIDS to make choices regarding their lives and their future has been identified as a key benefit of development. The impact of discrimination on human development has been the topic of global debate for decades. In the 1960s, global resistance to the apartheid regime in South Africa and to race- based segregation and discrimination in the United States led to the creation of the first international human rights treaty in modern times, the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. In 1979, global focus on the role of women in development led to the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). The issue of discrimination on the basis of identity has also been the subject of several World Conferences convened by the United Nations (UN) including the World Conferences on Women,1", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb836293-5b9c-4ac0-aa21-9ab17271f428": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb836293-5b9c-4ac0-aa21-9ab17271f428", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "96d2f8c26394cef1bddc94883a0a0d4e6c781201169abd84955478a515db1a79"}}, "hash": "96d2f8c26394cef1bddc94883a0a0d4e6c781201169abd84955478a515db1a79", "text": "and on Racism.2 The significance of international acceptance of the lived experience of inequality and discrimination in ensuring human development is borne out by the fact that all international human rights instruments and procedures have the elimination of discrimination as a their primary objective. The Human Development Report of 2000, which focused on human rights and development, identified seven freedoms of which the first was freedom from discrimination on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, national origin or religion. The concept of gender first entered human development discourse in response to empirical evidence regarding the persistent nature of discrimination and inequality based on sex. It enabled analysis of human relationships of inequality and subordination, in a way that was applicable to male/female relations but that also encompassed unequal relations of power 1 Most recently in Nairobi (1985) and Beijing (1995) 2 Most recently in Durban (2001) and Geneva (2009) 4 between other sectors and communities based, for example, on class and/or race differences. Gender revealed the foundations of the unequal relations of power between men and women. It also unpacked the social construction of masculinity and femininity in a way that enabled a deeper understanding of the role of stereotypes in the subordination of women and men. The concept of gender was critical in enabling a shift in terms of policies and laws that would address inequalities between women and men, expanding our responses to include consideration of issues of power relations between masculine and feminine human beings. This conceptual shift had a major impact on the inclusivity of the concept of human development. The role of gender in human development was the theme of the Human Development Report of 1995, which defined moving towards gender equality not as a technocratic goal but as a political process. Equality of opportunity, the sustainability of such opportunities and the empowerment of people so that they could participate in, and benefit from, development processes were the key issues identified at the time.3 In recent years, we observe the expansion of the concept of gender to include the range of identities that do not conform to the traditional notions of masculinity and femininity. The original formulation of masculinity and femininity as being socially constructed had taken into consideration the fact that there need not be a direct co-relation between the biological body of any human being and her or his expressions of sex/gender identity. Thus, in the 1980s, concepts of \u2018masculine women\u2019 and \u2018feminine men\u2019 found their way into the corridors of debate and dialogue on human development and human rights. The growing visibility of transgender communities and their claims for equality and non-discrimination in the 1990s challenged the idea of fixed and static sex or gender identities. It also introduced the idea that gender identities are fluid and in the process of transition and transformation. However, most references to \u2018gender\u2019 in official and non-governmental documents, including documents of the UN system, continue to assume that gender is synonymous with women or at the very most is about relationships between men and women. Any inquiry into issues of gender identity today reveals the richness and diversity that exists in human society and also uncovers the complexities of understanding the phenomenon. Although the articulation and manifestation of these identities vary greatly according to cultures and contexts, there is a common thread that runs through history. This thread provides examples and evidence of discrimination and violence against groups of people, including women, who are perceived to express their sexual and gender identities in ways which are seen as transgressing dominant social and cultural norms. These norms are in turn rooted in traditions and customs that are based on ideas and ideologies of male superiority and male control of political and economic power, and are often discriminatory of women and other marginalized communities. In particular, the role of women in procreation is emphasized and non-procreative sex \u2013 sex for pleasure \u2013 is often defined as immoral. It is this dominant discourse that is being challenged today by those who espouse an inclusive vision of rights and development that treat all human beings as equals. In promoting such an inclusive vision of rights, the evolution of the concept of inter-sectionality of oppression and 3 UNDP Human Development Report 2005 5 of discrimination has been crucial since it allows for the consideration that all human beings experience, or could experience, multiple forms of discrimination and therefore calls for an understanding of equality that is complex and sensitive to diversity and difference among human beings. 2.

Among these groups who are claiming their space within the community of nations that respect all human rights for all are indigenous communities, dalits in South Asia and others who face discrimination on the basis of the descent and occupation, as well as their sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Sexual orientation is commonly understood to mean the attraction that any one person may feel for another, irrespective of sex or gender. It encompasses attraction between people of the same sex (homosexuality) and attraction between people of the opposite sexes (heterosexuality). Gender identity is understood as referring to a person\u2019s sense of identification or \u2018belonging\u2019 to any one of many manifestations of gender expression. This allows for understanding that a person\u2019s gender identity may or may not conform to their biological identity. 5 A wide range of men and women, including men who love men (commonly referred to as gays), women who love women (commonly referred to as lesbians), people who regularly or occasionally adopt the dress and mannerisms of other gender identities, people who are in the process of undergoing surgical and other procedures that may transform their physical sex/gender identity as well as those who live out, or would rather live out, their lives as a member of a gender identity group that is not in conformity with their gender identity at birth (transgender) and those whose biology defies categorization on the basis of male and female (intersex). All of these people are members of our societies who are seeking to be full and equal partners in human development. In some parts of South Asia (Nepal) and Southeast Asia (Malaysia/Indonesia) there is a growing group of transgender and intersex persons who reject the attempts to locate them within a binary 4 http://www.un.org/events/humanrights/udhr60/ 5 In the 2006 Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of international Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, Sexual Orientation is understood to refer to each person\u2019s capacity for profound emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender. Gender Identity is understood to refer to each person\u2019s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other expressions of gender, including dress, speech and mannerisms.

This creates an environment in which discrimination and violence against individuals and communities on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity is socially and legally sanctioned in many societies and countries of the world. It is also important to remember that patriarchy, or the system of embedding male/masculine dominance in society, interplays with hetero-sexism to strengthen gender-based divisions in social and economic life that have an often detrimental impact on the capacity of those of non-normative sexualities to lead lives with dignity and equality. In many countries, it has been the practice to use the term \u2018sexual minorities\u2019 to describe those communities that engage in non-heteronormative sexual behaviours and practices. However, there is an emerging consensus that categorizing any community as a \u2018minority\u2019 leads to a positioning of this community as \u2018lesser than\u2019 the \u2018majority\u2019 community against which it is being measured, not only in numerical terms but also in terms of social and political power.

The positioning of these communities within the \u2018non-normative\u2019 also allows for more critical investigation into the customs and traditions that perpetuate discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity since it is acknowledged that social and cultural \u2018norms\u2019 are located within history and are subject to constant change and transformation. The category of non-normative has a strategic and political value as well, since it creates spaces for better synergy and solidarity between social groups and movements that challenge hetero-normativity through various means. 6 For more detailed discussions see the work of Anne Fausto Sterling: The Five Sexes: Why Male and Female are not enough: http://about homosexuality.com/five-sexes.pdf 7 The \u00edmpossibility\u2019 of naming is discussed in greater detail by Tom Boellstoff in \u2018Queer Studies in the House of Anthropology\u2019: 2007. Annual Review of Anthropology. University of California at Davis. 7 For the purpose of this paper, the focus will therefore be on persons of non-normative sexual behaviors and practices, so as to be as inclusive as possible. 3. Hetero-normativity, Sexuality and Rights related to sexuality Hetero-normativity privileges heterosexual sexual relationships, preferably within the boundaries of legal and monogamous marriage, and therefore creates an environment in which all non-procreative sexualities occurring outside the bonds of marriage are suspect. Within the heteronormative order, certain sexual practices and behaviours are labeled deviant/dangerous, and subject to intense scrutiny. Through creating categories of what is permissible and what is not, in the interests of public order, the framework enables policing and control of all non-heteronormative individuals and groups on the basis that this is required in order to avoid moral disintegration and social disorder. Discrimination against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity is often due to prejudice and ignorance. In addition, there is a strong fear of the \u2018disintegration\u2019 of existing social norms and practices in the face of the challenge presented to these norms by those who espouse a \u2018different\u2019 life and lifestyle. Throughout history, those who first challenged discrimination on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity, and cultural and social origin were labeled as \u2018deviants\u2019 and radicals, until their efforts led to broad social acceptance of the alternative \u2018norms\u2019 that they were promoting. There are many examples of this to be found in the Asia- Pacific region. One such example is the resistance to the campaign against the practice of \u2018sati\u20198 in parts of Northern India, led by Indian reformer Ram Mohan Roy.9 The arguments of those who came to the defense of the practice, including some officials of the British colonial regime, were based on the rationale that this was a part of Indian tradition and culture.10 In a context of prejudice and discrimination, non-heteronormative persons live in an environment of powerlessness, prejudice and fear because of social stigma and because of laws and policies that institutionalize discrimination against them on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. For example, lesbian women in the labour force will often face heterosexist discrimination, which may restrict women workers to certain categories of work considered to be \u2018appropriate\u2019 for women. This discrimination is often rationalized on the basis of being \u2018women\u2019, within the patriarchal framework of a sex and gender-based division of labour. Lesbians will also confront additional problems because of their identity. These problems may include harassment, intimidation and abuse in the workplace from co- workers and from employers, which would have a negative impact on their professional advancement. Even though there is a growing critique of laws that discriminate against non- heteronormative persons, laws, policies and practices which contribute to stigma and prejudice against non-hetero normative persons continue to exist and represent a major impediment to their enjoyment of human rights and freedoms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9aa2d311-cbcd-4dfb-8a37-2617aaa903f8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9aa2d311-cbcd-4dfb-8a37-2617aaa903f8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a105d79706dec18ddc754d7d543dea5257c013b62e1b9ef6b9ca1bfdc22aabd"}, "2": {"node_id": "192df0c5-a942-440d-9523-79c30af11567", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db2a732ef0aa3423ebc211129e93a4b2b7f0b88b927c47e6f6d13e260368ba8e"}}, "hash": "8efd500617b672ed8f26aaa64e89a761239cd9233bb1e45402debe4b8c1a5634", "text": "The existence of anti-sodomy laws could, for example, prevent men who are having sex with men from accessing specialized health care services which they need.

Laws and practices such as these mean individuals from these groups face various forms of discrimination and violence at all levels, within the family and the community as well as in the public arena including within state and non-state institutions. The fact that they are marginalized on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity restricts their access to education, health and employment, and has a significant impact on their capacity to enjoy the rights and freedoms that are guaranteed to all by national and international laws. In addition, these limitations heighten their vulnerability to poverty and deprivation, and lead to sexual behaviour and practices that expose them to a range of risks including vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections and other illnesses. The combination of social prejudice and legalized discrimination may also result in the exclusion of persons of non-normative sexualities from employment. Research demonstrates the resistance of employers to recruit persons who behave or dress \u2018differently\u201911 as well as a great deal of anecdotal evidence from persons of non-normative sexualities who have experienced harassment and violence in the workplace.12 Focus on these issues has emerged in the international arena in the past years mainly due to the high levels of violence, discrimination and abuse experienced by persons because of their own sexual orientation and gender identity or because of the work they are doing as human rights defenders that calls for the protection of the rights of such persons. Cases of lesbian suicide have been highlighted by groups working on these issues in Sri Lanka and India in the past,13 while a high level of harassment of non-normative groups has been reported from countries such as Malaysia, where in October 2008 the National Fatwa Council issued an edict denouncing \u2018pengkid\u2019 (loosely translated as tomboys) as un-Islamic.14 In Thailand, on February 21, 2009, members of MPlus, a group promoting AIDS awareness and the Thai Queer Network were attacked while participating in Queer Pride, a peaceful demonstration calling for equal rights for Thailand\u2019s LGBT community.15 While existing legal and moral sanctions against individuals and communities on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity play a role in enabling such homophobic attacks and violence to continue, social attitudes shaped by heterosexism contribute to further silence and marginalization. The fact that those who defend the rights of non-normative communities are under attack as much as members of non-normative groups themselves is a further impediment to activities that can advance the rights of these groups. A graphic demonstration of the silencing that exists in the region is the low level of information regarding violence and abuse against persons because of their sexual orientation and gender identity that filters out of the region.

These could include: married women who exercise their right about when and how to have sex with their husbands; married women who choose not to have children; unmarried women who choose to have children; couples \u2013 heterosexual and homosexual \u2013 who have sex outside of marriage or their primary relationship and so on. Alice Miller, in her work on sexuality and rights, has detailed the shift from existing standards of legitimacy, that were based on norms relating to reproduction and marriage, to standards that are being created in the present, and that foreground individual expression according to principles of autonomy, consent and non-discrimination.18 Over the years, various human rights mechanisms and procedures of the UN human rights system, as well as regional human rights bodies, have considered complaints and appeals regarding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Historically, there have been some rulings which have been seen as path-breaking in addressing legal discrimination. In 1981, the European Court of Human Rights ruling on a case filed by Jeffrey Dudgeon, an activist with the Northern Ireland Gay Rights Association, found that the law criminalizing homosexuality between consenting adults violated Dudgeon\u2019s right to 16 http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/home/index.html 17 WHO http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/gender/sexualhealth.html#4. 18 Miller, Alice. 2008. unpublished paper: \u2018Unresolved Issues \u2013 Human Rights and Sexuality\u2019 for the International Council on Human Rights Policy 10 respect for his private life.19 In 1994, the Human Rights Committee, which monitors the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, heard a case in which gay rights activist Nicholas Toonen challenged the criminalization of homosexuality in Tasmania. He sought repeal of the law on the basis that it violated right to privacy under Article 17 of the Covenant that bars \"arbitrary or unlawful interference\" with privacy, and the right to equality under two counts drawing on Article 26 that prohibits discrimination \u2018on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status\u2019. The arguments on discrimination were on the basis of \"sexual orientation\" which, it was argued, would come within the phrase \"other status\", as well discrimination on the basis of \"sex\" by applying the law only to male homosexual activity. By ignoring lesbians, the argument went, the law followed a criminal law tradition that denied women's sexuality. In its conclusions, the Committee followed the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights in the Dudgeon case in finding that the Tasmanian law violated Toonen's right to privacy. Regarding the equality issue, the Committee held that \u201csex\u201d included \u201csexual orientation\u201d. The idea that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a form of discrimination on the basis of sex had not been widely accepted before the Toonen decision.20 In 2000 the Committee monitoring the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights issued General Comment 14 on the right to health, interpreting the non- discrimination clause in Article 2 (2) of the Covenant as including prohibition on discrimination on the basis of \u201csexual orientation\u201d.21 Asma Jahangir, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions, was the first of the Special Procedures within the UN human rights system to include individual cases of severe persecution of members of sexual minorities in her reports to the Human Rights Commission.22 In June 2001, the Special Rapporteur on the Freedom of Opinion and Expression, Abid Hussain, held a historic meeting with transgender activists while on official mission to Argentina.23 In November, 2001, the Special Representative on Human Rights Defenders, Hina Jilani, met with Colombian LGBT organizations working with members of sexual minorities, people living with HIV/AIDS and sex workers during her visit to Colombia.24 That same month, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Nigel Rodley, raised the issue of torture and discrimination against sexual minorities before the UN General Assembly in New York.25 In 2004, Paul Hunt, the UN Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health affirmed that sexual rights should 19 Sanders, Douglas. 2007.

In Fiji, for example, the judgment of the High Court of Fiji that decriminalized homosexuality relied on Article 17 of the ICCPR, and also took into consideration some judgments of the Human Rights Committee on the basis that \u201cthe right to privacy [is] so important in an open and democratic society that the morals argument cannot be allowed to trump the Constitutional invalidity. Criminalising private consensual adult sex acts against the course of nature and sexual intimacy between consenting adult males is not a proportionate or necessary limitation\u201d.27 In India in July 2OO9, the Supreme Court handed down a judgment supporting the petition filed by the Naz Foundation, India, an NGO working to raise awareness on HIV/AIDS and the Lawyers\u2019 Collective asking for Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to be read down. The judgment stated: \u2018Section 377 IPC insofar as it criminalizes consensual sexual acts of adults in private violates Article 21, 14 and 15 of the Constitution.\u201928 This has represented a victory that could be replicated in other countries, including in South Asia, where similar criminalization prevails under the Penal Code imposed on this region during the British colonial period. In 2006, a distinguished group of international human rights experts met in Yogyakarta, Indonesia and outlined what we now know as the Yogyakarta Principles: a universal guide to the applicability of twenty-nine principles already well established in international human rights law to the rights of persons of non-normative sexualities.29 This initiative was prompted by what the Principles describe as \u2018violence, harassment, discrimination, exclusion, stigmatization and prejudice...that undermine the integrity and dignity of those subjected to these abuses and that may weaken their sense of self-worth and belonging to their community, and lead many to conceal or suppress their identity and to live lives of fear and invisibility\u2019. In December 2006, a significant achievement for affirming the rights of persons of non-normative sexual practices and behavior was reached at the UN with the granting of consultative status to organizations representing the concerns of these communities. ILGA- Europe, which had consultative status with the European Union (EU), and two other LGBT NGOs, gained consultative status in an ECOSOC vote. In 2007, two additional organizations were accredited, one from Canada and another from Sweden.30 26 Pages 32, 38, 54 of the Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Paul Hunt. 2004.

In 2011, United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution supporting the equal rights of individuals regardless of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity and expressed concern at the violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.33 The resolution requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to conduct a study on discriminatory laws and policies and violence against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. International human rights law says that discrimination on the basis of sex and race cannot be justified on grounds of tradition, custom or religion. The same principle logically applies to sexual orientation and gender identity. However, there are many societies in the world that justify discrimination, criminalization and penalization of non-normative communities. Many of the countries in the Asia-Pacific region fall into this category. Finding culturally sensitive and appropriate ways in which to advance the agenda of \u2018ALL human rights for ALL\u2019 remains therefore a critical challenge to realizing human development in the future. 4. Social and cultural realities A key factor that emerges in any investigation of sexual orientation and gender identity is that there is a rich diversity of sexual practices and behaviour in every society. This is borne out by historical records which show that many diverse forms of sexual behaviour and practice existed among indigenous cultures and communities. For example, the diversity of gender identities is borne out through the ways in which the role of the \u2018hijra\u2019 in the life of the community throughout the South Asian sub-continent is defined in historical record and by traditional practice, as is the role of the \u2018tom boy\u2019 in Southeast Asia. In her Preface to the book Same Sex Love in India authored by her and Saleem Kidwai, Ruth Vanita 31 http://www.hrw.org/news/2008/12/18/un-general-assembly-statement-affirms-rights-all 32 Ibid. 33 Human Rights Council, A/HRC/17/L.9/Rev.1, (2011). 13 points to the fact that the Kamasutra catalogues \u2018sexual interactions between men and between women in the same sections, thus treating them as having much in common\u2019 and adds \u2018In a whole genre of late-Medieval Urdu poetry written by men, we encounter depiction of sexual relationships between women\u2019.34 The work of Evelyn Blackwood, Saskia Wieringa and others have explored issues of sexuality, gender identity and culture in a range of Asia- Pacific societies including Indonesia, Malaysia and India, and seeks to expand theories of sexuality beyond the cultural problematics of the West. It also engages in ethnographic explorations of diverse practices and expressions of same-sex love and desire in the Asia- Pacific region.35 These practices were constantly subject to change and transformation due to internal processes of social evolution as well as by processes of colonization. In general, processes of modernization led to the validation of certain forms of social and sexual behavior, creating the norm of the modern family as being heterosexual and nuclear in form. Along with this came legal frameworks that penalized non-normative behavior and legitimised marriage and monogamy. A report released in 2008 by Human Rights Watch points out that all British colonies inherited laws that criminalized sodomy building on Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code of 1860.36 In Asia and the Pacific, these countries are Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei, India, Kiribati, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nauru, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Samoa.37 Australia, Fiji, Hong Kong, China (SAR), and New Zealand also inherited the same British law, but have abolished it since.38 In the Asia-Pacific region, the dynamic relationship between modernity and tradition has led to a situation in which recognition of diverse practices that are sanctioned by religion, culture and tradition have led to the creation of diverse legal frameworks that co-exist and that, for example, legitimize customary marriages and polygamy in certain communities. It is in this context that the rich and varied experiences of the region in terms of sexuality and gender identity need to be discussed and understood. Often, however, the promotion of static understandings of culture and tradition lead to discrimination against women and other socially marginalized communities and reaffirm hierarchies of power based on economic and political strength that is most often controlled by men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97efec07-a78d-4060-b800-1141130e8da6": {"__data__": {"id_": "97efec07-a78d-4060-b800-1141130e8da6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "760811dcd8f738c4e892e2b8491f56a90f95ada25b18bef6d5746ecb8bf734d4"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f5c168c-3626-4c6d-9217-13c7cd003fc7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "49882d9aa2af7b1093e35ab8fb8464a7fa44b048bfc81ce42b632ba3e03c0ff7"}}, "hash": "7d6f641f8c1a8f4c68c0f20e7e551bd330b470bc7c8a4f43f4fcdc7543d3a699", "text": "This resistance to change comprises a major challenge to those who seek to transform social and political relationships into more equitable ones, and also obstruct attempts to reform laws and policies", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "815985db-aa0d-4101-8794-6ccb607c5827": {"__data__": {"id_": "815985db-aa0d-4101-8794-6ccb607c5827", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "711c3da6bc8a60e0cf0a5d453dc06f68424a81aa71f9e567791afde22a913ffe"}, "3": {"node_id": "c37c7344-4ec5-48b7-886d-8575d31cef36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7d73d60d213b6ba1b0874270c5fde2c33cd5ad96fe51d8c8e742356c57a47711"}}, "hash": "96c66acd7958f41c377cb88fb2939f17e11c7e4ec07610d3c8e39b59de753470", "text": "that seek to instill equilibrium into social relations.

While there are different attitudes towards sex work in different countries in the Asia-Pacific region, the criminalization of \u2018prostitution\u2019 was also a part of the colonial legal tradition that ended up in the statute books of many colonies. The strength of patriarchal domination was borne out by the fact that most of these laws criminalized the person who sold sex, as well as the person who profited from the sale, while the one who bought it was not sanctioned. Struggles for the de-criminalization of sex work and for ending the victimization of sex workers have accompanied the struggles for the ending of discrimination and violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity in many countries. Sex work and laws that govern it have also come under intense scrutiny in this era of HIV/AIDS. In 2008, the independent Commission on AIDS in Asia called for the decriminalization of sex work in countries where the laws still criminalizes this behavior, arguing that this would increase their access to prevention and care services.39 However, the UN is yet to take a firm stand on decriminalization of sex work. The recently developed UNAIDS guidance note on HIV and Sex Work does not discuss possible legal policy positions on sex work and leaves this matter to individual member states, some of which have decriminalized sex work as one policy option.40 In the case of Viet Nam, for example, studies show that female sex workers receive special attention not only for the sake of HIV/AIDS prevention, but also as a group that could threaten social stability.41 Various policy documents have been produced for the purposes of prevention and control of commercial sex, including the national strategy for prevention and control of prostitution (2001\u20132005) and the 2003 Ordinance on preventing and combating prostitution. Although the Ordinance sanctioned gives penalties for the (overwhelmingly) male customers, including fines and notifying their employers, implementation has fallen short. One of the reasons for hesitancy in enforcing the law on male customers \u2014 including growing numbers of government cadres \u2014 has been the concern that the news could damage their families. On the other hand severe penalties, ranging from administrative detention to forced re-education, have been enforced against female sex workers.42 Current debates on criminalization, including from within the sex worker community, pose the dilemma that criminalization of sex work, whether of client or provider or both, tends to drive sex work underground and thereby renders sex workers, their clients and other sexual partners more vulnerable to violence, abuse and ill health. In many countries in the Asia-Pacific region today, there are communities of people who espouse non-normative sexualities who occupy a particular niche in society. In many indigenous languages there are terms that describe the transitory and transient nature of sexuality and gender identity in more expressive ways than \u2018trans\u2019 gender.

Normative legal frameworks The decades from 1990 to 2010 will undoubtedly go down in history as being the period in which normative frameworks around the globe began to pay serious attention to issues of discrimination and violence against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. The South African Constitution became the first in the world to explicitly declare that sexual orientation would not be the basis of discrimination, with Ecuador becoming the second state to do so in 2008.48 Current debates on the new Constitution of Nepal point to that nation becoming the first in the Asia-Pacific region to insert this inclusive clause in its text.49 However, there are many obstacles yet to be overcome. At present, 86 Member States of the United Nations criminalize sex between consenting adults of the same gender, while seven states have death penalties for homosexual relations between consenting adults.50 Many laws define non-heteronormative practices as being \u2018abnormal\u2019, \u2018against nature\u2019 and \u2018indecent\u2019 and many policies and social practices continue to exclude and marginalize persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. In the 21st century, out of the 44 countries in the Asia-Pacific region that are member states of the UN, all have a discriminatory policy or law that criminalizes sexual behaviour that is not 43 Reddy, Gayatri.

At the same time, due to these obstacles and the discrimination, stigma, prejudice and violence faced by these communities, there is a growing and vibrant community of gays and lesbians, transgender and intersex, sex workers and single women who are challenging their exclusion from society. A key challenge to laws and policies that criminalize homosexuality has been the approach taken by groups working on the prevention of HIV/AIDS and on the elimination of discrimination and violence against people living with HIV/AIDS. In November 2008, UNAIDS Director Peter Piot went on record as saying, \"Homophobia - in all its forms - is one of the top five barriers to ending this epidemic, worldwide. If communities, NGOs, governments and international organizations do not respect and promote the rights of all people with diverse sexuality, we will not end AIDS\".52 His argument was that countries that have non-discrimination laws against men who have sex with men, injecting drug users and sex workers have achieved higher rates of coverage of HIV prevention efforts.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d8a89052-8f8c-4c7d-8f4a-14a5642289cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d8a89052-8f8c-4c7d-8f4a-14a5642289cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf5ca16bf438e3a21f0aa6676dd6684c637f8689be7299b3c7576d9876f1b426"}, "2": {"node_id": "839c4ceb-0540-432c-b9dd-469eadc62fdd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f38c522ea87e6fecd18714ce05280a09293a1b96e974ab4801897cb3f48c61bb"}}, "hash": "528d4551b572cefde4ee7a044184fa4d9c34e0474b212ade69941c52b9b75047", "text": "More recently, the independent Commission on AIDS in Asia urged governments across the region to revise laws that criminalise men who have sex with men, arguing that this would be an essential component in creating an enabling environment to address barriers to prevention, treatment and care of HIV.53 6.

Thailand was selected because it has been traditionally flexible in terms of its response to diverse sexual practices, for example with the traditional acceptance of tomboys and katoeys (feminine men).

In Cambodia, growing concerns regarding the sexual exploitation of children has led to a clampdown on all forms of \u2018deviant\u2019 sexualities. Also more recently, in Cambodia, a new anti-trafficking law was enacted in early 2008, which was interpreted to equate sex work with trafficking. In Timor-Leste, there is a process of creating many new laws and policies that must strike a balance between the religious faith of the majority of Timorese people, Roman Catholicism, and the desire to adhere to international 51 http://ilga.org/ 52 UN AIDS: Geneva: Nov 27, 2008 53 Commission on AIDS in Asia, Redefining AIDS in Asia: crafting an effective response, 2008, p. 187. 17 norms and standards. Indonesia, Malaysia and Bangladesh are countries where the tensions between women\u2019s rights and religion/culture are intense and resolved in diverse ways. Fiji has a vibrant women\u2019s rights movement supported in the Pacific which has also touched on issues relating to reproductive rights and sexual rights. This study looks at existing laws that reflect the levels of sensitivity and willingness of the state to deal with issues relating to sexuality, such as laws on sex work, homosexuality, sodomy etc. as juxtaposed with constitutional guarantees and other legal guarantees of equality and non-discrimination. In addition to the legal frameworks that may contribute to persistent and systemic discrimination against people with non-heteronormative sexual behavior and practices, were the policy frameworks that could marginalize such individuals and groups, when for example, it came to issues of access to public services such as health and education. Thus, failure of education services to be sensitive to incidents of bullying of \u2018effeminate\u2019 boys in school contributes to early drop out from schools of adolescents who are not conforming to the norm; this means they have a lower level of education that in turn has an impact on their employment potential. In the same way, the failure of health policy to be sensitive to non- normative sexualities leads to major problems for transgender and intersexed persons when they require hospitalization. The study also probes into the factors that contribute to the lack of access and control over sustainable incomes and assets by non-heteronormative persons. The existing discourse on the inter-sectionality of discrimination and oppression enables us to understand the full complexity of discrimination and oppression experienced by those who are non- heteronormative on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity since it allows for consideration of the impact of other factors such as race, class, ethnicity, religion, ability, on the manifestation of discrimination and oppression. The study also reviews the situation of persons of non-normative sexualities when confronting systems of law enforcement and justice, including community-based systems of justice. Sodomy laws effectively criminalize homosexuality in many of the countries in the region, and even though numbers of actual prosecution under these laws is very low, they provide justification for harassment and intimidation of these communities by law enforcement officers. The social stigma and practice of ostracism against these communities render them even more vulnerable to abuse and ill treatment. There are many instances of police brutality as well as attacks by members of their own families and communities that are confronted by members of groups discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity.54 The silence about the existence of people of non-normative sexualities in the media and their absence from the public arena perpetuates prejudice and discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Sri Lankan groups working for an end to discrimination against people from non-normative communities have documented reports 54 See for example the report of the People\u2019s Union for Civil Liberties (Karnataka) India 18 from the media in which prejudicial and derogatory remarks against lesbians have generated some public debate. A Letter to the Editor published by the English daily The Island, went so far as to advocate the rape of lesbians by a team of convicted rapists. When the group that had proposed organizing a conference of lesbians filed a complaint against the newspaper with the Press Council of Sri Lanka, the Council in its turn condemned lesbianism as \u201csadistic and salacious.55 From India, there were two cases in which people elected to public office lost their seats because of challenges on the basis", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a83d40b-113f-4581-9b47-0dc9c57fc234": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a83d40b-113f-4581-9b47-0dc9c57fc234", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39bfe7faf631826d14585252af11dc160a62073ea8bec88520b9adb10e731ddb"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ba217e6-b071-4b3f-b6a9-fbb3f396c8f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01c957c91451a9f41d8e4b73341a09a45f6ea04d5fc41381962f700193fb9ea3"}}, "hash": "4afae564ef0f93852abb4b67ad21ed9ec71fd3d3c4f0f819e0bafab8d3785040", "text": "of their \u2018indeterminate\u2019 sex56 while a popular woman athlete from South India had to surrender her silver medal at the Asia Games in Doha in 2006 because of testing that pointed to ambiguities as to her sex.57 These silences are maintained in the public arena through the absence of any reference to these communities in public documents. National household surveys, for example, in all the countries of the region do not include consideration of the situation of members of non- normative sexualities even when the impact of other forms of diversity such as ethnicity, caste, religion and so on is well recognized in data gathering structures. This is the case, for example, when one looks at surveys regarding household poverty or distribution of resources. This is also the case in surveys conducted by international agencies. It is only in the arena of HIV/AIDS prevention that one finds some references being made to men who have sex with men and to sex workers. There is also the reality of gendered differences within the communities that face discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity and in terms of responses to the needs and concerns of these communities that is shaped by the overall framework of male domination and patriarchy that prevails in all societies in the Asia-Pacific region. Thus the situation of female-to-male transgender is different from the situation of a male-to-female transgender. The situation of lesbians is different to that of gays. Gay men and male-to-female trans persons enjoy access to public space and social interaction in ways that are often not accessible and open to lesbians and female-to-male trans-persons. In all countries, there is a tension between denial of the existence of non-normative sexualities and acceptance. In South Asia, there are two culturally visible and publicly institutionalized non-normative gender/sexual subcultures. One of these is known as the Hijra,58 a community of \u2018males\u2019 mostly from lower classes who desire \u2018macho\u2019 males and often identify as \u2018female\u2019 or \u2018non-man\u2019. The second subculture is of \u2018effeminate\u2019 males who self-identify as Kothi. In Thailand, the katoey or \u2018tomboy\u2019 is an accepted part of mainstream society. In addition, in many societies of the Asia-Pacific region, marriage is an obligatory 55 The Status of Lesbians, Bisexual Women and Transgendered Persons in Sri Lanka; NGO Shadow Report to the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women; Women\u2019s Support Group, Sri Lanka January 2011 56 In one case, Aasha Devi who won the elections for the post of Mayor of Gorakhpur in 2000 as a woman, was later disqualified due to a petition that claimed she was a man; she was later reinstated: see theviewspaper.net/the-fate-of-eunuchs-in-politics 57 Indian silver medalist female runner at Asian Games fails gender test: International Herald Tribune: Dec 18 2006 58 For a detailed analysis of the Hijra and Kothi and the rise of LGBT see Hossain, Adnan (fc) 2008 \u2018socio- political review of LGBT Issues in Bangladesh\u2019 in Greenwood Encyclopedia of LGBT Issues Worldwide.

This reality has led to the evolution of the category of \u2018men who have sex with men\u2019 (MSM) as distinct from homosexual men, being a category that encapsulates men who live within the bounds of heterosexual and monogamous marriage and engage in sex with other men as a regular part of their life. In every country, there are reports of violence against people because of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Hijra, Kothi and other \u2018effeminate\u2019 males are often vulnerable to violations of their rights including abduction, arbitrary arrests, detention, beatings and gang rape by law enforcement agencies as well as by community policing. There are also extensive reports of physical and psychological molestation of \u2018effeminate\u2019 males in academic institutions and workplaces. In Bangladesh, most Hijra and Kothi- identified persons who attended schools cited bullying as one of the preeminent reasons for dropout from state sponsored primary schools. Many are reported to have turned suicidal and experienced acute psychological trauma.

The lack of appropriate sexuality education within the school system in most countries is also a factor that leads to ignorance and prejudice, especially against persons on non-normative sexualities. A survey conducted by the Family Planning Association of Sri Lanka in 1986-87 revealed that sexual myths and taboos--not solid information about human physiology and development--dominate young people's knowledge of reproductive health. Sex education is not a part of the curriculum in Sri Lankan schools, although 90% of the youth surveyed believed such courses should be offered.61 Lack of awareness regarding sexual orientation and gender identity among members of the medical and healthcare professions also lead to many problems for persons of non-normative sexualities. For example, human rights groups in Bangladesh have pointed out that although the psychiatric establishment in Bangladesh follows DSM (the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) of the American Psychiatric Association, which has removed homosexuality from the list of diseases in 1973, many psychiatrists and psychologists in Bangladesh still consider homosexuality as an \u2018aberrant\u2019 condition and provide curative therapies often to the 59 See Hossain, Adnan, 2005.

Awareness about marginal sexualities and gender identities among the medical professionals in government mental hospitals is very low, and many doctors consider homosexuality as a \u2018psychotic\u2019 disorder.62 In addition, the idea that non-normative individuals can desire to reproduce and to have children is still a very contentious issue in the region. Although the principle of \u2018surrogate\u2019 motherhood is now protected by law in India, for example, the impact on same-sex couples is still unclear. The difficulties faced by lesbians who want to have access to reproductive health care, or by same-sex couples who want to adopt a child require careful and consistent attention if discrimination in this area is to be challenged.63 6.2 Resistance in the Region There is increasingly compelling evidence that shows that there is growing resistance to the marginalization of non-normative communities coming from within those communities as well as from the broader human rights communities in most countries in the Asia-Pacific region. There are many groups and networks working on sexual rights and sexuality related issues in general, within a broad human rights framework, as well as groups working with specific communities and on specific areas of rights of people of non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity. While the movements for sexual rights are quite advanced in countries like India and Thailand, even in countries that are newly emerging onto the global arena of debate on sexual rights, such as Mongolia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, there are nascent groups that espouse the politics of sexual rights activism and are creating spaces for debate and discussion.64 Global networks such as the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA) and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) have regular and systematic links with groups in the region through their Asia-Pacific programmes.65 The ILGA International Conference in 2007 was held in Thailand, for instance.66 Regional networks on women\u2019s rights have been at the forefront in creating the space for women of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities to raise their concerns. Other networks on human rights, on migration, and indigenous people\u2019s issues have been slower to come on board. HIV/AIDS prevention campaigns in many countries in the region have focused on the need to be more open to issues of discrimination and violence against people because of their sexual orientation and gender identity on the basis that criminalization of same-sex sexual activity, for example, leads to greater vulnerability to transmission of the virus.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "79b3cb0d-4ebe-46b4-bc16-6c504b4c49dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "79b3cb0d-4ebe-46b4-bc16-6c504b4c49dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79f58578dbcf71d63bab0669a3f9f733d01b6cd498784083a2714b8c45379f13"}, "2": {"node_id": "e46fb218-7b13-4657-905c-5a010b764012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eda9cb9f1dac0a290b010934b654bde64025d1065f5495d2fe6d263a67010524"}}, "hash": "c7ba4e8d040969690c09d5c27f1905b3fd26bebb22bdec2c9bfdaaafe3d73215", "text": "A report issued by the 62 Email correspondence by Hossain, Adnan with clinical psychologists practicing as interns in government mental hospitals on 11/8/08, quoted in Bangladesh UPR report, 2009 63 The Assisted Reproductive Technologies (Regulations) Bill 2010 64 For example, the Mogolian LGBT Rights Centre, and 65 http://asia.ilga.org/; http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/region/6.html 66http://asia.ilga.org/3rd_ilga_asia_regional_conference_chiang_mai_thailand_24_27_january_2008/about_the_ conference 21 Independent Commission on AIDS in Asia in March 2008 points out that 50 per cent of new HIV infections in the region would be among men having sex with men.67 On Human Rights Day 2010, the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon appealed for decriminalization and non-discrimination stating that: \u201cTogether, we seek the repeal of laws that criminalize homosexuality, that permit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, that encourage violence.

We cannot stand by. We cannot be silent.\u201d 68 Difficulties faced by Indian and global health programmes working for the prevention and eradication of HIV/AIDS in India have led to several senior UN officials calling on the Indian government to de-criminalise homosexuality. In the face of increased rates of infection among men who have sex with men in India, in November 2008, Jeffrey O\u2019Malley, Director of the UNDP programme on HIV/AIDS called on the Indian government to reform its laws.69 Within the same month, Peter Piot, Executive Director of UNAIDS repeated this call, reported as saying that an \u201coutdated Indian law that criminalises sex between men is a major obstacle to curb the rising reach of HIV/AIDS in India\u201d.70 Union Health Minister of India Dr. Anbumani Ramadoss had earlier attempted to have this section of the Penal Code repealed, but following severe criticism from other Parliamentarians, the debate has now shifted to a reform of the existing law.71 Activity by civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations working in the field of HIV/AIDS and sexual health has created new arenas for discussion on sexuality related issues. A range of different groups and networks working on HIV/AIDS have been brought together under the aegis of the regularly held International Conferences on AIDS in the Asia Pacific (ICAAP). This space has enabled critical alliance building initiatives including the Asia Pacific Network on Sex Workers (APNSW) and the Asia Pacific Coalition on Male Sexual Health (APCOM), and has allowed for these issues to become a part of the public domain. For example, in the Community Forum at the 8th ICAAP held in Colombo in 2007, there was active representation by LGBTI groups from the Asia-Pacific region.72 In South and Southeast Asia, celebrations around the International Day against Homophobia (IDAHO) in May 2008 saw more organizations participating for the first time, were simultaneously unfurled in Jakarta, Surabaya, Yogyakarta and Makassar in Indonesia.73 In each city, there were a range of activities including art exhibitions, film screenings and discussions. In June 2008, Delhi saw its first Queer Pride demonstration and in Bangladesh, 67 Commission on AIDS in Asia, Redefining AIDS in Asia: crafting an effective response, (2008) 68 http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=37026 69 http://www.unaids.org/en/Resources/PressCentre/Featurestories/2009/July/20090707MSMLaw/ 70 News Track India website, 17.11.2008 71 See Times of India, August 11, 2008 73 International Day Against Homophobia Committee, Annual Report 2008-2009, p. 39. 22 the International Day against Homophobia was celebrated for the first time in a public lounge under the banner of a gay-identified group.74 Information available also shows that the arena of research teaching and training is one in which the issues of sexuality may be opened up for greater public debate. In China, the Institute of Sexuality and Gender at Renmin University is actively promoting research on a range of topics including the \u2018underground\u2019 sex industry, and sexuality among youth and students.75 Pan Suiming and Huang Yingying examine the ways in which rapid transformation of the social, cultural and economic environment in China has created new spaces and arenas for the exploration of sexuality. According to their research, traditional social systems have changed under the impetus provided by modernisation and the opening up of China to the outside world. As traditional family systems have altered and residency patterns have changed, social controls have loosened up and the potential for diverse forms of personal interaction emerge.76 In April 2009, a conference on \u2018Contested innocence: sexual agency in public and private space\u2019 was organized in Hanoi, Vietnam by the International Association for the study of Sexuality, Culture and Society.77 The South and Southeast Asia Resource Centre on Sexuality based in Delhi, India and working in China, Viet Nam and Indonesia, has played a critical role in supporting these initiatives.78 At the national level too, there are many training activities that focus on issues of sexuality and on promoting the rights and equality of persons of non-normative sexual practices and behavior not only with non-heteronormative communities but with social justice and human rights activists in general.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53140c83-e3ec-4f16-a828-c59ede227269": {"__data__": {"id_": "53140c83-e3ec-4f16-a828-c59ede227269", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff0de01977860e13fc08fee355840bc1da86bb1617ed535ef4fe877255e4b694"}, "2": {"node_id": "70de9053-fff1-459e-a0c4-fdb18ee81e82", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5105fd942da6dea18048dc0c9ac735e19874aa97e22f7559a9f2fea2c2eed6e8"}}, "hash": "d61ce22c62c3da0ae1fb904844edb0db4895bb4849e68b48c67761966dc88d0f", "text": "CREA and TARSHI (Talking About Reproductive and Sexual Health Issues), two groups working on sexuality and rights from a base in New Delhi, organized the first Sexuality And Rights Institute for Indian social movement activists in India in 22.

At times, this has had a negative impact, as in the case of Sri Lanka where newspapers attacked a proposal to hold a lesbian conference, 74 http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1818912,00.html 75 See website of Renmin University; www.english.ruc.edu.cn, 76 A research paper titled \u2018The Rise of Rights and Pleasure: Towards a Diversity of Sexuality and Gender\u2019 by Pan Suiming and Huang Yingying 77 http://iasscs.com/VII-Conference 78 www.tarshi.net 79 www.sexualityinstitute..org 80 http://www.tarshi.net/asiasrc/rinst/rinstitute.asp 81 www.wsgsrilanka.org 23 or in the case of Indian groups in Lucknow who had an AIDS awareness activity labeled as a promotion of homosexuality.82 But in general, the higher levels of visibility, especially in academic and official circles, is useful and necessary in an environment in which gaining acceptance for the principle of equal rights for all remains a challenge. The issue of discrimination and violence against persons of non-normative sexualities has taken a huge step forward in Nepal with the election of Sunil Pant of the Blue Diamond Society as a member of the Constituent Assembly tasked with the drafting of the new Nepali Constitution. The Blue Diamond Society has been actively engaged in promoting the rights of persons of non-normative sexualities since its inception in 2001 and has offices in 20 districts of the country.83 6.3 Legal frameworks in the region Research shows quite clearly that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, created in 1860 by the British colonial regime, titled Unnatural Offences is replicated in every country that was a part of the British Empire, directly or as protectorates.84 This law penalises \u2018carnal intercourse against the order of nature: Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\u2019 The Explanation that accompanies the text of the law defines the act of \u2018carnal intercourse\u2019 further: Penetration is sufficient to constitute the carnal intercourse necessary to the offence described in this section.85 In India, and in many other Commonwealth countries where this law prevails, judgments under this law show that only vaginal penetration by a penis is considered to constitute the \u2018natural\u2019 act of sexual intercourse. Thus, although the law has been loosely dubbed the \u2018Sodomy\u2019 laws, in fact it allows for the criminalization not only of anal intercourse \u2013 even between consenting married adults - but also of oral sex. 86 The broad nature of the definition has meant that the law could be used for harassment of anyone suspected by law enforcement officers to be of a non-normative sexuality and leads to arbitrary arrest and detention, torture and other human rights abuses.

In 2006, the State Government of Kelantan imposed a ban on Mak Yong performances despite UNESCO certifying these as a world cultural heritage. No action was taken to challenge this ban by the Federal Government.105 In Cambodia, the suppression of the rights of sex workers in the name of anti-trafficking efforts and its implications for HIV prevention creates yet another area of concern. The police started cracking down on brothels and arresting and harassing sex workers after the enactment of a new anti-trafficking law in 2008, which was interpreted to equate sex work with trafficking.106 As a consequence, sex workers have been driven underground and HIV prevention efforts targeted at them have been disrupted. This has resulted in a 31 per cent reduction on condom distribution, a reduction in the number of entertainment sector workers accessing sexual health services and a 15 per cent reduction on the number of referrals to STI clinics.107 6.4 Challenges to legal frameworks Over the years, different states in the Asia-Pacific region have confronted diverse challenges to discriminatory laws, usually initiated by civil society groups. Many discriminatory laws have been repealed and reformed over the past years, especially those that had perpetuated discrimination against women, dalits, tribal and indigenous peoples. However, challenges to laws that discriminate against people on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity have been slower to gain ground. At times, the results of efforts at law reform have in fact reaffirmed the divide between normative and non-normative sexual practice and behavior. In Sri Lanka, the text of the law criminalizing \u2018unnatural\u2019 sexual behavior was applicable only to men since it referred to \u2018He\u2019 throughout. However, a move to institute gender neutrality in the law in 1995, as a part of broad reforms of the Penal Code, resulted in the word being changed from \u2018he\u2019 to \u2018person\u2019. Although this was done throughout the Penal Code, with regard to the Section defining \u2018unnatural\u2019 sexual acts, it made it applicable to women as well. Consensual sexual activity between adults of the same sex remains a crime under Article 365 and 365A of the 1883 Penal Code.108 In October 2007, the chamber in Singapore passed a bill legalising oral and anal sex for the first time, but only between heterosexual couples. Thus, Section 377A in Singapore remains a valid law that criminalizes same sex behavior. Under the legislation, a man caught committing an act of \u201cgross indecency\u201d with another man could still be jailed for up to two 105 http://blogs.straitstimes.com/2010/07/13/malay-makyong-is-dying/ 106 Human Rights Watch, Off the Streets: Arbitrary Detention and Other Abuses against Sex Workers in Cambodia, (2010). 107 Lisle, Tony.

It reiterated the diversity in physical growth, sexual orientation and gender identity in the country. Thus, according to the reasoning of the Court, equal rights, identity and expression must be ensured regardless of sex at birth. The Court also issued a directive order to form a seven-member committee including a doctor appointed by the Health Ministry, one representative each from the National Human Rights commission, the Law Ministry, the Nepal police, the Ministry of Population and Environment and one advocate as a representative from the LGBTI community, to conduct a study into legal standards on same- sex marriage.116 In India, although section 377 stands to decriminalize same-sex relationships between consenting adults, the matter remains in Court due to challenges to the petition by a number of right wing and extremist groups. In response to these challenges to the law and to social practice, laws in Nepal and India have been changed to enable the inclusion of a third category of gender into the national registration/identification card.

In 2006, The Sexual Diversity Coalition, a coalition of activists working for sexual rights in Thailand, called for the inclusion of equality for persons of non-normative sexual practices and behavior within the new Constitution. The National Human Rights Commission supported this call.119 Although the process of creating the new Constitution saw this proposal being defeated, for the first time the topic became the matter of serious public debate. In 2007, the Coalition lobbied the Constitutional Drafting Committee to specify sexual orientation and gender identity as grounds for protection against 115 www.cnngo.com/life/fighting for gay rights in nepal 116 http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/nepal/Nepal-SC-approves-same-sex-marriage/Article1- 352722.aspx 117 John Godwin, (2010), op. cit., pp. 16-17. 118 HIV and AIDS Data Hub for Asia-Pacific, http://www.aidsdatahub.org/en/country-profiles/india 119 Godwin, John. 2010.

These terms are now spelled out in the Letter of Intention to be included under the category of sexual discrimination in the Constitution.120 In the Philippines, efforts to get an anti-discrimination law framed in the form of an equal protection clause in the Bill of Rights to prevent any kind of harassment, violence and discrimination towards non-heteronormative people is underway.121 In September 2008, Jennifer Cagandahan, who was classified as female at birth went to the Supreme Court of the Philippines to claim that she had \u2018naturally occurring male characteristics\u2019 and was granted leave by the Court to change her name and gender entries in her birth certificate. The trial court likewise ordered that Cagandahan's school records, voter's registry, baptismal certificate and other pertinent records amended to conform with the corrected data. The Court, in its decision, pointed out that in the 20th century, medicine adopted the term \"intersexuality\" to apply to human beings who cannot be classified as either male or female, or a state of a gonochoristic species whose sex chromosomes, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics are determined to be neither exclusively male or female. \"In deciding this case, we consider the compassionate calls for recognition of various degrees of intersex as variations which should not be subject to outright denial\", the Court ruled. \"Ultimately, we are of the view that where the person is biologically or naturally intersex, the determining factor in his gender classification would be what the individual, like respondent, having reached the age of majority, with good reason thinks of his/her sex\", the Court said in its 13- page decision penned by Senior Associate Justice Leonardo Quisumbing.122 The Equal Opportunities Act of 2008 in Mauritius provides an innovative direction to the Asia-Pacific region. The Act in Article 2 defines the grounds of discrimination including \u2018any other status\u2019 and then defines that to include sexual orientation. Article 5 of the Act goes on to prohibit discrimination on the basis of the status of an aggrieved person.123 6.5 Reflecting on the experiences: Lessons learned As the preceding cases demonstrate, throughout the Asia-Pacific region there is a growing consensus that democratization calls for the recognition of the rights of all human beings to equality and non-discrimination as affirmed in international human rights laws. In addition, there is recognition of the richness of human diversity and of the valuable social, political and economic roles that can be played by persons of diverse sexual orientations and gender identities. These are crucial factors when considering the challenges of realizing the full potential of each and every human being in human development. At the same time, experience shows that in spite of the silencing, the policing, the marginalizing, communities of people who express love and desire through non-normative sexual practices and behaviour are claiming their space in all the countries of the Asia-Pacific region through a range of activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24867174-13f1-48f6-9047-803347569c21": {"__data__": {"id_": "24867174-13f1-48f6-9047-803347569c21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16f3e931780182c97b1ca23e54a90516a2ef9979c7786abd2a7d00d3c361a2c5"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d0cee05-409b-4469-846f-062c36370506", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b6c1c1661debf4b11fceea81775a4ed5c45ff6a05d6c1fce823c37a63bc2bb0"}}, "hash": "a21397330043e42505b17fa9276d0a8948bb85c4b72a7b302e5c4a3e66f5a3ae", "text": "Some are challenging existing legal and policy frameworks that exclude and marginalize people on the basis of their sexual orientation and 120 http://www.iglhrc.org/cgi-bin/iowa/article/takeaction/resourcecenter/552.html 121 http://tarshi.net/asiasrc/plspk/2006_4/campaign.asp 122 www.aprainbow.org, website of the Asia-Pacific Network of Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transgenders, Intersex and Queer People (APRainbow) 123 http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=45599 30 gender identity, for example in India and Thailand.

The growing strength of national and regional networks and alliances that bring together diverse groups working for equality and non-discrimination to include the issues of people discriminated against on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity on the same agenda as all other forms of discrimination contributes to the growing visibility and acceptance of these communities at every level. Organizing around HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness programmes seems to provide a collective space in which to organize for the recognition of sexual diversity, not only because of the availability of funding but because of the legitimacy gained from association with agencies such as UNAIDS that actively work for the rights of men who have sex with men. Among the UN agencies, UNIFEM (now UNWOMEN), the UN agency with the mandate for the promotion of women\u2019s rights, has begun to integrate and include issues of discrimination and violence against women because of their sexual orientation and gender identity using the principles of equality and non-discrimination enshrined in CEDAW. In Viet Nam, a study on Gender and the Law sponsored by UNIFEM highlights the need for guarantees of equality to include non-discrimination on the basis of sex and gender as well as on the basis of other grounds of discrimination including sexual orientation.124 A report prepared by UNIFEM for legal reform in the Solomon Islands proposes the inclusion of sexual orientation in the anti- discrimination clause in the Constitution.125 However, it must not be forgotten that even within the communities that have common and shared experiences of marginalization and discrimination, there are levels of misunderstanding and chauvinism that create obstacles and barriers to the best possible collective activism. Lesbians, bisexual women and female-to-male trans persons perhaps face the greatest discrimination since they confront the multiple oppression that comes from their being people of non-normative sexualities. They are subject to all the forms of oppression and discrimination experienced by women in general and are also subject to discrimination and violence on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, lesbian, bisexual women and male-to-female trans persons experience marginalization within the media, and in terms of access to resources. In addition, we must take into consideration the fact that there is resistance to the recognition and legitimisation of non-normative sexualities by governments and large segments of society in the Asia-Pacific region as well. Challenging the legal and policy barriers as well as the prejudices and misconceptions that fuel the resistances remains a major undertaking in this arena, calling for cultural sensitivity and for greater outreach to strengthen consensus and understanding. 124 Chiongson, Rea. 2009.

UNIFEM 31 The successes clearly point to the need to build political and social alliances around the issues of discrimination and violence against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. Most of the political and legal successes referred to above have emerged in the context of the broadest possible processes of alliance building. Linking all forms of discrimination has been critical in these processes, drawing in women, members of minority communities and marginalized social groups to reflect on the collective experience of discrimination and violence to develop a collective voice for equality. While there is no doubt that it is courageous individuals who have often come forward to break the silences and denials of centuries, their individual bravery would not have achieved the results they did without broad social and political support that develops out of broad and collective organizing and mobilizing. The case of MP Sunil Pant in Nepal is one such case. There is also a need to engage in a more expanded public discourse that can challenge the many misconceptions and prejudices against people who express non-normative sexual behavior and practices. Improving the work that groups working to combat discrimination and violence against persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity calls for enhancing work with the media and with public education. It calls for greater outreach to media groups that espouse the principles of the freedom of expression, opinion and information as well as for greater collaboration with groups of professional educators and trainers. Developing creative and innovative methodologies for public outreach work remains a major challenge in this area. In particular, developing arguments that will help convince decision-makers, including senior policy makers that focus on the economic and political disadvantages of continuing to ignore the realities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85498172-a82c-4a8d-a54a-246abcd50c40": {"__data__": {"id_": "85498172-a82c-4a8d-a54a-246abcd50c40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c9b92ff25ca25aa69f23ee06f4f1b2c4ea2005295d381dc2580229c600fddc2"}}, "hash": "6c9b92ff25ca25aa69f23ee06f4f1b2c4ea2005295d381dc2580229c600fddc2", "text": "of non-normative sexualities. Focusing on the very real economic and social contribution of such communities to national economies and to strengthening social cohesion must form a substantial part of any campaign to win over public attitudes. An area in which least progress has been made is in that of the greater economic equity and security for persons of non-normative sexualities. Many examples from around the region point to the fact that there is little legal protection for persons of non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity in terms of employment. Therefore, challenging dismissal from employment, or failure to recruit, because of sexual orientation or gender identity is extremely difficult. In several cases, we have seen that recruitment into the military is one area in which there have been some challenges. In Thailand, a decision to restrict recruitment to teacher training colleges to deliberately exclude homosexuals was challenged but this is still the exception rather than the rule in the Asia-Pacific region.126 In addition, transgender persons face many challenges when it comes to issues of affirming their legal identities, which can have a direct and indirect impact on their capacity to hold a job and engage in economically productive activities. Although in some countries, like India, transgender persons have won the right to an identity that clearly states their specific \u2018trans\u2019 identity, in most of the region, trans persons continue to be boxed into the dual identity of 126 Jackson, Peter (1999). Lady Boys, Tom Boys, Rent Boys: Male and Female Homosexualities in Contemporary Thailand. Haworth Press. pp. xv-xiv. ISBN 0789006561. 32 male and female.127 In Muslim communities, male-to-female trans persons may confront challenges to their inheritance rights since there may be disputes regarding their male/female status, which has a critical impact on the determining their share of the inheritance. Kartini in Malaysia has cited this as a reason for her deciding NOT to reveal her trans identity to her community.128 Trying to push public discourse without first having built up a substantial support base can often lead to reversals in this area. The experiences of the groups from Thailand that are engaged in the campaign to include non-discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in their new Constitution is a good example. Despite winning the support of the Thai Human Rights Commission and of regional and international groups working against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, the Thai groups could not convince a sufficient number of Parliamentarians and politicians of the usefulness of this addition to the Constitution. They continue their campaign, having absorbed the lessons of their first rebuttal. 7. Challenges and potential solutions for the future The continued absence of persons who are openly able to espouse a call for protection of rights of persons of non-normative sexual orientations and gender identities, including of persons who themselves are of a non-normative sexuality, from decision-making arenas remains a major challenge for the future. Prejudice and the traditional practice of social exclusion of anyone who challenges the norms set out by a particular society and/or community play a key role in the perpetuation of this form of discrimination and marginalization. There is a need to address the dual arenas of legal and institutional structures that are discriminatory along with social and customary practices that support and facilitate the existence of discriminatory laws and policies. While there can be no question of the need to develop strategies that address both arenas, it is clear that legal protection of the rights of persons of non-normative sexual practices is an imperative factor that can enable the full participation of these individuals and communities in the economic, social and political life of their societies. Once the principle of equality is established in law, it becomes easier to create spaces for the inclusion of persons of non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity in the public arena, through the media and through social programming. There may also be lessons to be learned from the strategies adopted by the women\u2019s movements in the region to secure enhanced representation of women in decision-making structures. The most successful initiatives have been at the local and community levels, with millions of women becoming members of the panchayat system in India and thousands becoming members of Ward Committees in Nepal in the 1990s.129 This proved that it is easier to capture the attention of 127 John Godwin, Legal environments, human rights and HIV responses among men who have sex with men and transgender people in Asia and the Pacific: an agenda for action, UNDP, APCOM, (2010) 128 http://tarshi.net/asiasrc/plspk/2008_1/interview.asp. 129 UNDP Human Development Report", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3f19a610-1918-4bc1-ae43-2c11dc9c9e94": {"__data__": {"id_": "3f19a610-1918-4bc1-ae43-2c11dc9c9e94", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/13", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/13", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "11f73f4d1e2c31cae107ff71845714b4e35b962e1af46f54a8a731ffc08f453d"}}, "hash": "11f73f4d1e2c31cae107ff71845714b4e35b962e1af46f54a8a731ffc08f453d", "text": "2010 33 the public in the face of historical marginalization and discrimination when one appeals to communities directly. The process of transformation for full acceptance of persons of non-normative sexual practices and behavior into the national mainstream and for the recognition of their rights to equality and non-discrimination at every level in the social, political and economic life of a society is undoubtedly a long and arduous one. In the legal arena there must be steps taken to repeal discriminatory laws and to guarantee the equality including equal opportunities and equal access to every sphere and arena of life to persons of non-normative sexualities. Judicial and other official procedures and structures that allow for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity must also be subject to reform and amendment. This will bring the countries of the Asia-Pacific region into consonance with the global community where the principle of non-discrimination against persons on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity has been well established in law, and in practice. At every level in the social arena, in the community as well as in the family, and at the national level, there must be a series of initiatives that can present the non-normative person as a full and equal member of society and of the community. Prejudice and stigma and persons of non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity should be confronted and combated on the understanding that their exclusion diminishes the society and the community as a whole and leaves us unable to access and enjoy the richness that their full participation will bring to every aspect of our lives. Concrete strategies that seek to enhance access to opportunities and resources for persons and communities of persons of non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity should be promoted. These can include funding accompanied by strategies that affirm inclusion of diversity as a fundamental principle of democratic society through legal and other institutional mechanisms and structures that pave the way for sustained and long-term changes in attitudes and perceptions in this regard. If one were to distil five messages for the promotion of equality of persons of non-normative sexual orientation and gender identity and enhance their capacity to enjoy and contribute to human development, one would have to identify the following: - Guarantee and affirm the legal protection of people on the basis of non-discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, through the reiteration of existing guarantees for equality in Constitutions and other laws; bringing the country in line with international norms and standards as well as establishing respect for human rights and human dignity as a principle if national laws and law-making processes can be critical results of such a step. - Create and strengthen legal standards that guarantee equal rights in employment and access to economic resources including land and property for persons of non- normative sexualities. 34 - Create legal frameworks and promote statistical and data gathering frameworks that take into consideration the existence of trans persons including protection of their rights to engage in processes of physical transformation and their rights to an identity that is not confined to the male/female paradigm. Issuing identity cards that allow for a person to specify a \u2018third gender\u2019 as an option could be a vital first step in this direction. - Support creative and innovative public education and media strategies that would promote a positive image of persons of non-normative sexual orientations and gender identities and also present social analysis of an inclusive world. These could focus on the fact that all forms of discrimination create social inequalities and dissonances that have long-term impacts on human development. - Amend and reform existing directives and policies on sexual health to ensure that appropriate and effective consideration is paid to the specific needs of persons of non- normative sexual orientation and gender identity when seeking help from medical and health professionals and institutions. In June 2O11, responding to a spate of homophobic rapes in South Africa, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Ms Navaneethan Pillay said: \u201cRecognizing that lesbians, gays and bisexuals, transgender and intersex persons are vulnerable to violence and discrimination is an important step towards realizing the basic rights of all people.

Although the phenomenon of male sex workers is common, because of the intense stigma against male-to male sex and the illegal status of prostitution in China, male brothels are much more discrete than the venues hosting female sex workers. In August 2O1O reports surfaced about a widespread crackdown on sex workers in different parts of the country and a protest by female sex workers in Wuhan in central Hubei province. Shanghai Leyi, an organization supporting male sex workers, also went on record commenting on the gravity of the crackdown and its repercussions on the community they work with.132 Cambodia In 2008, Sou Southevy, a 70-year-old transgendered sex worker activist from Cambodia became the first person to lodge a civil complaint with the ECCC- \"the Khmer Rouge Tribunal\" - citing instances of gender based crimes during the Pol Pot regime which came under scrutiny for human rights abuses in the course of this Tribunal. In doing so she not only challenged the silence in her society about matters relating to sexuality but for the first time pushed an investigation into allegations of mass killings of transgendered persons during the conflict in Cambodia133. Southevy is a transgendered person (male-to-female) who was imprisoned several times in re- education camps as well as in prisons during the Khmer Rouge regime by Khmer Rouge soldiers and cadres. She was punished for having committed \u201cmoral offences\u201d and for \u201cbehaving as a woman\u201d, by being forced to cut her long hair and to wear men\u2019s clothing. She was threatened with death if she refused to marry a woman, and the Khmer Rouge ordered the performance of sexual intercourse as part of the marital obligation. Her experience during the Khmer Rouge period was a major factor in her decision to become an activist for the rights of transgenders, gays, lesbians and sex workers. Southevy is now the Director of a local NGO, the Cambodian Network of Men and Women\u2019s Development (CNMWD), that fights for the rights of sex workers and sexual minorities. 131 Gill, Bates, Huang, Yangzhong, Lu, Xiaoqing: Demography of HIV/AIDS in China: A report of the Task Force on HIV/AIDS of the Centre for Strategic and International Studies; July 2007; p 14 132 www.guardian.co.uk/world/2O1O/august O3 133 www.ipsnews.net/news: Khmer Rouge trials bare sexual abuse: Phnom Penh September 8 2OO8 36 BIBLIOGRAPHY Books Blackwood, Evelyn and Wieringa, Saskia. 1999.

The law, whether formal or customary, is neither neutral nor gender blind: nor is it legislated or interpreted in a vacuum without reference to the political, economic, religious, social and cultural contexts. The law, both de jure and de facto, written and unwritten, by act or omission (failure to act) and by interpretation, significantly affects the capacity of women to harness the full potential of the benefits of development. This paper examines the significant gaps between the law de jure and women\u2019s experiences of the law on the ground, de facto reality. Changing law should not be an end in itself \u2013 formal legislative equality by itself is meaningless. Law can enhance human development if it is used positively to expand opportunities for women\u2019s greater participation in economic activities, in the political sphere and to alter the outcome of women\u2019s overall participation in development.

This means not only addressing formal legislative equality between men and women, but also historical and systemic disadvantage, and the additional responsibilities of paid and unpaid work, pregnancy, lactation, child care and so on. Gender justice recognises also that women are not a homogenous group. They have multiple identities, which also determine their status within society.

The law is one of these forces. Gender justice recognises also the need for temporary special measures, in favour of women, to accelerate de facto equality for women. A key question addressed throughout this paper has been: what impact does the law, written and unwritten, conventional and customary, have on Pacific Island women, and through them, on the lives of their children and families? The findings have been that the law, de jure and de facto, written and unwritten, by act or omission, and by interpretation, affects the capacity of women to harness the full potential of the benefits of development. It influences and shapes every aspect of their human development \u2013 their human security, their entry into the marketplace, their access to land, their capacity to obtain access to funds, their ability to gain political power, and their rights to child custody, financial support and property after separation or divorce. The link between the law and gender justice is therefore both causal and mutually reinforcing. Both conventional and customary legal systems are important for gender justice, and positively shaping and influencing both systems is vital. In responding to the questions, attention has been paid to the concept of discrimination, which means treating people in different ways, based on their sex, race, religion, political opinions, creed, sexual preference and so on. There are different models of equality, which affect the ways of addressing gender injustice. The \"strict equality\" approach says that women are the same as men and should be treated the same. According to the \"biological differences\" approach, women should be treated the same as men except where there must be allowance for biological differences. On the other hand the \"everything different\" approach says that women are quite different from men and should be given special treatment. Finally, the \"anti-subordination\" approach holds that women have been treated as inferior to men, and must have special treatment to become equal to men. The legislature and courts have not adopted a consistent approach, but an ad hoc one, based on a mixture of strict formal legal equality and equity, the various models of equality and protectionism. Protectionism, appears to have been the most consistent theme in new legislation, whilst courts have approached the \u201cproblem\u201d of gender equality within a formal legal equality paradigm. When assessing what constitutes discrimination, courts generally use male behaviour as the standard; they do not question the ways in which laws or cultures or social traditions have produced and maintained discrimination against women, or the extent to which our institutions are male-defined. 6 The approach preferred by women\u2019s groups in the Pacific region is generally that of substantive equality adopted by the Committee on the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), which identifies discrimination in terms of historical disadvantage. The disadvantage test is very similar to the anti- subordination approach, and acknowledges that discrimination against women is socially and economically based. The status of women in the constitution and customary law generally obstructs their access to education, employment and capacity to be heard in decision making, thus hindering their overall capacity to participate in economic activities. The tensions between customary law and mainstream constitutional protections continue to be a source of conflict which manifest themselves as conflicts between the rights of women to equality, versus what is perceived by many to be their traditional and \u2018proper\u2019 status. A legal policy option for mitigating the harmful effects of the customary system on women is to amend those Pacific Island Country or Territory (PICT) constitutions which recognise custom law, so that they contain a specific provision stating that where there is a conflict between women\u2019s rights to equality and custom, the former should prevail. CEDAW is the second most ratified international human rights treaty in the Pacific. The most significant added value for gender justice, of ratifying and reporting under the CEDAW treaty body mechanism, is that it provides an additional layer of accountability. Appearing before the CEDAW Committee every four years, and reporting to it, compels countries to \u201cstock take\u201d, and then attempt to improve women\u2019s gender justice before the next appearance. It is therefore critical that all Pacific Island countries and territories ratify CEDAW and report on it regularly. Tonga, Nauru and Palau have not ratified CEDAW, arguing for example, that in Palau, their women enjoy higher status than men in their matrilineal society, and ratification might mean a \u201cleveling down of their status\u201d.1 Tonga argues that its land laws cannot be amended to give women equal rights,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c395774c-fa64-45e6-a568-dac2e6b75f6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c395774c-fa64-45e6-a568-dac2e6b75f6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "137170949436d39798126a786abc497adbd7c4e3144ce5ee6f2eb09d990ec873"}}, "hash": "137170949436d39798126a786abc497adbd7c4e3144ce5ee6f2eb09d990ec873", "text": "as land is already a scarce resource. Convincing arguments are needed to demonstrate that treaty ratification can provide new and powerful opportunities to link and address both processes in order to bring them closer to each other.2 Fiji, PNG and Vanuatu have had the most success in passing new legislation, in compliance with CEDAW. In terms of approximate formal legislative compliance with CEDAW, Fiji has the highest compliance rate at 44 per cent ; Vanuatu, 35 per cent; Samoa, 35 per cent; Republic of Marshall Islands, 34 per cent; Papua New Guinea, 24 per cent; Cook Islands 24 per cent; Federated States of Micronesia, 23 per cent federal compliance (State compliance is higher \u2013 Yap, 25 per cent; Kosrae, 29 per cent; Chuuk, 29 per cent; and Pohnpei, 31 per cent); Kiribati 23 per cent; Solomon Island 20 per cent; and Tuvalu has the lowest at 18 per cent. No PICT is more than 50 per cent compliant. Fiji and Vanuatu improved their overall compliance, from being amongst the lowest ranked, to amongst the highest, with the passing of the Family Law Act 2003 in Fiji; and the Family Protection Act 2008 in Vanuatu. Until 2003, Samoa was ranked the highest. Samoa has made no significant changes in legislation, despite being the first PICT to ratify CEDAW. Although formal legislative compliance is an absolutely necessary first step, it is also necessary to develop a set of indicators to measure de facto reality, that is, to adequately and 1 In conversations with the author at the SPC Workshop for CEDAW Non-ratified countries, 5-7 November 2008, Nukualofa. Tonga. 2 Jalal, 2006. 7 accurately reflect the situation on the ground. The real picture of CEDAW compliance can only be measured by the collection of case law, numerical data/statistics and other forms of empirical evidence to assess real compliance with CEDAW.3 The opportunities provided by the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, a mandatory reporting mechanism for all UN members before the UN Human Rights Council, is a further possibility for women to hold their countries accountable for gender injustice, before the eyes of the world. Both Tonga and Tuvalu appeared in 2008, and during the Interactive Dialogue made promises about improving women\u2019s rights. These promises provide an important entry point for women\u2019s groups to mobilise locally to effect change. No Pacific Island constitution grants women full equality in substantive terms. If this is not protected specifically in the constitution itself, it reduces their ability to challenge inequality on constitutional grounds. The anti-discrimination provisions of the Bill of Rights in most PICTs appear to cover the public sector only. Amendments are needed to specifically cover the violations of human rights committed by the private sector. It is also critical that all PICTs have national human rights commissions and/or a regional human rights commission for the protection of rights outside the court system. The Pacific region has the lowest percentage of women in national legislatures. Of the eight countries in the world that have no female members in their national legislatures, four are in the Pacific. Access to political power is critical to make a difference in other women\u2019s lives, but women make up only 3.7 per cent of PICT legislatures.4 No PICT has national legislation for specific electoral quotas or reserved seats for women in the national legislature. Quotas provide a fast-track method to win seats, so reserved seats in legislation, are a necessary and critical policy and legal tool. Policy by itself is inadequate to effect change. There is no formalised discrimination in the criminal legislation, and the language is generally gender-neutral. For example, there are equal rules of evidence. The lack of gender equality is demonstrated in the interpretation of legislation, common law rules and practices. Violence against women is both a cause and consequence of gender inequality.5 It is a serious and endemic problem in the region and cuts across all social and economic classes. For the most part, the laws are ineffective in securing justice for women. Most sexual assault and domestic violence laws are based on myths about women\u2019s sexuality and roles, and no PICT has specifically legislated against traditional forgiveness ceremonies having any influence on criminal proceedings. However, Vanuatu\u2019s brand new Family Protection Act 2008 states that the payment of bride price has no bearing on guilt or punishment in domestic violence cases. Comprehensive stand-alone legislative reforms combating violence against women are needed in all countries. Despite the complexity and diversity of customary land tenure systems in the Pacific, women usually lack independent rights to land and have less input than men into decisions about land.

Indigenous women have, in theory, as much right to control and manage custom land, as men. Discrimination against women in terms of land ownership or access to the use 3 The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has embarked on such a project. 4 Based on figures from the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) \u201cWomen in Parliaments\u201d website (http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/world.htm) at the time of the commissioning of this paper 5 WHO, 2005. 8 of land is indirect. The interpretation of customary law governing the control and management of land gives power over land mainly to men. Tonga is the only country in the region in which the legislation explicitly discriminates against women. A small number of PICTs have matrilineal systems of land ownership, including across the Western and Northern parts of the Pacific, in which women have more access to, and control over land. Most of Micronesia is matrilineal, and matrilineal societies exist in both Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. However, women\u2019s roles in matrilineal societies are increasingly constrained. The power that women exercise over land generally varies across matrilineal areas. Although in some areas, matriliny is tantamount to gender equality and equal political power, in other areas, women have much less power and less say in decision making.6 The post-conflict constitutional making process in the Solomon Islands has offered women the rare opportunity to influence their land rights in legislation. They have proposed new language to secure their land rights which will, if accepted: recognise both patrilineal and matrilineal customs; provide constitutional guarantees that none of the custom laws, traditions, systems and institutions shall be applied to unfairly discriminate against women; and ensure that women are entitled to participate equitably in the planning and decision making process, through participation in community land management committees. The economic and social costs of gender discrimination in the employment, health and education sectors are significant. It impedes women\u2019s participation in employment, reduces their productivity, diverts resources and has an overall impact on their empowerment. Legal or other impediments to female employment raise labour costs and lower international competitiveness, preventing women from entering the market and earning decent wages. The region has very little legislative protection for all workers in general, let alone women. The existing legislation is largely inadequate and not properly enforced. The family law in most PICTs is based on outdated colonial legislation. The legislation, common law and legal practices are discriminatory against women and legitimate violence against women. Rigid concepts of women\u2019s roles within the family are the basis for how laws have been devised and interpreted. Divorce in most cases cannot be obtained without proving fault, including proof of persistent cruelty, and women\u2019s adultery is often held against them when they seek custody or contact with their children, maintenance and matrimonial property. In much of Melanesia, the payment of bride price by the husband\u2019s family to the wife\u2019s family is used to justify domestic violence, secure rights to custody over children and to some extent, property. In most PICTs, there is no legislation granting equal rights to property after divorce, and distribution is generally based on the principle of financial contribution, thus disentitling the vast majority of Pacific Island women and greatly increasing their own and dependant children\u2019s likelihood of living in poverty. A combination of strategies is needed to change outdated legislation, shape discriminatory interpretations of legislation and ensure commitment to the effective implementation of new laws. These include mobilising the women\u2019s movement; mass educating at all levels; informing; lobbying and campaigning with all stakeholders about the existing law and the need for law reform; altering the substance of discriminatory legislation through working with members of legislatures; training judicial officials, lawyers and court officials on the new law and in gender equality principles which affect the functioning of law; ensuring that sufficient financial, human and technical resources are allocated to effectively implement 6 Stege, Maetala, Naupa, & Simo, (ed) Huffer, 2008, viii. 9 new laws; and finally, closely monitoring the new law to assess whether it fulfills its promise.

The law, both de jure and de facto, written and unwritten, by act or omission (failure to act) and by interpretation, significantly affects the capacity of women to harness the full potential of the benefits of development. It influences and shapes every aspect of their human development. This can include: their human (physical and psychological) security; protection from violence; their entry into the marketplace, and thereafter, their upward mobility within it; their access to land and therefore their capacity to obtain collateral for funds; their ability to gain political power and access and influence the highest levels of community; regional and national leadership; and their ability to gain access to funds and property after separation or divorce (see Tables 1 & 2 for additional selected human development indicators for women in PICTS). In these ways the law is a critical determinant of women\u2019s economic empowerment and their human development. The link between the law and gender justice is therefore both causal and mutually reinforcing. An orchestration of multiple forces determines the overall status of women within the justice system. The law, whether conventional or customary, is neither neutral nor gender blind: nor is it legislated nor interpreted in a vacuum without reference to the political, economic, religious, social and cultural contexts. The law is the handmaiden of those who enjoy political and social control in any given society. In this role, the law functions in precisely the same way, whether at a macro level in the national legislatures, courts or justice agencies, or in the kustom, village, community or informal courts, fonos, maneabas and nakamals at the micro level of justice systems. The fono (Samoa), maneaba (Kiribati) and nakamal (Vanuatu) are formal and informal semi-traditional village councils, adjudicated by (mainly) male chiefs or elders, which deal primarily with village matters and disputes. Both conventional and traditional legal systems are important for gender justice, and positively shaping and influencing both systems is critical.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "229e459e-f140-425e-8326-2dc080b16f80": {"__data__": {"id_": "229e459e-f140-425e-8326-2dc080b16f80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "834e12d4f46154dde9899db978ca047eee4600799ec5c09249c4b77806f14757"}, "2": {"node_id": "12189d54-4da9-449b-bc85-8485f3628193", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bfb45c70a4931085fa9419aa0a40c34cb67ca2a91485dc00bdceb736813fcb1"}}, "hash": "b7e4d8ed088b657333a4f8d1af96abdd80ef426169987137cbe76e2de2a8c088", "text": "If gender discrimination is a key impediment to women\u2019s voices being heard, their lack of power, and their lack of participation in economic activities in the region, what role can the law play in removing that impediment and altering the outcome of women\u2019s participation?

Substantive equality is required to ensure both de jure and de facto equality. This type of equality recognises systemic and historic discrimination against women, the necessity for special temporary and affirmative action measures for women and is embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). Gender stereotypes, beginning in the home and replicated in technical and professional fields, continue to impede women\u2019s access to educational and training opportunities. Notwithstanding some progress, women remain, to a great extent, underrepresented in decision-making bodies and high-level positions, in and outside government. There is inadequate access by women to both general and reproductive health care in a number of Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). Violence against women is widespread throughout the region. Other grave emerging issues with the potential to significantly impact the lives of Pacific peoples, and women in particular, include HIV/AIDS, globalisation and 14 trade liberalisation, labour migration and poverty.7 Women are as much affected by their economic status as they are by their gender. Although poor men also experience poverty, women constitute greater numbers of the poor and additionally suffer further multiples layers of discrimination. Women\u2019s overall status in PICTs bears much similarity to many parts of Asia however sub regional differences persist (see Box 1 and Table 3 for listing of Pacific sub regional country listings).8 For the most part, the vast majority of PICTs have failed to meet their obligations under Article 2 of the CEDAW, the key equality provision, which requires State Parties to eliminate discrimination against women in its various forms. Substantial amendments to law, policy and practice, and the allocation of resources for implementation, are required for full, or even substantial compliance, in all countries. Although poverty is not experienced in quite the same way in the PICTs, as it is in Asia, women are historically and systemically discriminated against in every sector: in the legal, civil, political, economic, social and cultural spheres limiting their capacity for autonomy and control over their lives and those of their children. 7 SPC 2004, 46. 8 Note from author of paper: In 1998, I published my 700-page book documenting the treatment of Pacific Island women in the justice system, P I Jalal, Law for Pacific Women: a legal rights handbook, published by the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement, 1998.

SPC, 2008b Pocket Statistical Summary. 17 A key question addressed throughout this paper will be: what impact do the laws, written and unwritten, conventional and customary have on Pacific Island women, and through them, on the lives of their children and families? Ultimately, what impact does the combination of legislation, case law, customary law and legal practices and rules have on women\u2019s incomes, their health, their levels of education and their future prospects, on who they are and what they might become \u2013 on the choices they can exercise? In the final analysis, the larger question is: what does their legal status in formal and customary law mean for human development? What contribution then, can improved laws make to the lives of women, and therefore to human development?9 This paper attempts to examine these questions and issues in depth. However, the lack of availability of data has hampered this effort, and any numerical data in the region should be viewed with some caution due to the lack of human, technical and financial resources in statistical offices in most PICT governments. This is a desk review relying primarily on secondary information. There are gaps and weaknesses in the information. The last comprehensive research in the area of gender justice in the Pacific island countries was completed some 10 years ago.10 The CEDAW Legislative Indicators (CLI) research addresses only formal legislative equality and is limited to ten countries.11 Primary research is critical to fill the gap, cover all PICT countries and legislation, record un-codified customary law, carefully examine case law and how the legislation impacts women on the ground, and update outdated information. There is a dearth of research available on the rights of poor disadvantaged men and sexual minorities, and is not covered in this paper. This lacuna ought to be addressed.12 Poor men suffer similar disadvantages to women, especially poor women, but they still have more control and autonomy over their own lives. They also control the lives of the women in their families including inflicting violence on them. Box 1.

A feature they share in common is that all three groups have traditionally been organised along social, rather than economic lines. However, although largely patriarchal, all place varying degrees of emphasis on factors such as gender and patriarchal authority within society. Therefore, the degree of gender equality differs between the sub-regions as well as within countries and social groupings. In Polynesia and Micronesia, social status has been traditionally based on inherited chiefly status, whereas in Melanesian societies they were traditionally ranked along strict patriarchal gender lines. Thus, while some Polynesian societies have traditionally featured both women and men in high-ranking positions of authority, in Melanesian societies (PNG, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and parts of Fiji) men are almost always in a higher ranking position than women. Although there is much variation, and Pacific culture is rapidly changing, there is generally more overall gender inequality and gender injustice in Melanesian than in Polynesian and Micronesian societies.14 Table 3.

Hardship and hunger not only exist, but are increasing in the PICTs, although extreme poverty is generally not present. The information relating to poverty is far from complete and the quality is poor. Despite the deficit of information, available evidence unequivocally demonstrates an increasing incidence of poverty in some PICTs. Critical issues in the region include land tenure, subsistence activities and access to natural resources, as well as issues often grouped under the term \u2018poverty of opportunity\u2019 (referring to access to education and economic and other opportunities).15 Poverty and hardship studies undertaken by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conclude that hardship is much more widespread than generally thought, with at least 20 per cent of households in 12 of 13 PICs studied16 suffering from basic needs poverty. In the most disadvantaged countries, the proportion is estimated to exceed 33 per cent. Although hunger is less widespread, malnutrition is present, with the proportion of underweight children reaching 27 per cent.17 In urban and peri-urban areas, as well as in the more isolated rural areas and in the outer islands, poverty exists at a level that leads to difficulties in meeting basic needs in food, 14 UNICEF Pacific 2007, 9. 15 SPC 2004, 23. 16 The study focused on ADB developing member countries in the Pacific including: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. 17 Abbott and Pollard 2004, 23. 19 clothing and shelter, as well as severely limited access to education and health services. Largely due to their small size and remoteness, most PICTs have experienced difficulty in developing their economies.18 Approaches to defining discrimination, equality and equity The academic debate between the proponents of gender equality and gender equity is an interesting one and is most often noted in opposition to each other. Equality, it is argued, is sameness, uniformity, objectivity or impartiality. In the common law legal system, a conventional interpretation of equality implies \u2018treating likes alike\u2019 or non- discrimination on strict terms which do not recognise historical or systemic discrimination.19 The principal models of equality are discussed in Box 2. On the other hand equity is understood differently based on the context. It ranges from the \u201ccommercial world of business, real estate and finance to the world of laws and justice. In the commercial world equity is understood as ownership in any asset after all liabilities associated with that asset are paid off.

On the other hand the \"everything different\" approach says that women are quite different from men and should be given special treatment. Finally, the \"anti-subordination\" approach holds that women have been treated as inferior to men, and must have special treatment to become equal to men. Strict equality: Women are the same as men and should be treated the same. The argument is that there are no important and fixed differences between men and women; if men and women were given the same opportunities, they would eventually be on an equal footing. All legal and other discrimination should be removed and men and women should thereafter be given strictly identical gender-neutral treatment. This approach to providing solutions to women's problems is traditional in most law schools, so legislators, state officials, lawyers and judicial officials feel comfortable with it and tend to apply it within the law. However, some practical problems arise. Equal treatment has been defined by a male-dominated society. Thus women succeed only if they copy male models of success. The judiciary in some developed countries has been willing to apply the strict identical treatment to help men, but not to help women. 18 UNICEF Pacific 2007, 9. 19 Rajivan and Sarangi, 2009. 20 For example laws that are statutory being enacted by legislatures or those established through judicial precedents in court cases. 21 Rajivan and Sarangi, 2009. 20 There is no way of comparing what is strict identical treatment in situations that happen to women but not to men \u2014 for example, pregnancy or breast-feeding. The approach ignores the serious historical and contemporary economic and social disadvantages suffered by women. Biological differences: Women should be treated the same as men except where we must allow for biological differences. The argument is that women and men should basically be given identical treatment, but where differences cannot be avoided (for example the specific need of women for maternity leave), these differences must be taken into account. The main disadvantage of this approach is that it does nothing about social and economic disabilities or the things that happen mainly to women because they are women. It takes fixed biological differences into account, but approves basically of the way things are. Everything different: Women are different from men and should be given special treatment. This approach is based on the idea that women are socially, physically and psychologically different from men. Therefore all policies and laws must take account of these differences and give women different treatment. Some of the differences are positive and some negative; not all should disappear. The disadvantages have been brought about by political structures, so positive changes in policies and laws will result in real equality for women. The great advantage of this approach is that it takes into account both the real differences between men and women, and the need for women to receive resources necessary to remove their economic and social disabilities. Its major disadvantage is that it might encourage laws that treat women differently \"because they need protection.\" For example, women may be stopped from working in certain industries or at night or prevented from participating in certain sports \"for their own good.\u201d Thus discriminatory treatment might continue because men and women are different. Anti-subordination: the \"disadvantaged as a group\" approach. Inequality is not defined in terms of differences between men and women, but in terms of women's subordination to men. The argument is that women have been deliberately kept inferior to men by patriarchal political, social and economic structures. The \"special treatment\" approach to equality neither approves of, nor reinforces, differences arising from historical conditions of inequality. Its most significant aspect is that it allows a judge to ask: Will this decision create further inequality for this woman, or will it bring about an improvement in her life? However, because it has the most potential to redistribute wealth, resources and power, it may be seen as an attack on the foundations of society, and so it is the most difficult to apply. How do Pacific Island courts use these approaches? The courts have not adopted a consistent approach, but an ad hoc one, based on a mixture of strict formal legal equality and equity, the various models of equality and protectionism. When assessing what constitutes discrimination, courts generally use men as the standard; they do not question the ways in which laws or cultures or social traditions have produced and maintained discrimination against women, or the extent to which our institutions", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0fbdeab-0964-438b-be27-5cf444f17a78": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0fbdeab-0964-438b-be27-5cf444f17a78", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2556f173d9f07f641eba038e5faa29fc93ab15691eb816b1e29ff3126ca39ca"}}, "hash": "c2556f173d9f07f641eba038e5faa29fc93ab15691eb816b1e29ff3126ca39ca", "text": "are male-defined. Generally, therefore, they use approaches based on strict equality, biological differences or \"everything different.\" The Supreme Court of Canada has adopted a different way of assessing discrimination in Andrews v Law Society of Canada,22 and more recently in 22 (1989) Supreme Court of Canada Reports, 1 (1989) 143. 21 Fiji, in Balelala v The State.23 This identifies discrimination in terms of disadvantage, not in terms of similarities and differences. If a member of a disadvantaged group proves that a law, policy or practice maintains or worsens that disadvantage, then the law, policy or practice is discriminatory. The disadvantage test is very similar to the anti-subordination approach. It acknowledges that discrimination against women is socially and economically based, and is more in keeping with the object and purpose of the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW ). Source: Jalal, 1998. The proper approach is one which combines equality and equity principles, and the disadvantaged circumstances of women as a group, and is determined by the context which is being discussed. Discrimination and equality in the law Discrimination means treating people in different ways, based on their sex, race, religion, political opinions, creed, sexual preference and so on. Sex or gender discrimination generally focuses on whether a person is male or female. Discrimination takes many forms, both direct and indirect. Direct discrimination is based on an individual's behaviour or actions even where that behaviour was not intentional. It can directly and expressly be based on a person's sex or it can be a decision based on assumptions about an individual or group of individuals. In law, direct discrimination against a woman might mean that something happens to a woman because she is a woman and not because she is an individual person. The discrimination may be based on a particular characteristic applying generally to women, for example, being able to have children. Or it may be based on a particular characteristic that society may perceive women have, for example, being \"too emotional and not logical or objective.\" Direct legal discrimination may be obvious in the legislation or legal practice. For example, if the legislation states that men are permitted certain rights and women are not, direct discrimination is clear and unsubtle.24 Indirect discrimination is often based on policies, laws and practices that are part of the structures of society. Most legislation is written in gender-neutral form. It may seem not to favour men over women, but it may indirectly discriminate against women, because the courts and law agencies that apply, interpret or enforce the legislation do not consider the other disadvantages of women. If, for example, a police station has one car in working order, the police may not want to use the car to arrest a father who has not paid maintenance for his children. They may prefer to keep it handy in case \"something important comes up.\"25 Indirect discrimination occurs also because social and cultural attitudes cause officers of the courts, law enforcement agencies and associated agencies to interpret laws and procedures in ways that discriminate against women. This type of indirect discrimination may be called \"procedural and interpretative discrimination\". The law may also be indirectly discriminatory 23 Fiji Islands, Criminal Appeal No. AAU0003 OF 2004S, 2004. 24 Jalal 1998, 16. 25 Jalal 1998, 16 \u2013 17. 22 where it fails to address or correct discrimination. This may be called \"discrimination by omission.\"26 The approach preferred by women\u2019s groups in the Pacific region is generally that of substantive equality and the disadvantage approach adopted by CEDAW, which is not strictly based on either concept, but a combination of both. Gender justice is not formal legislative or legal equality between men and women which does not address historical and systemic disadvantage or the additional burdens of pregnancy, lactation, child care and so on. It is based on achieving substantive equality recognising the disadvantage that women face as a group due to historical discrimination. It recognises also that women are not all the same. They have multiple identities which also determine their status within society. Women are not only affected by their gender but by their race, ethnicity, social and economic status and other diversities. Gender justice recognises also the need for temporary special measures so that women as a group can catch up with women as a group. It should be noted also that gender discrimination can be caused by non-state actors, such a private corporations. The state is complicit in the discrimination if it either fails to address the discrimination, by refusing to address the problem or it", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "142057c1-2b8b-4b9a-8fbd-3bac0f6cbc3b": {"__data__": {"id_": "142057c1-2b8b-4b9a-8fbd-3bac0f6cbc3b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0283e349398fb9061ab8a8fc077115cfd0d4daff6dc4db9bd6335ec2d2c0dd7b"}}, "hash": "0283e349398fb9061ab8a8fc077115cfd0d4daff6dc4db9bd6335ec2d2c0dd7b", "text": "fails to put in place policies and laws to achieve substantive equality. The latter requires positive action as a matter of state obligation. Methods of addressing equality and non-discrimination in the law include examining whether the problem is one of substance, structure and context, in order to decide on the appropriate strategy. If the problem is one of the substance or content of the law then the strategy that ought to be adopted is a legislative strategy of changing the offending legislation. A litigation strategy or a test case to obtain a new precedent or interpretation of existing law may also affect the substance of the law. If the problem is one of structure, for example, a lack of access to courts or inadequate resources to properly enforce laws, then the problem might be addressed by providing access or better human and financial resources. If the problem is the attitudes of justice officials, then gender training may be required to make the law effective. In some cases a combination of all three strategies may be required. 26 Ibid. 23 Chapter 1: Overall legal status of women in the Pacific The law influences almost every aspect of human endeavor. It is informed by the low overall status of women in society and in turn, the law further influences and determines women\u2019s overall legal and other status. The link between the law and women\u2019s status is therefore both causal and mutually reinforcing. Although the law has in the past, been an instrument of exclusion and oppression it is increasingly being used, by women\u2019s movements and governments, as a tool for empowerment and liberation for women, acting as a catalyst for sweeping social change and advancement. The tensions between customary law and formal law The status of women in custom and customary law in the Pacific generally obstructs their access to education, employment and capacity to be heard in decision making, thus hindering their overall capacity to participate in economic activities. Even where formal laws provide some measure of gender equality, there are tensions between the two systems of law, which have a harmful impact on women\u2019s empowerment. Historically, even in those islands in which women previously enjoyed some degree of power under customary law, this is no longer accurate of most of the Pacific, and there has been significant change over time. The tensions between customary law and mainstream constitutional protections continue to be a source of conflict in all Pacific Island communities. The few cases that end up in court tacitly acknowledge the contradiction between the traditional Pacific Islands and the \u2018modern way of life\u2019. Many of those conflicts manifest themselves in tensions between the rights of women to equality versus what is perceived by many to be their traditional and \u2018proper' status. This ambivalence resonates throughout the Pacific and sometimes has political repercussions, reflecting the sensitivities that are involved and the caution about concepts such as human rights.27 Customary law is enforced through either social sanctions, village courts that are specifically empowered to enforce customary law through mainstream legislation, or the conventional law courts (see Box 3 for an example). More research is needed to ascertain the influence of customary law in settling mainstream disputes. Box 3. Chiefs pass \u2018new\u2019 custom law \u2013 a restrictive dress code for women, Vanuatu In 2005, the traditional Malvatumauri (House of Chiefs), supported by Church leaders, attempted to pass a new \u2018customary law\u2019, a dress code restricting the right of ni-Vanuatu women to wearing trousers, shorts, pants or jeans. Chief Morrison Dick Makau said, \u2018We\u2019ve made it so that girls wearing trousers when they walk along the road will be fined. And the punishment is that they must kill one pig.\u201928 The Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre challenged the code with a media campaign saying it was unconstitutional and against their rights to equality. The dress code was withdrawn, but is still enforced intermittently and informally.29 The experience of women within the customary system appears to be largely a harmful one in the contemporary context in most countries, particularly in the areas of land rights, family and criminal law. Where the two systems of law have been pitted against each other in the 27 Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2008.

In some cases, customary law is also codified and legislated, and mainstream courts are charged with the responsibility of enforcing such law. In most cases however, customary law is broadly recognised in the constitutions, and the courts at all levels are charged with the responsibility of having to determine its impact on other law. The Constitution of Palau at section 2 for instance recognises customary law in the following terms: Statutes and traditional law shall be equally authoritative. In case of conflict between a statute and a traditional law, the statute shall prevail only to the extent it is not in conflict with the underlying principles of the traditional law.30 The language suggests that both the constitution and custom have equal status even though the constitution is supposed to be the supreme law. In such cases courts have to look at both systems of law, including an ambiguous provision such as the one above, and decide which takes precedence in each case if they cannot be harmonised. Some PICTs have \u2018traditional\u2019 courts that exercise minor jurisdiction over village, family and personal matters. These courts are generally presided over by male chiefs or traditional elders who receive varying degrees of training. These courts often, unofficially and indirectly, adjudicate the rights of women and have a critical impact on how women experience the justice system. For instance, many civil and criminal matters are handled by village fono (councils) in Samoa, which vary considerably both in their decision making style and in the number of matai (chiefs) involved in the decisions. The Village Fono Act 1990 gives legal recognition to the decisions of the fono and provides for limited appeals to the Lands and Titles Court and to the Supreme Court. In 2000, the Supreme Court ruled that the Act may not be used to infringe upon villagers' freedom of religion, speech, assembly or association. More recent court decisions reinforced this principle. Like many other custom courts in Melanesia, the fono system in Samoa sits uncomfortably within the formal legal system because of its dual role in administering both fa\u2019a Samoa (customs) and village matters under the Act.31 In Melanesia, the customary law system, rather than the conventional law system, has the more significant impact on women, particularly rural women and women from outlying islands. The tension between women\u2019s rights to equality in those constitutions which embody these principles, and their subordinate status in custom, remains a source of much controversy in the region. In Papua New Guinea for example, women in rural areas are still commonly tried, convicted and imprisoned for \u2018sorcery\u2019 (witchcraft) by the village courts.32 There is a significant gap in the information about enforcement of customary law, and in most of the Pacific customary law is \u201cenforced\u201d either by social sanction or by the 30 Constitution of Palau, Section 2. 31 See cases in Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2005. 32 State v Aigal & Kauna, (1990) PNGLR 318. 25 conventional courts which administer mainstream legislation. In Papua New Guinea and Samoa, there are specifically constituted courts which enforce customary law. Their powers of enforcement range from fines (Papua New Guinea and Samoa) to imprisonment (Papua New Guinea). In Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, the Local and Island Courts respectively, are lower level Magistrate\u2019s courts which enforce both legislation and customary law. However, the overlap between conventional legislation and customary law are considerable and often confusing. Most courts, including those that administer customary law, are constituted under the Constitution and legislation. Virtually all PICT constitutions state that the constitution is supreme law and also that the constitution recognises customary law. The anomaly is therefore stated in the same document, giving custom law some degree of constitutional status and adding to the uncertainty. Most PICT Constitutions may not specifically state that where customary and constitutional law conflict there should be precedence given to formal constitutional law, even though it is an edict of general constitutional interpretation. There is little constitutional guidance to state what ought to be given precedence by the courts and it is left to the judge or magistrate to decide. Specific legislation is required to state that where there are conflicts in the law, formal constitutional equality ought to prevail. Those countries which do not modify all discriminatory customary laws against women have failed to meet their obligations under Article 5 of CEDAW. This requires State Parties to modify the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women which are based on the idea of the inferiority of either sex.

Religion and gender justice Religion also influences how women experience gender justice and has an impact on the deepening chasm between men and women. The vast majority of Pacific Islanders are Christian, of all denominations and orthodoxies, ranging from liberal to orthodox, with smaller numbers of Hindus and Muslims (South Asian) in Fiji, with its minority but large Indian-Fijian (37 per cent)34 population. In 1987 the population of Indian-Fijians constituted more than half of the population. Church leadership in all religions in the Pacific is mainly patriarchal. Although all PICTs are secular, except for Tonga, many regard themselves as \u2018Christian states\u2019 and these values are given some form of recognition in national constitutions. The Constitution of Vanuatu\u2019s preamble for example states that: \u201cWE the people of Vanuatu\u2026HEREBY proclaim the establishment of the united and free Republic of Vanuatu founded on traditional Melanesian values, faith in God, and Christian principles\u2026\u201d 33 Proposed new clause at s. 9 (4). The writer is part of the team that is working on the Draft Bill of Rights in the proposed Constitution. 34 Fiji Island Bureau of Statistics 2007. 26 The majority of the religious hierarchy has an orthodox patriarchal interpretation of religion. In 2003, the Methodist Church in Fiji attempted to stop the passing of the Family Law Act, which removed systemic discrimination against women in family law, on the basis that it was un- Christian and anti-indigenous Fijian. However, it was ultimately persuaded not to officially oppose the Act by the ruling government party, closely aligned to the Methodist Church at the time, and by various prominent individuals. The Vanuatu Family Protection Act 2008, passed in November 2008, and designed to protect women from domestic violence, was challenged by some Christian churches and traditional chiefs on the basis that it is against ni-Vanuatu kustom, and Christian and Melanesian values in the preamble of the Vanuatu Constitution.35 The Supreme Court ruled in late November 2008 that the new law was consistent with Vanuatu\u2019s Constitution. CEDAW and the domestic application of international human rights law The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) promotes the fundamental human rights, dignity and worth of women.36 It prohibits discrimination against women on the grounds of sex and gender and legitimates affirmative action for women. CEDAW is the second most ratified international human rights treaty after the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) in the Pacific. The most significant added value for gender justice, of ratifying and reporting under the CEDAW treaty body mechanism, is that it provides an additional layer of accountability, beyond the borders of the Pacific islands, to a global body of experts. Appearing before the CEDAW Committee every four years, and reporting to it, compels countries to conduct a stock take, and to attempt to improve women\u2019s gender justice before the next appearance. It is therefore critical that all PICTs ratify CEDAW and report on it regularly. CEDAW is also linked to regional action plans as the improved economic and political participation of women meets Strategic Objective 8 of The Pacific Plan37 and MDG 3, that of improved gender equality. The Pacific Plan, a Pacific regional development plan agreed to by all PICTs that are members of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, aims to, step-by-step, envision a region that is \u2018respected for the quality of its governance, the sustainable management of its resources, the full observance of democratic values, and for its defence and promotion of human rights\u2019. Traditional Pacific aid partners38 have strong and explicit gender policies and look toward the recipient state\u2019s commitment in furthering women\u2019s equality. Ratification and implementation of CEDAW is one such indicator. Technical assistance to promote and support the state\u2019s commitment to gender equality is more likely to be increased and enhanced if CEDAW is ratified.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "377fb013-45f2-4ef7-92b5-c29ca46e399b": {"__data__": {"id_": "377fb013-45f2-4ef7-92b5-c29ca46e399b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e93dfd4f840b6b436a2a491e17ab75130f384004751be2c55c28e853dc64efdb"}, "2": {"node_id": "c82e3c22-e178-4e53-9b8d-31352e11d07f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1d7a1d9d46616769522a422bd4212892346fe10b31f8062980ad875c4f70961"}}, "hash": "e827f0549169e9a258750ae1026ceea1761aee0a81225d36dd57e04825e19b74", "text": "Although there has been some sensitivity in PICTs when CEDAW compliance has been assessed, unlike other parts of the world, women\u2019s NGOs have worked closely with government counterparts in compiling the CEDAW State Reports.

Although formal legislative compliance is an absolutely necessary first step, it is also necessary to develop a set of indicators to measure de facto reality, that is, to adequately and accurately reflect the situation on the ground. The real picture of CEDAW compliance can only be measured by the collection of case law, numerical data/statistics and other forms of empirical evidence to assess compliance with CEDAW.43 There is a significant gap in research and data in this area. For example, Article 10 secures the equal right to education for girls and women. Compulsory education is required to realise this right. There may be domestic legislation to legally secure this, in a few countries. If so there would be formal legislative compliance with CEDAW. However, the actual numbers of girls who are registered at both primary and secondary schools, and who complete their education, compared to boys, is needed to assess real, de facto, compliance.

Additionally, some Palauan women in government delegations argue that their women enjoy higher status than men in their matrilineal society, and ratification might mean a \u201cleveling down of their status\u201d.45 Tonga is reluctant to ratify, arguing that its land laws cannot be amended to give women equal rights, as land is already a scarce resource. Low ratification and compliance with human rights conventions and CEDAW The Pacific region has by far the lowest ratification rates worldwide of the core international human rights treaties.46 The majority of countries that have ratified various international human rights treaties have struggled to report on them in compliance with the legal obligations defined in the treaty. Most have limited human and financial resources to implement human rights treaties. Governments generally perceive reporting requirements to be the most immediate practical constraint to ratification.47 Their priorities are generally limited to issues that are perceived as pressing and of utmost importance to individual countries and to the region, such as sustainable development, fisheries, global warming, 45 In conversations with the author at the SPC Workshop for CEDAW Non-ratified countries, 5-7 November 2008, Nukualofa, Tonga. 46 Includes the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (CRMW). 47 Jalal 2006, 11-13. 31 climate change, international crime, security and anti-terrorism.48 Sometimes, it is also supposed that ratification and implementation may take away resources which are already in short supply.49 Ratification of international instruments also requires ensuring that customary practices, for example Melanesian kustom and fa\u2019a Samoa, do not infringe on or conflict with domestic legislation and human rights practice. Although customary values, beliefs and practices greatly vary within each Pacific sub-region, even at country level, and evolve with time, they are considered as a limitation to treaty ratification. Convincing arguments are needed to demonstrate that treaty ratification can provide new and powerful opportunities to link and address both processes in order to bring them closer to each other.50 Applicability of international human rights law to domestic law There is a distinction between countries that follow the American common law system and those that inherited the English common law system.51 This distinction determines how they apply international conventions domestically. In the American common law countries of Palau and Federated States of Micronesia, once ratification occurs the provisions of the convention have immediate applicability in the courts and on domestic law in general, at least in theory. British common law countries, as well as Vanuatu, must enact domestic legislation before a convention comes into effect as part of the domestic law of the country, so ratification must be followed by domestication in the local legislature. However, only Vanuatu has a specific constitutional provision requiring parliamentary approval to complete the ratification process.52 The Marshall Islands follows the English style of requiring further domestic legislation before a treaty comes into effect.53 However some courts have resorted to human rights conventions for guidance and interpretation without requiring domestication.54 Some constitutions have specific mandatory provisions that allow for the use of conventions in the courts, apparently without the need for ratification.55 These provisions are extremely important for gender justice if they are known about and used. It is critical that judges, lawyers and human rights activists are trained to use such provisions. Organisations such as the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) have enjoyed marked success in popularisng such provisions in judicial and legal training thereby increasing the number of cases which apply such progressive provisions.56 However, more training is needed and those Constitutions which do not have such provisions need to be amended to include them. For example, Article 43 (2) of the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of Fiji states: 48 Huffer, E., 2003, 7. 49 Jalal 2006. 50 Ibid. 51 Paterson, Tavala and Jowitt 2008, 3. 52 Section 26, Constitution of Vanuatu. 53 Article 5, Section 1(4) of the RMI Constitution reads \u2018No treaty or other international agreement which is finally accepted by or on behalf of the Republic on or after the effective date of this Constitution shall, of itself, have the force of law in the Republic\u2019. 54 For a full analysis of Pacific Island courts applying human rights conventions see Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2005.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9091929-c07f-4eeb-8018-ac817b5d777c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9091929-c07f-4eeb-8018-ac817b5d777c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e60af878f3f8a5de0026b08cbe1c7f3efdbf7d977ee896733ddef38e629e5ec2"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e8747ed-f289-4c0d-a625-0541aa56f1a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c56935bd1202fb0059c80ccb7a8a4dc31a22a50dccf636337c800023714b465f"}}, "hash": "e55e13fb1717723060bc74c758a0e3f0c603b634063d2dc49df83473b6e8a671", "text": "55 Section 43(2) Constitution of Fiji; Section 15(5)(c) Constitution of Tuvalu and Section 17 Tuvalu Interpretation and General Provisions Act (Cap 1A); and Section 39(3) Constitution of Papua New Guinea). 56 These cases are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "64b3bf60-e83a-4c80-96bf-f12580b62f1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "64b3bf60-e83a-4c80-96bf-f12580b62f1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da28bd6c4307468572c7b488d67487bd65ae572ca71cd5363636a52e28129597"}}, "hash": "da28bd6c4307468572c7b488d67487bd65ae572ca71cd5363636a52e28129597", "text": "documented in two volumes of the Pacific Digest of Human Rights Law published by RRRT. 32 In interpreting the provisions of this Chapter, the courts must promote the values that underlie a democratic society based on freedom and equality and must, if relevant, have regard to public international law applicable to the protection of the rights set out in this Chapter. In Fiji, the courts have not been reticent about using such a provision to apply conventions to domestic law in innovative and creative ways. Examples from Fiji include the case of State v Bechu,57 in which the Magistrate chastised the accused during rape sentencing stating: Women are your equal and therefore must not be discriminated against on the basis of gender. Men should be aware of \u2026 CEDAW which our country ratified ... Under the convention the state shall ensure that all forms of discrimination against women must be eliminated at all costs. The courts shall be the watchdog of this obligation. The old school of thought that women were inferior to men or part of their personal property, that can be discarded or treated unfairly at will, is now obsolete and should no longer be accepted by our society. These attitudes are not commonplace in the magistracy and ought not to be taken as indicative of magisterial attitudes in general. However they are reflective of a growing trend of willingness to apply women\u2019s international human rights standards if domestic legal provisions allow it, and if lawyers make the appropriate submissions. In contrast, in Kiribati, a prosecution lawyer attempted to use the non-ratified CEDAW (at that time) and the Constitution of Kiribati in Republic of Kiribati v Timiti & Robuti58 in what was then the first known attempt in a Pacific Island court to apply CEDAW to domestic law. She used similar arguments to that used in Attorney General v Dow59 and Balelala v State but failed to convince the court that CEDAW ought to be used to prohibit the gender discriminatory corroboration rule in rape cases. This rule requires a rape complainant\u2019s evidence to be corroborated independently by witnesses and medical evidence; is based on an assumption that women lie about sexual matters; and that they need to show physical evidence of proof of resistance. In 2003, RRRT state and civil society partners successfully lobbied for the passing of the Evidence Amendment Act 2003 which included a provision making the corroboration warning unlawful (for more information on the work of RRRT, please see Box 5). The legislative strategy was necessary given the unwillingness of the court to use CEDAW to outlaw discrimination using the courts and new precedents. In 2004, after the ratification of CEDAW and CRC, in a similar attempt to challenge the corroboration practice in a child sexual abuse case, the Chief Justice held that as the offence had occurred before the passing of the Evidence Amendment Act 2003, the corroboration practice still applied to the case before it. The court refused to apply the ratified CRC to allow a degree of flexibility, stating that the CRC did not form part of the law of Kiribati unless it was given the force of legislation.60 Box 5.

It works with Members of Parliament, judges, magistrates, senior decision makers in government, institutions, civil society groups and NGOs. Over the past decade, RRRT and its partners have made significant headway in the promotion and enforcement of human rights by encouraging compliance with local and international human rights standards. Training of the judiciary has led to growing support for human rights. and a significant increase in the application of human rights conventions in courts in a number of PICs.

Judgments in Fiji, Vanuatu, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu and Kiribati indicate that lawyers, activists and judges use human rights language more often and as guidance in decision making or as the basis of arguments. Major goals for the next five years include the passing of violence against women legislation and exploring the possibility of a regional human rights mechanism under The Pacific Plan. RRRT continues to provide gender equality and human rights support to PIC governments and NGOs using tried and tested methods of partnerships between both. Tuvalu and Papua New Guinea have similar provisions to Fiji allowing courts to apply international human rights standards, while Solomon Islands law states that if a law is capable of two interpretations the one consistent with international law is to be preferred. However they are rarely used or are resisted on grounds that they must be further domesticated in legislation.61 Despite these empowering provisions, Tuvalu still generally follows the doctrine of non-enforceability of international law.62 None of these provisions are sufficient by themselves to ensure the application of CEDAW or other human rights conventions to domestic situations, and legislation and implementation measures are required in all PICTs to ensure the realisation of rights provided under the international treaty system. However, a starting point is that all PICT constitutions need to be amended to state that human rights conventions must be applied domestically where relevant. Training of judicial officials is also imperative. Reporting and implementation status of CEDAW for gender justice63 Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu and the Cooks Islands have appeared before the CEDAW Committee once each to report on CEDAW.64 Fiji\u2019s second report was due in 2006 but is not yet drafted. Papua New Guinea and Kiribati are at various stages of the process of preparing their first reports. Solomon Islands has set up a taskforce that will oversee the preparation for its initial report. Tuvalu submitted its first report in 2008. New Zealand reports on behalf of Tokelau and Niue, whilst the Cook Islands reported separately in 2007.65 61 Section 15(5) Constitution of Tuvalu; Section 39 (3) Constitution of PNG; Section 12, Interpretation and General Provisions Act [Cap 85]. 62 This section is extracted directly from Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2005. See the Digest for comprehensive summaries of Pacific Island cases that have applied international human rights conventions in domestic courts. 63 This section largely extracted from Jalal 2007. 64 Fiji in (2002); Samoa (2005); Vanuatu (2007); Cook Islands (2007). 65 Since March 2009, when this paper was completed, Fiji has appeared before the Committee for the second time; and PNG for the first time at the July 2010 CEDAW Session. 34 The most significant changes in most countries since ratification have been the setting up of ministries, departments or desks dedicated to women\u2019s affairs and implementing CEDAW. Some countries have passed important policies, initiated projects to increase women\u2019s economic empowerment and increased budgets for relevant departments, but very few have passed legislation to implement CEDAW in order to secure the rights-based system under it. Thus, implementation is largely dependent on political will and commitment, and not on enforceable rights. From a gender justice perspective, Fiji has made the most significant progress in implementing CEDAW since 2004, particularly in the area of family law.66 In November 2005 the Family Law Act 2003 was implemented with the opening of the new Family Law divisions of the courts towards the end of 2005. The new law, removes systemic discrimination against women and children consistent with CEDAW Articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 14, 15 and 16. By passing this law, Fiji immediately improved its legislative compliance with CEDAW up to 44 per cent, making it the leading country in the region of the nine assessed on legislative compliance. In 2003, with the introduction of the Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children) Act 2002, Papua New Guineas, and Marshall Islands in 2005 with amendments to its existing Criminal Code,67 changed their sexual assault regimes, attempting to remove legal discrimination against women in sexual offence law and practice.68 Kiribati has amended its criminal law to outlaw the gender discriminatory corroboration warning in the law of rape.69 In November 2008, Vanuatu passed the Family Protection Act, making it the only PICT to have stand-alone legislation combating domestic violence. The bill is guided by CEDAW and CRC.70 General implementation of CEDAW principles is weak in many countries and even where there is political commitment on the part of governments there are insufficient resources either available or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35db4160-0fe4-473c-985f-170eee8b1977": {"__data__": {"id_": "35db4160-0fe4-473c-985f-170eee8b1977", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "25600f9cfacbea612f7d544b883331a84a052417e2e68453766c48c9be900402"}}, "hash": "25600f9cfacbea612f7d544b883331a84a052417e2e68453766c48c9be900402", "text": "allocated to implement the standards in CEDAW.

Universal Periodic Review and the Human Rights Council The opportunities provided by the Universal Periodic Review process, a mandatory reporting mechanism for all UN members before the UN Human Rights Council, is a further possibility for women to hold their countries accountable for gender injustice. When Tonga appeared before the Human Rights Council in March 2008, the majority of questions asked it related to women\u2019s rights in Tonga and democratic reform. Tonga responded by promising to hasten democracy, but balked at committing to improving women\u2019s land rights given the constitutional entrenchments. However, Tonga said it was committed to improving human 66 UNIFEM Pacific 2007. 67 Criminal Code, Cap.1, 1966. 68 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, 266. 69 Evidence Act 2003, Kiribati. 70 The author and RRRT worked closely with the Solomon Islands government to effect the passing of the legislation. 35 rights in other areas for all groups including free speech, a highly contentious issue in Tonga.71 In contrast, Tuvalu committed to changing its constitution to prohibit sex and gender discrimination in December 2008 when it appeared before the Council.72 71 IHRS 2008, 8. 72 The author of this paper was an Expert Advisor to the Tuvalu Government delegation, and a member of the delegation during its Interactive Dialogue with the Universal Periodic Review process, Human Rights Council, December 2008, Geneva. 36 Chapter 2: Overall constitutional and politico-legal status of women This section examines how the general constitutional and politico-legal status of women determines their voices being heard in the public world of decision making and power on an equal footing with men; and how it affects their capacity to influence policies and the allocation of resources that affect them. All independent PICTs have written constitutions mostly granted them after independence from the colonial powers during the 1960s and 1970s. A number of them have made significant amendments to their constitutions in the wake of civil strife, as in Fiji\u2019s post-coup d\u2019\u00e9tat constitution in 1997. Most countries have a bill of rights (BOR) in their constitutions, which contain basic civil and political rights. Only a very few, like Fiji and Marshall Islands, have some economic, social and cultural rights, for instance the right to education contained in the BOR.73 The constitution and the bill of rights contained within it is the supreme law of the country in most PICTs. This means that in theory, any law, policy or practice inconsistent with the constitution is unlawful. However, the principle of equality for women is not firmly embedded in the constitutions of most PICTs, even though some outlaw various forms of discrimination, including sex discrimination. If women\u2019s rights to equality and non- discrimination are not protected specifically in the constitution itself, it reduces their ability to challenge inequality on constitutional grounds. If it is present, it allows courts to interpret constitutional provisions in an equitable way. However, no Pacific Island constitution grants women full equality in substantive terms. Protection against sex or gender discrimination is not the same thing as full equality, as discussed in the previous chapter. It is therefore critical that women\u2019s rights to equality, as well as non-discrimination, are secured in the constitution itself and not only in other pieces of legislation. Anti-discrimination protection and fundamental rights and freedoms No PICT has stand-alone, comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation. Some constitutions have a general equality provision with specific definitions of discrimination in which citizens are entitled to certain basic rights, regardless of their religion, race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, religion or creed and so on.74 Apart from Fiji, no constitution specifically protects discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or disability. Only Samoa, and possibly the states of Chuuk and Pohnpei in Federated States of Micronesia, protect against marital status discrimination. However, in both Micronesian states, the position is not clear, as \u2018social status\u2019, rather than marital status. is mentioned.75 It is theoretically possible to argue that marital status falls within the broader ambit of social status. Health status discrimination is not explicitly protected as a prohibited ground in any country, except 73 Section 39, Constitution of Fiji; Article II, section 15 Constitution of the Marshall Islands 1979. 74 For example : Section 64 Cook Islands Constitution Act 1975; Section 38 Constitution of Fiji 1997; Section 15 Constitution of the Solomon Islands 1978 ; Section 15 Constitution of Kiribati 1979 ; section 3 Constitution of Nauru", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d057bd5c-6d76-4549-b0d1-16c1ff308560": {"__data__": {"id_": "d057bd5c-6d76-4549-b0d1-16c1ff308560", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95aab3af3ba91263c795c80fcd2fb6d85328fc26b43ef020b602391d30723481"}, "3": {"node_id": "5274f86a-f8d3-4770-b6ca-178d88edb72c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ea93bc28c3a746a56563eecdac94594bc613b687075387455fe200225e62fbd"}}, "hash": "244c87752520f36028130957855b5fe1eb5fcd8260515ccbdbc8571480e675ad", "text": "1968; section 4 Constitution of Tonga 1875; section 27 Constitution of Tuvalu 1978; section 5 Constitution of Vanuatu 1980; section 15 Constitution of Samoa 1960; section 55 Constitution of PNG 1975. 75 Article III, section 2 Constitution of Chuuk; Article 4, section 3 Constitution of Pohnpei. 37 possibly in the state of Chuuk,76 although all Micronesian states provide for access to health care in their constitutions. Although all grounds of discrimination are important to the overall situation of women, some grounds, missing in many countries, are of particular importance to gender justice and human development. If the grounds of sex or gender discrimination, sexual orientation, marital and health status, and disability are absent in the constitution, women and minorities are more likely to suffer further layers of discrimination. Fiji\u2019s non-discrimination provision guards against both direct and indirect forms of discrimination at section 38. Fiji\u2019s Constitution is the most advanced in the PICTs providing that: (1) Every person has the right to equality before the law. (2) A person must not be unfairly discriminated against, directly or indirectly, on the ground of his or her: (a) actual or supposed personal characteristics or circumstances, including race, ethnic origin, colour, place of origin, gender, sexual orientation, birth, primary language, economic status, age or disability; The Fiji Human Rights Commission is empowered to investigate allegations of unfair discrimination and violations of the rights and freedoms set out in the Bill of Rights of the 1997 Constitution and to investigate other alleged violations of human rights.77 The Kingdom of Tonga, has an 1875 Constitution that grants equality in most interesting terms: 4. There shall be but one law in Tonga for chiefs and commoners for non-Tongans and Tongans. No laws shall be enacted for one class and not for another class but the law shall be the same for all the people of this land. However, legal discrimination against women is evident throughout the legislation in Tonga. For example, women are discriminated against in terms of land and cannot constitutionally inherit land unless the male line dies out.78 In Vanuatu, the Penal Code79 also makes unlawful discrimination a criminal offence, making it an unusual provision in PICTs. No person shall discriminate against another person with respect to his right to the supply of any goods or services, or to gain or to continue in any employment, or to be admitted to any public place, by reason of the sex, ethnic or racial origin or the religion of any such person. No one has ever been prosecuted in Vanuatu for a breach of this section, despite the high level of sex discrimination against ni-Vanuatu (Ni-Vanuatu is the term used to describe people of Vanuatu ethnicity) women in both conventional and kustom law systems. 76 Article X, section 6 Constitution of Chuuk. 77 Section 38, Constitution of Fiji, 1997. 78 Article 107, Constitution of Tonga. Discussed fully in Chapter 4. 79 Section 150 Cap.135. 38 HIV legislation New legislation of very few countries makes HIV discrimination unlawful (see Table 7). Both Papua New Guinea80 and Pohnpei State81 in Federated States of Micronesia have passed relatively new legislation to this effect. The legislation in Papua New Guinea states that: \u2018[I]t is unlawful to discriminate against a person to the detriment of that person on the grounds that the person is infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.\u201982 Legal anti-discriminations provisions are inadequate in all countries to protect women from discrimination on the grounds of gender and all need strengthening to varying degrees. Only in Fiji are indirect forms of discrimination explicitly recognised and protected, yet the vast forms of discrimination experienced by women fall into this category. All constitutions need to be amended to specifically prohibit both direct and indirect discrimination. Table 7.

The legislation appears to be silent about females or does not appear to contemplate the possibility. Only in Fiji is it possible to challenge discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation as it is one of a very small number of constitutions globally that explicitly protects sexual orientation, and is the only one in the Pacific (see Table 7). In the landmark case of Nadan v McCosckar, two men were prosecuted for engaging in a homosexual act in a hotel room, under the Penal Code, which only allows for prosecution of men, not women.83 The Fijian High Court ruled that the Bill of Rights, supported by international human rights standards, granted protection of the right to privacy for sexual minorities. The court made it clear that its decision was based on the privacy provisions of the constitution, rather than non- discrimination provisions.84 Although the right to non-discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation was raised in submissions, it was not canvassed in the judgment. The issue of whether the relevant provisions are discriminatory awaits further argument. There is some basis for suggesting that the apparent neutral character of the legislation is contradicted by the actual practice of applying them only in sodomy cases involving males. The Director of Public Prosecutions could not point to any example of prosecution against a heterosexual person for sodomy and the court accepted the argument raised by the Fiji Human Rights Commission that the law was selectively enforced against male homosexuals.85 83 Sections 175 and 177 Penal Code Cap 17, acts of carnal knowledge against the order of nature and acts of gross indecency. 84 Criminal Appeal Case Nos: HAA 85 & 86 of 2005, 6 August 2005 (Fiji) analysed in Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2005, 30. 85 Ibid at 86. 40 When debate and controversy erupted in Palau over the issue of same sex marriage, its legislature hastily moved to ensure that the law was clear and unequivocal by passing the following amendment: Section 13. \u2026All marriages contracted within the Republic of Palau shall be between a man and a woman. 86 All PICTs, except for those Melanesian countries that recognise polygamy, define a lawful marriage as the union of one man to one woman to the exclusion of all others.

Box 6. Women\u2019s freedom of movement and the Chiefs of Tanna Island - Public Prosecutor v Kota The wife (M) and husband (K) had separated in bitter circumstances. Local chiefs, accompanied by some police officers, tried to reconcile the parties, forcing W to return to Tanna Island from Port Vila saying that it was their customary duty to reconcile the parties. M asked the Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre (VWC) for assistance. K and the group of chiefs who had forced M\u2019s return to Tanna, were prosecuted by the state. The court had to consider whether the chiefs of Tanna had the power to force M to return to Tanna under custom law and whether they were bound by the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of Vanuatu (CV) in the same way as the state. The court found K and the chiefs guilty of various offences, but noted a conflict between the constitution and custom. Parliament needed to consider whether any amendments had to be made to the CV or other legislation to clarify the role of the chiefs. If this role was clarified by legislation, the fundamental rights of women in Vanuatu had to be protected. Furthermore, the chiefs had to realise that any powers they wished to exercise in custom were subject to the CV, and also subject to legislation. Article 5 of the CV mandated non-discrimination and made it very clear that women were to be treated the same as men. Whilst custom may have been that women could be treated as property, and could be directed to do things by men, be those men husbands or chiefs, they could not be discriminated against under the CV. The court also observed that the Vanuatu Police had no authority to act as they did in the given case, to bully and force W to attend a meeting. Note: All cases in this paper are real cases based on the author\u2019s interpretation. In other PICTs, the result of the strict application of the vertical rule in terms of human development is that women cannot legally challenge sex or gender discrimination against private corporations. This is highly problematic given the growing impact of large multinational and domestic corporations on the lives of women, particularly in countries where they are the largest employers of female labour. The Constitution of Fiji, together with the Fiji Human Rights Commission Act 1999, would appear to allow for the horizontal enforceability of rights, however this interpretation is yet to be properly tested. In the tax exemption zones in Fiji, which hire extremely large numbers of women in garment or other manufacturing factories, it is not clear whether exploitative labour conditions are able to be challenged on constitutional or human rights grounds. This legal impediment needs to be addressed legislatively through amendments, with clear and unambiguous language.

Courts are expensive and available mainly to women who have the financial means to afford lawyers or who have access to well-resourced legal aid offices. There are very few avenues for reporting rights violations in most PICTs and very rarely are human rights violations reported at all. Both issues have a bearing on each other. Apart from Fiji, which has a Human Rights Commission, the only avenues to obtain remedies in most countries are the mainstream courts, which require access to courts, lawyers and funds (see Box 7). Thus the structures and mechanisms for promoting and protecting women\u2019s rights are extremely limited. Existing mechanisms like ombuds offices have limited and poor enforcement powers and are inadequately resourced and funded. Most ombuds\u2019 powers are also restricted to investigating a limited range of administrative malfeasance. It is critical that all PICTs have national human rights commissions and/or a regional human rights commission for the protection of rights (see Box 8). Box 7. Fiji Human Rights Commission94 Only Fiji has a national human rights commission established by the 1997 Constitution. The Fiji Human Rights Commission is set up under 1999 legislation of the same name. It has 3 Commissioners. Only one, the Chair, who is also the Ombuds, is full- time. The Commission is responsible for playing a leading role in the protection and promotion of human rights and in helping build and strengthen a human rights culture. Specifically it is mandated to educate the public about human rights, to make recommendations to the government about matters affecting human rights and to perform such other functions as are conferred on it by a law made in Parliament. The legislation enables the Commission to investigate allegations of human rights violations and unfair discrimination in employment. The bulk of its work appears to be in the area of employment. It has also enjoyed some success in challenging discrimination in the area of sexual orientation in Nadan v McCosckar,95 ; and age discrimination in Martin v Suva City Council.96 Box 8. A regional human rights mechanism Most Pacific Island countries will have difficulty in setting up national commissions which comply with international standards such as The Paris Principles on National Human Rights Institutions which require independence and autonomy from the State. There is ongoing work to consider the possibility of setting up a regional human rights mechanism to serve the needs of all PICTs, especially those smaller countries that lack technical expertise and resources. The Pacific Plan encourages the concept of regionalism: that is, countries working together for their joint and individual benefit provided that a regional approach adds value to national efforts.97 A regional human rights mechanism or national human rights mechanisms for the protection of rights outside the court system are critical. 94 In January 2007 the Director of the Commission, Dr S Shameem, issued a report defending the actions of the Military in its 5 December 2006 takeover of Government and removal of the democratically elected Government. Since that time the Parliament of Fiji remains suspended by the military and Fiji is ruled by a military Government. The Commission has become an institution of controversy and is no longer a member of various international bodies of national human rights institutions. 95 Criminal Appeal Case Nos: HAA 85 & 86 of 2005, 6 August 2005 (Fiji) analysed in Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2005, 30. 96 Civil Action No 0073 of 2004, High Court of Fiji 97 PIFS 2005, 4. 43 Exceptions to anti-discrimination law and their effects on women The general limitation on equal rights is that of what is \u2018reasonable and justifiable in a free and democratic society,\u2019 such as in section 39 of the Constitution of PNG. If a restriction on a fundamental right is reasonable and justifiable, in a free and democratic society it will be accepted. This general limitation is either explicitly stated in some constitutions as in Papua New Guinea,98 or read in by the courts as a matter of common law in others. However, almost all constitutions also provide for specific exceptions to the principle of non- discrimination on the grounds of custom, titles for chiefs and aristocracy or land rights for indigenous peoples; and in some cases citizenship rights are specifically excluded from equality provisions.

Sex and gender discrimination Notably missing from the prohibited grounds in some constitutional definitions of discrimination is sex and/or gender discrimination. In Nauru, Kiribati, Tonga, Tuvalu and the state of Kosrae in the Federates States of Micronesia99, it appears to be lawful to discriminate against women on the basis of their gender. For example, in both Tuvalu and Kiribati100 , it is not an oversight that their constitutions define discrimination but do not forbid sex discrimination (see Box 9). It is an omission deliberately made since the definition does forbid discrimination on the grounds of race or religion. The result of this omission is that it has been virtually impossible to challenge gender discrimination in the courts of these countries. Box 9. Challenging legal discrimination without constitutional protection: The Kiribati K-Wan Tumai Timeon and Teretia Tokam are two young women lawyers who graduated from the University of the South Pacific\u2019s School of Law and have done the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team\u2019s (RRRT) human rights course. The course is designed to promote the use of human rights in the Pacific Islands. With other women lawyers and activists they formed a network of women called the Kiribati Women\u2019s Activists Network (K-WAN) in 2008, which focuses on women\u2019s human rights. They have a feminist platform, although unstated. They are in the process of challenging discriminatory legislation. They have no office and staff but have registered as a member of the Kiribati Associations of Non-Government Organisations (KANGO) to secure support and cooperation of the umbrella NGO and other sister associations; and to seek recognition for their platform. They currently \u2018Advocate, Train and build public Awareness (ATA)\u2019 on the issues of women\u2019s human rights. As part of their ATA plan they have two strategies: litigation (using private lawyers who are willing to take on pro bono cases for the time being) and legislative reform. During 2008 they attempted to challenge two discriminatory laws, one which excludes widows from the definition of \u2018beneficiary\u2019 in certain legislation making them ineligible to receive their husband\u2019s pensions (legislative strategy); and second, land codes that discriminate against widows who are not provided specifically for in their husbands\u2019 wills (litigation strategy) but are facing legal structural obstacles. The biggest legal challenge they face is that Kiribati\u2019s Bill of Rights 98 Section 39, PNG Constitution. 99 In relation to Kosrae see UNIFEM Pacific 2006, 52. There would appear to be a conflict with the Federal Constitution of FSM which does make sex discrimination unlawful. 100 Section 27; section 15. 44 in the Constitution does not include sex/gender discrimination as a prohibited ground of discrimination, thus allowing discrimination against women. If the definition included sex or gender they could challenge a number of discriminatory laws and practices on the grounds that they are unconstitutional. K-WAN needs to get the constitution amended to make sex or gender discrimination unlawful.101 Custom as an exception to non-discrimination Custom is accepted as an exception to the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex by the national courts in some jurisdictions. However, courts are ambivalent about this, showing the importance of judicial attitudes in mitigating the discriminatory impact of custom law on women (see Box 10 for an example). To discriminate against women on the grounds of custom or tradition is in violation of Article 5 of CEDAW. Box 10. Custom law and widows\u2019 pensions: customary law is allowed to discriminate against women In Tanavalu v Tanavalu & Solomon Islands National Provident Fund,102 the court took the view that the constitution permitted the use of custom law even if it discriminated against women. In this case, pension funds were paid to the father of the deceased, rather than to the deceased\u2019s widow. The father then distributed the funds at his discretion, giving nothing to the widow. The court ruled that this was in accordance with the relevant custom, where inheritance was by patrilineal succession. The widow could not object on the ground that the custom was discriminatory, as the constitution specifically exempted custom law from the general prohibition on discriminatory laws.103 The result of this decision has a long-term impact on the economic empowerment of widows, whose only source of income following the death of a \u2018breadwinner\u2019 may be their pension funds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7ae12677-699f-4e42-916f-87dd012b0ff2": {"__data__": {"id_": "7ae12677-699f-4e42-916f-87dd012b0ff2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5855e8b63abfd3eaafb8a1d34106601b92f04febb7e1d4b60d10c2a33543d23"}, "2": {"node_id": "bdff02b9-f7c4-4f34-872b-7a54ef6895da", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbea539cdeb3916790602b230f7d5feefc5df44300aa78e1407f0a373e53dc37"}}, "hash": "f312f759e48d49184e9fc4e546142bc6dc66e683ad31bbaffe81397b51d60ae6", "text": "In contrast, a custom not allowing widows to have relationships was held to be ultra vires (beyond the power of) the equality provisions of the Constitution of Papua New Guinea in Raramu v Yowe Village.104 Raramu was a widow, but was nevertheless convicted and sentenced by a village court to a term of six months\u2019 imprisonment.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb896771-e63f-4d02-b9be-fb6f0a02c5c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb896771-e63f-4d02-b9be-fb6f0a02c5c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "54266625bce25b9688d328462e5d17c380d34e2aae2d34f7b0bd806eafca899a"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ea9e822-96b1-42f1-80ec-834616ee4a9b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27be54a35db840a449fda2af3a4f949bd7e1e2b7604128e7106d67a50d6d0c59"}}, "hash": "a9f578b467ca15940c140bd26143d46b34024019f54f66700da24e7e8281e6ff", "text": "The customary practice in many areas of PNG does not allow widows to have subsequent relationships.

Citizenship and immigration laws prohibit citizenship and automatic residency for female citizen\u2019s foreign husbands, forcing women to leave their countries. This principle is reflected in the constitutions of Kiribati and Nauru and in ordinary legislation in Vanuatu.105 Similar legislation in Kiribati discriminates against their children, if born abroad and fathered by foreign husbands, by denying their children citizenship.106 The same restrictions do not apply to male citizens of those countries. Although this law might be challenged on the grounds of unconstitutionality in Vanuatu, this has not occurred. Table 9.

Such provisions also deny women the right to freedom of movement and the right to family life by either forcing women to leave their countries or to live apart from their spouses and children. Domicile laws however do not discriminate between men and women, at least in the formal legislation. There is no legislation requiring a woman to adopt or follow the domicile of her husband. 105 Sections 22 & 26, Constitution of Kiribati; section 74, Constitution of Nauru; section 10, Citizenship Act Cap.112 (Vanuatu). 106 Jalal 1998, 38. 46 Temporary special measures or affirmative action for women Strict formal legal equality principles, forbidding discrimination, are a possible barrier to passing laws or initiating policies that treat women differently or give them an advantage. Temporary special measures, affirmative action, or positive discrimination in favour of women are critical to accelerate de facto equality for women and to ensure that that systemic and historical disadvantage is adequately addressed. This principle and the necessity for legislation to specifically cater to this need are recognised, in Articles 3 and 4 of CEDAW. The constitutions of Fiji, Palau, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Tuvalu and Vanuatu appear to allow for different or special treatment to assist disadvantaged groups.107 Vanuatu, Samoa and Papua New Guinea108 specifically allow for special measures for women as a disadvantaged group.

One such field that requires affirmative intervention is parliamentary seats. I believe in quotas because that is the only way the imbalance of males and females will be readily addressed. This is required because there is no level playing field. The odds are stacked against women from the beginning and it is nonsense to suggest that candidates are selected on merit. His Excellency Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi112 One of the primary reasons women are vulnerable to discrimination is that they do not have an equal voice in decision making at home, in the villages, nakamals, fonos, maneabas113 or in society, and at the national level, even in matters directly related to them (see Box 11 for an example). They are generally powerless intellectually, materially and politically.114 Consequently, even if women are allowed to take autonomous action, their efforts are not productive because they are denied access to resources. Whether it is a question of exercising reproductive rights, actively participating in the work force, or accessing social (health care and education) and material resources (land, houses and credit), women\u2019s independence and self-sufficiency play an important role in gender equality.115 Political leadership, by women, for women, can be an effective catalyst toward addressing discrimination against women. Article 7 of CEDAW obliges member states to eliminate both direct and indirect discrimination in women\u2019s public and political lives. 112 Madraiwiwi 2006 (Former Judge of the High Court, former Human Rights Commissioner and high Chief of Fiji) 113 Informal and sometimes formal decision-making bodies at the village or community justice level. 114 UNESCAP 2007, 119. 115 Ibid. 48 Box 11.

Ueda, Minister Of Health, Republic of Palau, 1999 The Pacific region has the lowest percentage of women in politics at the national level and shows no improvement, despite two decades of global activism, because contemporary culture in the Pacific still favours men politically, socially, economically and administratively (see Table 11). Of the eight countries in the world that have no female members of in their national Parliaments, four are in the Pacific. They are the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu. Palau elected its first female candidates in the November 2008 elections, taking the region\u2019s representation from 2.5 per cent to 3.7 per cent. Vanuatu has just two women in parliament, while Tonga, Marshall Islands and Papua New Guinea each have one. Affirmative action and temporary special measures for women are critical to alter the situation.119 The Tongan female member is appointed by the King, in a non-elected seat, and is the Attorney General.

The head of the administration, as \u2018Prime Minister\u2019, is the commander of the military. The low numbers of female politicians in the Pacific might be compared to global numbers for an appropriate analogy. According to a study by UNIFEM, women have entered politics in greater numbers than ever in the past decade, accounting for 18.4 per cent of parliament members worldwide. This means that the proportion of women has increased by seven percentage points since 1995. The increase was attributed to women realising that they needed to attain power rather than just lobby for change. If the rate of change holds constant, it will take until 2045 for women to reach parity in the developing world, which UNIFEM has defined as holding 40 per cent to 60 per cent of elected parliamentary seats. Quotas that reserve seats for women have proved influential in increasing female numbers.

Another recent global survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Union found that women parliamentarians tend to emphasise social issues, such as childcare, equal pay, parental leave and pensions; physical concerns, including reproductive rights, physical safety and gender-based violence; and development, which includes human development, the alleviation of poverty and delivery of services.121 This partly demonstrates the principle that political leadership, by women, for women, can be an effective catalyst towards addressing discrimination against women. The closing of the \u2018democratic deficit,\u2019122 meaning equal representation for men and women, is critical Another recent global survey by the Inter-Parliamentary Union 123 found that women and men have different interests and perspectives. Although women parliamentarians were not a homogenous group, they share certain general interests and concerns. More than 90 per cent 120 UNIFEM 2008, 17-33. 121 IPU 2008(a), 2. 122 Senator Cecilia L\u00f3pez Monta\u00f1o, the speaker of the opposition Liberal Party in Colombia. Quoted in UNIFEM 2008. 123 IPU 2008 (a). 50 of all respondents agreed that women bring different views, talents and perspectives to politics. Women parliamentarians tend to emphasize social issues, such as childcare, equal pay, parental leave and pensions; physical concerns, including reproductive rights, physical safety and gender-based violence; and development, which includes human development, the alleviation of poverty and delivery of services (see Box 12 for an example).124 The same study noted however that men were also needed to create and build partnerships to effect gender sensitive legislation. However half the women respondents made it apparent that they considered men not to be able to satisfactorily represent the interests of women in politics. Access to political power is critical for women leaders to make a difference in other women\u2019s lives, but women make up only 3.7 per cent of PICT legislatures.125 Not only is this important from a simple rights-based representative democracy point of view, but also because of equity, productivity and empowerment. Young girls also need positive role models and to believe that \u2018women can do anything\u2019. The psychosocial element of women\u2019s sense of empowerment, in being able to bring about change, is as important as formal legal equality. Women need to know that they are able, given the right milieu, to access and influence every sphere of human endeavor and development. Parliament is one such avenue, although by no means the only one. From a practical and productivity perspective, women are generally better able to voice women\u2019s concerns, and there is some local evidence to suggest that a greater number of women in the legislature is a catalyst for progressive legislation to be passed.126 Box 12. Fiji\u2019s female legislators and the historic Family Law Act In the case of Fiji\u2019s progressive Family Law Act 2003, which removed historic and systemic discrimination against women, the overwhelming majority of female representatives in Parliament not only championed and supported the proposed law during parliamentary debate on the bill, but lobbied within their parties for the new law to be passed across party lines. They worked closely with the Fiji Law Reform Commission, the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team and the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement to bring about the passing of the bill into law. Fiji\u2019s political parties mobilise largely along racial lines, in a country deeply divided by race. In the informal coalition, women members of parliament mobilised along gender lines, and significantly, also across racial lines, in racially polarised Fiji. This coalition between women politicians was not only unprecedented in Fiji\u2019s legislative history, but created a positive side effect by building alliances on the basis of gender, rather than on party lines and racial identity. Only one female MP, refused to mobilise around the new law or to co-operate with women campaigning for it.127 The IPU study also shows that numbers do matter; the more women there are in the legislature, the easier it is to address women\u2019s issues and to change the gender dynamics in the chamber. Eighty-six percent of MPs questioned agreed that larger numbers of women in parliaments would increase women\u2019s influence on political policies and priorities.128 124 Ibid. 125 See Table 11. 126 UNIFEM 2008(a), 26-27. 127 Personal knowledge, the writer was Family Law Commissioner campaigning and lobbying for the new law during 2003. 128 IPU 2008 (a), 2. 51 No legislation in any PICT, formally or directly prohibits women from participating in politics or decision making in both formal and informal political systems.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f8bdd3ca-9ea3-4a11-b704-fcc21894afa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f8bdd3ca-9ea3-4a11-b704-fcc21894afa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a05e09939f3e657f910206ef7d66b1a2f0712a39efeccb964a91f15d458b61e"}, "2": {"node_id": "339f4658-7f1f-424d-aaec-767ccaa3fcfa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c2557d122bc325f32f529361e7882d8b264e90265b0edbe7fb09e6b608ea027"}}, "hash": "2029c8e406d4fa9d710a7e38f012fc8bb1191efe8ba7b92fe5f7449ea576e524", "text": "Nor do laws prohibit women from voting.

This is particularly so in PICTs where membership of the chiefly or \u2018big man\u2019 echelon is an entry point for candidacy in the national legislatures. Box 13. Reasons why there are low numbers of women in Pacific Island legislatures 1. Most Pacific Islanders vote along the basis of identity politics; but most standing for election are men in any case. This means that Pacific Islanders generally vote for members of their racial or ethnic groups, clans, wantok, aiga, mataqali and cultural groups irrespective of gender, corruption, ability or merit. 2. Entry to many legislatures is directly or indirectly accessed or controlled by membership of traditional chiefly hierarchies, for example, noble, chiefly or other titled systems. This means that chiefly, titled or noble females have a better entry possibility than \u2018commoners\u2019 and others. In addition senior chiefs must have precedence over younger chiefs, regardless of the merits of either.129 3. Most Pacific countries are patriarchal, even those countries that have matrilineal land systems. 4. Traditional cultural and patriarchal prejudices against women. 5. Membership of political parties and eligibility for candidacy is controlled by powerful political families. 6. Financial constraints.130 7. Electoral systems in the Pacific are not conducive to women winning seats.131 8. Pacific Island political parties are gender-biased and do not field female candidates even when they have affirmative action policies on paper.132 9. There are very few, if any, Pacific women\u2019s NGOs mobilising and dedicated to increasing the numbers of women in legislatures, as there are for other women\u2019s issues like gender justice in the law, violence against women etc, especially across party lines. 10. There are no electoral quotas for women in any Pacific Island country legislation or constitution 11. The strict gendered division of labour; and disproportionate food security and domestic responsibilities prevent women from participating in decision making. 12. Both custom and formal laws do not give women equal rights in any Pacific country, so women are discriminated against in other sectors as well. 13. It is culturally unacceptable for all Pacific Islanders, but especially women, to \u2018promote\u2019 themselves, and openly compete with others. It is regarded as being too individualistic and against communal values.

Author\u2019s personal knowledge. 52 The chiefly system and equal political access Gender and custom also have a big role to play in determining access to political participation. In Minister for Provincial Government v Guadalcanal Provincial Assembly133 the court has to consider the possibility that women were discriminated against in the mainstream political system, because they were not able to be chiefs in the traditional kustom system, as only chiefs were able to be members of the Provincial Assembly (see Box 14 for an example). As a result of the constitution recognising the validity of kustom, the Court of Appeal held that discrimination against women was not unconstitutional, as the constitution itself legitimated that gender discrimination. Box 14. Women cannot be chiefs and leaders: Minister For Provincial Government v Guadalcanal Provincial Assembly, Solomon Islands When the Constitution of Solomon Islands) came into effect, there were no provisions for a system of provincial government. In the High Court, the Guadalcanal Provincial Assembly attacked the validity of certain provisions of the Provincial Government Act 1996, which it argued were invalid as being inconsistent with the constitution. A point of discussion during the case was to \u2018consider the role of traditional chiefs in the provinces\u2019. One of the issues was, how does the Provincial Government Act in providing for traditional representation of custom chiefs in governance, affect the rights of women? The court said that the traditional position was that only a male could be a \u2018traditional chief\u2019. The constitution itself therefore recognised this imbalance or discrimination and it would remain until the role of \u2018traditional chief\u2019 under the constitution was re-evaluated. Initially the role for women in government at the provincial level would be limited to standing for election to Area Assemblies. It was clear that women were disadvantaged, given that traditional chiefs were male, however this was not unlawful as the constitution itself allowed it. There is very little discussion in the Solomon Islands courts of the discriminatory effect of laws and practices on women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "402ed4e4-7b1a-49f4-b5f5-c321eefb8a25": {"__data__": {"id_": "402ed4e4-7b1a-49f4-b5f5-c321eefb8a25", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12ab26d9e8e71da88b6c07ce653a7043d9e5e6cb1d2cc03ba73d02631acd1c2b"}}, "hash": "12ab26d9e8e71da88b6c07ce653a7043d9e5e6cb1d2cc03ba73d02631acd1c2b", "text": "In this case, two members of the court recognised the effect the particular constitutional provisions had by reinforcing the traditional power structures.

Although there was no reference to international instruments that Solomon Islands had ratified, these conventions would have been modified by the constitutional provisions in place, because the Solomon Islands constitution is the supreme law and any conflicting law would be overridden. Source: author Women are indirectly discriminated against in a similar manner to the Solomon Islands, in Tonga, Samoa, Fiji and Marshall Islands by indirectly limiting equal eligibility for political representation through the customary title, chiefly or noble system. In these PICTs, membership of such privileged groups is an entry point for eligibility for political representation. 133 (1997) SBCA 1, 11 July 1997. 53 In the Marshall Islands there appears to be equal eligibility for political representation, but the reality is that the Constitution does not recognise the female equivalent of chiefs,134 notwithstanding that women chiefs play a powerful role in society, and that Marshall Islands is primarily a matrilineal society in which women have much say in the control and management of land. The Constitution of the Marshall Islands 1979,135 creates the Council of Iroij. Election to the Council of Iroij is restricted to those recognised by customary law or traditional practice as having rights and obligations equivalent to those of the iroijlaplap (paramount chiefs). They have the power to veto certain legislation affecting customary law or any traditional practice or land tenure or any related matter passed by the Nitjiela (parliament). Election to the council is limited to those of chiefly status. Although there is no formal barrier to women becoming chiefs, they rarely do. Only one woman has served as a member of parliament in the Marshall Islands.136 Similar limitations exist in Fiji where 14 of the 32 seats in the upper house, the Senate, are appointed by the president on the advice of the Bose Levu Vakaturaga (BLV), the Great Council of Chiefs.137 The president and vice-president are also appointed by the BLV. The numbers mean the chiefs can vote as a bloc to prevent any law from being passed, but they also have legislative power to veto any bill regarding land and customary rights of indigenous Fijians.138 Membership to the BLV is limited to traditional chiefs. Women generally become chiefs in only very limited circumstances, but the system is rapidly evolving in some parts of Fiji. The Bill of Rights in the Samoan Constitution specifically prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex,139 and allows for affirmative action. There is no formal legal direct discrimination against women participating in political life but there is a prohibition on non- matai (chiefs) standing as candidates for election to the legislature. The traditional matai system still plays a dominant role both at the village level and in national politics. However, inheriting a matai title is not only through inheritance. It is notable that succession to matai titles can be by consensus of the extended family rather than any fixed mode of inheritance. Since about 97 per cent of matai are male, it is not surprising that only six per cent of the members of parliament are female. The Kingdom of Tonga\u2019s legislature has three classes of persons, the King and his family, 33 noble families and the remaining group of commoners or ordinary citizens. The 32-member (normally 32 but can be greater) Legislative Assembly is composed of nine directly elected members (commoners), nine indirectly elected members (nobles), and 14 members appointed by the King.140 Effectively, 70 per cent of the Tongan Parliament is controlled by the nobility.141 Thus equal eligibility for political representation is affected by the overall lack of democracy in Tonga, and membership of social classes. 134 Stege, Maetala, Naupa and Simo, (ed) Huffer, 2008, 26. 135 Article III. 136 UNIFEM Pacific 2006, 249. 137 Section 64, Constitution of Fiji. 138 Section 185, Constitution of Fiji. 139 Section 15, Constitution of Samoa. 140 IPU 2008(b). 141 Author\u2019s interpretation. 54 Electoral systems, electoral quotas or reserved seats in parliament for women Electoral systems Research by the IPU142 and UNIFEM143 suggests that there is a direct link between electoral systems and women\u2019s representation; and the proportional representation (PR) system gets more women into legislatures.

For example, in East Asia and the Pacific, an average of 19.1 per cent of seats were held by women in countries with proportional representation systems, compared to 6.3 per cent in non-PR systems. 145 Electoral quotas The same research reveals that quotas provide a fast track method for women to win seats in parliament. They indicate a policy shift from formal equality in the political sphere, to substantive equality on the ground, as required by CEDAW. Reserved seats are a critical policy tool for increasing women\u2019s participation in legislatures. An estimated 40 per cent of countries around the world have put into practice some form of quotas for women, with an average representation of women at 22 per cent. In comparison, in those countries without quotas, the average drops to 14 per cent. The research concludes that the positive effect of quotas in electing women to parliament is now well documented.146 Other types of temporary affirmative action measures, such as quotas at the sub-national level or political party quotas for electoral candidates (which can be voluntary) raise the number of countries with quotas to 95. The majority of countries with women in 30 per cent or more of national legislature seats applied quotas in some form.147 The Pacific Island French territories are subject to the French Law on Parity 2000, which requires all political parties to include 50 per cent women on their lists of candidates in a list system. These islands have a proportional representation system, a result of their links to France. As a result of the combination of the electoral system and Parity Law, New Caledonia, has 44.4 per cent and French Polynesia 42.1 per cent women in their legislatures.148 No other PICT has similar laws. It is also suggested that constitutional or electoral law quotas are the strongest means of increasing women\u2019s engagement in political competition regardless of political system. Other types of temporary affirmative action measures, such as quotas at the sub-national level or political party quotas for electoral candidates (which can be voluntary) raise the number of countries with quotas to 95.

Building the women\u2019s movement The building of the women\u2019s movement in the Pacific and improving women\u2019s capacity to mobilise for political rights is critical for women\u2019s political participation. Unlike other issues that women\u2019s organisations mobilise around, including violence against women, gender/legal justice, economic empowerment, anti-globalisation and so on, there are hardly any, if at all, Pacific organisations dedicated to increasing the numbers of women in the legislature. The few local organisations that attempted to mobilise around this issue, in a project supported by UNIFEM in the last decade, failed to be sustainable. They emerged briefly, leading up to elections, and then faded away after elections. Another factor leading to the lack of sustainability of such organisations is that they failed to mobilise across party lines, or in Fiji\u2019s case across racial lines, around the goal of gender parity, despite the good intentions of their funder and supporters.150 One of UNIFEM Pacific\u2019s key priorities for the next four years is increasing \u2018gender justice in democratic governance in stable and fragile states\u2019. 150 Author\u2019s personal knowledge. 56 Chapter 3: Criminal law and women\u2019s rights This chapter examines the impact of criminal law on women, looking particularly at how they fare as survivors of gender-based violence or as defendants when they are accused of gender- based crimes. How does this contribute to their health, autonomy, capacity to earn incomes and to participate in the marketplace? There is no formalised discrimination in the criminal legislation, and the language is generally gender-neutral. For example there are equal rules of evidence and the evidence of women is theoretically given equal weight, unlike some countries in Asia.

It is an important indicator of women\u2019s lack of self-sufficiency and autonomy, and cuts across all social and economic classes. Gender-based violence can have a lasting psychological impact on its survivors, lowering women\u2019s self-esteem, productivity and wages and destroying marriages. It leads to significant costs for the family, particularly children. Violence before and during pregnancy may also lead to serious health costs: miscarriage, premature delivery and low birth weight. It also carries serious financial costs \u2013 counseling fees, medical expenses and legal bills. 152 For the most part, the laws (legislation, court decisions and legal practices) are ineffective in securing justice for women. Compared to many other regions of the world, there has been a paucity of legislative reform in this region.153 With the exceptions of Vanuatu, in domestic violence legislation, and Papua New Guinea and Marshall Islands in sexual assault legislation, reforms have been piecemeal changes to existing criminal and civil legislation, or common law precedents and legal practices, and have provided little but band-aid therapy. In 2003 and 2005 respectively, Papua New Guinea and Marshall Islands changed their sexual assault regimes, attempting to remove legal discrimination against women in sexual offence law and practice.154 In Fiji, the innovative Family Law Act 2003 was implemented in the beginning of 2006 and provides a civil protection order to women. In November 2008, Vanuatu passed the Family Protection Act 2008, making it the first country in the region to have targeted domestic violence legislation. Systematic research is required to assess the effectiveness of new legislation. 151 WHO 2005. 152 UNESCAP 2007, 119. 153 Jalal 2008. 154 Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children) Act 2002 (PNG); and Marshall Islands in 2005 amended its Criminal Code 1966, Cap 1. 57 States that are parties to CEDAW are required by Article 2(f) to take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to modify or abolish existing laws, regulations, customs and practices that constitute discrimination against women. So far, most countries in the region are in de jure and de facto breach of Article 2(f). As well, states that have signed the Convention on the Rights of the Child have an obligation to protect children against abuse of all kinds. The incidence and economic costs of violence against women The Reserve Bank of Fiji has estimated that violence against women costs the Fijian economy close to FJD300 million a year, 7 per cent of the GDP. Of this, 97 million is in direct costs borne by victims and their families; and government spends a further 200 million annually on welfare, law enforcement and health care for complainants. If opportunity costs are added, the figure could be higher and possibly closer to FJD500 million. It was concluded that the estimated direct cost of violence against women of about FJD300 million was equivalent to the Fiji government's budget deficit; the government total borrowing; the total government capital expenditure; the total income taxes expected to be collected; the total Value Added Tax estimated to be collected; and was greater than the total budget allocated to all the law and order agencies of government in 2003.155 In the Pacific, Papua New Guinea has the highest rate of gender violence, with 67 per cent of women reporting physical assault by a male partner.156 In national research conducted in Papua New Guinea it was found that 67 per cent of women in rural areas, and 56 per cent of women in the urban low income category as well as women in the \u2018urban elite category\u2019 were hit by their husbands. There was also a high record of men hit in Papua New Guinea, but further investigation found that these men were hit mainly in self-defence.157 In Papua New Guinea rapes, knife attacks on wives, beating and sexual abuse of girls, and torture and murder of female \u2018sorcerers\u2019 or \u2018witches\u2019 are among the many forms of violence against women. The threat of rape, sexual assault and other violence is so great that women and girls cannot freely move around their communities, go to school, the markets or places of employment.158 The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea publicly noted in October 2008, that he was ashamed about the high level of violence against women in his country, including cases of highly-educated leaders beating their wives.

Sexual assault and rape Sexual assault is widespread and vastly under-reported throughout the Pacific.165 In some countries, women are made powerless and live in constant fear of being attacked again. The situation is worse in the Pacific Islands with its small populations and even smaller communities. The perpetrator of the crime and the survivor may live in the same village. The survivor's situation becomes unbearable when the perpetrator goes free because of the prejudices and inefficiencies of the legal system. In some communities some young girls do not even know that they have the right to refuse unwanted sexual advances or that rape is a criminal offence. In a Vanuatu case, an accused said it was his \u2018constitutional right to have sex with whomever I want\u2019, whether the woman agreed or not.166 Sexual assault is also complicated by cultural attitudes that are really excuses for perpetrators. In Samoa, there is a practice of moetotolo, or moetolo in Tuvalu, where the man creeps into the fale (traditional house) and rapes a woman, while others in the fale are sleeping, or pretending to sleep. Anecdotal evidence suggests that this practice is quite common but there is a lacunae in the research. If the perpetrator is taken to court, the court may believe that if a woman was really being raped, someone would have taken action to stop it. However, if the watchers believe that women's role is to please men, they will not interfere. The court often shares this cultural attitude and so takes it for granted that silence means consent.

If the woman was assaulted she would often be too afraid to tell her relatives.167 Common features of sexual assault law Most sexual assault laws in the PICs are based on myths about women\u2019s sexuality, no different to the laws that prevailed in most common law countries, prior to more progressive reforms being introduced. The PICTs inherited the worst elements of rape law from the British, most of which remain.

Definition of sexual assault Marshall Islands,168 Papua New Guinea and the Federated States of Micronesia have broadened the definition of assault to include rape by other objects, 169 but the narrow definition remains in most other countries. Proof of resistance Common to most PICTs, except Marshall Islands, is the practice of the requirement of physical \u2018proof of resistance\u2019 which requires complainants to prove that they fought their assailants to escape, in order to be believed that they were raped.170 The discriminatory corroboration warning Many countries still allow the highly discriminatory corroboration common law practice in relation to the evidence of the complainant, in which the court gave a warning to itself or a jury that it was dangerous to convict on the independent uncorroborated evidence of the victim. The corroboration warning, based on a belief that women lie about rape habitually, is the worst of all practices. The rule is still practiced in Vanuatu, Solomon Island, Federated States of Micronesia (all states) and other PICTs.

The rape case that outlawed the gender discriminatory corroboration rule - Balelala v State, Fiji174 In 2002, the accused (B) held prisoner and raped the complainant (C), three times at a popular nature reserve. B was found guilty and corroboration of the evidence was a point of discussion. The case went all the way to Fiji\u2019s highest court on appeal, the Supreme Court. B argued it was dangerous to convict him on C's words alone as per the corroboration warning and his conviction should be overturned. In a groundbreaking precedent, the court removed the corroboration practice (\u2018the rule\u2019) after examining the legal basis of it, the rationale behind the rule, the laws of Fiji and other jurisdictions on the rule. The legislation did not require corroboration in a rape offence or other sexual offences. However, the rule was enforced in Fiji as a long-standing practice under common law, in which the court gave a warning to itself that it was dangerous to convict on the uncorroborated evidence of the victim. The court examined the origin of the rule and said it was representative of the practice in force in England at the time the evidence legislation was enacted in 1944. The rule was based on an outmoded and fundamentally flawed rationale, which was unfairly demeaning of women. The rule had been applied to victims of either gender. In other jurisdictions it had been confined to women and girls because, under criminal law, rape and other sexual offences were crimes committed against women. The effect had been to place victims of sexual offences in a special category of suspect witnesses. This resulted in convictions which were solely based on the complainant\u2019s evidence being regarded as unsafe and unsatisfactory. Moreover, it afforded the accused protection which did not exist in other cases of serious criminality. In addition, it almost certainly had the effect in many instances of deterring the rape victims from reporting offences committed against them or from cooperating in the prosecution of offenders. The rule discriminated against women who were victims of sexual violence, which was a violation of Article 38(1) of the Constitution of Fiji.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc487390-0ea7-48f7-8a82-b4ea665b2793": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc487390-0ea7-48f7-8a82-b4ea665b2793", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b43860df36c2f95764a5995dc5f7eb605138333399500dc07e94ac0a18aaa008"}, "2": {"node_id": "379c8476-03b1-47f5-bd00-699be66e33a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8d4ec328864c3716c640e3f2387e69bda29efa9fe3a0f1f4d0149b5a50993a3"}}, "hash": "0ce0e3ef8488341e8fcb1dcab022b29c26b7c3015872007be728b16d43054296", "text": "Under Article 43(2) also, the court was required to interpret the provisions of the Bill of Rights \u2018to promote the values that underlie a democratic society based on freedom and equality and must, if relevant, have regard to public international law applicable to the rights set out in the Bill of Rights\u2019.

Note: All cases in this paper are real cases. The past sexual history of the complainant The admission of the rape survivor's past sexual history can affect her credibility to the extent that she is not believed, the prosecution does not succeed and the rapist is acquitted (see Table 13). If he is sentenced, her past sexual history may reduce the severity of the sentence. Papua New Guinea and the Cook Islands have changed the credibility practice, not allowing the admission of the survivor\u2019s past sexual history through legislation, whilst the Federated States of Micronesia has only partially addressed this, still leaving it to the discretion of the 174 Fiji Islands, Criminal Appeal No. AAU0003 OF 2004S, 2004. 61 court.175 Tonga and Fiji have also partially addressed the practice through landmark court cases and new precedents.

There are customary reconciliation practices of ceremonies of forgiveness in most PICTs, (for example I-bulubulu in Fiji or ifoga in Samoa) generally involving the rapist\u2019s and survivor\u2019s families, which the police and courts use to justify the reduction of sentencing of those convicted, or in some cases not allowing charges to be filed at all (see Box 17). It is of interest to note that these \u2018forgiveness ceremonies\u2019 have dramatically changed over time and now often take place without the complainant\u2019s actual permission or participation.

He said that he when he saw the nine-year-old girl walking along the road, he got aroused and raped her. He paid the chiefs customary settlement of three pigs and six mats in total valued at 74,000 vatu. Neither the rape survivor nor her parents shared in the compensation. In court, the charge was reduced from rape to unlawful sexual intercourse. The High Court said that the offence was very serious because of the girl's tender age. However, because the accused was a first offender and had made a customary settlement, his sentence was reduced to only three years. No PICT has specifically legislated against the forgiveness ceremonies having any influence on criminal proceedings. However Vanuatu\u2019s Family Protection Act 2008 states that the payment of bride price has no bearing on guilt or punishment in domestic violence cases. 10.

A few countries allow for prosecutions in limited circumstances. In Santo, Vanuatu in 2008, a marital rape was prosecuted by the police but was dismissed by the court.179 The Cook Islands, Niue, Tonga and Samoa have legislation stating that marital rape is only illegal if the parties are separated, divorced or where \u2018consent has been withdrawn through the process of law\u2019.180 Papua New Guinea has removed the marital immunity in their legislation that had previously prevented husbands from being prosecuted for a charge of rape.181 The states of Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia also permit the prosecution of husbands, at least on paper.182 Changes in the law of sexual assault In 2003, with the introduction of the Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children) Act 2002 Papua New Guinea dramatically changed its sexual assault regime. A number of new offences were introduced extending penetration to all orifices by the penis or any other object. The offences were graded according to the gravity of the harm and integrate the many ways in which women are sexually violated. Harsher sentences were introduced, the marital immunity that had previously prevented husbands from being prosecuted for a charge of rape was removed, and the common law practice of requiring corroboration as evidence was abolished.183 The new legislation did remove the admission of the prior sexual history of a victim but did not legislate against the requirement for proof of resistance by the 179 Informant, Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre legal adviser, Agathe Malsungai at RRRT Regional Lawyers Training Workshop, Port Vila, Vanuatu, 13-17 October 2008. 180 Section 141 (3) Crimes Act 1969 (Cook Is); section 118 (2) Criminal Offences Act, Cap 18 (Tonga); and section 46 Crimes Act (Samoa). 181 Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children) Act 2002 (PNG). 182 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, 83, 145. 183 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, 266. 63 victim. It also allows victims of sexual and domestic violence to claim compensation from the perpetrator.184 The claiming of compensation for wrongdoing is a common feature of Papua New Guinea custom law in general, and is meant to reduce the possibility of \u2018payback\u2019 crimes, potentially against the women of the perpetrator\u2019s wantok or clan. Payback is a common practice in PNG and may involve the men of the survivor/complainant\u2019s clan, sexually assaulting women of the perpetrator\u2019s clan. Most attempts to change sexual assault laws through comprehensive dedicated legislation have so far failed. For example, rape law draft legislation185 in Fiji has been thwarted for a variety of reasons, including disputes about the substance of the draft law (see Box 18); that it favoured the victim over rights of due process awarded the accused, and the perception that the draft was too \u2018western\u2019, feminist, radical and clashed with so-called Pacific culture. Added to this, Fiji has experienced three military coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in 20 odd years, thus interrupting the rule of law and reducing the space for legal reform. Other PICTs show similar recalcitrance in passing new laws. Box 18. Fiji\u2019s Proposed Rape Law Reforms The draft legislation proposed by the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement and largely accepted by the Fiji Law Reform Commission at the time has some of the following necessary features: 1. The grading of sexual assault to reflect degrees of harm including penetration of all orifices; 2. Expanding the definition of assault to include all forms of sexual assault including assault with an object; 3. Removing the corroboration warning; 4. The removal of the need to demonstrate proof of resistance on the part of the complainant to demonstrate lack of consent; 5. The forbidding of questions of the complainant\u2019s past sexual history with men other than the accused by the accused person\u2019s lawyer; 6. Allowing the prosecution of marital rape, that is, removing marital immunity and making spouses competent and compellable witnesses; 7.

Despite efforts by women\u2019s NGOs (see Box 20), there has been minimal legislative change in the area of domestic violence. Box 20. The Pacific Women\u2019s Network Against Violence and the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre (FWCC), by Shamima Ali Violence against women is prevalent in the Pacific and for most of the past ten years, there has been a deathly silence surrounding the issue except for that raised by the women NGOs working towards its elimination. Violence against women remains largely under-reported in all countries of the Pacific and is often sanctioned by various cultural practices. The Pacific Women\u2019s Network Against Violence against Women, initiated by the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre, was formed in 1992 and includes 23 organisations from 10 different countries of the region. The network\u2019s members are at the forefront of work against violence against women and are constantly battling traditional attitudes, bureaucratic processes and the low status accorded to women in the Pacific. Grudgingly the issue of violence against women has been acknowledged by various authorities and is slowly being recognised as a serious issue of concern. Source: Provided by Shamima Ali of the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre Gender-based violence is not recognised generally as a specific crime. Police and court officials are unsympathetic to women whose husbands beat them, and usually do not encourage legal solutions. The complainant is responsible for laying and pursuing charges and there is a consistent focus on reconciliation, whatever the circumstances. Courts and police accept customary practices of reconciliation such as i-bulubulu (the Fijian customary forgiveness ceremony) in lieu of punishment of the offender or to reduce the punishment; and non-molestation orders or protective injunctions are difficult to obtain and enforce. There is also a belief amongst women that the law cannot help them. Common features of domestic violence law No specific domestic violence criminal or civil legislation The Cook Islands has a specific domestic violence provision in its criminal legislation.188 Vanuatu has brand new stand alone or separate domestic violence legislation, which attempts to encompass all criminal and civil elements of domestic violence in one piece of legislation 186 UNESCAP 2007,107. 187 Kotoisuva, Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre, 2008. 188 Crimes Act 1969. 65 (see Box 21). However, in all other PICTs a domestic assault is prosecuted under general assault laws, giving domestic violence no special status, nor treatment, by justice agencies. However, some countries have set up VAW units to attempt to change this. Domestic violence is generally not considered a gender-based crime in most of the Pacific islands. No PICT has yet passed comprehensive integrated VAW legislation covering all forms of violence against women consistent with substantive equality standards. Box 21. The Family Protection Act 2008, Vanuatu \u2013 combating domestic violence in the home189 VAW against women is a widespread problem in Vanuatu.

The Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) provided technical support to both government and NGOs, including working with Members of Parliament to help them gain an understanding of the proposed law. The new law is designed to combat domestic violence and to provide for enforceable protection orders. Although by no means perfect legislation, it is a major advancement in women\u2019s rights in Vanuatu, in the area of domestic violence. The legislation\u2019s main features are: 1. It recognises domestic violence as a specific offence; 2. It makes domestic violence both a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment; and a civil offence attracting protection orders; 3. All forms of marriage are implicitly recognised so that any person in a domestic relationship of some sort is entitled to a protection order, thus implicitly including a de facto spouse and a custom marriage; 4. One of its innovative features, designed to deal with the remoteness of populations living in the outer islands far away from courts, is the authority given to trained \u2018authorised persons\u2019 in remote villages to give special temporary protection orders to women who are being beaten; 5. It is illegal to use culture, custom or the payment of bride price as a defence to a prosecution; 6. Given the remoteness of Vanuatu\u2019s populations it allows for court orders to be obtained by telephone or fax.; and 7. It removes various legal impediments which prevent successful prosecution. The Police have extensive powers and can arrest without a warrant. They can investigate an offence 189 VWC, 2008. 190 Informant, Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre legal adviser, Agathe Malsungai, Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT), Annual Regional Lawyers\u2019 Human Rights Training, Port Vila, Vanuatu, 13-17 October, 2008 66 and charge on the basis of a specific domestic violence offence. The Police are required to bring an arrested person to court within 48 hours of arrest The law was sent to the President for his signature as his formal assent is required under law. Some churches and chiefs lobbied the President not to sign arguing that it was \u2018un-Christian\u2019, against Melanesian values, discriminated against men, and was unconstitutional. However Vanuatu\u2019s Constitution makes discrimination against women unlawful. It also allows special measures, including legislation to be taken for disadvantaged groups, including specifically, women. The President filed a case in the Supreme Court seeking a technical opinion on whether the bill was unconstitutional based on several sections of the bill, including whether it was consistent with Christian principles outlined in the Preamble.191 In November 2008, the Chief Justice ruled that the bill was constitutional. This is an important legal milestone for ni-Vanuatu women. Only time will tell whether there is sufficient human, financial, training and technical resources allocated to implementation so that the new law lives up to its promise. Customary and formal reconciliation processes Traditional reconciliation, forgiveness practices and ceremonies, and justice agencies widely encourage forgiveness and reconciliation, both in the informal or village courts, or the national level courts which administer formal law (see Box 22). The effect of this is that there is either no prosecution, finding of guilt and punishment deserving of the crime or the forgiveness is used to lessen the punishment. Box 22. Customary practices, bride price and domestic violence in Melanesia Among the most frequent explanations women put forward for the violence and discrimination they suffer at the hands of their husbands in the Solomon Islands is the tradition of a \u2018bride price\u2019 given to the parents of a bride at her wedding by the parents of the groom. While customs on bride price vary according to provinces and language groups, the practice encourages an attitude in husbands to treat wives like property: \u2018As a wife, she is expected to be subordinate to and obey her husband \u2026 She is at the mercy of her husband, who paid bride price for her\u2026\u2019 Some Malaitan men confirmed this perception and added that a young husband was under pressure from the male community and his relatives to show his ability to \u2018control\u2019 his often teenage wife, including through violence.192 Many customary practices are still in place and reinforce certain interpretations of religious (mainly Christian) beliefs about women\u2019s roles. In Melanesian countries, apart from Fiji, bride price is still used to justify binding women in violent marriages. Where polygamy is practiced and accepted, violence against women is prevalent. In Papua New Guinea, there is a high level of violence against women by their husbands and also between co-wives.

As domestic violence is considered a minor criminal assault, prosecutions are generally conducted by untrained non- lawyer police prosecutors in the lower courts. This decreases the likelihood of securing criminal convictions. When ni-Vanuatu women go to the police to attempt to file charges, the police send them to the Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre (VWC) to get civil protection orders against further abuse, but refuse to prosecute under the criminal law, by filing criminal charges.194 The VWC assists women obtain civil protection orders but civil orders are generally poorly enforced. When young, gender-trained police officers try to file charges, their senior officers refuse to follow through.195 Court attitudes also reflect ambivalence. In a Fiji case in the Magistrate\u2019s Court recently, a female prosecutor lawyer said that the magistrate had asked the complainant wife: \u2019Why did you get beaten?\u2019 rather than to ask the husband why he beat his wife.196 No drop prosecution policies There has been some anecdotal evidence to suggest improvements to rates of prosecutions in PICTs where police and prosecution offices have introduced \u2018No Drop\u2019 policies of prosecution, regardless of the view of the forgiving wife/partner. This means that the Police are not permitted to drop the prosecution of the offender even if the spouse is unwilling to pursue a prosecution after first having laid criminal charges. However, these are policy decisions, which cannot be enforced by the courts, as they are internal organizational policy. Such policies can be enforced by internal disciplinary measures only. The policies require police to follow through with prosecution following incidences of domestic violence, without any discretion being exercised. These policies have been applied inconsistently depending on the commitment of the police commissioners. Many women\u2019s NGOs are of opinion that prosecutions and sentencing must be mandatory and secured in legislation. In addition, specialist units need to be set up within the police force in all countries to deal with VAW. Some countries including Nauru, Fiji, Vanuatu, Cooks Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa and Solomon Islands, have units within the police dedicated to investigating and prosecuting violence against women, either domestic violence or sexual assault (see Box 23). They vary in terms of size, resources, sophistication and effectiveness. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are slightly higher rates of detection prosecution and conviction, where such units exist but there is no methodical research in the area. It is likely that a combination of policies and special units will enhance rates of detection and conviction. Box 23.

The Nauru Police has a small unit comprising three women and two men constables and is headed by a woman constable who has attended training organised by the NZAID Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme (PPDV). The main obstacle faced by the DV unit in their attempt to address DV in Nauru was the lack of a safe place where women survivors could be sheltered whilst their cases were being investigated. Nauru has a population of around 12,000 living on one island. In many cases, women survivors had no choice but to 'reconcile' with their husbands straight after filing their complaints as there was no alternative accommodation for them. This prompted the 3 women constables of the DVU to set up a temporary shelter in 2007 after obtaining permission from Government to use some buildings in the abandoned Australian refugee processing centre. Because of a lack of resources within the Nauru Police, the three women constables have been running the Shelter (in terms of food and drinks for the survivors) using their own funds. The only assistance from the Nauru Police is the security that it provides to the Shelter. To date this Shelter has accommodated 6 women survivors.198 Lack of availability and enforcement of protection orders in legislation Non-molestation, protective orders or injunctions are generally available through the common law as a rule of practice in some PICTs (see Table 14). However, there is generally no legislative basis for providing such protection. The courts exercise their discretionary power to make the order sparingly and inconsistently. Only married women, and not de facto wives or girlfriends, are entitled to seek the order. When the orders are granted and disobeyed, the police habitually do not enforce the orders through imprisonment, partially because the orders are vague, and also because there is no legislation setting out clear guidelines. Imprisonment requires lengthy and complex contempt of court proceedings, and domestic violence is not high on the police list of priorities. The perpetrator is usually summoned to the police station or court, \u2018reprimanded\u2019 and allowed to leave. There is no specific protection order by legislation in Samoa but the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act 1961 section 20 makes it a criminal offence to molest a wife after divorce.199 197 Radio New Zealand International www.rzni.com posted 09 July, 2008 198 As told to RRRT. 199 Section 20, Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act 1961 69 Table 14.

Source: author Sentencing of offenders A considerable challenge is that in most PICTs, courts rarely award custodial (prison) sentences that reflect the seriousness of the crime; despite the fact that domestic violence is a recidivist or repeated, habitual crime (see Box 24). Courts tend to give bind-over (probationary type) orders, which command the offender not to commit another crime for a specified period. If the offender does commit the crime again, he will be punished for the original crime. It is in effect a \u2018keep the peace\u2019 order. However, in practice, the courts usually refuse to imprison a \u2018breadwinner\u2019 even when a further crime is committed. Crimes against theft or damage of property regularly attract greater sentences throughout the Pacific. Courts routinely say that that if they imprison a breadwinner there will be no-one to financially support the family. Interestingly, the only time this justification is ever used is in domestic violence cases and not in mainstream criminal cases. As a matter of policy courts should order a 24-hour jail sentence to mitigate the breadwinner argument or imprison at night only. Box 24. Domestic violence is not a private matter but not serious enough for a long prison sentence - Toakarawa v The Republic of Kiribati200 T was a 22-year-old married man whose wife was four months pregnant. Whilst intoxicated, T beat her, dragged her by the hair and bit her on the nose, cheek, lips and fingers of both hands. He resisted attempts by neighbours to intervene. The injuries were permanent and included the upper and lower lips being bitten off, exposing the teeth. T maintained that he was so intoxicated that he did not know what he was doing; that he had apologised for his actions and had later reconciled with his wife.

The CJ noted however, the apology, reconciliation, the state of drunkenness, the absence of previous convictions and the early plea of guilt. T was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment. T challenged the sentence, arguing amongst other things, that he needed to earn money for the family. An issue for consideration was whether the apology, reconciliation and that T was the main breadwinner, relevant to sentencing in a domestic violence case? Was domestic violence a private or public matter? The Court of Appeal refused to lessen the sentence saying that assaults on wives were to be treated as serious matters of public concern, and that the extraordinary ferocity, the duration of the attack and the permanent disfigurement made the sentence appropriate.

This is particularly so in a region in which wife beating is regarded as a customary \u2018right\u2019 of a husband. There have been some haphazard improvements to lengths of sentences for domestic violence offenders, but this is still dependent on individual judicial attitudes. The \u2018breadwinner\u2019 philosophy still largely prevails. Legislation on protection orders in family law Fiji, Cook Islands, Solomon Islands each have a legislative basis for civil protective orders in the family law.201 The problems with the new provisions in Fiji lie not in its legislative framework, but in the inability of enforcement agencies to understand the new legislation, to leave the unwieldy and inefficient old system of enforcement behind, and in the attitudes of police officers who are supposed to enforce the new legislation. Powers in the legislation are broad and sweeping, but the police and various court officials appear not to understand what is required of them under the new law, despite the clear and simple procedures. The new law has enjoyed moderate success in Suva where there is a full time dedicated Family Court, with four dedicated family court magistrates, and effective NGOs that closely monitor the implementation of the new law.202 Both the Cook Islands and Solomon Islands have specific legislation regarding injunctions. The legislation is gender-neutral and applies only to persons married by law or by custom.203 Magistrates and women\u2019s NGOs say that the biggest problems are a lack of training in the new legal regime, and the historic recalcitrance of police and enforcement officials to imprison men for what has always been regarded as culturally acceptable behaviour. However, for the tenacious domestic violence survivor, and the women\u2019s NGOs that support them, the new provisions have been innovative and useful.204 Women as criminal defendants Abortion and infanticide Laws on abortion, infanticide (the killing of a child under the age of 12 months) and prostitution or commercial sex work, are heavily influenced by religious and social beliefs. Strict legislation making abortion illegal, weigh most heavily on poor women, who have no alternative but to resort to unsafe, mostly dangerous, and amateur back-street abortions. Wealthy and middle-class women go to other countries close by, like Australia and New Zealand, where abortion is available, safe and legal, or to private hospitals where the law is less vigilant. Abortion and infanticide are criminal offences in most PICTs. Both occur when poor women have little control over their own fertility, and because of the social and economic conditions 201 The writer of this paper, P I Jalal, was Commissioner for Family Law, and prepared the Fiji Law Reform Commission report, Jalal 2000. 202 Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre and the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement. 203 Cook Islands Amendment Act 13/1994; Affiliation, Separation and Maintenance Act 1971 (Solomon Islands). 204 Jalal 2008. 71 of their lives.205 This has serious consequences for women\u2019s health and capacity to control their lives and productivity.

These provisions allow some room to maneuver for countries wishing to legalise abortion. All PICTS need to explicitly recognise the right to health care and specifically reproductive health care, and to non-discrimination on the grounds of health status. Abortion laws Abortion is specifically illegal in most PICTs, except for the Marshall Islands and three states of the Federates States of Micronesia.209 Penalties for the women procuring the abortion range from two years in Vanuatu to seven years\u2019 imprisonment in much of the Pacific; to life imprisonment in Kiribati. 210 There appear to be no specific criminal provisions against abortion in the Marshall Islands nor in three out of the four states of the Federated States of Micronesia: Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap, leading to the conclusion that it is not possible to prosecute either the medical practitioner or the women procuring an abortion in these states.211 Their state constitutions also mandate the provision of health care but without providing safe facilities for abortion to be carried out, so the de facto right is probably limited even if the law de jure permits it.212 Only the state of Chuuk specifically criminalises abortion providing for penalties up to nine years\u2019 imprisonment for anyone involved in the act, including the mother213, except where the mother\u2019s physical health is at stake.214 Chuuk also mandates that there shall be no discrimination in health care, so the position in Chuuk is unclear.215 In the area of the law on abortion, medical policy and actual approaches on the ground, there is a clear gap in information and research is needed in this area for all Pacific countries. Abortion is prohibited in Palau unless it is deemed medically necessary to save the mother\u2019s life.216 However, in the case of Palau Trust Territory v Tarkong,217 the court ruled that the abortion provisions were invalid because they were so broad and vague so as to constitute a denial of due process. The court objected to the fact that no circumstances were laid down 205 Jalal 1998, 193. 206 Article IX, section 2. 207 Section 15. 208 Section 6. 209 UNDESA 2002.

This decision is important for women in Palau and allows medical practitioners wider discretion. Although abortion is illegal, on the face of the legislation, the legislation in some countries, and the courts in others, have introduced defences to charges of abortion, where it is necessary for the \u2018preservation of the mother\u2019s life\u2019,218 or to \u2018save the mother\u2019s life\u2019 or if the \u2018health\u2019 of the mother is in danger (see Table 15). This is generally taken to mean the \u2018physical\u2019 and not \u2018mental or psychological health\u2019 of the mother in most countries. However, in Fiji, the courts have interpreted the legislation to include both the \u2018physical and mental health\u2019 of the patient as being justifiable grounds for medical intervention.219 In The State v Tabua220, the judge went so far as to say that the laws were not only outdated but further implied that they also discriminated against poor women.

Jalal 1998 and UNDESA 2002. In a recent and high profile Fiji case, State v Mudaliar,221 the necessity for illegal backstreet abortions led to the death of a young university student and the conviction of the medical practitioner to three years\u2019 imprisonment for manslaughter. Very few cases reach the courts and the present case only did because of the death of the pregnant girl. Fiji, Cook Islands, Nauru, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Niue and Samoa seem to interpret existing abortion laws relatively liberally, whilst Tonga, Kiribati and Tuvalu only permit legal abortion to protect the physical health of the mother (see Table 15). Although not specifically legislated for, anecdotal evidence suggests that a rape complainant who becomes pregnant will be allowed a legal abortion in some PICTs. However the lack of safe medical facilities might make any such right illusory in countries where there appears to be a degree of legal flexibility. Infanticide laws Infanticide is not widespread in the region but is a defence to a charge of murder, when a woman takes her child\u2019s life in circumstances in which it is medically proven that she is suffering from depression up to 12 months after birth.222 In most cases the charges are reduced from murder to manslaughter. In a number of cases the courts have recognised the link between poverty and infanticide, and in some cases, domestic violence. In The State v Mala Wati223 a woman was given a two-year suspended sentence for causing the death of her five-month-old baby. The court noted that the woman had been a battered wife, was living in an impoverished squatter settlement, was unable to provide her baby with nourishing food and was the sole supporter of her seven children. Commercial sex work, prostitution and trafficking Prostitution as well as so-called sorcery and witchcraft, are very close linked to poverty. Women turn to such forms of earning an income in desperation. Prostitution or commercial sex work appears to be illegal in all PICTs (for both the owner/keeper of the premises and the woman (or man) soliciting for the purposes of prostitution, except for Niue where it appears to be illegal only for the keeper of the premises.224 In the states of Yap and Kosrae of the Federated States of Micronesia, soliciting is not an offence, while it is in the others.225 Prostitution laws are based on double standards, which view prostitution (sex work) as a necessary evil, but choose to criminalise mainly the women who provide the service, and the brothel keepers, but not the men that are their clients.226 Couched in gender-neutral language, the legislation in most PICTs, therefore indirectly discriminates against women under Article 221 [2006] FJHC 45, 46, 47. 222 Section 205, Penal Code, Chapter 17.

They tend only to be charged for this offence when they are also arrested for theft from clients.231 From an equity perspective to empower sex workers, they need conditions of employment (albeit very limited conditions in most PICTs) similar to that of other mainstream workers. This paper does not cover female sex trafficking in any great detail, as regional intelligence reports do not support high levels of human trafficking in the Pacific.232 The same research noted that some countries report anecdotal evidence of trafficking through their borders, including Fiji, the Marshall Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Vanuatu. In 2005, a Chinese national of Palau was convicted of smuggling and trafficking offences for recruiting women from China, ostensibly for waitressing work, but who were ultimately coerced into prostitution.233 There is very little Pacific research on female adult trafficking for sexual purposes, although some US based organizations believe that between 18,000- 20,000 women are trafficked into the USA from Asia and the Pacific Islands annually.234 In addition, the UNHCR reports that PNG has become a problematic area in recent times (see Box 25).

Some foreign women travel to Papua New Guinea willingly on tourist or business visas and may be aware they will engage in prostitution. They are dispersed to various nightclubs, bars, or employee dormitories, and some may end up in a situation of involuntary servitude. Some of the logging camps bring Asian women into Papua New Guinea by indicating in their visa applications that they will work as cooks or secretaries.

Women are occasionally sold as brides. Children are held in indentured servitude either as a means of paying a family debt or because the natural parents cannot afford to support the child. Some children may be given to another family of greater wealth to serve as a housekeeper or nanny \u2013 a practice that can lead to trafficking in persons. Children in prostitution are common in the bars and nightclubs in the larger cities. There are no official statistics kept on trafficking of persons, mainly because of the tendency of the communities to remain silent about the problem. The Government of Papua New Guinea does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. While the government is becoming aware of trafficking as a challenge distinct from sexual violence or human smuggling, its current legal framework does not contain elements of crimes that characterize trafficking. No one has been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted for trafficking in persons, and there have not been any anti- trafficking operations conducted by any law enforcement agency. The government lacks victim protection services or a systematic procedure to identify victims of trafficking from among vulnerable populations, such as foreign women arrested for prostitution or children in prostitution. Although the law does not prohibit all forms of trafficking, its criminal code prohibits the trafficking of children for commercial sexual exploitation, slavery, and abduction. Most internal trafficking-related crimes occur in rural areas and are referred to village courts which administer customary, rather than criminal law, resolving more cases through restitution paid to the victim. It is also to be noted, that in a recent study on child sexual exploitation covering Fiji, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu it was confirmed that in each country children are sexually abused by family members and neighbours and, to varying degrees, that child prostitution, child pornography, early marriage, child sex tourism and trafficking (for sexual purposes) occurred. Perpetrators of the abuse and exploitation were found to be overwhelmingly males, and typically men with resources or power in the community.

While the study highlights some prevalence of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation committed by foreign tourists and foreign workers in the Pacific, children are most at risk in their homes and communities and with people they know and trust.236 Most countries have adopted a watchful approach to the exploitation of girls under 18 and women who have been forced into sex work without their consent and trafficked to other locations within the country or abroad in generalized criminal laws but have failed to translate this into legislation. Only a few have specific legislation against the trafficking of women. No PICT has specific laws against sex tourism (see Table 16). Papua New Guinea has introduced a range of offences and severe penalties for the generalized exploitation of children, including criminalizing the clients of children in its new legislation mentioned.237 Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu provide some limited protection for girls and women who have been trafficked to other locations both within the country or abroad, but the low punishment of two to three years\u2019 imprisonment is an insufficient 236 UNICEF Pacific 2007, viii. 237 Criminal Code (Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children) Act 2000. 76 deterrent.238 It is difficult to judge the extent to which the formal legislation is actually enforced in any of these countries without careful research.

Witchcraft, adultery and other custom laws and practices Witchcraft As recently as January 2009, a woman in rural Papua New Guinea was bound and gagged, tied to a log and set ablaze on a pile of tires, possibly because villagers suspected her of being a witch. The killing of those suspected of witchcraft and sorcery is not uncommon. The victims are often scapegoats for someone else's unexplained death -- and bands of tribesmen often collude to mete out justice to them for their supposed powers. In this specific incidence, a group of people dragged the woman to a dumping ground outside the city of Mount Hagen. They stripped her naked, bound her hands and legs, stuffed a cloth in her mouth, tied her to a log and set her on fire. More than 50 people were killed in two Highlands provinces last year for allegedly practicing sorcery.239 A few PICTs still retain certain discriminatory arcane laws on sorcery or witchcraft as a means of controlling women. For example Niue\u2019s law is couched in the following terms: Witchcraft - Everyone is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months who pretends to exercise or use any kind of witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration, or undertakes to tell fortunes.240 Although seemingly gender neutral, the laws are selectively enforced against women, especially older women. It is not clear why this is so, but there is some anecdotal evidence that HIV/AIDS is often blamed on witchcraft, and that women gain power as they grow older in Melanesian society, and this is a means of \u201ckeeping them in their place\u201d (see Box 26). A recent report by an Australian think-tank, the Centre for Independent Studies, found that \"sorcery, witchcraft and other supernatural forces\" were widely blamed for the disease in PNG. The report stated that \"The mysterious deaths of relatively young people, thought to be deaths from HIV/AIDS, are being blamed on women practising witchcraft ...

There is a belief that witches were a public menace, causing death and disease, from whom society was justly entitled to protection. It was a pattern of socially-approved customary terror exercised against elderly women, to keep them in their place. The power of older women, as against men, was limited by the threat of an allegation of witchcraft which usually resulted in their death. Witch hunting also violated the constitutional rights of the victims \u2013 the right to life, the right to freedom from inhuman treatment, and the constitutional direction to improve the status of women in the National Goals and Directive Principles. Comment. The role of witchcraft in sexual politics is a reflection of male dominance in certain communities in Papua New Guinea. It is used as a means to ensure elderly women remain in submissive roles. The practice is both discriminatory, and an implicit threat, against elderly women. The allegation of witchcraft is difficult to disprove and engenders strong community feelings. Tragically, once such accusations are made, it results in death or great harm to the victims. Slavery In a case involving slavery, the court said in The State v Kule,243 the customary practice of giving a daughter to the murder victim\u2019s family in Papua New Guinea was not a mitigating factor for murder. It violated constitutional prohibitions on slavery. The Convention on the Abolition of Slavery and Slave Trade was applied, as well as the constitution, to reach that conclusion. The handing over of the child was an institution or practice similar to slavery and therefore prohibited by the Constitution, even if the evidence showed that such a custom was a common practice. Whilst compliance with customary obligations was a matter to be taken into account, the particular custom had to be proven by evidence and consistent with human rights provisions of the constitution. There have been no reported slavery cases in recent times, demonstrating the positive effect of this decision. This is an encouraging example of the influence of the law in shaping the evolution of custom. However, without systematic research, it is impossible to infer that slavery is not practiced in remote areas of PNG, as the bulk of the population does not live in urban centres. Adultery In some parts of Melanesia adultery is an offence under custom law deserving of either imprisonment or compensation. Tonga, Vanuatu, Cook Island and Solomon Islands also retain some elements of this law by allowing a claim for damages for adultery against the 241 Centre for Independent Studies, 2008. 242 (1990) PNGLR 318. 243 [1991] PNGLR 404 (3 December 1991) 78 \u2018seducer\u2019. So far the defendants appear to have been women.244 Solomon Islands\u2019 law is openly gender-biased allowing only husbands to claim damages.245 Adultery is a serious offence under custom, and in Banga v Waiwo246 a decision involving the payment of large sums of damages ordered by the chiefs against a man who had seduced a married women, was challenged in the lower and higher courts. 244 Jalal 1998, 224. 245 Ibid.

This means that they own land primarily under unwritten customary law. Only Fiji has a large minority population of Indian Fijians who comprise some 37 per cent of the population.248 Indigenous peoples in the PICTs are not generally marginalised or disenfranchised of their land. Protected, native or custom land makes up more than eighty per cent of the total land area,249 with some countries, such as Fiji, at about eight per cent, and to a limited extent Samoa (four per cent), having small but significant amounts of freehold land which can be bought and sold freely. Decisions about land use are made by many individuals or in Fiji\u2019s case the Native Land Trust Board (NLTB) in Fiji. Customary ownership is secured in most constitutions, or land codes and is governed by mainly unwritten, complicated rules of inheritance and traditional practices.250 For example, Article 72 of the Vanuatu Constitution states that \u2018the rules of custom shall form the basis of ownership and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49407e0f-e1dc-43d2-98fc-04f478477a91": {"__data__": {"id_": "49407e0f-e1dc-43d2-98fc-04f478477a91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc6870816041f5fda262b648822706e436507a792b7c2d808e5d02264b8a6afa"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7a92bc3-1132-46dc-b7a9-a0032407439b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd8bc25a2043d1fa7a6d3d40610779ca96751c84bc291afefa838313d30f0073"}}, "hash": "53cffa54417d1e1ec325806e068799e969609b05d3da44f528c1498132d7f037", "text": "use of land\u2019, but provides no other guidelines. Traditional, customary or \u2018native land\u2019 ownership is the principle form of land ownership in virtually all PICTs. Land is owned either communally; or in some cases, individually with the permission of the relevant tribe or other forms of land owning units (the mataqali in Fiji is the traditional land owning unit), on lease. In Fiji, it is possible to lease native land through the NLTB which is authorised to control the management of native or customary land.251 Although traditional or customary ownership protects the rights of native owners against exploitation by outsiders or foreigners, it restricts land development, and the access of women to land.252 With the advent of the modern cash economy, many people no longer enjoy secure land tenure, nor do they have confidence that their rights (or their group\u2019s rights) to land will be respected, legally or otherwise, by others, and protected in cases of challenge.253 \u2018Rights to land\u2019 mean different things in various countries, and even within countries, and depend mainly on highly localised practices which are determined by kinship ties, lineage and social and cultural practices.254 Each form of rights influences women\u2019s rights to control, use or obtain funds using land as collateral. Land ownerships systems are either patrilineal or matrilineal and have shifted over time. For example, on Gaua in Vanuatu, inheritance patterns have swung back and forth between patrilineal and matrilineal systems, leading to conflict 247 United Nations Human Settlements Programme 2008, 15. 248 Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics 2007. 249 AusAID 2008, xi. 250 Jalal 1998, 53. 251 Ibid. 252 Ibid. 253 AusAID 2008, xi. 254 AusAID 2008, 6. 80 among men and women over the character of \u2018custom\u2019 itself. In a similar vein, in parts of Espiritu Santo in Vanuatu, lines of descent and marriage are influenced by reference to the mother, but land is inherited through the father and domicile is determined by the location of the father. Thus the local system has matrilineal, patrilineal, patrilocal and significant patriarchal notions. This means that rights to land are determined not only by reference to gender but also by kinship, marriage and locality.255 Land laws affecting women It is important to note that the legislation does not directly or formally discriminate against women. The discrimination exists in the interpretation of custom and in unwritten land codes. All countries have both matrilineal and patrilineal land systems, and there is variation and diversity on all islands. There is a significant lacunae in the information, and research in this area is imperative. Recent research indicates that despite the complexity and diversity of customary tenure systems in the Pacific, which are constantly evolving in response to contemporary pressures, it is possible to make two general statements about women\u2019s rights to customary land in the region.256 \ufffd Women usually lack independent rights to land \ufffd Women usually have less input than men, into decisions about land However, in all PICTs countries, except Tonga,257 the land legislation does not formally nor directly discriminate against women. Indigenous women have, in theory, as much right to control and manage custom land, as men. Control and management of the land means having the right to say how the land should be used, whether it can be mortgaged as security to obtain loans for development purposes and whether it can be leased to individuals. Discrimination against women in terms of land rights or access to the use of land is indirect. Thus, although the legislation itself might not discriminate against women, the interpretation of customary law governing the control and management of custom land gives power over land mainly to men. Tonga is the only country in the region in which the legislation explicitly discriminates against women. Women\u2019s access to land in patrilineal systems In patrilineal societies, land is passed on from generation to generation through the male line. Land control and management are in male hands. Most Pacific Island societies are currently patrilineal, even if there was more matriliny in the past. The fact that a society is patrilineal does not necessarily mean that the society is also patriarchal, and that women do not have any access to land at all.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c7a92bc3-1132-46dc-b7a9-a0032407439b": {"__data__": {"id_": "c7a92bc3-1132-46dc-b7a9-a0032407439b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc6870816041f5fda262b648822706e436507a792b7c2d808e5d02264b8a6afa"}, "2": {"node_id": "49407e0f-e1dc-43d2-98fc-04f478477a91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "53cffa54417d1e1ec325806e068799e969609b05d3da44f528c1498132d7f037"}}, "hash": "dd8bc25a2043d1fa7a6d3d40610779ca96751c84bc291afefa838313d30f0073", "text": "However, if the society is both patrilineal and patriarchal, land is passed through the father's line, and men control and manage it: and women\u2019s access is determined through family patronage.258 Some areas in the Pacific trace rights to land through the female line, although not necessarily from mother to daughter.

It is often a woman's brothers or uncles on the mother's side who have control,259 and women\u2019s access to land is therefore often dependent on whether or not they enjoy good relationships with the men in their social and kinship groups.260 Traditional customs usually ensured that vulnerable groups such as widows, unmarried or elderly women had some form of access to land to protect women from poverty. Where strong gender discrimination exists, it often arises \u2018from the interaction of custom with social and economic pressures, including increases in economic activity and making customary land available for development\u2019.261 Women have been affected differently by the changing patterns of land use. Some women now have fewer rights and less access to land than they had under traditional arrangements. However, if women are able to understand how modern land uses affect their rights they can shape and influence not only better land policies but more equitable legislation. This will provide more economic benefits for women and children.262 Women have also lost access to land from interaction with outsiders who tend in the main to deal with men, based on assumptions about land ownership. Research into the matrilineal system of Mele on the island of South Efate, Vanuatu, concluded that this undermines the rights of women and may result in changes in customary ownership.263 Solomon Islands examples demonstrate the risks to women\u2019s rights over land, of over-simplifying and reinventing custom. In the Marovo area of New Georgia, descent lines were simplified in answer to a private developer\u2019s requests for custom to be represented in a clear and concise way; on Choiseul, people with customary rights to use land have altered their genealogical charter so as to show themselves as patrilineal descendants of the first occupants of the area, thus granting themselves rights to control the land. Genealogies on Malaita have been changed to rule out group members who have become residents of other areas.264 Box 27. Male primogeniture and male privilege in land rights in Tonga Tonga is a highly socially stratified society presided over by a hereditary monarch. Significant power is vested in the King, the royal family and nobles. The 1875 Tongan Constitution and the Land Act ensure that land is vested in the Crown. The legislation establishes male primogeniture and male privilege, in which the eldest male of the male line is preferred over others and women.265 There are three kinds of land entitlements: the hereditary estate (tofia); the tax allotment ('api 'uta); and the town allotment ('api kolo). The Land Act governs rights to town and tax allotments and provides that every Tongan male is entitled to a tax and town allotment when he reaches 16. Scheduled hereditary estates (tofia) are held by nobles and matapule. The Land Act states that inheritance of hereditary estates will take place according to Article 107 of the Constitution. Article 107 of the Constitution indicates those who are eligible to inherit land: 259 Ibid. 260 AusAID 2008, 82. 261 Ibid. 262 Ibid. 263 Stege, Maetala, Naupa & Simo, (ed) Huffer 2008, 103-115. 264 AusAID 2008, 85. 265 Jalal 1998, 58. 82 Legitimate children, male and female but primarily the eldest male and his heirs; then the second male child if the eldest son has no heirs; and so on until the male line ends. If the male line dies out, the eldest female line will succeed. If then the female line dies out the land reverts to the male line. The widow of an estate holder does not have an automatic right to live on her husband's land.266 The Tongan Constitution and Land Act give the widow of a tax or town allotment holder ('api 'uta or 'api kolo) a right to succeed to the allotment until she dies, or remarries or \u2018fornicates\u2019. This means that once a widow has sexual relations with another man, she loses her right to live in the home that she lived in before her husband's death.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f10c05b-1886-4edf-bc27-853f2150bfb5": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f10c05b-1886-4edf-bc27-853f2150bfb5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3041a6b1718f693d57c6a1ec88d9f7e4c1b296e041cf8b80d177c7d4b71e0ecb"}, "2": {"node_id": "327c8879-a4e1-459e-8793-6c0b19fcc9de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45d6d7b9bdb28d30cf0266f0d37b1189af42ba514bdd83864e1faeb4a4f6a446"}}, "hash": "28cfbae00ac0356eb14ca6a18d0c8abd57f0155f487117798d29e9bf16b41c6a", "text": "For the rest of her life, she must be sexually faithful to her dead husband or risk losing her home.267 Women's land rights in Tonga are very limited; they depend on the goodwill of men and on the custom of fahu, the traditional duties of a brother to his sister.

It especially affects widows who cannot lease out life estates or mortgage life estates, because the Bank does not regard a life estate as good security. As women have little access to land, they have limited means to obtain loans. They need the consent of husbands, fathers, brothers and sons to borrow money, as they cannot be legal owners of land unless they are registered lessees. Women\u2019s access to land in matrilineal societies A small number of PICTs have matrilineal systems of land ownership, including across the Western and Northern parts of the Pacific. Most of Micronesia is matrilineal including Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia (except for Yap), the Marshall Islands and Nauru.270 Matrilineal societies exist in both Solomon Islands and Vanuatu.271 In many cases, women managed land, were the primary advisers on land use, the primary caretakers of the clan\u2019s assets and settled disputes over land. However, recent research reveals that women\u2019s roles in matrilineal societies are increasingly constrained by male domination, not only in terms of decisions about land but in society generally.272 The power that women exercise over land generally varies across matrilineal areas, because although in some areas matriliny is tantamount to gender equality and equal political power, in other areas, women have much less power and less say in decision making.273 266 Ibid. 267 Ibid. 268 Ibid. 269 One senior woman licensed lawyer said that Tongan women get very angry about land, personal communication. 270 Stege, Maetala, Naupa, & Simo,.

(ed) Huffer,2008 viii. 273 Ibid. 83 With the advent of colonisation in the Pacific some matrilineal areas gradually became patrilineal in terms of title, inheritance and/or land ownership and transmission.274 This happened in many parts of the region including Fiji, Tokelau, the Marshall Islands, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands.275 It is recorded that Pohnpei in Micronesia was a clear example of introduced German law codifying land laws into patrilineal inheritance and awarding \u2018each adult male a piece of land\u2019. The result of this, is that now land is commonly transferred from father to son, although daughters can also inherit land.276 The downfall of matriliny has been attributed to social disruption caused by changing population shifts; colonial-era land alienation; patriarchal land laws; the promotion of males in education and the formal economy; women\u2019s exclusion from public office and political power and the pressing need for cash.277 Political power in the hands of men can also influence changing land ownership from men to women. Recording or registering customary law in legislation or policy has buttressed male control over land. The Custom Policy in Vanuatu for example, provides that the \u2018true custom owners\u2019 of land are men whose lineage is directly linked to the community domiciled within the borders of the land. If these men die, male guest residents (who were originally outsiders a few generations previously but now living in the locality) may assume ownership rights, if they have lived there for at least four generations. If the long-term guests have also died out, adopted sons and their descendants may assume rights. Control over land may pass to a ni- Vanuatu woman only if all these men are dead, and none of her uncles are alive. This means that women in Vanuatu \u2018own\u2019 land only as a last resort under the Custom Policy.278 Men from outside the area, i.e. guest residents, and even adopted males, have precedence over local women. Women rarely assert their rights using the formal court system, particularly in Melanesia, although there is some anecdotal evidence that women use the court system more often in Polynesia.279 The unwillingness of women to use the formal court system is due partially to the system being culturally alien, based on colonial adversarial or inquisitorial methods, and in conflict with cultural values of consensus.

Although in this case, a woman\u2019s son filed a court case on behalf of his mother and her family, the dispute was essentially about women\u2019s access to land in a predominantly patrilineal and patriarchal community. All the people involved belonged to the same wantok (clan). Crero Toto, the father of Obed Toto and grandfather of John Noel, had been the custom owner of a piece of land known as Champagne Beach on Espiritu Santo Island. He had two wives, one from Hog Harbour and the second, de facto wife, from Kolo. He had several children with both wives including an eldest daughter, Julie, from the first wife. Custom evidence had established that Obed, and not Crero's eldest child Julie, was the head of the family. Obed argued that he could decide what to do with the money from the land: he normally would give some money to the family, but was not obliged to do so. He further argued that the family members should ask the head of the family for land, and that when women married, they lost their customary rights to their fathers' land. Therefore his married sisters (including Julie) had lost their rights to Champagne Beach, and their children had no rights either. The legal issue at the centre of the argument was Article 5 of the Vanuatu Constitution which grants equal rights to men and women. However Article 72 says that \u2018the rules of custom shall form the basis of ownership and use of land\u2019. If there is conflict between the interpretation of customary law and the Constitution, which law should prevail? The court said although customary law was the basis of land ownership in Vanuatu, it was still subject to the constitution and cannot be applied if it discriminates against women. This is a fundamental principle, which overrides any law or custom that is contrary to it. Further, a decision giving more rights to men than to women would be contrary to CEDAW, which the Vanuatu Parliament had recently adopted. Therefore, Obed's sisters and brothers were equally entitled to a share in the income from Champagne Beach. No distinction should be made between the legitimate children of Crero's first wife, and the children of his de facto wife. Obed Toto was the head of the family but was obliged to share the income equally with his sister, brothers, half-sisters and half-brothers and descendants. In the RMI a legislative strategy was not attempted. Instead, women\u2019s groups mobilised, campaigned and lobbied against proposed legislation that they considered would deprive them of their traditional land rights (see Box 29). Box 29.

Men of the chiefly (irooj) class were iroojlaplap, women lerooj, but the basic chiefly duties were left to the junior male relatives. In the exercise of power and duties consultation with the lerooj was critical.

In stark comparison, the rural atoll of Namdrik is still governed by matrilineal lineage, and disputes over land are largely settled through negotiation and consensus. Marshallese women have a critical political power base because of matrilineal heritage, and they have direct power in decision making over land, notwithstanding an emerging patriarchal political power structure dominated by men. In December 2003, the government established a Land Registration Authority (LRA) to allow for voluntary registration of interests which require the consent of all senior land owners including chiefs of both genders. However there has been barely any participation in the LRA due to a lack of interest, costs of registration and because of the lack of involvement of the people in designing the scheme. In recent times there have been tensions about the legitimacy of females to be alap and to participate in the public and political spheres. In 2005, the High Court, with the concurrence of the Traditional Rights Courts, decided in favour of two female plaintiffs claiming alap and senior rijerbal rights on Kwajalein Atoll (where the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defence Site is located and which brings huge income to traditional land owners).283 Subsequently two male senators of the Nitijela (Parliament) introduced Bill 84 to codify Marshallese customary law so as to define the term alap only as a male elder person. Women United Together Marshall Islands (WUTMI), a woman\u2019s NGO, mobilised to defeat Bill 84. They conducted a strategic campaign relying heavily on the media (even on Radio Australia) using especially the voices of the female lerooj in newspapers, radio, community wide petitions targeting elected members of the Council of Irooj as the government monitors of custom. The lobbying effort was successful and demonstrates the extent of female authority in custom, as many women saw themselves not as feminists, but as traditionalists protecting Marshallese manit (custom). However, WUTMI conducted a very modern, smart, strategic and media effective campaign, reminiscent of modern feminist campaigns to either pass or defeat proposed law, as in other countries. Limited access to land has severe consequences not only for the general human need for shelter but also for the ability of women to obtain money without reference to men. Without land as security, there is very limited access to credit or loans from commercial banks. This ultimately reinforces women's dependence on men. In the Pacific Islands, as in other countries, possession of land is a very important factor in being able to obtain loans to start businesses, develop property, grow produce, participate in the cash economy and build homes. If women do not have access to land they have no means of acquiring money or obtaining any real economic power. Most Pacific Island countries have special constitutionally recognised land courts that adjudicate disputes over land (see Box 30 for an example). These land courts usually have male judges. In some cases, as in Fiji, women are traditionally not allowed to give evidence as expert witnesses, as a matter of practice not law, despite the fact that women are regarded as primary caretakers of tradition. The current interpretation of customary law gives control 283 Stege, Maetala, Naupa and Simo, (ed) Hufffer 2008, PIFS 19 (Case MIJ 4/1/2005, MIJ 4/22/2005 see endnote 26 to 29, 33. 86 and management of custom land to men, particularly to men of high rank. Thus land rights are affected both by sex and by social class. Except in the Marshall Islands and the Cook Islands, women rarely take action in the various land courts. The complicated legal processes and the expenses of taking cases further operate against women and the poor.284 Box 30. Land and decision making in the Solomon Islands - The Proposed Solomon Islands Draft Constitution The post-conflict constitutional making process in the Solomon Islands has offered women the rare opportunity to influence their land rights in legislation. They have mobilized in partnership with the Women\u2019s Ministry to make submissions to the National Constitutional Congress.285 They have proposed the use of new language: \u201cPatrilineal and matrilineal customs shall be equally recognised.\u201d \u201cNone of the custom laws, traditions, systems and institutions referred to shall be applied to unfairly discriminate against women.\u201d \u201cWomen are entitled to participate equitably in the planning and decision making process.\u201d 284 Jalal 1998, Chapter 3. 285 Ministry of Women and Culture, Solomon Islands 2008. 87 Chapter 5: Health, education, employment and economic issues It is widely accepted that women\u2019s contributions need to be better harnessed in support of economic productivity.

The UNESCAP Economic and Social Survey for Asia and the Pacific 2007, found that discrimination against women costs Asia-Pacific economies almost US$80 billion a year.286 The survey stated that gender discrimination in the region is most visible in the low access women and girls have to education and health services, to economic opportunities and to political participation. The law has a significant role to play in bringing about gender justice, to achieve gender equality in these and other areas, in order to address these historic inequalities. Gender discrimination has widespread consequences and clear economic and social costs. The UNESCAP Economic and Social Survey 2007 states that although the Asia-Pacific region has made good progress in reducing gender discrimination in recent years, \u2018appalling disparities\u2019 remain. The survey states that the region is losing $42-$47 billion per year because of restrictions on women\u2019s access to employment opportunities, and another $16-$30 billion per year because of gender gaps in education.287 Article 13 of CEDAW mandates State Parties to ensure that women are granted equal rights to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit free from discrimination. There are no direct legislative barriers to women obtaining bank loans and mortgages in any PICT, but indirect discrimination, in the form of informal restrictions on women\u2019s access to employment, continues to deter women from obtaining credit and loans to purchase property or small businesses. Their limited access to land in most PICTs adds a further layer of discrimination, preventing women from being able to provide the collateral necessary to obtain funds for a variety of income earning opportunities. A combination of these factors interferes with women\u2019s autonomy and ability to earn a livelihood. How do the laws contribute to gender discrimination in health, education and employment? Gender, health and the law No PICT explicitly makes health status discrimination illegal in their Constitution. However, Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and Marshall Islands recognise some semblance of the right to health. The Micronesia Constitution grants Congress the power to promote health by setting minimum standards288 whilst the Constitutions of the Marshall Islands289 and Palau290 recognise the right of the people to health care. The Constitution of the State of Chuuk in Micronesia provides that no person shall be discriminated against in the distribution of medical care or refused medical care because of financial inability.291 Given that the Federates States of Micronesia federal constitution prohibits sex discrimination, a combination of the provisions of the Chuuk state and federal laws would allow for a lawsuit on the basis of health status discrimination in that state. All PICTS need to explicitly 286 UNESCAP 2007, 4 287 Ibid. 288 Article IX, section 2. 289 Section 15. 290 Section 16. 291 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, 92. 88 recognise the right to health care, and specifically, reproductive health care, and to non- discrimination on the grounds of health status, specifically in their constitutions. Gender, education and the law Surveys show conclusively that women\u2019s education, particularly its intergenerational effects on children\u2019s health and education, is directly linked to human development.292 There is also a positive relationship between women\u2019s education and economic growth.293 Compared to Asia, recent research indicates no huge gender disparities in enrolment rates in the Pacific region294, and in most cases, girls outnumber boys\u2019 enrolment numbers in high school (see Table 17), as well as in university. For example, current enrolment rates at the regional University of the South Pacific, indicate that 11,224 females and 9,842 males are registered as students, whilst there are 221 female and 391 male staff.295 However there are huge disparities between islands and the quality of education differs greatly between them as well.296 From the Pacific region Kiribati and Tonga were the best performers.297 However numbers drop significantly for both groups for secondary school compared to primary school, and women enter the paid work force at significantly lower numbers. What is not clear is the comparative fall out rate for girls from secondary school. In the Marshall Islands for example, despite the figures apparently indicating gender parity, at both primary and secondary levels, female drop-out rates are higher than for males, resulting in a higher proportion of males completing Grades 6, 8 and 12 than females. Reasons for this include the rise in teenage pregnancy rates and socio-cultural expectations requiring females to be at home to help their parents take care of younger children and other family members.298 Table 17.

There are no formal laws that prohibit access to education for girls or women. Rather, it is gender discrimination by omission, for example, in failing to legislate in areas affecting girls and women\u2019s education. However, they are disadvantaged because of informal and structural impediments such as poverty, cultural attitudes and perceived gender roles. This means that if there are limited education funds available within the family, girls may be withdrawn from school first. Cultural reasons are also important. Research in 1994 indicated that close to 20 per cent of Indian Fijian girls were taken out of school in fifth form (around the ages of 15- 16, two years short of graduating from high school) to marry, in mainly arranged marriages.299 It is not clear whether this pattern remains and more research is needed. There is no legislation creating special measures for education of girls, whether in the form of temporary special measures or the requirement of special budgets for female education, despite the laws of several countries allowing such measures for disadvantaged groups. Some informal policies for affirmative action for the education of girls appear to exist but there is no data supporting this. There is no legislation preventing schools from expelling girls who fall pregnant, or mandating schools to allow them to complete their education, after childbirth. It is the norm in most PICTs schools for pregnant girls to be expelled.300 Article 10 of CEDAW mandates State Parties to ensure that women and men have equal rights and opportunities in the field of education. Fiji has made equal access to education a constitutional requirement,301 and has specifically allowed for legislation to be passed to provide equality of access in the field of education.302 However, this provision has not been used to pass laws on affirmative action or to encourage female education. The Marshall Islands\u2019 Constitution recognises the right of the people to education303 and Vanuatu specifically mentions educational disadvantage arising from the gender of the child.304 It is widely accepted that legislating for compulsory education is critical to ensure that girls are equally prioritised and not discriminated against in education.305 CEDAW General Recommendation 5 also encourages States to make more use of temporary special measures such as affirmative action, preferential treatment or female quotas to promote women\u2019s participation rates in education.306 Several PICTs have introduced compulsory schooling at both primary and secondary levels up to certain ages, generally around 14 years of age.307 The Federated States of Micronesia in 299 Fiji Ministry of Women & Culture, A Statistical Gender Profile, 1994. 300 DAV Secondary School is the only school in Fiji with a deliberate policy of allowing young mothers from any school to complete their education. 301 Section 39(1), Constitution. 302 Section 44, Constitution; Section 21, Human Rights Commission Act 1999. 303 Article II, section 5. 304 Section 2(d), Education Act 2001. 305 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, x. 306 Ibid. 307 Compulsory Education Regulations 1997 made pursuant to the Education Act Cap 262 (Fiji); Education Act Cap 30 (Kiribati); Education Act 1991(RMI); Samoa - up to 14 years old Compulsory Education Act 1992; Education Act 1978 (Tuvalu) up to 15 years; Education Act 2001 (Vanuatu) up to 14 years. 90 particular, guarantees free elementary education for all throughout the country, and has established student loans for all young men and women to undertake higher education.308 Palau also offers free and compulsory education for grades one through to twelve.309 Gender, employment and the law The economic and social costs of gender discrimination in employment are significant. Gender discrimination frustrates women\u2019s participation in employment, reduces their productivity, diverts resources and has an overall impact on their empowerment. Legal or other impediments to female employment raise labour costs and lower international competitiveness, preventing women from entering the market at competitive wages.310 Global marketing forces and local tax regimes also wield significant influence over women\u2019s access to paid work.

The significance of unpaid household work The overwhelming numbers of non-student females in Fiji are doing unpaid household duties. Recent research estimates the value of unpaid household work at almost FJD480 million, a figure greater than the income created by sugar or tourism, the two largest industries. Women were unable to pursue professional development or other income-generating opportunities because they shouldered an unequal burden of household work. Although the employment of women has done more to encourage global growth than capital investment increases and productivity improvements, the vast majority of women are engaged in low-paying or unpaid work. The report points to some positive signals of change over the past 25 years. In some industries, income disparities between men and women have been reversed for women with certificate and diploma level education.313 The UNESCAP Economic and Social Survey314 indicates that in the Asia-Pacific region women\u2019s participation in the labour force, whether formal or informal \u2013 and thus their role in the economy \u2013 is constrained by many obstacles: lack of proper education, discrimination in wages and promotions, cultural attitudes, harassment at work and difficulties in reconciling domestic commitments, including childcare.315 Even when women participate actively in the labour market they may not have decent jobs.

Land shortages will make this capacity to provide food increasingly problematic. 321 Although the data in Tuvalu reveals a high percentage of women employed at 44 per cent, the majority of workers are employed by the government, due to the virtual non-existence of a private sector. In some countries, like Samoa, the picture is more promising. Women are increasingly entering the labour force, comprising 43 per cent of the formal wage economy. They dominate in manufacturing, as well as in the teaching and nursing professions. Female civil servants are guaranteed eight weeks of paid maternity leave, and a further six months\u2019 leave without pay, but the private sector is not equally benefitting. In the private sector such benefits are determined by private arrangements between employer and employee. Women have also benefited from credit and training programmes, as the majority of loans approved for business enterprises and commercial activities were granted to women.322 The patterns of women's employment vary from one Pacific Island country to another, but there are some common features:323 \ufffd Most countries do not consider women as economically active unless they work for money. \ufffd Where women work for money they earn generally less than men. \ufffd Women working for money concentrate in \u2018female\u2019 occupations like nursing, teaching, clerical and the service industries. \ufffd Work in subsistence agriculture and fishing is recognised but usually only indirectly. This work contributes significantly to food security in all countries. \ufffd Some women are obtaining access to income by becoming self-employed. These women are not counted in statistics but they are making significant contributions to the family income and to the economy. \ufffd There are few trade unions in \u2018women's industries\u2019 and this ultimately contributes to women's powerlessness in paid labour. \ufffd Because of their powerlessness, women get few promotion opportunities and may suffer sexual harassment as well. 317 SPC 2004. 318 Fiji Islands Bureau of Statistics, Category: Labour Supply, Date: 04/04/07. 319 Hughes and Sodhi 2008, 15. 320 Jalal 1998, Chapter 11. 321 Hughes and Sodhi 2008, 15. 322 CEDAW Committee 2005. 323 Jalal 1998, 506. 93 Legal impediments and omissions in employment If gender discrimination, whether legislative, interpretive or by omission in employment, is a key impediment to women\u2019s unequal voice, lack of power, and economic development in the region, what role has the law played in reinforcing that discrimination; or can the law play a role in removing those impediments and altering the outcome of women\u2019s participation rates in paid employment? The Pacific Island region has very little legislative protection for all workers in general, let alone women. The existing legislation is largely inadequate and not properly enforced. The main form of gender discrimination is that of discrimination by omission because the work typically done by women is not covered by legislation. Article 11 of CEDAW requires States Parties to eliminate gender discrimination in the area of employment and to pass laws that protect the employment rights of women in labour legislation. Fiji\u2019s human rights legislation324 contains specific grounds of unlawful discrimination found at section 38 of the Constitution, in the areas of employment, professional accreditation, training, the provision of goods, services or facilities, public access, land, housing or other accommodation and education. No other PICT has similar legislation. Legal restrictions on the type of work that women do A number of countries in the region restrict women\u2019s employment choices, banning them from night work, and from certain industries such as working in mines325 and, in Samoa and Papua New Guinea, women are also prohibited from undertaking manual work.326 Although the Fiji Ministry for Employment still has the discretion to impose limitations on the types of work that women do, it removed the limitations from the legislation some years ago, in response to lobbying from women\u2019s organisations.327 Women\u2019s work choices are not legally restricted in Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia, and in the Marshall Islands. However it should be noted that none of these countries has yet put in place legislative mechanisms to protect the employment and labour rights of workers other than in the Public Service.328 Protectionist policies that attempt to limit women\u2019s choices of employment, although seemingly well meaning, limit women\u2019s choices to earn an income as they choose and to have independence and control over their lives.

It is noteworthy, that in ratifying CEDAW, the Federated States of Micronesia reserved on pay equity and maternity leave with pay,330 indicating by reservation that it was not yet prepared to improve women\u2019s rights in the workplace. No PICT has specific health protections for pregnant workers. Most provide for paid maternity leave in varying degrees to female civil servants, by legislation or policy, but not to women working in the private sector. Women in the private sector have to rely on private arrangements, union negotiated maternity leave, or the generosity of employers. However, none of the nine countries examined by the CEDAW legislative indicators study, meet the standards of 14 weeks paid maternity leave recommended by CEDAW and the International Labour Organisation (the ILO recommends a period of 14 weeks maternity leave and CEDAW recommends that it be paid).331 Many countries provide breastfeeding mothers with thirty minute breaks twice daily by law except the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Samoa. No PICT has state funded childcare facilities. The Marshall Islands does not provide for paid maternity leave nor does it provide for protection against dismissal during pregnancy or for unpaid leave taken for maternity reasons. It is left to negotiation with employer.332 Equal conditions of work Men and women generally enjoy the same conditions of work in the formal unionised work sector. However, since the majority of work that women do is in the informal sector, they are not covered by legislation at all. For example domestic work, casual work, part time work, outwork and other forms of informal work are not covered by any legislation, and in fact, are specifically excluded from protection in most PICTs. In much of the region women are engaged in home gardens.333 Papua New Guinea has a curious provision that states that if a woman is the \u2018breadwinner\u2019, she is entitled to the same rights as men in the public service.334 The majority of PICTs do not have equal pay legislation. However, Papua New Guinea legislation states that if an employer fails to pay a female employee the same wages for work of the same kind at the same level it is an offence.335 Samoa, Kiribati and Vanuatu336 provide for some degree of equal pay legislation. Palau passed a minimum wage law in 1998 but the large numbers of foreign workers (6,000) are not covered.337 Protection from sexual harassment Harassment at work is a major impediment to women\u2019s participation in the formal and informal workforce and is largely unreported because it is difficult to prove, and there is no specific legal protection. 330 Ibid. 331 Ibid. 332 Ibid. 333 Hughes and Sodhi, 2008 334 Public Service General Order 20 63-71, UNIFEM Pacific 2006, 283. 335 Section 97, Employment Act 1978. 336 Samoa Labour & Employment Act 1972 s19; Kiribati Labour Act, Cap 73 1960 s30; Vanuatu Employment Act Cap 160 1983 s8(1); UNIFEM Pacific 2006 344. 337 USA, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2006. 95 Sexual harassment of women in the workplace is significant In a survey commissioned by the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement, a staggering one in three women interviewed (thirty-three per cent) claimed to have been sexually harassed in the workplace during their working life (see Table 20).

Specific legal protection from sexual harassment is absent in most PICTs although some countries recognise blatant forms of sexual harassment which involve outrageous indecent behaviour such as deliberate exposure of genital organs in criminal legislation. Criminal remedies are not adequate to address the range of unwanted behaviour that women experience in the workplace.339 Human rights legislation in Fiji makes sexual harassment a civil offence by providing that \u2018\u2026sexual harassment, for the purposes of this section, constitutes harassment by reason of a prohibited ground of discrimination\u2019. No other PICT has specific civil laws against sexual harassment, although Papua New Guinea\u2019s code applying only to government civil servants, provides that dismissal may result from an act of sexual harassment.340 338 Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement 200 (sample size 550). 339 UNIFEM Pacific 2007. 340 Public Service General Order 15.59.20.73 cited in UNIFEM Pacific 2006, 284. 96 Sexual harassment lawsuits are virtually unheard of in the Pacific region. However in a recent case in Tuvalu, an unfair dismissal case, filed on the basis of an unrecognised offence of sexual harassment was dealt with as a matter of common law (see Box 31). Box 31. Challenging sexual harassment in Tuvalu - Katea v Niutao Kaupule & Satupa341 There is no criminal or civil law offence for sexual harassment in Tuvalu so the plaintiff (K) sought damages for the tort of sexual assault and breach of her constitutional rights against the defendants (NK and S). The Niutao Kaupule (NK) is a traditional local island council. K was appointed as a clerk for the NK and her superior was the second defendant (S). In 2001, S began sexually harassing K and continued to the extent that S approached K at home asking her for sexual intercourse. In 2002, K was allowed Christmas leave only after she consented to have sexual intercourse with S upon her return. After her leave she told S that there was no possible way she would agree. In 2003, after she had taken two days off to look after her sick daughter, K received a letter of dismissal from S for lack of competence. The defendants filed a joint statement of defence denying all the allegations of sexual harassment, but admitted to improper procedure in the termination of K\u2019s employment. The court held that there was enough evidence to prove the sexual assault and that the defendants were liable for unfair dismissal. The tort protected individuals not only from physical harm, but also from any interference with his or her person that was offensive to a person with a reasonable sense of honour and dignity. Consequently, both NK and S were liable for assault and for unlawful dismissal. Sex discrimination legislation needed Most countries in the region do not have specific sex or gender discrimination legislation in the area of employment, apart from general constitutional safeguards against sex discrimination in some PICTs as mentioned previously (see Table 21). However, Fiji does prohibit unfair discrimination on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation and disability in the area of employment in its Human Rights Commission Act,342 but not in its employment legislation; Papua New Guinea on the grounds of sex only,343 and the Federated States of Micronesia makes sex discrimination in employment unlawful in the public service, but not in the private sector.344 Table 21.

Or do the laws and social forces combine to weaken their status or to make them sink deeper into poverty? There is no perfect legislation in the arena of human relationships. However gender equality based family law can do much to diminish the worst impacts of women sinking into poverty, or deeper poverty following separation or divorce. Anecdotal evidence, supported by NGO reports346 throughout the Pacific, suggests that the largest numbers of the new poor consist of separated, divorced or single women with children. Arguably, the laws on the family (closely linked to domestic violence laws) affect the largest numbers of women and children in the region. At the time of the passing of the new law in Fiji 2003, there were FJD 8 million in arrears of court ordered un-enforced maintenance owed women and children.347 Family law in most PICTs is archaic and based on outdated colonial legislation. The legislation, common law and legal practices are discriminatory against women and legitimate violence against women. Rigid concepts of women\u2019s roles within the family are the basis for how laws have been devised and interpreted. Divorce in most cases cannot be obtained without proving fault (including proof of habitual or persistent cruelty for a specified period over 2-3 years), and women\u2019s adultery is often held against them when they seek custody or contact with their children, maintenance and matrimonial property. In much of Melanesia, the payment of \u2018bride price\u2019 by the husband\u2019s family to the wife\u2019s family is used to justify domestic violence, and to secure rights to custody over children and to some extent also, property. In most PICTs, there is no legislation granting equal rights to property after divorce, and distribution is generally based on the principle of financial contribution, thus disentitling the vast majority of Pacific Island women and greatly increasing their own and dependant children\u2019s likelihood of living in poverty. Article 16 of CEDAW obliges States Parties to remove discrimination against women in family law including; marriage, separation, divorce, child custody, property division, paternity and inheritance. Currently almost all PICTs, with the exception of Fiji, are in violation of Article 16. Minimum legal age and consent to marriage The age of 18 is regarded as the appropriate minimum age for the law to permit marriage under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.348 Most PICTs, except for Kiribati, allow marriage for ages ranging from between 14 to 16 for females with parental consent, and 16 to 18 for males, including the Micronesian states of Kosrae, Chuuk and Pohnpei.349 Niue 346 As told to the writer 2005-8. 347 As told to Commissioner Imrana Jalal then of the Fiji Law Reform Commission by court officials, October 2003. 348 Under the CRC Art 1 a person under 18 is a child.

Given that the vast reach of the population in Papua New Guinea is far away from the formal courts, this presents serious problems for protecting the rights of young females. Marrying without parental consent is possible after at least one, or in some cases, both, have reached the age of 21. In Niue marrying without parental consent is possible when the male is 21, and female, 19.353 In some PICTs permission must be sought from both parents to marry at certain ages,354 in others, one of the parents,355 and in some, the father\u2019s consent in prioritised over that of the mother.356 Where the legislation prioritises the consent of the father it has the effect of reinforcing stereotypes, about men as breadwinners and heads of household.357 Custom and religious marriage Most PICTs do not recognise customary, polygamous or religious marriages which have not been formally registered or conducted in compliance with marriage legislation. The formal legislation in most countries forbids multiple forms of marriage, historically accepted in most parts of the Pacific, until the widespread acceptance of Christianity. However, custom marriages are recognised in Palau\u2019s Code,358 in the Federated States of Micronesia states of Chuuk and Pohnpei,359 and in many parts of Melanesia. Some 27 per cent of Fijian Muslims also enter into nikah without ever legalising their marriages.360 Unfortunately, because the formal law does not recognise religious marriage in Fiji, a woman who participates in such a marriage does not have the normal protection of the law.361 De facto marriages De facto marriages, in which a man and a woman live together in a domestic relationship as husband and wife, are different from customary marriages. Customary marriages are recognised by law, but de facto and religious marriages are not. In a custom marriage, there is usually some form of customary ceremony or ritual in which the parties participate. There may be no legal requirements, but there are customary practices that must be complied with, before the tribe or community will accept that the parties are married, including, the payment of bride price, the giving of other gifts, feasting and the like. Melanesian countries recognise customary marriages as valid marriages.362 However, no PICT formally recognises de facto 350 Section 525, Niue Act 1966. 351 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, 57. 352 Even Palau is 16 for females and 18 for males.

The consequence of this is that many women find themselves without a home, matrimonial property and financial support at the end of a de facto marriage. Legal recognition of custom marriages or de facto marriages is important because a number of legal rights, for both women and children, flow from that recognition. Divorce If parties have been married in custom, their divorce must also take place according to custom, except in the states of Yap and Pohnpei, in the Federated States of Micronesia.363 If that marriage has been registered, the divorce under the formal system must also take place. The existence of both formal and customary systems of law may put women at a disadvantage because a man may marry a woman in custom and then marry another under the formal system. There are no rules preventing this. The effects of religious or custom divorce on Pacific women need more research both at local and national level. There are many unnecessary anachronistic, technical and burdensome rules that mar the laws on divorce and have a disproportionate impact on women.364 However of all the strict rules, the burden of fault-based divorce has the most disproportionate impact on women. Most PICTs have a fault-based, undignified divorce system, including all the states of the Federated States of Micronesia, which requires the party alleging divorce to blame the breakdown of marriage on one party, and then prove it, with objective evidence.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4db0d2b-89fa-438a-a652-4cf94fcfa5f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4db0d2b-89fa-438a-a652-4cf94fcfa5f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c7b640a9adbb804aeaf6a98e6f3cdbe3d94cca3ccb3d6948d1cc750f7595724"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ece2bc2-b7a7-4ad4-b33e-2e6a495ef490", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eecc797368aa9df2d9b8af8f88c314efedb8b883b07b24c064d71dcae5492411"}}, "hash": "2d03e168c50a01a41d2c6528ac903503d3c48c983cf40876618001f191dc99fb", "text": "The divorce grounds shared by many countries include adultery, desertion for a required number of years, willful refusal to consummate the marriage, habitual cruelty, rape, sodomy and bestiality by the husband, habitual drunkardness, a criminal conviction accompanied by leaving a wife without financial support for a specified number of years, imprisonment for a specified number of years, attempt to kill or commit grievous", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2398753-0ebc-4c90-af75-42de23c24f3e": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2398753-0ebc-4c90-af75-42de23c24f3e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ea51d5924814e7c6b72be6f78eab62c2adffc83784be276b63bd53e79388df30"}, "3": {"node_id": "d49f20fb-4668-4810-8877-a5773611c069", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07c0df0fe7f3ae47db4a592db2e674a185b4dd498683ec9ad424ac065ca38b1b"}}, "hash": "5862dad4863599ec5e6ceeaac56cf144feb5061c872be80ae234bfb5a148e75d", "text": "bodily harm on the petitioner (the spouse seeking the divorce), insanity if accompanied by institutionalisation of a spouse for a specified number of years (2-4) and the presumption of death. Some countries also allow divorce on the anachronistic ground of failing to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights either through the common law365 or through legislation as in Papua New Guinea.366 The PNG legislation states that a divorce may be granted: (k) that the other party to the marriage has, for a period of not less than one year immediately preceding the date of the petition, failed to comply with a decree of restitution of conjugal rights made under this Act; This marital remedy allows the spouse being deserted to seek a court order requiring the deserting spouse to return to the marital home. In the event of failure to comply with the order the requesting spouse may obtain a divorce. Such grounds can be a license for continued domestic violence. 363 UNIFEM Pacific 2006, 57. 364 For a full discussion see Jalal 1998, Chapters 7-12. 365 Jalal 1998 in Kiribati, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu by common law. 366 For example section 17 Matrimonial Causes Act 1963 (PNG). 103 Some countries have grounds that are specific only to that country or a few, such as divorce being available on the grounds of a spouse having an incurable disease in Tonga; venereal disease, epilepsy, duress or mistake in Kiribati; murder conviction or judicial separation by agreement in Cooks Islands; leprosy of one spouse in Palau367, Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands; and personal indignities that make life burdensome and intolerable in Palau.368 There are only a few PICTs that have gender specific divorce grounds including a wife\u2019s drunkardness and neglect of domestic duties in Samoa and Niue369 and the wife being artificially inseminated by the sperm of another man in Cook Islands and Niue.370 All of the fault-based grounds require the hiring of lawyers, court cases to be filed and witnesses to be brought to court to provide supporting evidence. Although most grounds are gender-neutral they place enormous burdens on women, particularly poor and rural women, who have little access to the courts or women who wish to escape from domestic violence. The burden of fault-based divorce further humiliates not only women, but men as well, allowing them little opportunity to escape unhappy marriages with some measure of dignity and privacy. The requirements which place battered women in the invidious position of having to wait three to five years before becoming eligible to divorce, because of the difficulties of providing \u2018objective evidence\u2019 to prove domestic violence, is tantamount to a further sentence of wife-beating. In Tokelau, the scope of cruelty extends uniquely to cruelty committed also against the child of the applicant.371 In all countries with a fault-based system there is a duty on the court to promote reconciliation and forgiveness by the injured spouse. This can include the restoration of marital rights and might prevent a divorce from taking place.372 The duty to promote reconciliation also neglects to take into account possible power disparities between the spouses, the significant financial, customary, family and community pressure that may be placed on a woman and the possible existence of violence against the wife. The only PICTs with divorce regimes that are commonly regarded as having some semblance of no-fault grounds are: separation for one year in Fiji, non-compatibility in Kiribati and \u2018unreasonable behaviour\u2019 in Tonga. The countries that provide longer periods of separation are not really \u2018no fault\u2019 countries because the onerous burden of proof in fault based grounds is similar to requiring longer periods of separation before a spouse becomes eligible for divorce. Most countries, except Fiji, are therefore non-compliant with Article 16 of CEDAW which requires no fault divorce regimes to bring about substantive equality. Custody and guardianship of children In theory there is formal legal equality between men and women in obtaining custody and guardianship of children following separation or divorce.

The latter language is more capable of being misinterpreted and affected by gender discriminatory attitudes about women\u2019s roles and responsibilities by judicial officials and those who administer traditional courts, because it gives courts a greater degree of judicial discretion.374 It is widely believed that women get custody of their children. This is not accurate in many PICTs.375 Many factors operate in concert to affect women\u2019s equal capacity to be given custody. If parents negotiate an agreement it is more likely that mothers get custody by consensus; but if there is a dispute, which ends up in litigation in court, fathers have a significantly better chance of getting custody. This is because men are generally better financially situated than women, and the \u2018best interests principle\u2019 can be interpreted in light of this, implying better home conditions, financial advantage for the children and so on. Women suffer distinct disadvantages primarily due to their lack of financial independence, land rights and access to shelter, equal right to matrimonial property and limited capacity to enforce maintenance awards. In summary, women\u2019s lack of legal and economic rights in other areas affects their capacity to obtain custody of their children. Adequate financial support is critical to enable women to care for their children. In addition, if women commit adultery, judicial attitudes are often that \u2018immoral\u2019 women are not capable of being good mothers. The same behaviour by men, rarely affects their capacity to obtain custody.376 Effect of custom law on custody and the payment of bride price in Melanesia In Melanesia the custom of bride price practice may affect a woman\u2019s right to obtain custody of her children. It is a widely held customary belief that the payment of bride price by the husband\u2019s family to the wife\u2019s family secures the right to custody of the children following separation of the parents, as well as all right to common matrimonial property. This custom is generally respected in the vast majority of cases that never reach the courts, seriously disadvantaging women. However in the few cases that have reached the formal courts of law, there have been some attempts to mitigate this custom practice using the best interests of the child principle.377 In Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia also, the legislation specifically allows custom law to be applied in cases affecting the right to custody of children.378 373 Convention on the Rights of the Child. 374 Jalal 1998, 291 (for children born within marriage) and 465 (for children born outside marriage).

Gender discriminatory evidence rules in establishing paternity Evidential burdens are extremely difficult to satisfy. Corroborative evidence is required either through legislation or common law to prove fatherhood. In most countries, there is no legislation requiring alleged fathers to submit to compulsory blood tests for blood or DNA testing. The courts do not allow assumptions about liability to be made, when a man accused of fathering a child refuses to submit to a blood test. In Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, a magistrate may refuse to accept an application for maintenance if the mother\u2019s morals are questionable or \u2018during the normal period of conception the mother was of notorious loose behaviour\u2019.380 In addition, unmarried women claiming maintenance may be subjected to questioning about their sexual conduct with men other than the alleged father, in trials somewhat similar to the questioning of rape complainants during sexual assault trials.

In Fiji until the passing of the Family Law Act 2003, the High Court ruled twice, in Subhaigam v Rakoso & Permalamma382 and Ravula v Evanson383 that although the common law appeared biased against the fathers of natural children in custody and access disputes, its hands were tied until such time that the legislature saw fit to improve the rights of men by amending existing common law.384 These cases are arguably clear cases of bias against men but at that time the laws in Fiji were heavily weighted against women, and this law was regarded by women\u2019s groups as one of the few laws in their favour, and not to be amended until all forms of legal discrimination were removed against women. Tuvalu and Kiribati have the most restrictive and direct gender discriminatory laws regarding custody over such children. The legislation in both requires that natural children be given to 379 Jalal 1998, Chapter 12, 450-497. 380 Section 4(a), 6(5) Maintenance of Children Act Cap. 46 (Vanuatu). 381 Author\u2019s personal knowledge from conducting years of trials in Fiji and observing court cases in other countries. 382 Civil Appeal 1/1987. 383 Civil Appeal no 13/1992. 384 Jalal, 1998, 460. 106 their fathers, if paternity is accepted, on reaching the age of two.385 This is supposedly to ensure the right of the children to the father\u2019s land. The legislation is thus a double-edged sword. On the one hand it allows natural children to claim rights to their father\u2019s land but on the other hand women give up the right to care for their children. If however women had equal rights to land in Kiribati and Tuvalu, losing custody of children would not be an issue.386 In Palau,387 the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia there appears to be a dearth of legislation covering the rights of natural children. The Micronesian legislation appears to give an unmarried mother the right to apply for a paternity order and financial support, but provides no other legislative guidelines leaving it to the court to exercise a wide degree of discretion.388 In the Marshall Islands, the legislation is silent about children born to unmarried mothers.389 Financial support and matrimonial property rights Financial support for women and children after separation or divorce A significant factor affecting women\u2019s capacity to survive separation, divorce and domestic violence, and to prevent sinking into poverty (or deeper poverty and sometimes prostitution if they are poor women), is the law affecting maintenance and matrimonial property in the Pacific. The specific problems stem from limiting those who are eligible for maintenance, the conditions upon which maintenance is awarded, the enforcement of maintenance orders when payment is not made and the legal basis for the distribution of matrimonial property. The majority of PICTs are not in compliance with Article 16 of CEDAW, except for Fiji, which has a new, fair and just legislative regime for maintenance and property. However, enforcement of maintenance is still a problem in Fiji due to the inadequate resources given to the new Family Division of the Magistrates\u2019 Court.390 The majority of PICTs have marital legislation providing for the payment of financial support or maintenance following separation or divorce for both the spouse and the children of the marriage. Some provide specifically for spousal and child maintenance391 whilst others state that any person can apply for maintenance against any other person based on customary and legal obligations.392 For example, the liberal provisions in the law of Niue allow any person in the family to apply for maintenance.393 Countries such as Fiji, Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, Tonga and Nauru allow only married persons to apply for maintenance, thus discriminating on the basis of marital status. However, it is arguable whether a court, in a country that allows any person to apply against any other person, would consider the obligation to support a de facto wife a 385 Native Lands Act, Cap. 22 (Tuvalu); Native Lands Act Cap. 61 1957 and section 65(2) Magistrates Court Act Cap. 52 1978 (Kiribati). 386 Jalal 1998, 462. 387 Ntumy 1993, 587.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cfc75dc-1470-4785-b081-f1b6c3885a39": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cfc75dc-1470-4785-b081-f1b6c3885a39", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9be04e7d2bd68cae927ccacc548d735279203b72d53597476f1834fa1a4a29bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "2890621d-6b89-4892-92e1-428d91d47068", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b319326a0d09714415f7b84c7a6d9f00311c8400d7d330cf154b209aa6b19f23"}}, "hash": "9cfeffdb6decba61c6d6a0ff8c0aab24f267b9288ee0628ad41ac58cc327addb", "text": "386 Jalal 1998, 462. 387 Ntumy 1993, 587. 388 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, FSM Code [Title 6, Cap 17, Sub cap 3] s 1751; 389 UNIFEM Pacific 2007, 260.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4b23dfc6-0c1f-439c-b729-1409a2184c48": {"__data__": {"id_": "4b23dfc6-0c1f-439c-b729-1409a2184c48", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15bd5b037faba5e185769b4a2312a41b5c9d59fe92d48228a9efb00556baf2cb"}}, "hash": "15bd5b037faba5e185769b4a2312a41b5c9d59fe92d48228a9efb00556baf2cb", "text": "390 Personal knowledge of the author 391 Fiji, Solomon Islands. 392 Tuvalu, Kiribati, Cooks Islands, Samoa. 393 Sections 548-579 Niue Act 1966. 107 customary obligation. Likely, women all over the Pacific whose marriages are not legally recognised, suffer a similar fate regardless of the legislation. The basis for awarding maintenance Equality standards require that maintenance awards should be based on need, the financial commitments of both parents, their respective capacities to earn and the needs of the children. Comprehensive guidelines are specifically stated in Fiji\u2019s Family Law Act.394 Owing to the fact that no other PICT provides guidelines for the amount of maintenance to be calculated, most courts award grossly inadequate amounts of maintenance, rarely based on reason. The lack of adequate guidelines in the legislation causes great economic injustice to women, and their children. The moral conduct of the parties ought not to be relevant to payment. Notwithstanding, some countries require the proving of fault on the part of their spouse (most commonly the husband) to obtain spousal support. Countries with a fault-based spousal maintenance regime include Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and to a lesser extent Tonga. The Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, by allowing a broad discretionary basis for maintenance to be awarded, open the door for conduct to be considered. If a wife has committed adultery she is unlikely to obtain spousal support from her husband or if she has been receiving maintenance it will cease upon proof of \u2018adultery\u2019. Spousal support is thus tied to sexual fidelity even after separation and divorce in Nauru, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu either in the legislation or under the common law or by practice. In Nauru the legislation also disqualifies a wife who is a \u2018drunk\u2019 from receiving maintenance. 395 Vanuatu, and to a lesser extent Palau, have the most restrictive and difficult maintenance regimes. Vanuatu requires a woman and children who have been deserted by the husband/father to first secure a criminal conviction for desertion against him and then to use that criminal conviction to obtain a maintenance order in the civil courts.396 Palau\u2019s law decrees that the spouse at fault has to pay financial support for the children until they reach eighteen years of age.397 Both countries place onerous financial burdens on women, especially poor women, by making financial support for women and children dependant on proving fault, given the difficult evidential burdens. Enforcement of financial orders A significant problem in all PICTs is enforcing maintenance awards, partially because there is a historic reluctance to imprison for non-payment of maintenance. At one time in Fiji, prior to the passing of the new family law, 50 per cent of maintenance awards were not paid nor enforced, a further 35 per cent of orders were enforcement intermittently and only 15 per cent of fathers paid maintenance regularly under maintenance orders.398 This is not uncommon throughout the region as inadequate human and financial resources are committed to enforcement systems. There has been no research done to determine the effect of the new maintenance regime in Fiji. Samoa has a reasonable maintenance framework. The legislation provides for the appointment of a special maintenance officer to recover arrears, and allows a 394 Section 157. 395 Section 5 (6) Maintenance of Wives & Children Ordinance 1959-1967. 396 Niurrie v Niurrie, Vanuatu, Supreme Court Civil Appeal 7/1996. 397 Palau National Code 1985, Title 21, Ntumy 1993, 587. 398 Personal knowledge of the author as told to her by court officials in 2003. 108 maintenance order to be a charge on real or personal property. A receiver can be appointed to execute the charge to enforce maintenance. The charging order gives women an equitable charge over their husband's property to enforce maintenance in case of default and his chattels, land and goods can be sold to pay off arrears. Matrimonial property rights The economic rights of women are affected by their limited land rights, unjust matrimonial property laws, the unwillingness of the courts to award appropriate amounts of maintenance and the lack of resources allocated to the enforcement of it. In the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau, complex customary inheritance laws govern the ownership of land. For example, Palau has no legislation for dealing with personal property, and all land is governed by custom or the common law of United States as applied by the courts. Disputes over ownership of traditional Palauan money are settled by custom.399 As stated earlier, Tongan laws are defined by the constitution and are both patriarchal and patrilineal.

Generally both legal regimes are based on financial contributions. For example in the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia, property division upon divorce, like maintenance, is determined on the basis of \u2018justice\u2019 and \u2018the best interests of all\u2019.400 The interpretation of such broad provisions is generally taken to mean, that distribution of property will be based on actual financial contribution to the accumulation of family finances and property. This presents the single most important legal impediment to women claiming a fair share of matrimonial property, namely that women\u2019s unpaid work and non-financial contribution is not legally recognised as contribution deserving of the right to share in property following divorce. Tongan legislation allows for a lump sum to be paid to either party. Although this is more relevant to the question of maintenance, it has been used to make settlements of matrimonial property under the constructive trust principle.401 No country apart from Fiji clearly states in its legislation that women are entitled to an equal share of property after divorce based on principles of equality (see Boxes 32 and 33). The main principle upon which distribution is based is financial contribution, thus disentitling the vast majority of women who are engaged in the informal economy, agriculture and fishing. Society and custom decree that once women marry, they accept the responsibility of doing \u2018women's work\u2019. In the Pacific, most women are engaged in unpaid labour, or in home gardens. However unpaid work or non-financial contribution is generally not regarded as the basis of entitlement. In General Recommendation 21, the CEDAW Committee states that the division of marital property should include recognition of non-financial contributions during a marriage such as, raising children, caring for elderly relatives, and discharging household duties. 399 Ntumy 1993, 588. 400 UNIFEM Pacific 2006. 401 Section 15 Divorce Act Cap.29 (Tonga); Divorce Amendment Act 1988 (Tonga) No 39/1988. 109 Box 32. Making Unpaid domestic responsibilities and non-Financial contribution count \u2013 Fiji\u2019s Family Law Act 2003 In late 2008, a Fiji court ruled on the issue of a homemakers\u2019 contribution under the new law. In Khan v Nisha402 the court took into account the assessment under the relevant provisions of the contributions made by the parties in their respective capacities \u2013 as \u2018breadwinner\u2019 or \u2018principal breadwinner\u2019 and \u2018homemaker\u2019 or \u2018principal homemaker\u2019 (together with financial contributions) over a period of some 37 years of marriage. The Court gave the wife what appeared to be almost half of the marital assets. This is a landmark ruling in Fiji, and for the Pacific in general, demonstrating the potential benefits of sound legislation. Box 33. Gender equality in Fiji \u2013 the Family Law Act 2003403 Only in Fiji has there been a concerted attempt to change family law. The resulting law, the Family Law Act 2003, which is based on the no-fault principle of divorce, utilises a non- adversarial counseling system and a specialist Family Division of the Court which prioritises children\u2019s needs and parental support. It removes all forms of formal legal and financial discrimination against women and grants them rights to enforceable custody and financial support for them and their children. It legitimates and requires recognition and implementation of the major human rights United Nation conventions affecting family law, especially CEDAW and the CRC.404 From early results it appears that the new Act will substantially reduce the costly use of lawyers and Legal Aid.405 Initial research, based on a one-year study of the new law in operation406, indicates that family law litigation had been reduced by about 90 per cent. Most disputes, (especially those regarding children), at Suva Court, were settled by counselors and conciliators, on average, after three sessions with trained counselors. These results have not been published, as the officials need to do a more stringent follow-up survey. The problems with the implementation of the new law are: - Most of the positive results are from Suva, the capital city with the largest population, and the only center with a dedicated family court. - There are insufficient resources to implement the Act properly outside Suva. - Only Suva has a good complement of court counselors to settle disputes without litigation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec930d46-1436-4840-bdbb-a52ef64333b7": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec930d46-1436-4840-bdbb-a52ef64333b7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "847e18dbeefc1846855577f9db0c4b3fdd7606fab1c662da8eb723e5837ee2c1"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d027b3f-8424-4751-8e45-5ebb8237c087", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c609a4776462690b5903a52b7138abea4f810af4c982fc57b97a5a5ea2ae73c"}}, "hash": "2ad992a6de2ee743734e890be9485eb37c645cc1f2a296d372812e8b885fda4e", "text": "- Only Suva has a good complement of court counselors to settle disputes without litigation. - The magistrates and lawyers are still caught up in the former \u2018blaming\u2019 culture of the old legislation, especially the older lawyers who cannot get their heads around solving problems without fighting, for instance over children.

The legal system, as it exists in most Pacific Island countries, is inappropriate for family cases. The fault-based divorce process hurts all parties. Most grounds of divorce are framed in gender-neutral language but women find it more difficult to escape unhappy marriages than men do, because of the burdens of proof, social pressure, waiting long periods to qualify for legitimate divorce and limited access to funds, advice and legal representation (see Table 22). 111 Table 22: Selected Family Legislation and Common Law affecting women\u2019s rights to equality in family law.

They have been able to mobilize politically, and utilize key trust relationships, developed in and outside government, to mentor and guide champions within Parliament. Positive legal changes in the Pacific have arisen mainly by way of litigation with new legal precedents being established in the courts, as a result of the advocacy of feminist and human rights lawyers, rather than through legislative change.408 Although this is far from ideal, as precedents can be reversed by superior courts, it is legal activism in the courts, and not legislative change, which has borne the greatest success in improving legal protections for woman and girls. Changing all the laws that affect women, without concomitant changes in other areas, is not sufficient to advance women\u2019s rights to justice in every sphere. An integrated approach is critical as advancement in one area promotes advancement in another. Any strategy to overcome their systemic disadvantage must be multi-sectoral and across disciplines otherwise amendments to existing legislation run the risk of further oppressing women. If for example, all legislation was amended to bring about equal rights for women, granting them formal legal equality, but the women from the outer islands have no access to the courts, nor the finances to employ lawyers to represent them what good are new laws to them? However, given the appropriate milieu, the law can play a catalytic role in improving women\u2019s status and enabling women as a group to equally enjoy the benefits of human development. There is an unequivocal link between the law and human development, particularly women\u2019s human development. The combined impact of the laws, written and unwritten, formal and customary, case law, and legal practices and rules have a significant impact on Pacific Island women, and through them, on the lives of their children and families. Their legal status in formal and customary law in the Pacific, in every area: constitutional and politico-legal, gender-based violence law, education and employment, family law and land rights, has a combined disproportionate influence on human development. Changed, improved, enforceable laws combined with adequate resources to properly resource them; and gender and human rights training for law agency officials, can make an overall, critical difference to the lives of women, and therefore to human development. Substance, structure and culture of the law and the strategies to address them The approaches recommended in this chapter do not address any particular area of law, but rather all areas of law. Some countries may determine that employment, family or gender- based violence laws might be the first step because of their closer links to poverty. Other countries may consider that constitutional issues need to be addressed first, because any form of discrimination, including economic gender injustice, can be then challenged on the grounds that they violate constitutional standards of equality. For example, it is more strategic for Kiribati NGOs to work on changing the constitutional definition of discrimination to include sex and gender discrimination because it is an obstacle to changes 408 Jalal and Madraiwiwi 2005. 119 in every sector. The choice of which laws or policies are targeted are often determined by national priorities or key political entry points that opportunistically present themselves. Notwithstanding the choices, an in-depth analysis is required, otherwise there is the risk that the measures adopted either increase gender injustice or fail to be effective because, for example, resources or training were not properly considered. This will involve understanding the exact nature of the discrimination and choosing the correct strategy to address it.409 There are three basic elements of the law that might inform the analysis, with each element requiring different approaches or a combination of approaches: a. The substance (content) of the law: the legislation, the common law and customary law, as well as legal practices, procedures and rules. b. The structures of the law: the courts, court administration and law enforcement agencies. c. The context and culture in which the law operates: the social conditions, economic conditions and attitudes of judges, magistrates, lawyers, court officials, police and agencies and of people in the community as a whole. If the problem is one of the substance or content of the law then the strategy that ought to be adopted is a legislative strategy of changing the offending legislation. A litigation strategy or a test case to obtain a new precedent or interpretation of existing law may also affect the substance of the law. If the problem is one of structure, for example, a lack of access to courts or inadequate resources to properly enforce laws, then the problem might", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f51da346-3b31-4a7a-ad41-dbe1b48a1734": {"__data__": {"id_": "f51da346-3b31-4a7a-ad41-dbe1b48a1734", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/14", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/14", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65c99918ab5862305bb29040d1372ecafdc32781cd00b667315ff80f43a59925"}}, "hash": "65c99918ab5862305bb29040d1372ecafdc32781cd00b667315ff80f43a59925", "text": "be addressed by providing access or better human and financial resources.

Source: author Litigation strategies In many instances where lawyers have been trained to submit human rights arguments, rather than purely technical legal ones, there have been innovative and creative interpretations of the law. A test case litigation strategy might be an initial approach to obtain more positive interpretations of existing law to obtain a new precedent. There is no history of public interest litigation or class actions in the Pacific but there are no legal impediments to adopting such approaches. However, new precedents are vulnerable to being reversed by superior courts and a legislative strategy might be necessary to secure more sustainable laws. This happened in Kiribati, when the prosecutors failed to outlaw the discriminatory corroboration rule in the law of evidence through a litigation strategy. It necessitated a legislative approach eventuating in the passing of the Evidence Amendment Act 2003. Litigation strategies require gender and human rights training for lawyers and judicial officials; and funds for legal expenses to pay for either pro bono lawyers and/or active NGOs willing to mobilise around the issues (see Box 34), as did ni-Vanuatu NGOs in several court actions (see Table 24). Box 34. Legal aid in the Pacific Law measures designed to protect have often not been accompanied by measures designed to empower and many women have neither the knowledge nor the means to bring their cases to court. There is limited usefulness in creating new legislation if women do not have the financial means to enforce those laws due to legal expenses. Some PICTs have legal aid services ranging from rudimentary to formalised. Without exception all are inadequately resourced, both in terms of human and financial resources. This is a critical issue which needs to be addressed through legislation establishing comprehensive legal aid services, and human and financial resources to make it effective.

Even if attitudes resist change, the legislation may force outward behavioral change. Comprehensive, all-encompassing legislation should be designed not only to protect and enforce, but also to empower. Legislative strategies require the expertise of lawyers who are also gender or human rights specialists fully aware of the multiple forms of discrimination faced by women, and the local, textured conditions of women\u2019s lives.

The final step is ensuring that sufficient resources are allocated to make the law effective. A critical step is gender training for all those involved in implementing the new law. Changing legislation is a long-term process. The Fiji Family Law Act took over 13 years from the conception of the campaign, to the passing of the new law. Great tenacity and a combination of political and people skills are necessary, as well as strategic partnerships between various stakeholders, in civil society and government. Although achieving legislative change can be long-winded it can be fast-tracked given the right combination of political and economic opportunities and skills, as well as a propitious convergence of circumstances. Legislative reform is critical to achieve gender justice in the region. These should be combined with the strategies suggested in Table 23. The following key policy and legislative changes shown in Table 25 are needed. Table 25. Key legislative and legal policy changes recommended Constitutional Change Constitutions to be amended to ensure the right to substantive equality in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution. It is critical that women\u2019s rights to equality are secured in the Constitution itself and not only in other subordinate legislation so that it is difficult to change it. Constitutions be amended to state that where there is a conflict between women\u2019s rights to equality and custom, the former should prevail. For example the draft proposed in the proposed Solomon Island Draft Constitution would rule out any ambiguity: Where there is a conflict between customary laws or practices and women\u2019s right to equality under this Constitution or any other law, 122 women\u2019s right to equality shall prevail.410 Constitutions to be amended to make human rights in the constitution specifically apply to the private sector as well as the public sector, without ambiguity, for example, \u2018This Bill of Rights applies equally to all citizens including the public and private sector\u2019 or words to that effect. Constitutions and legislation to be amended to remove citizenship discrimination against women and their children and to make it unlawful to provide an exception on the grounds of custom. Constitutions to be amended to clearly and unequivocally provide for temporary special measures to promote the advancement of disadvantaged groups including, and specifically, women. A good starting point could be electoral quotas in national legislatures for women. All countries need to pass specific legislation such as Fiji\u2019s Social Justice Act but specifically targeting women, as well as other marginalized groups. All Constitutions need amendments to make it explicit that international human rights law shall apply to domestic law where relevant. The Fiji example is a good starting point. Legal anti-discriminations provisions are inadequate in all countries to protect women from discrimination on the grounds of gender and all need strengthening to varying degrees. For example, only in Fiji are indirect forms of discrimination explicitly recognised and protected, yet the vast forms of discrimination experienced by women fall into this category. Constitutions need to be amended include both direct and indirect forms of discrimination. Constitutions to be amended to include all forms of discrimination, including \u2018indirect\u2019, sex or gender discrimination. There are clear gaps in the definitions of discrimination in all PICT constitutions as well as non-compliance with Articles 1 and 2 of CEDAW. They need to be amended, if relevant, to specifically include sex, gender, origin, marital or birth status, sexual orientation, disability and health status to cover the myriad forms of direct and indirect discrimination faced by women, and other disadvantaged groups in the Pacific Islands. Without such amendments, it is impossible to challenge discrimination against women whether in law, policy or practice on constitutional grounds All PICTs need national human rights mechanisms or a regional human rights mechanism for the protection of rights outside the court system. Political Participation Recommendation for protective legislation for NGOs. A vibrant and politically aware civil society is critical as to whether gender justice is achieved and whether women can mobilize politically. Thus advocacy groups with good, fair, legislation to protect them from victimisation, both inside government and outside it, is necessary. The findings on electoral systems and electoral quotas have significant implications for any policy developed to increase the numbers of women in legislatures. The introduction of minimum quotas by legislation, rather than by policy, is essential to achieving substantive equality in this area. 410 Proposed new clause at s. 9(4).

A good starting point is 10% of reserved seats for women. These measures can be temporary for a specified number of elections. More internal democratization of political parties which, may include more internal quotas and affirmative action for women within party structures, needs to be encouraged. Criminal Law/Violence Against Women Comprehensive stand-alone legislation or separate all encompassing integrated legislation is needed to cover all forms of violence against women as recommended by UN DAW,411 rather than piecemeal and band-aid amendments to existing legislation or even legislation addressing single forms of violence, such as domestic violence. Such legislation would cover not only substantive criminal laws but also evidence and civil law approaches on VAW. It would remove all forms of evidentiary discrimination against women such as the corroboration warning and the questioning of a complainant\u2019s past sexual history. This integrated approach is less problematic from a practical perspective; can also include empowering provisions as well as new structural approaches rather than simple protection and punishment approaches. Amendments to sexual assault law must include, but is not limited to the following: 1. The grading of sexual assault to reflect degrees of harm including penetration of all orifices; 2. Expanding the definition of assault to include all forms of sexual assault including assault with an object; 3. Removing the corroboration warning; 4. The removal of the need to demonstrate proof of resistance on the part of the complainant to indicate lack of consent; 5. The forbidding of questions of the complainant\u2019s past sexual history with men other than the accused by the accused person\u2019s lawyer; 6. Allowing the prosecution of marital rape, that is, removing marital immunity and making spouses competent and compellable witnesses; 7. Forbidding the use of ceremonies of forgiveness like the i-bulubulu, to influence prosecution, the trial and sentencing; and 8. The recognition of sexual harassment as a civil offence within the workplace. Specialist units need to be set up within the police force in all countries to deal with VAW. It is likely that a combination of policies and special units will enhance rates of detection and conviction. Amendments to domestic violence law must include but is not limited to the following: 1. Making domestic violence both a specific criminal offence punishable by imprisonment; and a civil offence attracting protection orders; 2. Making prosecution mandatory; 3. Making all forms of marriage legally recognised so that any person in a domestic relationship of some sort is entitled to a protection order; 4. Granting authority to trained \u2018authorised persons\u2019 in remote villages to give special temporary protection orders to women who are being 411 Jalal 2008. 124 beaten; 5. Making it illegal to use culture, custom or the payment of bride price as a defence to a prosecution or the granting of protection orders; 6. Allowing for court orders and hearing dates o be obtained by telephone or fax; 7. Removing various legal impediments which prevent successful prosecution. The Police must have extensive powers to arrest without a warrant. They ought to be able to investigate an offence and charge on the basis of a specific domestic violence offence. As a matter of policy courts should order a minimum 24 hour jail sentence to mitigate the breadwinner argument, or imprison at night only. If it is not possible to amend criminal law it might be more strategic to lobby for legislative protection against domestic violence in family law rather than criminal law, as a first measure. The underlying logic is that because the burden of proof in establishing criminal guilt is much more difficult to establish i.e. beyond reasonable doubt, providing a legislative basis for it in the new family legislation, with its lesser \u201c balance of probabilities\u201d burden of proof, the courts are more likely to grant a protective injunction. The provisions of non-molestation orders have limited usefulness if relatively few people know about it or understand it. Injunctions work only if the law agency officials are sympathetic and understanding and are properly trained to implement new progressive laws. It is necessary for the police and magistrates to change their attitudes towards non-molestation orders and to strictly enforce the law. Law enforcement and the enhancement of legislation and policies will only be achieved with substantial determination by government to provide resources to educate agencies and greatly increase awareness of issues surrounding domestic violence.

Decriminalising of abortion, accompanied by the provision of safe terminations at public hospitals and clinics. Although highly controversial in the Pacific Islands, access to safe abortion is a critical element of women\u2019s access to reproductive health, and therefore their overall health and development. Adultery, witchcraft or sorcery should be removed as a criminal or civil offence. It is selectively enforced against women. Land Law Legislation that explicitly discriminates against women needs amendment, for example, the discrimination in the Tongan Constitution needs to be removed to enable equal inheritance laws. Changing laws and structures to increase women\u2019s access to land as well as file test cases are needed. A possible strategy for a more just political solution to the problem of the distribution of land could include a system of registration of customary land so custom sales of land may be recorded. Constitutions and other land legislation need provisions such as: \u201cPatrilineal and matrilineal customs shall be equally recognized\u201d; \u201cNone of the custom laws, traditions, systems and institutions referred to 125 shall be applied to unfairly discriminate against women; \u201d \u201cWomen are entitled to participate equitably in the planning and decision making processes regarding land.\u201d Health, Education & Employment Law All PICTS need to explicitly recognise the right to health care and specifically access to reproductive health care, and to non-discrimination on the grounds of health status in their constitutions. That legislation specifically and explicitly recognises the right to education, the right to equal access to education and compulsory education up to a specified age for both boys and girls. In order to fully comply with CEDAW, legislation requiring the adoption and implementation of special measures for the advancement of women in education is also necessary. This would legitimate the allocation of larger numbers of scholarships for girls, for example, to narrow the gender gap. As well, a legislative prohibition on the expulsion of pregnant students to ensure that girls are not discriminated against is required. In order to comply with gender equality principles and CEDAW, PICTs must have laws which are implemented and enforced, covering sex discrimination at work, temporary special measures to promote their advancement in the labour force; ensuring that women\u2019s work is not excluded from legislation ; ensuring that there are no legal restrictions on the type of women's work; equal access in recruitment, minimum wage guidelines; different kinds of leave with pay; health and safety legislation protecting workers from danger in the workplace; compensation for injuries; provision for training and promotion; promotion opportunities, and improved maternity provisions. The public sector should be a model for the private sector.412 Temporary Special Measures for Women in Employment. Women in the region have not achieved substantive equality in employment. Special measures are required to enable them to do so. No country in the region has passed legislation to provide for quotas for women in the public service or for special advancement in training or promotions notwithstanding that some countries have affirmative action provisions in the Constitution will allow for this. Family Law Comprehensive changes to family law are critical to address legal and financial discrimination faced by women. Although there should be a social educational focus on achieving gender equality in the family where gender discrimination often has its provenance, so that efforts spill over to society at large, comprehensive changes to family law are critical to address legal and financial discrimination faced by women. The biggest legal handicap is the lack of specialized legislation and a lack of specialized courts. All PICTs apart from Fiji, need new legislation and courts where families in the process of breaking up are treated like human beings undergoing an emotionally disturbing process. New laws should include protection from violence orders, a minimum age of marriage as 18 for both males and females, financial support for all parties without having to prove fault after separation and divorce, no-fault divorce grounds, equal rights to share in matrimonial property and family finances; and specific adoption of CEDAW and CRC as guiding principles in the legislation itself. The lee ways of judicial discretion should be as limited as possible to narrow the possibility of interpreting new 412 UNESCAP 2007 103. 126 legislation in further discriminatory ways.

Training of all stakeholders who implement new legislation is critical. Research is needed to devise an economic formula for assessing the economic costs of not amending laws affecting gender justice, as has been done with violence against women. Source: author Cultural and attitudinal strategies: training justice officials and legislators Orienting and training of all stakeholders in the legal machinery is critical as well as updating training material to reflect changing realities. Cultural and attitudinal changes about gender and the law are required, whether it is a legislative, litigation or other approach that is preferred. When new precedents have been created it has been the result of training of justice officials, including lawyers. The stakeholder groups include women themselves, the media, community groups, members of the legislature, lawyers, judges, magistrates, government officials, police and justice agencies (both formal and customary); all need gender and human rights training, to pass new legislation, reduce resistance to new laws and to adopt positive interpretations of law. It is important to use the media to accelerate cultural and attitudinal change (see Box 35 for an example). Working with legislators is a critical component of getting good legislation passed. In both Fiji and Vanuatu, women\u2019s organisations worked closely with Members of Parliament, building important trust relationships and encouraging the championship of the proposed legislation by them. In both cases, workshops were held with members of Parliamentary subcommittees who were more closely involved with the proposed legislation or whom NGOs considered to be potential powerful supporters. Box 35. Combining effective strategies to get new gender justice legislation -The Family Law Act 2003 (Fiji) by Imrana Jalal, Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) and former Commissioner of Family Law How can good laws be passed? The passing of the Family Law Act 2003 (Fiji) is a fine example of effectiveness of women\u2019s strategic partnerships in getting equality laws passed. The previous family law was outdated, irrelevant, not properly enforced and discriminated against women and children, legally and financially. What combination of circumstances can 413 Section 26 (e) Family Law Act 2003 (Fiji) 414 The Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) has embarked on such a project. 127 lead to human/women\u2019s rights policy or legislation?415 There has to be a fortuitous convergence of circumstances (multiple forces at play simultaneously), some, not all, of which must occur together at any given time: Civil society roles \u00a7 NGOs must themselves be educated about the issues; \u00a7 Education of all major stakeholders on the need for reform, especially major opinion shapers; \u00a7 A credible lobby group and/or civil society that is allowed to function. They have the political space to mobilise and advocate for change. A protected Bill of Rights is an important component of this factor. In Fiji\u2019s case, RRRT partner, the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement was the lead NGO supporting the passing of the Act; \u00a7 Public mass media campaigns and a responsive media \u2013 the media must be educated about the proposed law; \u00a7 A strong NGO movement which understands how government and governance functions and knows how to work within the system, both nationally and internationally; \u00a7 Working with all political parties to gather support for the proposed legislation. This may involve group seminars or one-to-one meetings; \u00a7 Sound economic analysis on the economic costs of not passing new legislation; and \u00a7 Good technical support as that provided by RRRT to both government and NGOs. Responsibilities of the state \u00a7 An existing democracy with guaranteed free speech because this means that citizens are allowed to challenge existing policies, law and practices; a constitution that guarantees equal rights; \u00a7 A government that is willing or is required to act within principles of good governance and to work with NGOs; \u00a7 An active and strong women\u2019s ministry/department working from within government RRRT\u2019s Government partners included the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Fiji Law Reform Commission and the Ministry of Women; \u00a7 A law that requires the application of human rights conventions must if relevant. Fiji is fortunate to have such a provision in the 1997 Constitution at s.43(2); \u00a7 The ratification of CEDAW and CRC which is a basis of justification for the change.

This may be a formally appointed commissioner for law reform or one employed, for example, by the NGOs; \u00a7 A powerful minister or other Member of Parliament can be an important ally and champion for the change. They may be an opinion shaper or champion within cabinet or parliament who other MPs respect; \u00a7 Important strategic partnerships \u2013 in this case the partnership existed between government (the Attorney General\u2019s Office, Parliamentary Office, Department of Women, Fiji Law Reform Commission) and civil society (FWRM and other NGOs) with RRRT providing technical and expert support to both government and NGOs. RRRT brokered and nurtured the extremely important government and NGO relationship that ultimately led to the passing of the Bill with unanimous support of all parties in Parliament. The latter was an historic and unprecedented event in Fiji\u2019s legislative history. Economic strategies An important political message to opinion shapers who determine whether good legislation is passed ought to include the economic costs of not passing legislation, and to clearly show the link between the necessary changes and core development goals. This can be a powerful determinant in compelling legislative change and was used in getting the Family Law Act 2003 passed in Fiji. Politicians and government officials often resist change for gender justice on the basis that the new law will be too costly to implement. If, for example in Fiji, it can be demonstrated that not passing new gender-based violence legislation will continue to cost the economy FJD300 million in direct costs annually,416 this might be a sufficient economic incentive for legislative change.417 Ratification and reporting of CEDAW and other core human rights conventions This strategy provides a further layer of accountability and compels countries to update their laws and implement new measures, and then report on them to a global body. The reporting process of \u2018saving face\u2019 and avoiding embarrassment enforces compliance. All PICTs need amendments to legislation and their constitutions to make it explicit that international human rights law shall apply to domestic law. The Fiji example is a good starting point. 416 Nairube, ibid. 417 Author\u2019s view. 129 Temporary special measures through legislation Temporary special measures through constitutional and legislative changes are critical to accelerate equality in all areas but particularly in the areas of quotas for political equality in national legislatures and other decision making bodies; as well as in education, employment, shelter and housing and access to credit facilities. Laws are necessary to affect such affirmative action and too much reliance should not be placed only on policy changes and goodwill. More internal democratisation of political parties, which may include more internal quotas and affirmative action for women within party structures, need to be encouraged.418 However, it is critical that legislation is passed to provide for electoral quotas and some Pacific countries already have general legal provisions that would allow this. If left to the voluntary goodwill of political parties, the results may not be the same.

Box 36. The tyranny of smallness \u2013 the challenges for political participation and women\u2019s rights defenders in small Pacific Island countries419 One of the difficulties for women\u2019s rights activists in challenging gender injustice is the relative smallness of PICT societies. Unlike many parts of Africa and Asia defenders do not face immediate everyday threats to their physical security, except for during the coups d\u2019\u00e9tat in Fiji and Solomon Islands; and the crisis in Tonga. However they face social isolation, alienation, hostility and structural and financial obstacles in doing human rights work. The small size of Island populations makes it socially difficult for activists to take an unpopular position against the State or the status quo or chiefs in villages or settlements. Often they are related to or belong to the same clans or are wantok to women\u2019s rights violators. Openly taking a different position is seen as going against the culture or a betrayal of one\u2019s culture. Social exclusion can often result. In bigger countries advocates have enough social networks to ease the loss of familial or social ties. When a defender in Tonga mobilised her women\u2019s group to fight against the new law which limited free speech she was ostracised by a social group very important to her. But there some advantages and opportunities to working in island communities too. The small populations offer protection and assistance to defenders as well. Human rights defenders are highly visible and well known. It would be almost impossible for example to arrest a defender and for it not to be known and for the community or family not to do something about it. Personal links also open doors for defenders in lobbying. Similarly It would be unthinkable for a government minister to refuse to see a defender who is his or her wantok (clan member). 418 UNIFEM 2008(a), 32. 419 Jalal, 2004. 130 Building the capacity of women\u2019s NGOs In many PICTs civil society organisations (CSOs), particularly women\u2019s NGOs, have been the driving force behind human rights conventions being ratified and progressive legislation being passed and implemented. New legislation is critical to protect the rights of women\u2019s NGOs to mobilise around legal issues. In Fiji an NGO that was perceived by government to be lobbying against government policies was deregistered.420 Funders and development agencies should support NGO mobilisation for gender justice. Conclusion Some of these measures would benefit greatly from primary research to fill the gaps, cover all PICT legislation, record un-codified customary law, carefully examine case law and how the laws impact on women, and update the existing information. However many laws do not require further research to justify amendment, as they are, on the face of it, blatantly discriminatory against women, and there is ample justification for their amendment. For example the inclusion of sex and gender in the prohibited grounds of discrimination need only for those words to be included. It is also necessary to develop a set of gender indicators to measure de facto reality, that is, to adequately and accurately reflect the situation on the ground. Changing all the laws that have an effect on women, without corresponding changes in other areas influencing the effectiveness of the new laws, is not sufficient to advance women\u2019s overall rights to gender justice. An integrated approach is critical as advancement in one area promotes advancement in another. Any strategy to overcome their systemic disadvantage must be multi-sectoral and across disciplines otherwise amendments to existing laws run the risk of further oppressing women. Specifically, political leadership and commitment will go a long way towards correcting overall discrimination against women. Key Messages Main message Governments and NGOs across the Pacific Islands can together, in strategic partnerships, deal with the problem of improving women\u2019s overall gender justice by passing comprehensive progressive legislation, changing discriminatory laws, policies and practices in all areas affecting women; and ensuring the effectiveness of new legislation with adequate resources and training of all stakeholders. The approach must be an integrated one across all sectors because new legislation by itself is not enough. Secondary messages \u2022 Poor women bear a disproportionate burden of discriminatory laws.

Common law Historically, a body of unwritten law derived from the traditional laws of England based on case law precedents and judicial interpretation rather than legislation. Complainant Generally, a person who lodges a complaint with a court or other decision maker. In criminal proceedings it is a person, not necessarily the victim, who begins a prosecution by laying a complaint. Concluding comments Concluding comments are the findings or summing up of the state report by the relevant committee. Constitution A constitution is the supreme source of the law and provides the framework for other laws of the land. It sets out how the government is structured and operates, the executive and legislative powers of the state, the judiciary and the public service, and addresses issues of state finance, land and citizenship. Constructive dialogue The process by which a UN committee and government delegations engage in friendly, open discussions about the content of the reports. Corroboration In criminal proceedings, corroboration is independent evidence that connects the accused person to the crime. In the common law judges are typically required to advise the jury that it is dangerous to convict the accused on uncorroborated evidence for sexual offences and paternity. Convention A convention is a legally binding treaty or agreement based on international standards agreed upon between two or more states. Conventions are a source of international law, and can become part of local law once a country has ratified them. Custody Custody refers to the daily care and control of a child. It typically encompasses the rights and duties related to the upbringing of children. These rights include the power to make decisions about a child\u2019s education, religion and property as well as a personal power of physical control. The corresponding duties include providing the child with food, clothing, shelter, education and other necessities of life.

De jure Latin term meaning \u2018according to the law\u2019 and in contrast to de facto which means \u2018in fact\u2019. Discrimination Discrimination in general terms is the act of making prejudicial distinctions among individuals or groups by taking irrelevant matters into consideration resulting in unequal treatment. It is treating a person or persons less favourably; distinguishing, excluding, restricting, or preferring another on the prohibited basis of a certain or several features or attributes that the person or persons\u2019 possess. The definition of discrimination contained in Article 1 of CEDAW explicitly states that discrimination against women means any \u2018distinction, exclusion or restriction\u2019 made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field. Direct discrimination Direct discrimination results from less favourable treatment in comparison with a real or hypothetical comparator from the mainstream group in the same or similar circumstances on a prohibited ground.

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) NGOs are non-profit organisations dedicated to a particular cause or issue \u2013 for example, women\u2019s rights. They are independent of any government. NGOs are sometimes referred to as civil society organisations (CSOs), which is a broader term that includes a wider range of interest and community groups (for example, the Fiji Law Society, other professional societies and church groups). Optional protocol An optional protocol is an additional treaty that usually allows the opportunity to address other subject specific sections related to the main treaty that were not covered in the original treaty. Though there are exceptions to the rule, optional protocols need to be ratified separately and are usually open only to states parties that accepted the terms of the main treaty. Optional protocols usually allow an individual complaints procedure. Parallel reports Parallel reports to UN committees are written by non-governmental organisations to serve as an alternative or additional source of information to state reports. Party One of the participants in a legal proceeding who has an interest in the outcome. Parties include the plaintiff (person filing suit), defendant (person sued or charged with a crime), petitioner (files a petition asking for a court ruling) or respondent (usually in opposition to a petition or an appeal).

Periodic reports Periodic reports are usually made every four or five years after the initial report, or whenever the relevant UN committee so requires. These report on the progress made in removing obstacles to equality made since the last report. Polygamy Marriage to more than one spouse at the same time or multiple marriages. Precedent A prior reported judgment of a court which establishes the legal rule (authority) for future cases on similar facts or the same legal question. It is also a legal principle or rule created by one or more decisions of a higher court. These rules provide a point of reference or authority for judges deciding similar issues in later cases. Lower courts are bound to apply these rules when faced with similar legal issues. Prior sexual conduct The common law rule where the prior sexual conduct of a victim with either the accused or with other men is relied upon to establish that the victim consented to the sexual act in question. Proof of resistance Proof of resistance is a common law rule which requires sexual assault victims to establish that they physically resisted the perpetrator and is used to determine consent.

It is composed of criminal, international, environmental, administrative and constitutional law. Ratification, ratified To have ratified a treaty or convention means a state has officially committed to comply with the obligations under that treaty or convention. When a state ratifies a convention, it is said to be a \u201cparty\u201d to it, and is called a state party. Reservations A reservation is a formal statement made by a state claiming it is not willing to be bound by a particular article or section of a particular convention. Reservations can be made when the state signs, ratifies or accedes to a convention or treaty. Respondent A person or entity required to answer a petition for a court order.

Signatory Many countries first sign a convention to show their support and commitment to it. Becoming a signatory means a country is obliged to stop acting in a way that would defeat the object and purpose of the convention. However, signing a convention does not mean the state is legally bound by any obligations. When these countries decide to become states parties they do so through ratification. State party, states parties A state party is the legal name for a country that has either ratified or acceded to a convention. State report States parties to conventions are required to submit regular reports on the legislative, judicial and administrative measures they have implemented as part of their obligations under the convention. Statute A law made by parliament. Substantive equality Substantive equality refers to real or actual equality. Whereas formal equality merely requires the equal application of rules, substantive equality requires equality of access, equal opportunity and crucially, equality of results. Succession Succession is the acceptance of the legal obligations previously instated during a previous government\u2019s rule. This should not be confused with changes in administration, but instead usually applies to states that make the decision to maintain the obligations of another state that ratified a treaty on their behalf before they gained independence.

It identifies the fault lines in the de jure position of the justice systems as well as the gaps between the de jure and the de facto positions. The study also indicates that domestic violence and sexual harassment are areas where legislative impact is incomplete, even though the problem is endemic. Access to justice that includes effective legal services along with socio economic services is virtually absent in the region. With privatization, the state seems to be withdrawing from crucial areas such as education, health and employment and there are no mechanisms to address violations by non-state actors as a constitutional right. Various efforts by government and non-government bodies indicate positive developments that are moving towards progressive realization using the women\u2019s conventions as a benchmark.

Introduction This paper consists of an overview of law and legal mechanisms in the region and the legal system\u2019s response to concerns of gender. It reflects the commonalities and differences in the various legal traditions of the region with similar and varied experiences under colonial rule. Laws \u2013 de jure and de facto \u2013 are instruments that influence the extent of security and differential power that people have. While women\u2019s movements and NGO activities in South Asia have had some success in bringing about legal amendments having a discriminatory effect on women and other gender minorities as well as introducing new laws strengthening their legal status, actual implementation often falls short. Measures designed to protect have often not been accompanied by measures to empower, and many women in the region neither have the knowledge nor the means to bring their cases to the courts even if the laws entitles them to do so. Additionally, most of the issues that impact women in the region are governed by personal laws that are not universal but are bound within the specifics of communities. Issues under Focus The study takes a rights based approach, identifying the rights of women, men and other oppressed gender minorities as human rights. The discussion focuses on criminal law, civil law, constitutional law and rules of evidence, and includes: (a) The de jure position on statutes (legal) (b) The de facto position in practice (facts) (c) Position in local/traditional laws (norms ex religious law etc.) (d) Position on the ground/in operation (fact) The South Asian countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the Islamic Republic of Iran have been selected for the research. All countries have a shared history of mutual coexistence and a confluence of cultural values and systems. Islamic Republic of Iran, though not part of South Asia, has", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e9c5cbde-e2b4-4387-aa94-5054d766cdde": {"__data__": {"id_": "e9c5cbde-e2b4-4387-aa94-5054d766cdde", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bc5aa10d0156005166e4d49d789e2989b993e3d0f27884e13bd3858c3f5dba3f"}}, "hash": "bc5aa10d0156005166e4d49d789e2989b993e3d0f27884e13bd3858c3f5dba3f", "text": "a contiguous geography with Afghanistan and this has had considerable influence on the Indian subcontinent. Information Areas Sought A brief overview of primary information areas that were researched for the project included: \u2022 Sources informing the laws of the countries in the sub-region; relative importance of \"personal\" and \"universal\" laws within the countries; equality before law or otherwise for both men and women. \u2022 Status of women in the personal law in the sub-region; to what extent personal law (particularly in areas such as inheritance rights, marriage, divorce, child custody, etc.) is universal and to which extent it is bound within the specifics of communities in different parts of the region. 5 \u2022 Awareness and understanding of gender equality in justice systems; differences, if any and the reasons for the gender based differences in law and who benefits from these differences. \u2022 Mapping of the legal status in the sub-region: Secular versus traditional women and violence and laws. \u2022 Women\u2019s economic position in the sub-region secured by law such as inheritance, property laws, etc. Methodology Research has broadly looked into two specific aspects: \u2022 Human rights in the global context \u2022 Legal systems and gender in a generalized context The study is broadly divided into two parts. The first part deals with the de jure position and discusses legislation that covers areas of criminal law, evidence, legislation relating to employment, family law, and trafficking. The second part addresses the de facto position and addresses the role of law enforcers, the availability of resources, the application of the law and the areas of its non-application. The paper has attempted to be all inclusive. The intersection of class, religion, caste and gender in addressing gender equity in justice systems has been considered in the study. In the context of gender the paper is not about women alone. However, marginalization on account of gender and disproportionate experience of disparity and disadvantage is more severe with women, minorities and other marginalized groups and these have been identified in this paper. It is recognized that legal interventions by themselves cannot address the problem of discrimination, lack of access to justice and violations of human rights. But they can set standards which in turn can be an effective tool to address these critical concerns. 2. Sources of Law in South Asian Countries Legal Construct: A Historical Perspective In some of the countries of the region that have a shared colonial past, civil law is often understood as law that governs all civil and commercial transactions. Some examples of such legislation would include the various Contract Acts, the Partnership Acts and the Companies Acts of Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. These were originally formulated during the colonial period to facilitate trade and commerce and continue to this day. The common law system, also led to the development of judicial precedents in cases and judgments of the higher courts that are considered binding on the lower courts. The diversity of religious populace in the region also resulted in the growth of a complex set of personal laws or family laws based on religion that govern all aspects of marriage, divorce, custody, adoption, inheritance and other areas relating to the family. This branch of law, though civil in its impact, is based on religion and customary practices and is often referred to as personal law. During colonialism in the sub continent, some laws addressed certain areas of family matters. But the policy of 6 the colonialists was not to interfere in this area. Family law in the region thus is extremely diverse with each community following its own set of rules and regulations and with different kinds of legislative interventions. There is also interplay between civil law and family law in some countries that needs to be understood. To give an example, while laws relating to inheritance owe their origin to religious laws, transfer of properties obtained in an inheritance would be governed by a civil law like Transfer of Property Acts in countries like Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Islamic Republic of Iran provides for a comprehensive Code that includes both civil and family laws.1 Sources of such laws are also varied. Within the same religious denominations of the region there are different systems of laws. Sometimes these are sourced from religious texts as in the case of statutes or religious texts are applied as in the case of Shariat. To give an example, legislations relating to Hindu law in India and Nepal while consolidating its applicability to all Hindus is based on customary and religious Hindu practices. However the laws governing Hindus in India and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d79f3c8-02c8-4fc1-8f47-b410ab1bc094": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d79f3c8-02c8-4fc1-8f47-b410ab1bc094", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "APHDR Technical Background Paper 2010/15", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/aphdr-technical-background-paper-2010/15", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f492a20a3acc788bd774ba71fa0ded7b7981db91c016afb1baa602b1dacfde7"}}, "hash": "0f492a20a3acc788bd774ba71fa0ded7b7981db91c016afb1baa602b1dacfde7", "text": "Nepal are very different. Bhutan follows customary law. In Sri Lanka legislative laws relating to the Tamil communities who are Hindus are based on customary practices while other communities have a combination of laws in this regard. In Bangladesh, Pakistan, Maldives, Afghanistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, Sharia law is the basis of legislations relating to family law that are applicable to Muslims. The issue of state intervention with customs and traditions is a sensitive one because of the perception of influential groups in diverse communities that this is an official effort to denigrate and deny a legitimate sense of cultural or ethnic identity.2 Criminal law was codified by the British in the mid-nineteenth century, leaving behind three main legislations: the Penal Code, the Evidence Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure. These continue to be the foundation of the criminal justice system in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka despite each country having made various legislative changes in these laws. But since the British did not know much about the Sub Continent, they codified the laws based on their own experience in England and used the laws which had governed Britain as creating the right legal framework.3 Thus, laws that defined crimes involving violation to the body such as sexual assault, kidnapping or abduction were drafted with the dominant idea of protecting the honor of the individual and his/her family rather than as an injury to the woman. To give an example, the Bangladesh and Indian Penal Codes of 1860 treat adultery as an offence punishable with imprisonment only when it is committed by a married woman. This often resulted in discriminatory practices being sanctioned in the realm of criminal law whose impact is continued to be felt even today. In the case of Pakistan there is a shift to Islamic criminal law in certain areas of evidence and substantial criminal law. 1 For the Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, see http://www.unhcr.org/cgi- bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain 2 Savitri Goonesekere, Violence, Law and Women\u2019s Rights in South Asia, page 41, Sage Publications New Delhi. 3 Law power and justice, The protection of personal rights in the Indian Penal Code, Vasudha Dhagamwar, Sage publications, 1992, page 51. 7 Colonialism also introduced informal legal systems to serve their purpose. The system of Jirga although prevalent in the area of Peshawar in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan was introduced as a system of resolving disputes in the region.4 Other legal systems of countries of the region such as Bhutan and Nepal did not have a history of colonialism but have had monarchies with different systems of law in place and are in the process of transition. Bhutan has held elections towards the establishment of a national assembly. In the case of Nepal, major changes in the political system have resulted in a transition from monarchy to republic and the country is poised for formulation of a constitutional assembly. Nepal has ratified all human rights treaties. Islamic law operate in all the countries of the region in the area of family law while in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Maldives the principles of Shairat also govern parts of civil law and criminal law. Historically political and dynastic differences led to the creation of two schools in Islamic law, the Sunni and the Shia. The Shia school is divided into three main sub schools: the Athna-Asharias, the Ismailyas and Zaidyas. The Sunni school is divided into several sub schools such as the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafei and Hanabali named after their respective founders. Islamic law recognizes the right of any Muslim to renounce the doctrines of any school and adopt any one that he or she would choose. In practice however, the systems of some countries discriminate in favor of one school. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the laws have been codified following the Shia school and all Muslims to whichever school they belong are governed by the codified law. The vast majority of Muslims in the Indian sub- continent are Sunnis and the presumption is that parties to a legal proceeding are Sunnis unless the contrary is established. Since most of the Sunnis are Hanafis in the region the presumption is that a Sunni is governed by the Hanafi law. The foundation of Islamic jurisprudence is the Holy Quran.

The personality of the wife did not merge with that of the husband on marriage, and divorce was not prohibited. While other systems addressed marriage as a sacrament, Islamic law looked upon the institution as a contract. Widow re-marriage was a recognized principle in Quranic law. These principles actually provided a progressive system of jurisprudence that was subsequently recognized by other legal systems at a later point of time. As a source of law, the verses of the Holy Quran are quoted for various legal rules and moral laws. The Holy Quran also provided for principles of interpretation. When several verses deal with the same problem the principle of interpretation is that the earlier ones are repealed by the later ones.5 4 Lt Sandemann a british officer is credited with introducing Jirga in the region.

The other sources of Islamic law are the Hadis, Ijmaa and Qiyas, but the Holy Quran takes precedence over all of them. Islamic legal code based on the Holy Quran and other sources of law are called the Shariat. 1. Hadis: The law laid down in the holy book is supplemented by Hadis or Sunna, which are the precepts and the practices of the Messenger of God. They were not recorded during the lifetime of the Prophet but were collected from various sources and were preserved by tradition and handed down by various persons. Hence the authenticity of many of the traditions attributed to the Holy Prophet is considered to be in great doubt. Since they evolved subsequently, different jurists gave varied interpretations and very often the traditions were reported in contradictory ways without consensus among jurists. To give an example, one tradition was used against the former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by fundamentalists to state that a nation ruled by women could not prosper. Some scholars are of the view that such a Hadith is of a forged nature considering the high encomium paid in the Holy Quran to the rule of Queen Balqis of Sheba.8 2. Ijma: This is considered the third source of Islamic law and it means the concurrence or concordance of the companions and disciples of the Prophet, their successors and jurists. 3. Qiyas This is the fourth source of Muslim law that is based on the exercise of private judgment based on analogy. Linked to this is the concept of Ijtihad or Ijtehaad, which denotes the bringing into operation the whole capacity of forming a private judgment relative to a legal proposition. 9 As a source of law, Ijitihad or Ijtehaad refers to determining a decision about an issue on which the Shariat is silent. The decision is taken in the light of one\u2019s own understanding of the situation as well as that of the spirit of the directives of the Holy Quran. Qiyas and Ijtihad constitute a dynamic mechanism to meet the exigencies of the situation and for the development of law. 6 Justice Mahmood, \u201c one of the greatest difficulties in the administration of Muslim law, as indeed of all ancient systems, lies in distinguishing moral from legal obligations.

When Indo-Anglican courts interpreted Islamic law, they refused to consider them as valuable tools and instead depended upon commentaries of ancient jurists like Hedaya and Imameea. This resulted in old and antiquated views being prevailed upon what would have clearly followed and logically flowed texts of the Quran or the record of the Hadis.10 The current position continues in India in areas of interpretation where there is no statutory law. Legal Construct: The Contemporary Challenge Family laws in all the countries discriminate on the ground of gender. The safeguarding of minority rights which are all too essential in any country has unfortunately led to a situation where minority family laws are not amended even when they are discriminatory. As a result, women from minority communities often face double discrimination. As an example, Hindus in India are governed by various statutory laws in matters pertaining to the family, which legitimates divorce. But Hindus in Bangladesh and Pakistan - by virtue of their minority status - cannot obtain divorce since it is prohibited under Sastric Hindu (scriptures) laws11. In the same way, the practice of triple talaq by which a man can divorce his wife even in her absence by repeating talaq three times in the presence of two witnesses, is the common method of divorce among Indian Muslims. The Divorce Act of 1869 that governs divorce among Christians in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was amended in 2003 in India to simplify and add grounds of divorce due to campaigns by Christian women\u2019s groups. But the legislation that recognizes only adultery in its various forms as grounds of divorce continues to operate in Pakistan and Bangladesh12. Despite these tensions there are a number of legislations that safeguard women\u2019s rights. In such instances discrimination persists in the form of informal practices and other socio economic factors that deny women legal access. 3. Justice Systems in South Asian Countries: Structure and Equality The concept of equality has had a varied meaning in different systems of law. The traditional approach has been one of \u201ctreating likes alike\u201d ignoring gender differences between men and women focusing on \u201cequal treatment\u201d rather than on equality of outcomes. As a result, there is an additional burden on women to achieve male standards when in fact the social and economic reality of women is not similar to that of men.13 10 Muslim and the Constitution, AM Bhattacharjee, 2nd edition pg 19 Eastern Law Company 1994. 11 There is no statutory law in Pakistan and Bangladesh addressing marriage and divorce among Hindus 12 Divorce Act of Pakistan and Divorce Act of Bangladesh. 13 Madhu Mehra, restoring rights to women 2004 Unifem publication page 24. 10 The second approach recognizes these differences and reinforces them by sanctioning different treatment as while taking note of biological difference it relies on social assumptions as a standard for the roles and capacities attached to men and women. Such approach often falls on the assumption of weakness and subordination on the basis of sex rather than addressing the external, structural or systemic causes of the subordination of women. These two dominant practices in relation to equality are called the \u2018formal\u2019 and the \u2018protectionist\u2019 model of equality respectively. 14 Under CEDAW however, a third approach has been adopted. This is called the corrective approach that recognizes that women were historically disadvantaged and corrective measures ought to be taken in order to address this discrimination. The thrust is on substantive equality. A substantive definition of equality takes into account and focuses on diversity, difference, disadvantage and discrimination. It examines the assumptions behind the difference in trying to assess the disadvantage resulting from it and stresses the need to develop a \u2018different treatment\u2019 or a response that dismantles the disadvantage. It seeks to eliminate existing discrimination faced by disadvantaged groups at the individual, institutional and systemic levels through corrective and positive measures. Its principal concern is to ensure that the law corrects the imbalance and impacts on the outcome by assuring equal opportunities, access and benefits for women. In doing so it seeks a paradigm shift from \u201cequal treatment\u201d to \u201cequality of outcomes\u201d.15 The boxes 1 to 10 indicate the CEDAW\u2019s and equality and non-discrimination provisions of the various constitution of the countries.
