(2002) and Fuchs et al. (2007). It is plausible that it would have declined as have the other species with wider Lao distributions, for similar reasons. This seems to be so: during the 1992\u20131993 survey of Xe Pian NPA, it was common in the northern zone. There are also no recent records from Central Lao PDR, despite its former presence there and searches in late 2007 in suitable habitat in Savannakhet province (Duckworth et al. 1999, Duckworth unpubl.).

Its decline presumably reflects over-harvest. It was effectively absent from Vientiane in the 1990s (Duckworth & Tizard 2003) but bird persecution there has eased recently, and numbers are rising rapidly (Duckworth unpubl.). In contrast, the reverse pattern is seen in the more rural area of Pathoumphone: this single record, despite long and hard efforts to search in prime habitat (non-forest wetlands with abundant domestic bovids) contrasts with the assessment as \u2017common\u2018 in the Xe Pian NPA northern zone in 1992\u20131993 (Thewlis et al. 1996). If this pattern is widespread across rural South and Central Lao PDR, then the species may now be most dependent on the growing urban populations where there are less chances of people seeking out and raiding its nests. 2014 addition: At least some large non-urban populations persist and in South and Central Lao PDR. Hundreds were found in the Xe Champhon basin in 2013\u20132014 (Timmins 2014). Plain Martin Riparia paludicola \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records Two Plain Martins were seen near Ban Phapho in December 1992. The species is much declined in South and Central Lao PDR (Thewlis et al. 1998), and the lack of records in 2007\u20132008 is consistent with further decline, but it might simply have been overlooked. It is certainly not common in the survey area, given the survey focus on plains wetlands, with which it is much associated when outside river channels. 70 Yellow-bellied Prinia Prinia flaviventris \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records This prinia is widespread across Lao PDR and in some places is common (Duckworth 1996, Thewlis et al. 1996, WCS 1997, Davidson 1998, Duckworth et al. 1998, 2002, Robichaud & Stuart 1999, Fuchs et al. 2007, Timmins & Duckworth 2013). However, its distribution is localized and it was not found on several other surveys (e.g. Steinmetz et al. 1999, Evans et al. 2000, Evans 2001). Around Vientiane it is absent from most sites, even some with tall wet graminoid beds but wherever it occurs it is often one of the commonest birds (Duckworth 1996: 222; Duckworth unpubl., from other sites during 2003\u20132005). Sites supporting large populations include seasonally exposed bushland of the Mekong channel (Duckworth 1996), montane secondary shrubland and ruderals (Fuchs et al. 2007) as well as beds of tall wetland graminoids (e.g. the Vientiane city river-front) the eutrophic Nong Tha, Vientiane city (Duckworth unpubl.) and the isolated Nong Hiang on the Bolaven plateau (Duckworth et al. 1998). The absence from Pathoumphone despite the numerous nongs with apparently suitable habitat is not readily explicable. As with Grey-breasted Prinia, it may be part of a genuine gap in distribution: more extensive surveys in 1992\u20131996 of the lowlands east of the Mekong and south of the Bolaven plateau (Thewlis et al. 1996, Duckworth et al. 1998, Evans et al. 2000) found it only once: in the lowlands adjacent to the Bolaven plateau in wet-season 1993 (Thewlis et al. 1996). This may have referred to post-breeding dispersal from the plateau (which supports large populations; Duckworth et al. 1998). Rusty-rumped Warbler Locustella certhiola This species is common in nongs with patches of tall grass and sedge, with particularly large numbers in Thong Namniap. It was apparently absent from stands of short graminoids. Rusty-rumped Warbler is widespread and common on passage in Lao PDR, but few large wintering populations are known (e.g. at a few nongs with extensive tall wet graminoids on the Vientiane plain).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4f22c3b-e702-4943-9297-6458e3240942": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4f22c3b-e702-4943-9297-6458e3240942", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The significance of the Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar site (Champasak province, Lao PDR) and its surroundings for biodiversity conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "664e1d814ef04a56748a89653325d0b3d916155192e1ef2a50bce9950d9c7b2c"}, "2": {"node_id": "6b59b684-f426-4891-b5f8-81cf3fe6480e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "822c8e5e0b2fc9c6bb81a037aac3174c5ab05f607a6d34aca42b87728b74cf50"}}, "hash": "3c1fa2b8d527493cdd8737f48f86be5110fa8f81aa753a8ecc9c49798a0ce71b", "text": "at a few nongs with extensive tall wet graminoids on the Vientiane plain).

Pathoumphone has never been surveyed at the appropriate time to find the species on passage, but under current habitat conditions (destruction of emergent tall beds of graminoids by domestic bovid grazing and trampling) it seems unlikely that significant numbers visit on spring passage (early\u2013mid May). They might well do so in autumn (timing not well known, probably within September\u2013early November). It is even possible that it may be found to winter: rather few of the many small acrocephalus warblers in the tall wet grass were identified to species (all were the common Black-browed Reed Warbler A. bistrigiceps). Oriental Reed Warbler Acrocephalus orientalis Many of this species was found at Thong Namniap and Beung Kiat Ngong. There were fewer at many other sites. But with large flocks, the presence of Clamorous Reed Warbler could not be ruled out. Oriental Reed Warbler is widespread and common on passage in Lao PDR, but few large wintering populations are known (the Vientiane plain does not apparently hold one). The large population in the Pathoumphone nongs probably comprises a significant proportion of the national wintering total. Clamorous Reed Warbler Acrocephalus stentoreus \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records Of all birds accepted by Duckworth et al. (1999) without caveat to occur in Lao PDR, this is among the least understood. There are no recent records, and at least some of the historical records were in error (Thewlis et al. 1996). The lack of recent records might reflect difficulties in distinguishing this from Oriental Reed Warbler (which was common on the present survey). Of more concern is the possibility that Clamorous Reed Warbler is (or was) tied to a specific sort of (semi-)natural wetland (presumably one supporting beds of tall graminoids) that has largely or entirely been converted to agriculture. It is possible that it was overlooked among the many large acrocephalus warblers that could not be confirmed to be Oriental Reed Warblers. 2014 addition: Re-evaluation of historical literature (no specimen is known) suggests that all historical claims of this species in Lao PDR were in error, and it should probably be removed from the Lao list (Duckworth in press). Striated Grassbird Megalurus palustris \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records Striated Grassbird is strangely localized within Lao PDR, and has shown recent decline and localized extinction at several sites (Fuchs et al. 2007). There are no records from anywhere in South or Central Lao PDR. Summing information from habitat use at known Lao PDR sites does not allow an understanding as to why it occurs where it currently does, and yet is apparently absent from other similar wet grasslands. 72 2014 addition: Review of Lao PDR records suggests the possibility that this species was only ever a non-breeding winter visitor to the plain, with breeding restricted to the northern highlands (Duckworth in press).

Oriental Skylark\u2018s habitat use, of low-intensity paddy agriculture close to permanent waterbodies, places it under national risk of extinction because these are the choice areas for conversion to intensive irrigated rice agriculture, which does not support the species (Duckworth 2007). It is unclear whether the paucity of records reflects it having been much overlooked in Lao PDR, or a genuinely restricted distribution. Pathoumphone has much superficially suitable habitat: the total lack of records on this survey, despite ample time in the peak song period by an observer very familiar with the species, suggests genuine absence. Its wider distribution in South and Central Lao PDR remains unclear: it may genuinely be very rare. 73 Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava Small numbers almost ubiquitous, with concentrations >50 found only at Thong Namniap (100+ feeding, 15 December), Beung Kiat Ngong (feeding and roosting, many dates) and Ban Nam-Om (pre-roost gathering of c.50, 5 January. Roosting information is given under Red-throated Pipit. Yellow Wagtail is widespread and common on passage in Lao PDR, but the distribution and size of the wintering population has not been directly determined. There are probably only few areas with winter densities comparable to those of Pathoumphone. No other roosts of this size are known, but most of the other areas that might hold them have not been surveyed adequately. 2014 addition: Several similar roosts, at least one of comparable size, exist on the Vientiane plain (Duckworth in press).

In total with Yellow Wagtail, 2,000\u20133,000 were seen from a dusk watch of flying birds from the Thopsok sector on 18 December. A dusk count of birds leaving the pre-roost gathering site in the short turf and dry mud adjacent to Ban Kiatngong on 19 December estimated 4,000\u20138,000 birds. Boat-based observations from the south-west-centre of the marsh on 8 January showed that birds headed in the late afternoon to the Kiatngong pre-roost gathering site from the centre of the marsh, potentially even further to the east. At the Kele-2 sector at dawn on 12 and 16 January many hundreds of birds (Red-throated Pipit greatly outnumbering Yellow Wagtail) arrived from the general area of the central roost. Red-throated Pipit is widespread and common on passage in Lao PDR, but the distribution and size of the wintering population has not been directly considered. It is unlikely that many areas support winter densities comparable to those of Pathoumphone.

These numbers seen in Pathoumphone are tiny compared with what such a large expanse of prime habitat should support. 2014 addition: Another area supporting the species in Lao PDR has been found: the lower Nam Ngum plain, where it is also highly localized (Duckworth in press). Asian Golden Weaver Ploceus hypoxanthus \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records This weaver has never been found in Pathoumphone, but was provisionally found in the Xe Kong plains sector of Xe Pian NPA in 1993 (Thewlis et al. 1998). Even where it is relatively numerous, as in the other known Lao PDR site, Dong Khanthung proposed NPA, patches of superficially suitable habitat seem to be unoccupied (Round 1998), so the species could have been overlooked during the current survey, especially as males would be in female-like plumage and be less readily identifiable. Red Avadavat Amandava amandava \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records Red Avadavat is exceptionally rare in Lao PDR, with only one record, unpublished, of a few birds near Vientiane in 2005 (Duckworth 2009). It uses tall wet grassland and as a mobile flocking species it may need large areas, if not contiguous, then at least in networks within a general area. This may explain its rarity in Lao PDR, and undoubted declines in Cambodia and Thailand (C. M. Poole and P. D. Round in Fuchs et al. 2007). Pathoumphone, notably Beung Kiat Ngong and Thong Namniap, has among the best potential habitat in Lao PDR; this small species may have been overlooked. 2014 addition: There is one further certain record, in the Mekong channel near the 2005 sighting (Duckworth & Timmins 2013). The species may possibly also inhabit the lower Xe Champon plains (Timmins 2014). 75 Black-headed Munia Lonchura malacca \uf0b7 2007\u20132008: no records The sole recent record of this munia from Lao PDR, of eight birds at Nong Souy, Savannaket province, on 13 April 2007, complements few historical records; specific recent searches indicate that the species is rare in Lao PDR (Duckworth et al. 1999, 2002, Fuchs et al. 2007). Black-headed Munia probably depends upon seasonally-inundated tall beds of graminoids. Beung Kiat Ngong and Thong Namniap are among the best potential habitats in Lao PDR; this small species may have been overlooked. 2014 addition: There are a few more records: again from Nong Souy (Timmins 2014) and several of merit birds in Vientiane, presumably caught on the Vientiane plain (Duckworth in press). Chestnut-eared Bunting Emberiza fucata \uf0b7 Beung Kiat Ngong, Kele-2 sector: three on 12 January feeding in a small stand of withered/burnt Sesbania, amid trampled rice stubble and burnt grass; eight in nearby wet grass on 16 January Small numbers of Chestnut-eared Bunting have recently been recorded scattered across the plains and plateaux of Lao PDR (Thewlis et al. 1996, Davidson 1998, Duckworth et al. 1998, 2002, Evans & Timmins 1998, Showler et al. 1998; Duckworth unpubl.), but no areas regularly supporting large numbers are known. Yellow-breasted Bunting Emberiza aureola \uf0b7 Thong Namniap: one flew over on 15 December; at a roost where birds leaving at dawn headed directions between east and north-east, c.2,500 left on 7 January and c.2,170 left on 10 January.

Recent declines across its global range (Chan 2004) reflect loss of habitat and commercial trapping of the large flocks it is prone to form. The roosts could, therefore, following regional patterns, become more regularly trapped. It is listed as Endangered. Other wetland birds Various other wetland-associated birds were found, which are not in need of conservation measures because they can use the small patches of semi-natural vegetation amid paddies (e.g. in the drainage ditches), rice paddies themselves, small forest streams (which remain abundant), and/or non-wetland habitats, like the secondary grass and scrub of abandoned cultivation. A1.2 Species using other habitats The following species are not particularly associated with wetlands or grasslands, but the records are detailed there because the species are of elevated conservation concern, at least in Lao PDR (as identified in Duckworth et al. 1999, with some further, chiefly non-forest, species added reflecting discussion in Duckworth et al. 2002 and Fuchs et al. 2007). Oriental Pied Hornbill Anthracoceros albirostris This hornbill was heard several times, in no case with the suggestion of a large flock: Ban Thahou (14 December), Ban Thongpha (16 December), Ban Nongpop (24 December) and Beung Kiat Ngong (from the Kiatngong sector on 9 January). Hornbills are the only closed forest birds in Lao PDR to have shown a demonstrable decline to widespread local extinction in remaining habitat (Thewlis et al. 1998, Duckworth et al. 1999). Pied Hornbill is the most robust species and in some areas it is still common, but in heavily impacted regions, it too is now rare and local (e.g. Sangthong district, Vientiane, and Phongsali province; Duckworth 1996, Fuchs et al. 2007). These few records suggest a decline since the surveys of Xe Pian and Dong Hua Sao NPAs in 1992\u20131996, when the species was common throughout (Thewlis et al. 1996, Evans et al. 2000). Wreathed Hornbill Aceros undulatus \uf0b7 Beung Kiat Ngong: three flew from north to south over the marsh late afternoon on 7 January; two did so mid-day on 16 January Wreathed Hornbill remains the most widespread and numerous large hornbill in Lao PDR but has much declined (Thewlis et al. 1998, Duckworth et al. 1999, Fuchs et al. 2007), including in the Pathoumphone area in the last 15 years. In 1992\u20131993, \u2015parties often flew over agricultural land and deciduous habitats to the north of Xe Pian [NPA] in December and January and may have been travelling to and from Dong Hua Sao [NPA]\u2016. The comparable search effort of sky in 2007\u20132008 gave only two such records. 2014 addition: A. Johnson & M. Hedemark (in litt. 2011) saw two Wreathed Hornbills over/near Kiatngong on 29 December 2010 and Wheatley (2012) saw three flying over Kiatngong (whether the village or the marsh is not stated) towards Phou Asa on 6 January 2012. 77 Asian Koel Eudynamys scolopacea \uf0b7 Nong Sam: one male seen on 13 December Calling is unusual in December\u2013January so Koel may be much more common than this sole record might suggest; it was common in Xe Pian NPA\u2018s northern zone in 1992\u20131993 (Thewlis et al. 1996), a survey which extended into the calling season. Koel is a brood-parasite on crows and mynas, and because these have such patchy, and in total low, populations in most of Lao PDR today, Koels are also scarce, particularly in the northern half of the country (Fuchs et al. 2007).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14c33013-6ac0-4048-aee4-11723b768537": {"__data__": {"id_": "14c33013-6ac0-4048-aee4-11723b768537", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The significance of the Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar site (Champasak province, Lao PDR) and its surroundings for biodiversity conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3215e1c2466d422acb9843b5b8d598ec3ab7c7a52231d81417d9591d4c1e01b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "112d1508-3437-4a8f-a39a-d71cf32b1805", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1f8d1190218505026707f73efaa55fa8d339e4a088ff25f48e47d60c5a18d1d"}}, "hash": "7e057c1844810b8a3def59e752774cf8e20a19bf6803b420ede728505dd8d3a5", "text": "2007).

More detailed data are not readily available for the earlier surveys. 2014 addition: All of Lao PDR\u2018s other species of parakeet are also severely declined. Oriental Turtle Dove Streptopelia orientalis \uf0b7 Ban Nongpop: one on 24 December; five, including one in song, in a different area near Ban Nongpop on 25 December; and song heard in a third area nearby on 26 December \uf0b7 Ban Thopsok: one near the road-turn to Ban Kiatngong on 6 January \uf0b7 Ban Kele-2: three on 16 January The current Lao distribution of Oriental Turtle Dove is patchy: some large populations remain, mostly in the South and Centre, but major declines have occurred in parts of at least North Lao PDR (Duckworth et al. 2002, Fuchs et al. 2007), presumably through human persecution. A complication in assessing national status is the unknown balance between 78 resident and seasonal immigrant populations: that no birds were recorded in Dong Hua Sao in the 1993 survey (May\u2013July) but were recorded in 1996 (February) and the present survey (December\u2013January) suggests that it is a winter visitor to this area. Spotted Dove Streptopelia chinensis Small numbers of Spotted Doves were almost ubiquitous (including around Ban Thangbeng); in good habitat (e.g. around Ban Thahou, Ban Nakok and Ban Nam-Om) densities were high, with many songsters audible and many sightings of singles and small groups each day. The current Lao distribution of Spotted Dove is patchy: large populations remain, mostly in the South and Centre, but major declines have affected parts of at least North Lao PDR (Duckworth et al. 2002, Fuchs et al. 2007), presumably reflecting human persecution. The lack of suggestion for decline in Pathoumphone since 1992\u20131996 is noteworthy given the steep falls in some other medium-sized non-forest birds.

The birds merely heard may have been free-flying or in cages (even that in Beung Kiat Ngong), while even the bird observed may not have been a genuine colonist but an escaped cagebird. However, colonization of Vientiane has proceeded rapidly and there seems no reason why this dove will not also establish in the plains non-forest areas of South Laos. 2014 addition: There are now many records of Peaceful Dove from many parts of Lao PDR; colonization has been extremely rapid (Duckworth, Timmins, D. Van Gansberghe unpubl. records). The species is not of direct conservation interest but is included for comparison with other pigeons and doves. Thick-billed Green Pigeon Treron curvirostra Small numbers of green pigeons, mostly not identified to species, were widespread. On the basis of birds that were identified, on the present survey and in 1992\u20131996, most or all were presumably this species. Only three concentrations of >30 were found: 60 (only one confirmed as this species) at Ban Nakok on 20 December; 47 (five confirmed as this species) flighting to roost over Ban Nongpop on 23 December; 60\u2013100+ (20+ confirmed as this species) at a fruiting tree near Ban Nongpop on 26 December. This pigeon remains widespread and locally common in Lao PDR (e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ea75edf-9a1b-466c-851d-5a8dd3b79b8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ea75edf-9a1b-466c-851d-5a8dd3b79b8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The significance of the Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar site (Champasak province, Lao PDR) and its surroundings for biodiversity conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdda7aae8755e8af74c506bfbf26c47e2978d90cc2d78f9d8331b5ef6c63de52"}, "2": {"node_id": "5304638b-6efe-498e-9524-1d63141e185e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3cb279148219e4d464c4dcd7a715342dae427a7b7c74f90f6fbdf41344f21d9c"}}, "hash": "4a26b02e911777cc275b8c5185852dae31252f52e2736c342c792679781f815c", "text": "This pigeon remains widespread and locally common in Lao PDR (e.g. Duckworth 1996, Thewlis et al. 1996, Duckworth et al. 1998, 2002, Evans & Timmins 1998, Evans et al. 2000, Brooks and S\u00f8rensen 2001, Fuchs et al. 2007) but there have been localized extinctions (e.g. Fuchs et al. 2007), presumably through hunting: the species, with a fair amount of meat per bird, forms large flocks and predictably visits fruiting trees and saltlicks, offering easy hunting opportunities at both types of site,.

Recent records come only from the far south (Thewlis et al. 1998, Pain et al. 2003). Declines in Pathoumphone have continued since the survey of Xe Pian in 1992\u20131993, when all three species were found, two of them frequently, in the northern zone (Thewlis et al. 1996): comparable amounts of sky-watching in 2007\u20132008 gave no records. Four White-rumped Vultures (two adults and two young) were seen circling above Ban Thangbeng on 30 June 2000. In interviews in 2005, vultures were reported in nearly half the interviews in Pathoumphone, and Ban Thongpha villagers stated that they regularly saw a few vultures and once in 2003 saw about 200 around a dead buffalo (Poulsen et al. 2005). Vulture status was discussed with various villagers, who all stated that they had not seen vultures for a decade or more, usually with a statement along the lines of \u2015but they only come when there are dead ungulates left lying outside, and there have not been any of those for years\u2016. This latter was attributed to advances in veterinary treatment and immediate use of domestic bovid carcases. It was usually stated that the birds would presumably come if a carcass was left out, on the assumption that they were still \u2017around\u2018. But, one man (in Ban Kiatngong) independently outlined exactly the theory developed by R. J. Timmins for decline in the region: there are far too few wild ungulates to support vulture populations, so the remaining birds rely on domestic stock for food. Heavily settled areas have too much persecution and too few carcases left out to for vultures to survive, so they are restricted to \u2017frontier\u2018 areas at the edge of human settlement. He said Xe Pian NPA\u2018s northern zone was such an area until a decade ago, but no longer: there are too many people and too effective hands-on husbandry of stock. Common Myna Acridotheres tristis \uf0b7 Ban Thangbeng: up to three on several days \uf0b7 Nong Sam: three on 4 January \uf0b7 Ban Nabon: one on 22 December, two on 23 December \uf0b7 Beung Kiat Ngong: three low over the Kele-2 sector on 16 January Common Myna was found during the early\u2013mid 1990s to be widespread and locally common in Lao PDR south of the Nakai plateau but there are only low numbers across most of the North, including in some areas where it was historically common (Duckworth et al. 2002, Fuchs et al. 2007). The declines presumably reflect over-harvest. In Vientiane, where it was scarce in the early 1990s (Duckworth & Tizard 2003), persecution of urban birds has eased in recent years, and numbers have risen rapidly (Duckworth unpubl.). It was only found occasionally in the northern zone of Xe Pian NPA in 1992\u20131993 and in Dong Hua Sao NPA in 1993 (Thewlis et al. 1996), so the current low numbers do not indicate any further decline. Larger numbers live in Ban Pathoumphone, perhaps associated with the irrigated paddies there and/or the Mekong channel: 16 were counted on 18 January. 80 Hill Myna Gracula religiosa Small numbers widespread, but the only flocks of ten or more were: 38+ near Ban Nongpop on 24 December; 28+ in a different area near Ban Nongpop on 25 December; 34+ in a third area of Ban Nongpop on 26 December; and ten near Ban Nam-Om on 6 January. Hill Myna was specifically noted as being common in 1992\u20131993 in degraded dry forest close to villages in Xe Pian and Dong Hua Sao NPAs; flocks (in all areas surveyed those years) only sometimes exceeded 20 (Thewlis et al. 1996, 1998). There is thus no suggestion of a further decline. However, numbers must be below natural levels, because the biggest flocks (flock- size being the best indicator of local population status) were in the eastern sites, furthest from route 13, with its ready access into wildlife trade. 81 Tables Table 1.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cdb1e8f-dcf5-45be-9117-fae0de396a5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cdb1e8f-dcf5-45be-9117-fae0de396a5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The significance of the Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar site (Champasak province, Lao PDR) and its surroundings for biodiversity conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3862b2b779cc3ad87cf53ab6c185d827236396a25bb544cdb2091bc068803d3"}, "2": {"node_id": "47f68ee5-4aa4-4154-9495-a80ccfbedfbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cde4fc66dfb07566c61359e90634ac3c55eaf176e51480f55c75f7c071ca223a"}}, "hash": "ded12ee84d77eb715bfe95473228af54beb835113fdcd30e367f5a1c50444b90", "text": "81 Tables Table 1.

(d.) jerdoni. (2) All Marsh Harriers seen showed characters of the eastern (sub)species C. (a.) spilonotus. (3) The Peregine seen was a full-masked, dark plumaged bird of presumed resident race. (4) Pond herons in non-breeding plumage cannot be identified safely to species; they identification of these birds is based solely on geographic locality. (5) Most, perhaps all Cecropia swallows were probably Striated Swallows of the resident race H. d. stanfordi. (6) All the surprisingly few White Wagtails seen were of the race M. a. leucopsis. (7) Abundance assessment includes only birds not identified to species. 88 Table 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af495485-63ac-4926-b1a9-97c3d1dec929": {"__data__": {"id_": "af495485-63ac-4926-b1a9-97c3d1dec929", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The significance of the Beung Kiat Ngong Ramsar site (Champasak province, Lao PDR) and its surroundings for biodiversity conservation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4442852328a91e388a12d23a13d2917ed6b8ee1d6095c9584995ba432a8115b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "7252c3fa-1244-4d6e-90a3-03f3b91ecaf5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/significance-beung-kiat-ngong-ramsar-site-champasak-province-lao-pdr-and", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b56a12bee9f973f4044ef96d49c0b01cd363abb01101eaf3d317bea1ff5f7f44"}}, "hash": "994b6f6d31d69948fcb04a8d76b0d8859fb8a06b62dd94a4a2bb3be11f3e2a6d", "text": "88 Table 4.

Introduction In October 2013, following a request by Mrs. Rataya Chantian, the President of the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation (a member of IUCN), the IUCN National Committee for Thailand asked the IUCN Secretariat to use its status as a respected, credible, science-based international organization to conduct a study into the proposed dam on the Mae Wong River, Nakhon Sawan Province, Thailand. This report is intended to give a brief overview of the history of this issue in Thailand, and address some of the concerns surrounding it - including the ecological value of the proposed dam site, the ongoing discussion over the dam's intended use as an irrigation or flood-prevention tool, and potential alternative mechanisms for water management in Thailand. Following a short discussion of these topics, it gives recommendations on how these issues might be resolved, and how water resources might most effectively and efficiently be managed in Thailand. 2.

The Proposed Mae Wong Dam Thailand's terrestrial agricultural production depends heavily on irrigation by the Chao Phraya river system, which includes the Sakae Krang River (of which the Mae Wong River is a tributary). As such, issues of water management are central to agriculture and economic development in Thailand. In recent decades, Thailand's agriculture and infrastructure have increasingly come under pressure from drought during the dry season (November to May), and flooding during the wet season (May to November). These pressures are compounded by the rapid intensification of agricultural production nationally (rice farmers now regularly harvest three or four crops each year, compared with one or two crops per year, historically). As a result, issues of water management have become increasingly politicized, with successive governments struggling to find sustainable solutions to this issue. History A dam on the Mae Wong River (Figure 1) has been proposed multiple times over the past 20 years. However, the precise location of such a dam has varied, and each proposal has been met with criticism from a variety of sources. Early proposals for a Mae Wong Dam focused on its role as an irrigation tool to provide water to cultivated land during the dry season. The proposed land to be irrigated included large parts of Mae Wong and Lat Yao Districts, Nakhon Sawan Province. 2 Figure 1 - Location of the proposed Mae Wong Dam. A proposal for a dam on the Mae Wong by the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) in 2003 led to the establishment of a 'National Specialist Committee on EHIA' (NSC), under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment's (MONRE's) Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning (ONEP). The NSC, with the Sakae Krang River Basin Committee, demanded the undertaking of a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), and the development of an Integrated Water Management Plan (IWMP) before any dam construction commenced. The SEA has since been completed by Kasetsart University, but has not been officially ratified, and so the results cannot be made public. This document assessed two potential sites for a Mae Wong Dam, in order to reduce potential negative impacts on the environment. Heavy flooding in Lat Yao district in 2006 prompted the then Minister of Natural Resources and Environment to propose a Mae Wong Dam again, this time described as a flood-control mechanism. Following strong criticism in the national media, primarily from Thai civil society, a government order suspended this dam proposal. 3 In 2010, the RID proposed to ONEP to re-start the Environmental Impact Assessment process (this time with an Environmental Health Impact Assessment - in accordance with the 2007 Thai constitution. This EHIA was subject to a stakeholder consultation process, including consultation with local communities, but the full process of consultation and approval was not completed. In 2011, lowland areas of Thailand suffered widespread flooding during the rainy season, putting the government again under pressure to identify mechanisms for the more effective management of Thailand's water resources. A new proposal for a Mae Wong Dam (THB 13.28 billion/USD 403 million) was approved by the Thai Government as part of the THB 350 billion (about USD 10.7 billion) IWMP, without the full approval of the EHIA. The IWMP included several water management projects from across the country, but was criticized by some as suffering from a lack of transparency. This Mae Wong Dam proposal described the dam as a flood-control mechanism, to assist with flood prevention on the central plain of Thailand. In April 2012, the Cabinet approved the Mae Wong Dam as a flagship project for flood prevention, despite the fact that the EHIA was not completed until later in 2012. The dam was to be constructed within MWNP, creating a reservoir measuring 291,000 rai (46,560 ha) in the rainy season, and 10,000 rai (1,600 ha) in the dry season, holding 200 million m3 of water - 30-40% of the input to the Sakae Krang River basin. Civil society responded with the publication of a book analyzing the results of this EHIA, with input from academia, and presenting counter-arguments against the construction of the dam.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "83da9bf1-1f67-4f72-88e2-8cc687e578e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "83da9bf1-1f67-4f72-88e2-8cc687e578e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of Thailand's proposed Mae Wong Dam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a22999a70c6fdfb6cecf286898b98569fed7f8234393a4cc46bbf040db0be601"}, "2": {"node_id": "fcefbe53-31bb-45ee-95f3-1f0d41c131ce", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de2421131efc29e3e6fbde37953e45a88cbdb03a110112f20558a50b25e39179"}}, "hash": "5d3a669d6a16ffcda08bd31e1adf850f2471e540299e9cf687d241957c53ec27", "text": "The NSC (a specialist committee including key members of the National Parks Board, managed by the National Environmental Board, which is in turn managed by ONEP) disagreed with the results of the EHIA, citing a lack of clear mitigation mechanisms for dealing with negative environmental impacts, a lack of clarity about the proposed dam's location, and a lack of clarity about the intended positive impacts of the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3001948c-465a-4ea4-94a2-dc1dc419d9ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "3001948c-465a-4ea4-94a2-dc1dc419d9ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of Thailand's proposed Mae Wong Dam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33dd9141c94b510a45ba416d2c80427b3e6b6bcc8edbd5392e37511f8cd741dd"}, "3": {"node_id": "058f21ea-534e-457d-9c65-99e1a0e54895", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9da78528aa67353fda33cefc1fecc2513b5186707ae51a75fe85810459948ee7"}}, "hash": "b61f2275fb60d4584809ab5319efc5e660a9d9131b9cd25970e07d2da2557548", "text": "dam. In early 2013, the NSC was re-shuffled, with some observers complaining that the members most concerned about environmental impacts were removed from the committee. In August, an amended EHIA was re-submitted to the government for approval. In September, the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation submitted a letter of protest to the Secretary of ONEP, and organized public demonstrations. In November, the NSC visited the proposed dam site. Many of their findings were not in line with those of the EHIA. Active campaigning against the construction of the Mae Wong Dam has been primarily led by the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation. Through their efforts, they have been very successful in raising the public profile of this issue within Thailand. In 2011, the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation started working with the Nakhon Sawan environmental network, including organizing demonstrations, and working with academics to raise awareness of the scientific basis to their arguments. Since 2012, they have continued to commission studies, organize seminars and press conferences, and produce books, posters, video clips and other materials aimed at raising awareness and engaging the public in this issue. Since the Mae Wong Dam project was integrated into the national IWMP, the public discourse now concerns water management at the national level, not just the Mae Wong Dam. In September 2013, Sasin Chalermlarp, Secretary-General of the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation and a high-profile environmental activist in Thailand, led a ten-day march from MWNP to Bangkok (a total distance of nearly 400km). Organized primarily over social media, this event saw Sasin and his team joined by student environmental groups, and many others who felt strongly about the issue. Eventually, tens of thousands of people were present for the latter stages of the march, generating heavy national media coverage. The public awareness generated by this event saw a petition calling for the scrapping of the dam signed by over 200,000 people. Following this campaign, the government conceded that the dam should be redesigned if it is to be used for flood mitigation purposes rather than irrigation of agricultural land. 4 Recent Developments In May 2014, the government of Yingluck Shinawatra was replaced by a military government, led by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army. Although this government has withdrawn the IWMP, the Mae Wong Dam may still be constructed as a stand-alone project. On the 20th November 2014, the NSC (chaired by Kasemsant Jinnowaso, Secretary-General of ONEP) recommended to the National Environment Board that plans for the dam be dropped. This recommendation was supported by the DNP. According to Deputy Prime Minister Plodprasop Suraswadi (Chairman of the Water and Flood Management Commission (WFMC)), the government intends to conduct a new study into the proposed dam's utility as a flood prevention mechanism. 3. Concerns about the Proposed Dam Following each periodic revival of political interest in the construction of a Mae Wong dam, each new proposal has been met with criticism from Thai civil society and international organizations. Environmental Impact Dam proponents emphasize that construction of the Mae Wong Dam would only inundate 18km2 of MWNP (1-2% of its area). However, it should be noted that development of this type within a national park is currently illegal under Thai law. If dam construction were to go ahead, this would appear to set a worrying precedent for infrastructure development within protected areas (PAs) in Thailand. While the direct impact of flooding (habitat destruction) would be limited to a small area, indirect impacts would likely affect a much larger area of MWNP. Improved access to the site (due to road construction), and increased human population during construction, would likely lead to a significant increase in illegal hunting of wildlife and illegal logging (particularly of high-value hardwood tree species). Effective management of the protected area would become more difficult and resource-intensive, and eventually the ecological value of MWNP and other parts of WEFCOM could become severely degraded.

Gibson et. al. (2013) surveyed small mammals in forest islands in Chiew Larn Reservoir, southern Thailand, and found \"near-complete extinction of native small mammal fauna\" 25 years after the forest was fragmented as a result of flooding 165km2 of forest in southern Thailand in 1986-1987. Although this is a much larger inundated area than would be created by the Mae Wong Dam, this demonstrates how habitat fragmentation can be just as significant a driver of biodiversity loss as habitat destruction. Irrigation Regarding the dam's function as an irrigation tool, some have asserted that the likely reservoir size would be too small to adequately irrigate the intended areas of Nakhon Sawan Province. Indeed, there are related problems with land-use planning elsewhere in the Chao Phraya basin - a number of reservoirs further downstream do not regularly contain 5 enough water to operate as intended. The Natural Resources and Environment Conservation Network believes that rather than irrigating almost 291,000 rai of farmland (as is claimed by the dam proponents), the dam would only benefit about 116,000 rai of farmland. Flood Control Regarding the dam's function as a flood control mechanism, critics have asserted that similarly, the likely reservoir size would be too small to function effectively in this manner. While it has been claimed that the Mae Wong Dam would help prevent flooding across the central plain of Thailand, and even as far downstream as Bangkok, research by the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation suggests that it would only reduce flood water levels in this region by less than 1%. Environmental Health Impact Assessment Critics of the most recent EHIA claim the following: -\u00ad\u2010 a lack of clarity about environmental impact mitigation measures; -\u00ad\u2010 a lack of detail on the precise location and architecture of the dam; -\u00ad\u2010 a lack of analysis on the expected positive impacts of the dam; -\u00ad\u2010 a lack of analysis about land-use changes in the affected area; -\u00ad\u2010 a lack of information about how water will be directed to communities; -\u00ad\u2010 a lack of mechanisms to ensure sufficient water will be available to down-stream communities. Critics also claim that the hydrological modeling used is not appropriately rigorous for informed decision-making. Some experts believe that in place of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) currently used, a distributed model (including an analysis of hydrology at multiple points along the river) would be more appropriate. Critics believe that the dam's potential benefits for national flood control and local irrigation have been significantly overstated by the dam's proponents. Some believe that the 2012 dam approval was motivated more by political and financial considerations, than a rigorous scientific assessment of its utility for flood control or irrigation. 4. The Western Forest Complex Thailand's Western Forest Complex (WEFCOM), the largest protected area complex in Thailand (about 18,000km2), is made up of 17 contiguous PAs (six wildlife sanctuaries and 11 national parks (see Table 2)). With forest cover nearing 80%, and habitat continuous with intact forests in Myanmar, this area is one of the most important remaining tracts of relatively intact forest in Southeast Asia; as such, it is of global importance for biodiversity. Elsewhere in Thailand, most forested areas (with the notable exception of the Eastern Forest Complex, and a handful of smaller PAs) have been converted to agricultural land. Mae Wong National Park (MWNP) was established in September 1987, as Thailand's 55th national park. Situated in the Thanon Thong Chai mountain range, one of the highest ranges in western Thailand (the highest peak within MWNP, Khao Mokoju, reaches 1,964m above sea level), MWNP is covered primarily by mixed deciduous and evergreen forest, and contains the source of the Mae Wong River, a tributary of the Sakae Krang River, itself part of the Chao Phraya River's drainage basin. MWNP is one of only three PAs in WEFCOM that has no communities living within its boundaries. Communities living in the surrounding area are of diverse ethnicities including Mon, Yao, Karen, Lahu, and Thai.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ec6a681-4df9-4805-ac29-12852240a871": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ec6a681-4df9-4805-ac29-12852240a871", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of Thailand's proposed Mae Wong Dam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eabcbc60bfc228b692ce6e5b041d78d10bd2bc049de690ac76f4c3101b029a46"}, "2": {"node_id": "54c21b62-f8ef-486f-8ddf-c282d64c7f7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "062e25d6c5e78ea94c71d0bfa589ddadbda03f23f6f56177361d3b4f9c3f8c3a"}}, "hash": "55d8ca48b2e28fa383e49bdf3ab3f9bd27ffcfd831f3cd7dc8c745dacc1e0f82", "text": "6 Table 2 - Thailand's Western Forest Complex Name Established Area (ha) Province(s) 1 Salakpra Wildlife Sanctuary 1965 2 Huai Kha Kaeng Wildlife Sanctuary 1972 278,014 Kanchanaburi, Tak, Uthai Thani 3,4 Thung Yai Naresuan (West and East) Wildlife Sanctuary 1974 369,000 Kanchanaburi, Tak 5 Khao Sanampriang Wildlife Sanctuary 10,100 Tak 6 Um Phang Wildlife Sanctuary Tak 7 Erawan National Park 1975 55,000 Kanchanaburi 8 Chaloem Rattanakosin National Park 1980 5,900 Kanchanaburi 9 Sai Yok National Park 1980 50,000 Kanchanaburi 10 Si Nakharin National Park 1981 153,200 Kanchanaburi 11 Khlong Lan National Park 1982 42,000 Kamphaeng Phet 12 Mae Wong", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbb7605d-d0dd-4862-b976-06642cc725c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbb7605d-d0dd-4862-b976-06642cc725c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of Thailand's proposed Mae Wong Dam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fbf5ec82140215358d0dbe5e3b9b5e27dbc7f51d9eb7701c17c2c279cc799b31"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d45a771-12e9-4bcd-8a58-962819faf83f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a395bf74c60c1c0540f4e2029e6d302b2d5db6836cff2bc15232c96599af93e"}}, "hash": "456191331a7a1bf890997e986c46aaeba28586250a10c484b4ce683b924d8b08", "text": "National Park 1987 89,400 Nakhon Sawan, Kamphaeng Phet 13 Phu Toei National Park 1987 31,900 Suphanburi 14 Khlong Wang Chao National Park 1990 74,700 Kamphaeng Phet, Tak 15 Khao Laem National Park 1987 149,700 Kanchanaburi 16 Thong Pha Pum National Park 112,000 Kanchanaburi 17 Lam Khlong Ngu National Park 60,000 Kanchanaburi Source: Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.

Since then, however, much of the forest has shown a marked recovery. Large specimens of hardwood tree species including teak may be found, and populations of mammals such as sambar are now becoming well established. While this recovery (in stark contrast to the trend elsewhere in the region) is very encouraging, it will only be sustained if the integrity of the PA is maintained, and threats to its biodiversity are successfully mitigated. Mae Wong National Park now includes large areas of flat, low-lying deciduous forest and riparian grassland, habitat types that are now very rare in Southeast Asia, and heavily under-represented in Thailand's PA system (which currently focuses primarily on mountainous areas).

Figure 3 - Grassland and forest habitats of MWNP \u00a9 Wildlife Research Group/DNP The forests of WEFCOM are home to many species that are no longer commonly found elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Notable mammals found here include the tiger (listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List) (100-120 individuals are thought to be found within WEFCOM), sambar (listed as Vulnerable) (an important tiger prey species), banteng (Endangered), gaur (Vulnerable), wild water buffalo (Endangered), Malayan tapir (Endangered), Asian elephant (Endangered), three species of otter, some primate species, and some wild cats. Over 490 bird species are found in WEFCOM, including green peafowl (Endangered), Gurney's pitta (Endangered), six species of hornbill (including rufous-necked hornbill (Vulnerable) and plain-pouched hornbill (Vulnerable), and 20 species of woodpecker. However, there remain significant threats to the biodiversity of WEFCOM. These include habitat loss and degradation (due to illegal logging, clearance for agriculture, and infrastructure development), and the poaching of wildlife (at least three tigers were killed in 2010 alone). Several local and international NGOs are working to support the Thai Government and local communities in securing the protection of this site. For the last ten years, the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation (one of Thailand's most respected environmental NGOs) has been working alongside communities in WEFCOM in order to encourage them not to expand their cultivated land 9 into intact forest, and to assist them with the development of sustainable community forestry programs. International groups including the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have focused on assisting the Thai Government to improve law enforcement (including through training rangers, and implementing SMART patrolling (since 2006 in Huai Kha Kaeng) and MIST (since 2008)), and conduct biodiversity monitoring. As a result, PAs such as Huai Kha Kaeng have seen a decline in illegal land clearance, a stabilization of hunting levels, and some decreases in rates of logging (although these decreases have not always been sustained). On 7th November 2014, the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation held a seminar at Kasetsart University on the biodiversity of Mae Wong National Park (\"Mae Wong Dam Seminar: new information and findings\"). At this event, the Department of National Parks presented the results of research conducted by the DNP wildlife research group at the site of the proposed Mae Wong Dam reservoir, between October 2012 and August 2013. This research identified 442 species within the national park (32 amphibians, 42 reptiles, 279 birds, and 87 mammals), including 272 species at the dam reservoir site itself (24 amphibians, 22 reptiles, 171 birds, and 55 mammals). These figures are significantly higher than those found within the Mae Wong Dam EHIA (which identifies only 239 species), and those of previous studies. Notable records from this research include a newly-discovered species of horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sp.) (yet to be named), Walston's tube-nosed Bat (Murina walstoni) (a recently-discovered species previously only known from Cambodia and Vietnam), the Kakhyen Hills spiny lizard (Salea Kakhienensis) (a new record for Thailand - normally found in western Yunnan, Myanmar, and eastern India), the Doi Suthep Caecilian (Ichthyophis youngorum) (first found at Doi Suthep in northern Thailand - this is the second record in Thailand in 53 years), and a new species of bowfingered gecko (Cyrtodactylus sp.). Based on these findings, it is clear that the low-lying riverine forest is of great importance for biodiversity. It seems likely that further research will highlight more species, previously unknown to science.

These source sites currently contain about 2,200 tigers - nearly 70% of the global population (WCS/GTI, 2010). The only other recognized tiger source site in SE Asia is Nam Et - Phou Louey National Protected Area in Lao PDR, which may now contain as few as two individuals (WCS, 2013). There is no evidence of breeding populations in Vietnam or Cambodia. Huai Kha Kaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, and by extension the rest of Thailand's WEFCOM, can therefore be considered the most important site for tigers in SE Asia. As Huai Kha Kaeng itself is now likely at carrying capacity for this species, sites elsewhere in WEFCOM, such as MWNP now become a priority for tiger conservation nationally. Since 2010, WWF has been working at Mae Wong and Khlong Lan National Parks through their Global Tiger Recovery Program. This work consists of tiger and prey monitoring (camera trapping, scat analysis, and prey studies), efforts to strengthen law enforcement at the sites (by training rangers, and implementing SMART patrolling), and community education and outreach work (building a network of schools in communities surrounding the sites). Figure 5- Tigers in MWNP \u00a9Wildlife Research Group/DNP 11 As a result of this work and surveys implemented by the Thai Government (2011-2012 WEFCOM mammal survey), there is now clear evidence of breeding tigers dispersing from Huai Kha Kaeng to Mae Wong, including photographs of individual tigers in Huai Kha Kaeng, and then again in Mae Wong some months later. MWNP may now be home to as many as 20 tigers. In 2014, WWF obtained photo and video evidence of three breeding females in MWNP. The tiger populations in HKK and MWNP are now the only confirmed breeding tiger populations in SE Asia, and one of only four populations globally that have successfully recovered from very low population densities (the other examples are in the far east of Russia, India's Western Ghats, and in Nepal). An increase in MWNPs tiger population must be due both to dispersal from Huai Kha Kaeng and an increase in prey densities (particularly sambar and wild boar) in MWNP. One of Mae Wong's breeding females in 2014 is currently raising three cubs - requiring her to hunt about 5,000kg of meat/year. This is the same litter size as is found in parts of India, where tiger prey densities are typically 10-100 times what is found in Thailand. While tiger prey species such as sambar are still not common in Mae Wong as a whole, there must be pockets (in low-lying deciduous forest, such as the recently recovered forest surrounding the Mae Re Wa River), with high population densities. Indeed, a 2012 biodiversity occupancy survey conducted by the Wildlife Conservation Office of the Department of National Parks found tiger tracks near the Mae Re Wa river and in the surrounding hills, accompanied by evidence of tiger prey species sambar, wild pig and muntjac. Figure 6 - Tiger cubs in MWNP \u00a9Wildlife Research Group/DNP In January 2010, at the First Asia Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation (1st AMC), the Thai Government endorsed the Hua Hin Declaration on Tiger Conservation. This document recognized the \"crisis of extinction\" that is facing global tiger populations, and reaffirmed commitments to implement national tiger conservation efforts - focusing on landscapes, law enforcement and illegal trade, management, communities, sustainable financing, and accelerated implementation of national and regional tiger conservation programs. 12 Table 4 - Thailand Tiger Action Plan 2010-2022: Vision, Goals and Objectives Vision By 2022, tigers have recovered and thrive in the priority landscapes managed under high standard interventions and monitoring systems, and Thailand has become a strong support for international collaborations on tiger and wildlife conservation and protected area management in Southeast Asia. 2-year Goals 1.

This plan highlighted the importance of WEFCOM for global tiger conservation, emphasized Thailand's role as a world leader in tiger conservation best practices, science and policy, and committed to a framework of eight goals, 19 objectives and 51 activities (see Table 4). Efforts to monitor and secure the growing tiger population in MWNP would appear to align well with all stated goals, and particularly objectives 1, 3, 7, and 11. 4. Mechanisms for Water Management At various times, the Mae Wong Dam has been proposed as both a tool for irrigation of dry-season agriculture, and as a tool for preventing rainy-season flooding. However, there does not yet appear to be a consensus on how effectively the proposed dam would function at either of these roles. In 2013, Lat Yao town, Nakhon Sawan province was again subject to serious flooding. Local media reports at the time were vocal in calling for the construction of a dam to prevent this from happening again. However, research conducted by Kasetsart University concluded that the flooding was caused not by the lack of a dam on the Mae Wong river, but by the ineffective management of water resources, basin-wide. In particular, two key flood gates upstream from the town (designed to direct water away from the town in times of high flood risk) did not appear to have been properly utilized. Researchers studied the cases of flooding in the region, in order to provide recommendations to the dam proponents. In many cases, the primary cause of flooding appears to be inappropriate construction (particularly of roads and houses) in the river's natural flood-way. Reclamation of land for construction severely reduces the drainage capacity of the flood-way, leading to flash-flooding and the destruction of property. In some cases, urbanization has replaced wide klongs (canals), with smaller underground channels, more easily overloaded by rainy-season water flow. While it is clear that work needs to be done to solve the problems of water management in Nakhon Sawan Province (and nation-wide), experts recommend that the various available options be fully assessed for effectiveness and efficiency, before any decision to build a Mae Wong Dam is made.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f3f8e98-2083-4b75-83c0-9acd28659401": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f3f8e98-2083-4b75-83c0-9acd28659401", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of Thailand's proposed Mae Wong Dam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6ddc9a56b3dee0d2eb1c165947f6e6fcde36f297ef1a055b465abdc08419122f"}, "2": {"node_id": "08bb4206-35a1-4d45-b4b6-c887137187dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66f9ee0de099540e4b7f43553f27c3ffb821ac8e2de7d5574d99a8ced7a1a7a1"}}, "hash": "3ffaef1d9cb8f3ad246a937b057f73b4fc40678a7cd3ccba5af20631765a8c0e", "text": "Here, we present a brief summary of some of the alternative options for consideration: Existing Infrastructure Between the proposed Mae Wong Dam site and the town of Lat Yao, four small check-dams are already in place, designed to manage water flow at times of high flood risk.

In addition, Lat Yao town has an extensive drainage system including check-dams, canals, levees, and drainage ditches, all designed to aid the flow of water downstream. Unfortunately, in recent years, many of these have fallen into disrepair - control structures have not been well maintained, drainage ditches have been blocked by debris from construction and plastic waste, and poorly-planned road and building construction has rendered some of them no longer fit for purpose. As a priority, an assessment should be undertaken into which control structures are currently in use, which are in need of repair, and what the likely cost of repair would be. A rapid assessment indicates that several of these structures are relatively new, and could be brought back into full use at relatively little cost. The more effective use of existing infrastructure may well be an efficient strategy for addressing issues of water management in Nakhon Sawan province, and certainly should be undertaken in order to compliment any other investments made. Unfortunately, to date there appears to have been little political will to do this, with instead a focus on the revenue-generating opportunities of large new infrastructure projects. 14 Additional Small Weirs As mentioned above, between MWNP and the town of Lat Yao, four small check-dams have previously been constructed. One option, first proposed by an EHIA consultant and worth investigating in more detail, is the expansion of this system into a chain of 12 small weirs - designed to minimize impact on fish passage. Researchers at Kasetsart University have looked into the option of complementing this system with a chain of small storage ponds (connected to the small weirs, and sometimes referred to as 'monkey cheeks') and believe that this may be a cost-effective mechanism for providing dry-season irrigation water and rainy-season flood prevention. Although groundwater may currently be found in some places only 30-40cm below the surface, it is thought that the option of complementing this system with the pumping of groundwater is not likely to be a sustainable approach. Community-Based Solutions In recent years, as the public debate about the Mae Wong Dam has evolved into a nation-wide discussion on water resources management, much of the dialogue and decision-making has remained at the level of the national government. However, the most effective and efficient solutions may be found to lie at the community level. There is one pilot project already operating in Mae Wong division, with technical input from Mahidol University. A small community-based reforestation and irrigation project is now storing water for use by 220 households during the dry season. Similar initiatives could concevably be scaled-up to provide water security for much of Nakhon Sawan province, at a much lower cost (economic and environmental) than large dam-building projects. The value of local knowledge about hydrology and water resources management must not be understated when planning local and national-level water resources projects. The residents of Nakhon Sawan province are very keen to provide input to the planning of new projects, but so far many feel that their recommendations have not been adequately incorporated into the EHIA. Kasetsart University is currently working with a number of affected communities, to help address this issue. Some experts have recommended a 'jigsaw' model of water management, with each piece representing an area of locally-managed agricultural land. In this model, each jigsaw piece would include a small storage pond, connected to its neighbors, and to the main river channel. Such a locally-managed system would provide flood relief during the rainy season, and if coupled with investment in modern irrigation techniques, would allow for the efficient use of stored water during the dry season. 5. Conclusions/Recommendations IUCN recognizes the need for Thailand to take steps to resolve national issues of water resources management, in order to secure the nation's irrigation system, and reduce the impacts of floods and droughts. In this particular case, however, it would appear that the environmental costs of dam construction would outweigh the positive impacts on national water resources management. MWNP is part of a protected landscape of global importance, forms a buffer zone for a World Heritage Site, includes a habitat type of great ecological value that has been mostly eradicated elsewhere in SE Asia, and is home to a globally-significant and recovering population of tigers in addition to a number of other globally threatened species. The information reviewed during the preparation of this report suggests that the construction of a dam within MWNP does have the potential to negatively impact both the integrity and 'Outstanding Universal Value' of the Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuaries", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2b48cd1-0c1d-49ff-a3a4-a7dfe4ec04b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2b48cd1-0c1d-49ff-a3a4-a7dfe4ec04b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A review of Thailand's proposed Mae Wong Dam", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/review-thailands-proposed-mae-wong-dam", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1af3ed88b5c8526d2614fff79bf425f30f99cce87153572b8bbd5f7891d0937"}}, "hash": "c1af3ed88b5c8526d2614fff79bf425f30f99cce87153572b8bbd5f7891d0937", "text": "World Heritage Site. Habitat destruction and increased poaching in MWNP related to dam construction would be likely eventually to 'spill over' into the World Heritage property, impacting its Outstanding Universal Value as recognized under criteria (ix) and (x). These concerns were raised in November 2012 by the Director of the World Heritage Centre, in a letter to the Government of Thailand. Furthermore, the evidence generated by the 2011-2012 WEFCOM mammal survey that individual tigers utilize habitats both in MWNP and in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary suggests that the construction of a Mae Wong Dam in its proposed location could impact directly on the tiger population in the World Heritage Site through loss of dispersal habitat and a reduced prey base. 15 On the 7th November 2014, at a seminar at Kasetsart University organized by the Seub Nakhasathien Foundation, the Department of National Parks confirmed their intention to propose the expansion of the Thungyai-Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuaries World Heritage site to include Mae Wong National Park, and adjacent Klong Lan National Park. Aside from environmental considerations, significant knowledge gaps still remain about how successful the Mae Wong Dam would be as a tool for irrigation and flood prevention. While it is likely that its construction would have some utility under both of these functions (locally, if not nation-wide), it seems unlikely that this will be sufficient to justify the scale of the investment or the environmental cost. As a priority, assessments should be undertaken of the proposed dam and the alternative water management options available. Alternative options may be shown to be as (or more) effective, significantly cheaper, and less destructive. 16 Key References Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation. 2010. \"Thailand Tiger Action Plan 2010-2022\".

SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN 2002\u20132007 FOR RICORD\u2019S IGUANA, Cyclura ricordii 2 F Male Ricord\u2019s iguana ( Cyclura ricordii ) Photograph by Thomas Wiewandt 3 SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN 2002\u20132007 FOR RICORD\u2019S IGUANA, Cyclura ricordii F Foreword A s a group, the giant iguanas of the West Indies are the most endangered lizards in the world, primarily because much of their island habitat has been eliminated by human development or severely degraded by invasive species. Five of the eight species are ranked as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, with a 50% chance of extinction within the next ten years in the absence of immediate and intensive conservation intervention. One of these is Ricord\u2019s iguana, Cyclura ricordii, found only in the Dominican Republic, with an estimated remaining population of no more than 2,000\u20134,000 individuals. As the only country in the world to naturally support two species of rock iguanas, Cyclura ricordii and Cyclura cornuta, the Dominican Republic represents a special biogeographic situation with unique conservation challenges. We know from a variety of recent studies that West Indian iguanas, as the dominant native herbivores on islands where they occur, play a crucial ecological role in terms of promoting foliage growth through cropping, providing nutrients to developing seedlings, and dispersing seeds into new habitats. The dry scrub cactus forests of the West Indies are among the most imperiled plant communities in the world. Preservation of native iguana populations in the Dominican Republic represents a significant step toward maintaining these natural habitats in a healthy and self-sustaining state. On 17\u201318 November 2002, members of the IUCN SSC Iguana Specialist Group met with local experts in Santo Domingo to draft this cooperative species recovery plan for Ricord\u2019s iguana. The overall goal of the plan is to prioritize the conservation actions necessary to ensure the long-term survival of Ricord\u2019s iguana throughout its natural range. The work presented here details management of the wild population, restoration and maintenance of high quality native habitat, expansion of captive propagation efforts, implementation of education awareness programs, and mobilization of the financial, technical, and human resources. Achieving these objectives will preserve an important and unique component of Dominican natural heritage for all future generations to enjoy and appreciate. Clearly, the high quality of local expertise and strong commitment within the government, academic, and NGO communities of the Dominican Republic offer tremendous optimism for the future of this magnificent species. Our collective hope is that this comprehensive strategy will inspire funding agencies and the international conservation community to provide the ongoing attention this worthy recovery program deserves.

These initial studies will provide the necessary information to propose protection for all the areas critical to the survival of this species. The assessment is expected to emphasize the need for extension of Parque Nacional Jaragua in the Cabo Rojo - Pedernales area, which is already under consideration. Support for these measures from local communities will be sought and maintained through a major public awareness and education effort, led mainly by Grupo Jaragua throughout the areas where Ricord\u2019s iguana still occurs. In Santo Domingo, the role Parque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional plays in public awareness for Ricord\u2019s iguana will be expanded. After initial studies are complete, the results will be reviewed in a planning workshop that will provide important terms of reference for a future management plan for the protected areas supporting Ricord\u2019s iguana populations. Threats to Ricord\u2019s iguanas such as feral predators and habitat degradation will be prioritized and then progressively managed, reduced or eliminated within protected areas of Ricord\u2019s iguana habitat. Restoration of native vegetation communities in areas that have been seriously degraded by grazing animals will be attempted. In-depth research into the distribution, abundance and ecology of Ricord\u2019s iguana will be carried out to gain an understanding of the many issues which are likely to influence effective conservation management. The feasibility of maintaining Ricord\u2019s iguana in captivity will be investigated with two adult pairs at Parque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional, with the potential of supplying offspring to display for education and awareness purposes in other locations both within Santo Domingo and the Parque Nacional Jaragua area. Funding to implement this plan will be secured from a variety of local and international grants, supplemented with educational retail products that will be sold within the Dominican Republic and internationally. A newly formed Ricord\u2019s Iguana Recovery Group, supported by the members of the IUCN-SSC Iguana Specialist Group and the International Iguana Foundation, will implement the plan in the Dominican Republic. 5 SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN 2002\u20132007 FOR RICORD\u2019S IGUANA, Cyclura ricordii F Contents Foreword ........................................................................................................................... 3 Executive Summary.......................................................................................................... 4 Contents........................................................................................................................... 5 Species Recovery Plan 1.1 Current assessment........................................................................................ 6 1.2 Conservation actions implemented up to 2002.............................................. 7 1.3 Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats............................................ 7 Overall Goal 2.0 Overall goal statement................................................................................... 11 Objectives, Specific Results and Action Steps 3.1 Objective: Establish management for wild Ricord\u2019s iguana............................ 12 3.2 Objective: Restore and maintain habitats...................................................... 15 3.3 Objective: Expand and maintain captive facilities.......................................... 19 3.4 Objective: Institute long-term education and awareness programs................. 22 3.5 Objective: Identify and mobilize resources..................................................... 26 Appendices 4.1 Table of costs by year.................................................................................... 28 4.2 Maps............................................................................................................. 29 4.3 List of workshop participants....................................................................... 31 4.4 Addresses and contacts, primary individuals and institutions......................... 32 4.5 IUCN/SSC Iguana Specialist Group annual meeting photograph................. 34 Director of the Parque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional, Dr. Alfonso Ferreira, displays Ricord\u2019s iguana hatchlings, marking the resumption of successful captive breeding at ZooDom in 2002.

Mating seems to occur between March and May. Eggs are usually laid in May or June, in nests excavated in the soil. Average clutch size is 11 eggs. Ricord\u2019s iguanas appear to develop social hierarchies more than territoriality, using relatively small patches of appropriate substrate to excavate their burrows in high densities. Neonates and young often occupy arboreal retreats, and rock holes may be used. 7 SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN 2002\u20132007 FOR RICORD\u2019S IGUANA, Cyclura ricordii F Hatchlings may be preyed upon by Alsophis anomalus in the Enriquillo Lake area (although this is also a critically endangered species with what seems to be very low populations), by some birds (great blue herons and others), mongooses and feral and domestic cats and dogs. Adults do not have natural predators. 1.1.4 Conservation issues. Habitat destruction both in the Enriquillo and Pedernales ranges is the main threat. Land is being converted from wild habitats to agriculture, pasture and other uses. New mining activities are being initiated in some of the areas and intensive tourism is expected to be developed, all these creating speculation for real estate development (including fencing and clearing of lands). Feral and domestic cats prey on hatchlings and young animals, and feral and domestic dogs on adults and sub-adults. Trapping and shooting does not seem to be an important factor at present. 1.2 Conservation actions implemented as of 2002 Ricord\u2019s iguana has been legally protected over the last decades. Part of the range of each sub-population has been legally protected (Cabritos/Enriquillo Lake National Park since 1974, and Jaragua National Park since 1983). ZooDom (Parque Zool\u00f3gico Nacional), with assistance from Indianapolis and Toledo Zoos, recently restarted the Ricord\u2019s iguana captive breeding program. Grupo Jaragua has promoted both Cyclura ricordii and Cyclura cornuta awareness and education activities, including the publication of a set of three books for preschoolers (5,000 copies each). 1.3 Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats These factors are assessed here for Ricord\u2019s iguana and the current conservation program as of November 2002. 1.3.1 Strengths a) High biodiversity occurs in association with Ricord\u2019s iguana habitats b) Established national parks exist in Ricord\u2019s iguana\u2019s range SPECIES RECOVERY PLAN 2002\u20132007 FOR RICORD\u2019S IGUANA, Cyclura ricordii 8 F c) Effective management is in place for Isla Cabritos in the Lago Enriquillo Ramsar site (by the Secretar\u00eda de Estado de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, Subsecretar\u00eda de \u00c1reas Protegidas y Biodiversidad).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d7621d1-6fef-4e9a-aa74-3834db2fdc01": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d7621d1-6fef-4e9a-aa74-3834db2fdc01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/ricords-iguana-cyclura-ricordii-species-recovery-plan-2002-2007", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Ricord's iguana.

Document Design and Layout by the International Reptile Conservation Foundation Anegada Iguana, Cyclura pinguis, 2006\u20132010 Species Recovery Plan 3 F Foreword & Executive Summary Collectively, the West Indian iguanas of the genus Cyclura represent the single most endangered group of lizards in the world. Many populations have been drastically reduced because their island habitat has been eliminated by human development, or severely impacted by invasive species. Recent IUCN Red List assessments rank five of the existing nine species as Critically Endangered, with a 50% chance of extinction within the next ten years without intensive conservation intervention. Of these five species, the Anegada iguana, Cyclura pinguis, is considered the most primitive of the genus, and basal to the remaining eight descendent species. From a genetic diversity standpoint, conserving C. pinguis will preserve the greatest amount of evolutionary potential within the genus Cyclura. For these reasons the conservation of the Anegada iguana consistently ranks as the top priority for the IUCN/ SSC Iguana Specialist Group (ISG). Given that C. pinguis formerly existed on Puerto Rico according to the fossil record (and there is speculation that it ranged more extensively throughout the Puerto Rican Bank) perhaps a more appropriate name would be the Puerto Rican Bank iguana. Nevertheless the species is now restricted to several small islands in the British Virgin Islands (BVI). Only one of these is considered a \u2018native\u2019 population in that the others are the result of human- mediated introductions. At least four islands in the BVI now support small populations of C. pinguis, one of which (Guana) is large enough to be considered biologically significant. However the most important and robust population, not only from a conservation genetics and management perspective but for political reasons as well, is the one living on Anegada. Estimated at 200 \u2013 300 adult iguanas, this population, until recently, consisted primarily of aging adults with minimal recruitment due to feral cat predation on hatchling iguanas. This remnant population survives in a degraded environment with reduced plant diversity due to introduced grazing mammals \u2013 goats, cattle, donkeys \u2013 that have literally \u2018torched\u2019 the landscape in several key areas. Biologists began studying the iguana population on Anegada in the 1960s, documenting depleted populations and sounding an early warning for the species\u2019 future. Continued population declines were observed in the 1980s and 1990s, with an estimated 80% numerical decline since the late 1960s. By the mid-1990s the species was considered to be at a critical juncture. The ISG, at their organizational meeting in Miami in 1996, recommended a headstarting program aimed at overcoming high juvenile mortality. That program got underway in 1997 and since then over 150 young iguanas have been placed in a headstarting facility on Anegada, built in 1998; hatchlings have been collected for the program every year from 1997 to 2006. Beginning in 2003, repatriation of iguanas back into the wild began, with 24 released per year through 2005, and 29 in 2006, for a total of 101; overall survival has been encouraging, at 86%. Based on habitat use patterns it appears that the environment on Anegada is still below carrying capacity and will likely support a larger wild population. The core iguana habitat, particularly the nesting areas, is concentrated along the north coast of Anegada, at Bones and Windlass Bight.

Hosted by the BVI National Parks Trust (NPT), the workshop brought together NPT staff with members of the ISG and other local participants and was facilitated by Mark Day of Flora and Fauna International. Though a range of important topics were identified, and recommendations made, this Plan was not published and became outdated. In April 2004 a group of participants from the ISG and BVI NPT reconvened to revisit and update the Plan, hosted by the Miami Metrozoo. The resulting Species Anegada Iguana, Cyclura pinguis, 2006\u20132010 Species Recovery Plan 4 F Recovery Plan, 2006 \u2013 2010, has as the overall goal to restore a self-sustaining population of Anegada iguanas on the island of Anegada. The work presented here is outlined under seven broad objectives including invasive species control programs, enhancing effectiveness of the headstart \u2013 release program to maximize recruitment, collection of scientific data to aid in the long-term recovery and management of the wild population, protection of sufficient high quality habitat to insure long-term population viability, implementation of a public outreach program using the iguana as a flagship species, securing sufficient financial resources for SRP implementation and ensuring effective program oversight and coordination. The tasks that lie before us will not be achieved easily or without commitment and dedication from a wide range of individuals and organizations, both internationally and within the BVI. The strength of this process is that such a group already exists, hampered only by the lack of financial resources. Though this program has, over the years, attracted generous support from the conservation donor community and the participating institutions, saving the Anegada iguana on Anegada will require perhaps a twenty-fold increase in funding; the invasive species control program alone is estimated to run into the millions of dollars. It is our genuine hope that this SRP document will sufficiently elevate the visibility of this worthy program so as to inspire funding agencies and the international conservation community to take decisive action. Locally, the resolution of the long-simmering land tenure issue will be a pivotal moment for the iguana on Anegada and the next ten years will likely prove to the be the ultimate test of their survival. Will the last native Anegada iguana population persist naturally, or will it become relegated to small privately owned islands in the BVI and elsewhere? Speaking collectively for the ISG we have chosen to pursue the former course and are committed to making a stand on Anegada.

Conservation biologists estimate the current population to be less than 300 animals with near zero recruitment. Wild populations are known to have occurred on Puerto Rico during the late Pleistocene, but the species is believed to have been restricted naturally by climate change to Anegada before the arrival of Amerindians. European settlement of the British Virgin Islands resulted in the introduction of invasive mammalian predators and livestock to Anegada that have markedly accelerated the decline of the species. The natural wild population is now largely restricted to the Bones Bight\u2013Windlass Bight\u2013Western Ponds complex area of Anegada. A population of approximately 100 iguanas was established on Guana Island from eight founders in the 1980s, and small numbers of juveniles from the Guana population were subsequently translocated to Necker, Norman, and Little Thatch Islands. 1.3 Habitat requirements and limiting factors West Indian iguana species in the genus Cyclura evolved within Caribbean dry forest scrub habitats. The Anegada iguana is the largest native terrestrial animal in the British Virgin Islands and also the dominant herbivore. Almost exclusively herbivorous, Anegada iguanas are known to eat 25 plant species, representing 21 plant families. Of these, five, when in fruit, are extremely important seasonal dietary components, indicating that iguanas are highly selective in their food preferences. Iguanas inhabit areas that are regularly interspersed with large trees. In sandy areas these are most often seagrape (Coccoloba uvifera), whereas in rocky areas these are most often loblolly (Pisonia subcordata). Trees seem to be important for both cover and shade. Iguana retreats are often located beneath trees in both habitats, and in rocky habitats, rock slabs lifted by the growing roots of large trees sometimes provide the only available subterranean cover. As expected for a territorial and polygynous species, adult males have larger home ranges (and presumably territories) than adult females. There is considerable overlap in home range among animals, but adult males generally have centres of activity that are exclusive of one another (Mitchell 1999). In general, mating occurs in the spring near the end of the dry season. Females excavate tunnels with an egg chamber in sand or soil early in the summer wet season, then eggs incubate over the summer months when temperatures are highest and rainfall is relatively frequent. Juveniles emerge from nests in late summer or early fall when food resources are abundant. Some circumstantial evidence of natal homing exists (Gerber 2000). Anegada Iguana, Cyclura pinguis, 2006\u20132010 Species Recovery Plan 8 F 1.4 Conservation Issues Anegada iguanas evolved without large mammalian predators or competitors, and as a result, the principal threats to the survival of Anegada iguanas are predation by introduced mammalian predators, especially cats, competition with introduced mammalian herbivores, especially goats, cattle, and donkeys, and habitat loss and degradation caused by humans. Trampling of burrows by introduced livestock is also a serious concern. No Anegada iguanas exist within a formally managed area, although declaration of the existing Ramsar site on Anegada as a national park has been proposed. The current lack of a comprehensive plan to address invasive species management and protected areas management are key limiting factors. A headstart facility has been established by the British Virgin Islands National Parks Trust (BVI NPT) on Anegada; it can house up to 80 animals, is fully operational, and has repatriated 101 animals to the wild since 2003. A research programme led by IUCN Iguana Specialist Group (ISG) biologists is actively investigating the optimum age and size at which to release headstarted juveniles into the wild, with funding from the International Iguana Foundation (IIF), the IUCN Sir Peter Scott Fund for Conservation, AZA Conservation Endowment Fund, Nando Peretti Foundation, and others. A small ex situ population at the San Diego has produced 12 hatchlings to date, which will ideally form the basis for a genetically managed population in the U.S. to serve as a hedge against catastrophic losses on Anegada.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e52a3c4d-495b-4acb-a357-0548cfe948b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e52a3c4d-495b-4acb-a357-0548cfe948b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/anegada-iguana-cyclura-pinguis-species-recovery-plan-2006-2010", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Anegada iguana, Cyclura pinguis.

Introduction This report presents an overview of the workshops and meetings held in the Maldives during the week 23-\u00ad\u201027 March 2015 as part of the Resilience-\u00ad\u2010based Management theme under IUCN Project REGENERATE. It includes incidental observations made during the meetings and associated site visits that may have relevance to the current and future work under this project. It concludes with recommendations for future directions for advancing coral reef management in the Maldives under Project REGENERATE. The workshops have been facilitated by Dr. Paul Marshal, Adjunct Associate Professor at the Centre for Biodiversity & Conservation Science, University of Queensland as consultant reef management expert to project REGENERATE. He was supported by the Senior Project Officers of Project REGENERATE Dr Patrik Svensson and Dr Agnese Mancini. This report has been prepared mainly Dr Paul Marshall and Dr Agnese Mancini (Day Two -\u00ad\u2010 Discussion), with input from Munshidha Ibrahim, Abdulla Fisam, Fathimath Nistharan, Aminath Afau, and Doroth\u00e9e Herr. 4 2. Mathiveri workshop with community leaders, atoll councillors and resort managers 2.1 Background The workshop was held 23rd (full day) and 24th (half day) March 2015 in Mathiveri. The workshop was well attended by island community leaders and atoll councillors (see Annex 1). While there were fewer representatives from resorts, those that did participate were actively engaged and represent key nodes for future work with resorts. The aim of the workshop was to enable local communities of the islands of North Ari Atoll to understand and prioritize climate change risks to marine resources and associated ecosystem services. This workshop also aimed at introducing resilience-\u00ad\u2010based natural resource management climate-\u00ad\u2010smart planning approaches for sustainable management to resort managers and environment managers of island councils. 2.2. Content Workshop participants responded well to the information presented in Day One of the workshop, which included a combination of printed brochures on key issues (all with Divehi translations \u2013 see picture), powerpoint presentations and discussions (See also agenda in Annex 2). There was a wide range of experience and knowledge among participants, which to some extent limited the scope and depth of discussions about more complex topics such as resilience-\u00ad\u2010based management. However, presentations were adapted in an attempt to make them more accessible to a larger proportion of the workshop audience. Building on concepts introduced during the first part of the workshop (like resilience, resilience-\u00ad\u2010 based management, the connection between healthy reefs and healthy people) and using the results of the social surveys carried out in North Ari as starting point for discussion, the Day Two (half-\u00ad\u2010day) workshop aimed at: 1) evaluating the interest at local community island level in developing locally marine managed areas and 2) identifying possible next steps. 2.3 Discussion 2.3.1 Day 1 \u2013 Introducing resilience-\u00ad\u2010based natural resource management Despite the knowledge gaps, and some language challenges, the workshop stimulated strong engagement and discussion about the opportunities for local management efforts to build resilience to climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "49b3b853-7d6c-4feb-9bc6-508c9bc69bfc": {"__data__": {"id_": "49b3b853-7d6c-4feb-9bc6-508c9bc69bfc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/outcomes-reef-resilience-workshops-maldives-23-27-march-2015-workshop", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Outcomes from reef resilience workshops in the Maldives : 23-27 March 2015.

It was determined that it is important to know which areas should be allocated for resource use/extraction. It was mentioned that each island is currently able to manage its own house reefs, as the island council has been given the mandate to do so.

Furthermore is was highlighted that, when allocating protected areas, the central government did not communicate with the local communities and most people are unaware of the existence, extent and regulations of protected areas. However, it was stressed that local communities alone being responsible of natural resources is not feasible. Participants highlighted the issues of funding for managing and monitoring of these areas and suggested that the Baa Atoll Biosphere Reserve Conservation Fund is an ideal example where the government is interacting with the local community. They highlighted the need for such a plan for North Ari and suggested that a co-\u00ad\u2010management strategy is probably the best way to move forward. The participants highlighted the issue of lack of cooperation from the government bringing the example of several management plans that were submitted to the government but so far the central government has shown little interest. According to the participants, the support from central government is vital for formulating and implementing management plans of protected areas. Some participants also suggested working with nearby resorts, as most of them have dive centers and have more resources to monitor these areas. 2.3.3 Day 2 \u2013 Spatial planning and multi-\u00ad\u2010use areas Participants were presented with resource use maps created using data from the social surveys carried out by the IUCN Maldives Marine team in North Ari. As these maps reflect people\u2019s perceptions, the island and atoll councilors were asked to answer the following questions: Observation There is opportunity for Project REGENERATE to make an important contribution to the future of coral reef conservation in the Maldives through basic coral reef education and awareness raising targeted at key stakeholders such as councilors and school teachers on community islands that have the potential to be involved in future project work. by Dr Paul Marshall 6 -\u00ad\u2010 Are the maps accurate? -\u00ad\u2010 Can you identify conflict areas? Participants found that the maps were vague, especially for the fishery areas. Conflict areas were identified and referred mostly to spots used for both recreational activities and fishery. Focusing on their island only, councillors were asked to identify areas to be used for one activity only: -\u00ad\u2010 For fishery -\u00ad\u2010 For diving/snorkelling The maps created by the participants are included in the Annex 3. 2.3.4 Day 2 \u2013 What are the possible next steps? The participants recommended to inform timings of next workshops and meetings due to their busy schedule and suggested to start creating the management plan as soon as possible. Some discussion points that should be considered in future meetings were suggested as well: \u2022 There is a need for a proper management plan that can guide atoll and island councilors on what actions are needed to properly use resources; \u2022 When planning, attention should be given to fishing zones; \u2022 Thinking about having a board at atoll level, including representatives of all stakeholder groups, to manage resources effectively; \u2022 Collaborating with resorts and the marine police on monitoring and enforcement; \u2022 Including a plan to regulate reef fishery at island and atoll level, possibly by allocating licenses to fishermen and coming to an agreement with resorts to only buy from authorized local dealers; \u2022 Providing more awareness and involving local communities in natural resource management; \u2022 When zoning, the management of areas should be given to the closest islands. For example, areas near AA. Himandhoo should be managed by Himandhoo council and the community. 2.3.5 Summary Day 2 Day Two created an opportunity for more interactive discussion among Atoll councillors and Island community leaders, facilitated by the Project REGENERATE. Meeting participants explored a range of ideas for management aimed at building resilience of local reefs. There was much interest in local management actions that could involve community members and/or generate income for islands. While there was strong recognition of the need to align any plans or actions with the plans and regulations of central government, there was also much interest in \u2018no regret\u2019 or \u2018win-\u00ad\u2010win\u2019 activities that could improve reef resilience through simple local stewardship actions that could be implemented under current plans, policies and regulations. Atoll councillors were especially energetic about advancing toward an integrated reef management approach that spanned multiple islands and had strong community engagement. There were strong commitments to further explore options and processes for advancing the idea. The Project REGENERATE team committed to presenting the discussions to government officials in Male during meetings on the following day. 7 3.

It was well attended by staff from the Marine Research Centre (MRC), a key official from the Ministry of Environment & Energy (MEE) and a senior academic from the Maldives National University (see Annex 1). Other key officials from MEE and Ministry of Tourism were not able to attend, due in part to pressing national issues at the time of the workshop. 3.2 Content The format and focus of the meeting was adapted from the initial workshop plan to better build on the community workshop, and to be more relevant to the confirmed participants. The Project REGENERATE team gave an overview of the issues and concepts presented at the community workshop, and shared the ideas for advancing coral reef management through a resilience-\u00ad\u2010based management plan. 3.3 Discussion Workshop participants were very interested in the insights from resilience-\u00ad\u2010based management of coral reefs elsewhere in the world. There was particular interest in the concept of Outlook Reporting, which is a method developed in the Great Barrier Reef for reviewing values, threats and future options that can inform strategic approaches to coral reef management. Participants also liked the concept of \u201cFishing Priority Areas\u201d, which are used in St Lucia (eastern Caribbean) to acknowledge fishing as a traditional and legitimate use of the marine resources within the management area. The extensive role of local NGOs as partners in marine resource management in Belize was viewed as a relevant and inspiring case study. The potential for special-\u00ad\u2010purpose not-\u00ad\u2010for-\u00ad\u2010profit organisations to address challenges relating to sustainable financing, community participation and governance challenges was seen as worthy of further exploration. Ecosystem services and natural capital were recognized as important concepts for linking and reconciling the development and conservation agendas in the Maldives. Participants also voiced support for more fundamental education of Maldivian citizens about the value of coral reefs to the national economy and broader social wellbeing, and the need to actively include women in discussions about the environmental future of the Maldives. 8 The concept of an atoll marine management plan with a co-\u00ad\u2010management approach was well received by the government officials at the workshop. There was extensive discussion about existing marine management plans, and how an atoll management plan would complement and align with current policies and plans for marine conservation in the Maldives. The integration of resort marine managed areas (MMAs) with community-\u00ad\u2010based locally marine managed areas (LMMAs) under the larger umbrella of a national network of marine management areas was seen as positive. The focus on management planning, rather than designation of additional MPAs was also seen as positive. Participants discussed the need to review the experiences from implementation of the Baa Atoll management plan, especially the issues relating to fee collection, funds management and governance. Workshop participants provided thoughtful advice on how to advance on an atoll management plan in accord with current plans, policies, regulations and approval processes, and in ways that would increase the chance of political support for such a concept. The workshop agreed that North Ari Atoll was a sensible focus for a demonstration or pilot project for an atoll management plan, and participants offered to continue to provide advice and guidance to Project REGENERATE as the concept was advanced. Observation Discussions with community members and officials indicated that there has been a substantial increase in fishing pressure on reef fish in recent years. While the major commercial fishing activities targets pelagic species offshore and live bait species inshore, there is strong demand for reef fish from resorts. There were also reports of a trend of increasing numbers of herbivorous fishes being sold in the local market in Male. The low numbers of predatory reef fish observed during three reef inspection dives are consistent with heavy fishing pressure on local reefs. The sustainability of current fishing pressure on reef fish species warrants further investigation as part of any natural resource management program. by Dr Paul Marshall 9 4. Summary The workshops and meetings held during the week 23-\u00ad\u201027 March were highly informative and productive. There was strong engagement from community island leaders, atoll councillors, resort managers and government officials who participated. The economic conditions, history of natural resource management and the current political landscape create real challenges for strengthening coral reef management in the Maldives. However, the key ingredients of strong dependency on natural resources, good ecological resilience, engaged stakeholders and effective power structures appear to be in place to enable progress.

Introduction Land degradation significantly reduces the productivity of the land base upon which the well-being of humanity relies. Global estimates suggest that between 1 and 6 billion hectares, approximately 8% \u2013 52% of the Earth\u2019s vegetated land base, are degraded (Daily, Restorign Value to the World's Degraded Lands , 1995). This in turn negatively impacts the provision of ecosystem services, with approximately 60% (15 out of 24) of the ecosystem services examined under the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment being degraded or used unsustainably, including the provision of fresh water, food, fuel, and fibre, air and water purification, and climate regulation (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005). Together, emissions from agriculture, forestry and other land use land accounted for 20-24% of global annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, or net emissions of 12 Gt CO2e in 2010 (International Panel on Climate Change, 2014). More specifically, and conversion and land degradation alone are estimated to account for 4.4 Gt of CO2e emissions each year (Mathews & van Noordwijk, 2014). Locally, degradation and deforestation directly impact many of the world\u2019s poorest or most vulnerable communities (FAO, 2008). It is well established that the degradation and deforestation of landscapes can cause downward spirals into poverty (Dasgupta, Diechmann, Meisner, &", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "25082f39-e3c8-4b9b-9cef-18f7a3181cef": {"__data__": {"id_": "25082f39-e3c8-4b9b-9cef-18f7a3181cef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A cost-benefit framework for analyzing forest landscape restoration decisions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fafe2efc0f5f85ddb294210bba6c77b68009ff97ec708c5cf2253e748f6ee8a6"}}, "hash": "fafe2efc0f5f85ddb294210bba6c77b68009ff97ec708c5cf2253e748f6ee8a6", "text": "Wheeler, 2005). High population growth and lack of agricultural intensification can encourage farmers to continuously cultivate, which reduces soil fertility and future crops yields. Degradation and deforestation have also been routinely linked to the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, particularly floods and landslides (UNU-EHS, 2012). The pressure on landscapes to serve extractive or consumptive use is not likely to decrease in the coming decades. Demand for energy, food, and water - all potentially sourced from the land - is forecast to increase.1 Such predictions emphasize the need to restore the productive capacity of degraded and deforested lands and restoration has now become a global priority (Lambin & Meyfroidt, 2011). Each of the Rio conventions have adopted goals focused on forest landscape restoration: the Convention on Biological Diversity\u2019s Aichi target 15 requires signatories to restore 15 percent of degraded ecosystems by 2020 (CBD, 2011); The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change has also adopted the global goal to slow, halt, and reverse forest cover and carbon loss (UNFCCC, 2013); and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification is focusing on restoring unproductive lands (UNCCD, 2013). 1 According to estimates from Mckinsey and Company 175 \u2013 220 million hectares of additional cropland would be needed to meet the expected increase in food demand alone. 4 | P a g e Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) 2 is one approach for restoring degraded land and focuses explicitly on restoring important ecosystem services of forests, woodlands, and agricultural land across different land-use systems. The types of benefits FLR returns to society include carbon sequestration, timber and non- timber forest product supplies, biomass for energy production, drinking water filtration, soil and water conservation, improved soil productivity, erosion control and improved biodiversity conservation, among many others. Recently there has been a growing interest in the contribution forest landscape restoration can make to climate mitigation goals. However, the same holds true for those concerned with food security, water supply, climate adaptation, and other seemingly unrelated sectors (e.g. local economic development). In 2011 a high-level event organized by the Government of Germany and IUCN established the Bonn Challenge \u2013 a practical implementation platform to support governments and others in meeting existing international and national commitments related to FLR \u2013 with the aim of achieving 150 million hectares of new restoration activities by 2020. To date 15 government and other actors have already contributed over 60 million hectares. In 2014, the New York Declaration on Forests from the 2014 Climate Summit \u2013 which was endorsed by more than 100 governments, civil society and indigenous organizations, and private enterprises \u2013 explicitly built upon and extended the ambition of the original Bonn Challenge target of 150 million hectares by 2020 in its call for restoration of at least an additional 200 million hectares by 2030. Forest Landscape Restoration activities are often misunderstood as involving high up-front costs and low rates of return and these ideas persist because few evaluations of restoration activities include a comprehensive and objective accounting of restoration\u2019s ecological and economic impacts. Accounting for the impacts of restoration activities provides an opportunity to determine if their current designs warrant investments by governments, investors, and stakeholders, and when they do not preliminary analysis offers an opportunity to adjust restoration models so that investors see restoration as an investible opportunity. To address this gap in knowledge this report presents a cost-benefit framework for accounting for the ecosystem service and economic impacts of forest landscape restoration activities in a way that allows the results to be structured to inform multiple types of restoration decision-making that can help decision makers understand the trade-offs of different restoration scenarios. The results can be used to set prices for payment for ecosystem services, identify sources of restoration finance, identify low-cost/high-benefit pathways towards carbon sequestration, and identify priority landscapes for restoration based on return-on- investment analysis. 2 In this paper restoration is defined to include reforestation, afforestation, agro-forestry, on farm trees, natural regeneration, and other tree-based technologies that improve the production and ecosystem goods and services. See Annex 1 for additional information 5 | P a g e 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis for restoration decision making Restoration decision-making is not based on the Total Economic Value3 of a landscape, but rather on restoration\u2019s ability to change that value. When identifying areas of restoration potential it is important to know how much the value of ecosystem goods and services would change if the landscape were restored. This allows you to assess the desirability and tradeoffs of different restoration options for the same landscape.

When ecological goals are prioritized over economic ones, the framework can still be used to identify landscapes that produce the desired ecological outcomes for the least cost. Still, it is important to recognize that each landscape is composed of a number of land uses that work together to create ecosystem goods and services that people rely on. While landscapes can be targeted for possessing particular land uses, unless restoration targets the entire landscape the benefits of an individual intervention may not be realized (Maginnis et al., 2007). 2.1 Steps in the cost-benefit analysis There are nine steps in the application of the cost-benefit analysis: 1. Specify the set of restoration transitions: Define which degraded land uses will be restored and the activities that will be used to restore them 2. Define the stakeholders who will be impacted by restoration: Define the groups of people who will be impacted by the restoration transitions 3. Catalogue the impacts and define how they will be measured: Which impacts matter most to the stakeholders who will be impacted by restoration and what units of measurement are most useful for measuring them? 4. Predict the impacts quantitatively over the time horizon of the project: Use ecosystem service models, household surveys, stakeholder engagement, and other estimation methods to quantify the expected impacts of restoration activities 5. Monetize all of the impacts: Use appropriate direct and indirect methods to value the estimated impacts 3 The Total Economic Value of a resource is defined as the total value people derive from the resource compared to not having it. 6 | P a g e 6. Discount benefits and costs to obtain present values: Select appropriate discount rates to make streams of future benefits and costs comparable at the present moment 7. Calculate the Net Present Value of each alternative: Subtract the discounted stream of implementation, transaction, and opportunity costs from the discounted stream of benefits 8. Perform sensitivity analysis: The results of the CBA depend on assumptions and the sensitivity of the results to changes in the underlying assumptions should be evaluated 9. Make policy recommendations: From a Pareto-efficiency perspective the restoration activities with the largest NPV should be recommended 2.2 Step 1: Define each restoration transition Many types of land uses can become degraded through human or natural causes. Primary forest can be deforested or encroached upon so that the diversity of species and the functioning of the ecosystem are degraded. Overharvesting can degrade woodlands and forest plantations and agricultural land can be degraded through poor cropping practices that mine soil nutrients or result in excessive erosion. Some of the functionality of the original land use can be restored with restoration activities that are compatible with the existing land use. Identifying degraded land uses is not a straightforward exercise because in practice degradation is difficult to define and therefore difficult to measure. Degradation is typically defined as a process whereby the productivity of land as measured through the production of ecosystem goods and services declines over time as a result of biophysical and anthropogenic causes. Since certain land uses can increase the production of some ecosystem services at the expense of others a reference land use must be defined to clearly show that the production of services has declined compared to the reference land use. For example, agricultural land that was formerly primary forest could be considered degraded forestland if the reference land use is defined as primary forest, but if the reference land use is agriculture it may not be defined as degraded. There are a number of ways to identify degraded land uses. The first attempt to identify degraded land was made by the Global Assessment of Human-induced Soil Degradation (GLASOD) and used a survey of expert opinion to identify the land area being affected by different degrees of soil degradation. The method was subjective, inconsistent, and non-replicable, which limited its use in policy- relevant decision making. Recently, remote sensing scientists have begun measuring degradation through changes in net primary production (NPP) by arguing that changes in NPP are a proxy for changes in other important ecosystem services and therefore represent a valid measure of degradation. Hybrid approaches that combine stakeholder and expert opinion with remote sensing information have also been used to identify degraded land uses. 7 | P a g e Once degraded land uses have been identified restoration activities that can restore the productivity of the degraded land have to be proposed.

For example, the productivity of degraded agricultural land can be restored with agroforestry activities that increase crop productivity, provide fuelwood and other wood products to households, increase soil retention, and decrease sedimentation in watersheds. Alternatively, the productivity of degraded agricultural land could also be restored by allowing that land to return to secondary forest. Together the set of degraded land uses and the corresponding restoration activities constitute restoration transitions. If the main degraded land uses were identified to be agriculture, woodlots, and bare land and the restoration activities associated with each degraded land use were agroforestry, improved management of woodlots, and planted forests, respectively, the restoration transitions would be: 1. Degraded agriculture Agroforestry 2. Degraded woodlots and plantations Woodlots with improved management 3. Bare land Establishment of planted forests 8 | P a g e 2.3. Step 2: Define the groups of people who will be impacted by each restoration transition Since restoration transitions affect stakeholders at every level from local to global there are potentially many groups of people who could be included in a CBA study. A truly comprehensive estimate of the costs and benefits would include a global group of stakeholders. Federal governments may only be interested in taking national costs and benefits into account and local governments may restrict their stakeholder groups to community members only. The private sector might limit CBA estimates to private landowners since it remains largely concerned with the financial costs and benefits of restoration transitions. When there is doubt over which stakeholders to include a national or global perspective Box 1: Identifying restoration transitions in Rwanda In Rwanda, IUCN and WRI used consultative workshops with government and non- government stakeholders to identify three degraded land uses that could benefit from restoration through the strategic introduction of trees and improved management practices. Through the consultative workshops, the following land uses in need of restoration were identified: 1. Degraded agriculture 2. Poorly managed woodlots and timber plantations 3. Deforested land Five broad restoration activities that could be used to improve the ecological and economic productivity of the degraded land uses were proposed by stakeholders: \uf0b7 Agroforestry on steep sloping land in conjunction with other soil conservation measures such as radical and progressive terracing \uf0b7 Agroforestry on flat or gently sloping land, including those areas principally managed as pasture and rangelands \uf0b7 Improved silviculture and rehabilitation of existing, sub-optimally managed woodlots and plantations, including very small (<0.5 hectare) areas \uf0b7 Protection and restoration of existing areas of natural forests, mainly in or around protected areas but also extending to small isolated fragments \uf0b7 Establishment or improvement of protective forests on important and sensitive sites such as ridge tops with steep (20-55%) and very steep sloping land (>55%), riparian zones and wetland buffer zones and margins Based on the degraded land uses and the proposed restoration activities, the following restoration transitions were defined: 1. Traditional agriculture Agroforestry on steep sloping land and flat or gently sloping land 2. Poorly managed eucalyptus woodlots and plantations Improved silviculture and rehabilitation of existing, sub-optimally managed woodlots, spacing only 3.

The third step in the cost-benefit framework is to document the physical impacts of the restoration transitions. Impacts are broadly defined to include both the physical inputs that are needed to restore degraded land, such as seedlings, labor, and equipment, as well as the physical outputs that will be created as a result of the restoration transition.

Implementation costs: Implementation costs represent investments in land, labor, and materials and include any expense directly related to the establishment and operation of a restoration project, which could include hiring, training, and managing employees or buying materials. 2. Transaction costs: Transaction costs represent the cost for landowners and implementing agencies to identify viable land to restore and negotiate over terms that ensure restoration meets both local and national priorities. 3. Opportunity costs: Opportunity costs represent the tangible goods and services that were foregone to make restoration possible. 10 | P a g e Figure 1: General cost categories of restoration activities Note: Elements below the cost categories describe different activities and sources of cost. For example, forgone crop yields represent a source of Opportunity Cost, while monitoring activities represent a source of Implementation Costs. For this step of the cost-benefit framework the inputs that will be needed for each restoration transition should be catalogued and listed. These inputs come under the Transaction and Implementation cost categories. Opportunity costs are reflected under the physical outputs. For example, in areas where farm inputs are sparingly used, such as East Africa, restoring degraded agricultural land with agroforestry may require a modest number of inputs: Transaction Costs \uf0b7 Extension services (Man days; hour) \uf0b7 Labor (Man days; hour) Implementation Costs \uf0b7 Labor (Man days; hour) \uf0b7 Seeds/Seedlings (Kg; units) \uf0b7 Organic fertilizer (Kg; bag) \uf0b7 Farm equipment (units) \uf0b7 Land (Hectare; Hectare Year-1) The Transaction costs are accounted for through number of man days or hours of extension services that need to be provided to landowners to train them on how to transition their land to an agroforestry system and the amount of time land owners need to devote to learning about the agroforestry system. Most of the costs are Implementation Costs as the land will require seedlings, fertilizer, farm equipment, and labor to be restored. It is important in this step to define the physical units that will be used to measure the amount of each input that will be needed. 11 | P a g e 2.4.2 Benefits Knowing who the stakeholders are and where they are located helps to identify the impacts that will affect them because restoration creates impacts at multiple ecological scales. For local residents, private companies, national and local governments, and society at large all depend on the ecosystem services provided by restored land. Local residents and private companies directly depend on restored land to produce commodities like fuelwood, crops, and timber in addition to providing regulating services that underpin their livelihoods. National and local governments and society at large also depend on restored land to regulate the functioning of ecosystems, but they can also benefit from restored land directly. Figure 2 shows how the scale of ecosystem services relates to the types of stakeholders who are impacted by them. For example, restoring degraded land within a watershed could benefit landowners by improving the productivity of degraded woodlots and agricultural land while also benefiting downstream fishing communities by reducing eutrophication in important fisheries. The global community could also benefit if the restoration transitions helped regulate the global climate by sequestering carbon. Figure 2: Benefits of restoration at different ecological scales The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment), 2005) defined four categories of ecosystem services and each category of services can impact different groups of stakeholders. \uf0b7 Supporting services \u2013 Services that are necessary for the production of all other services. 12 | P a g e \uf0b7 Provisioning services \u2013 The benefits from products, like food, fuel, fiber, and water that are obtained directly from nature. Private landowners and companies can harvest commodities directly from restored land like fuelwood, crops, or timber. Downstream stakeholders, such as fishing communities or water users, can also benefit if restoration improves the productivity of a fishery or enhances water quality. \uf0b7 Regulating services \u2013 The benefits from processes like carbon sequestration, nutrient cycling, and water and air purification that regulate the functioning of ecosystems. While regulating services are generated at a parcel or landscape scale they can provide benefits to local, national, regional, and international stakeholders alike. For example, carbon sequestrations affects on regulating the global climate everyone equally, although other regulating services like flood control may only benefit stakeholders within specific areas of a watershed. \uf0b7 Cultural services \u2013 The nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through spiritual enrichment, cognitive development, reflection, recreation, and scenic beauty. These types of services are also improved by restoration at different spatial scales and therefore impact different groups of stakeholders.

Eco-tourism is becoming an increasingly popular benefit for local communities, national and local governments, and international tourists. It is important to note that the value of cultural services depends on the cultural backgrounds of each stakeholder group and for that reason restorations impact on cultural values is often left out of cost- benefit analysis despite being an important impact. Box 2: Ecosystem Service Impacts Identified in Rwanda In Rwanda, the stakeholder groups used in the cost-benefit analysis were local communities, including private landowners and the global community. Local stakeholders were most concerned about the ecosystem service impacts that restoration would have on provisioning and regulating services. Specifically, stakeholder feedback received during workshops held in the North, South, East, West, and Central part of the country all indicated that stakeholders were primarily concerned with the impact restoration would have on: \uf0b7 Timber production (M3 Year-1) \uf0b7 Fuelwood production (M3 Year-1) \uf0b7 Crop Yields (T ha-1 Year-1) \uf0b7 Prevented erosion (T ha-1 Year-1) \uf0b7 Carbon sequestration (T ha-1 Year-1) The physical units of each impacted ecosystem services were defined in biophysical units with a time dimension to reflect the fact that provisioning and regulating ecosystem services provided benefits over time. Timber and fuelwood production was measured in cubic meters per year, while crop yields, prevented erosion, and carbon sequestration were measured in tons per hectare per year. 13 | P a g e 2.5 Step 4: Predict the impacts quantitatively over the time horizon of the project The impacts of restoration transitions are felt over long time periods. Step 4 of the cost-benefit framework is to quantify all of the impacts for each land use (degraded and restored) for the relevant time horizon of the project. Predictions about the levels of inputs (i.e. costs) and the production of ecosystem services must be made for each year and for each land use in a restoration transition. This can be the most challenging aspect of CBA because there is not always a complete scientific understanding of how complex natural systems work, especially when significant changes to their structure are made. Time horizons should be selected that are compatible with the time scales of the restoration transition and of the stakeholders included in the analysis. The benefits of restoring degraded land can take anywhere from a few years to more than two centuries to occur and short time horizons may unintentionally exclude large benefits that occur far into the future. If society at large is given standing as a stakeholder then time horizons of 50-100 years may be appropriate since the analysis is interested the welfare impacts restoration will have on both current and future generations. In other cases, stakeholders interested in profitability and returns on investment may only be operating on time horizons of a few years to a few decades. 2.5.1 Quantifying the inputs of each degraded land use and restoration activity An annual site-level budgeting approach can be used to quantify the inputs that make up the implementation and transaction costs of each degraded land use and restoration activity. The approach records each activity and material input that is needed for each land use and restoration activity on an annualized, site- level basis. This information can be collected using published enterprise budgets or by using a combination of peer-reviewed data and expert opinions. 14 | P a g e There are two biological production function based approaches to quantifying the impacts restoration transitions have on benefits. Biological production functions relate the structure of an ecosystem to the outputs of goods and services that particular ecosystem produces (Daily, et al., 2009). They accomplish this task by representing ecosystem structure (e.g. soil nutrients, precipitation, slope, land cover) as inputs into production functions that produce various outputs (e.g. carbon sequestration, crops, fuelwood, water purification). Common services, like carbon sequestration and erosion prevention have been represented by generalized functions that can be applied to different field settings by changing the parameters. For less common services (like?) production functions need to be empirically estimated. One approach to modeling the impacts of restoration transitions can be called the ad-hoc approach because the impacts are modeled on an ad-hoc basis following the results from Step 3. Once the ecosystem services that will be impacted by the restoration transition are identified, biological production functions and location-appropriate parameters are identified through a review of peer-reviewed and grey literature. This approach is highly adaptable in that the impact of restoration on virtually any service can be modeled so long as a production function and location-appropriate parameters exist.

Box 3: Quantifying inputs of restoration transitions in Rwanda In Rwanda, IUCN and WRI used peer reviewed publications, stakeholder consultation, and expert opinion to quantify the inputs that would be needed for different restoration transitions. Figure 3: Annual enterprise budget for Maize in Rwanda The inputs considered in the analysis were hired and household labor, which covers activities including: bush clearing, planting, monitoring, demarcation, regeneration assistance, thinning, coppicing, beating-up, and establishment and maintenance of anti- erosion ditches, seeds, seedlings, organic fertilizer, and small agricultural equipment. Figure 3 shows the budget for degraded maize agriculture in Rwanda. The third column lists the quantities of each input. 15 | P a g e The second approach to modeling the impacts of restoration transitions is to use ecosystem service modeling tools that are now widely and freely available. While economic valuation methods for ecosystem services and biophysical models of natural processes have existed for decades, the development of dedicated tools for ecosystem services modeling has occurred more recently. This notably followed the release of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and, shortly after, the launch of systematic and sustained ecosystem services modeling approaches like InVEST and ARIES (Bagstad et al. 2013). Improved functionality and documentation with new versioning has occurred for several ecosystem services tools; others have been renamed, rebranded, or embraced new funding models (i.e., moving from free/open source to fee for use/proprietary). Some tools appear to no longer be supported or in use, while new other new tools have emerged. Box 4: Ad-hoc approach to erosion modeling in Rwanda In Rwanda erosion on steeply sloped agricultural land is a widespread problem that reduces soil fertility, introduces additional costs into water provisioning, and reduces the output of hydroelectric facilities. As part of the assessment of restoration opportunities in the country it was therefore important to quantify the impact that converting steeply sloped agricultural land to agroforestry would have on erosion. This was done by parameterizing the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) for Rwanda (Hudson, 1993). The equation of the USLE is: [7] Where R = Energy delivered during each precipitation event. K = Soil erodibility index. LS = Plot length and Slope. C = Soil cover factor. P = Management practice factor. Table 1 displays the information used to estimate the impact that converting steeply sloped agricultural land to agroforestry would have on erosion. Monthly precipitation data from Meteo Rwanda was combined with soil erodibility and soil cover values from a GIS database provided by the Rwandan Natural Resources Authority, and slope estimates from the 2008 Rwandan Agricultural Survey, at the provincial level, to estimate the amount of erosion associated with each land use and restoration intervention. Table 1: Prevented erosion from restoration transitions in Rwanda Restoration transition Land use Universal Soil Loss Equation Average Annual Erosion (t/ha/year) Prevented erosion (t/ha/year) R K LS C P Steeply sloped agricultural land to Agroforestry Steeply sloped agriculture 332 0.12 1.5 0.3 1 17.93 11.95 Agroforestry 332 0.12 1.5 0.1 1 5.98 According to the estimates shown in Table 1, converting steeply sloped agricultural land to agroforestry would reduce erosion by 11.95 tons per hectare per each year. 16 | P a g e In light of the continuing evolution of ecosystem service tools and in support of their use in large-scale forest ecosystem service assessment in the developing world IUCN, in partnership with Earth Economics and USGS, undertook a review of the ecosystem services tool landscape to identify tools that could be used in a cost-benefit analysis applied to restoration decision making. The advantage of using open-access ecosystem modeling tools rather than an ad hoc modeling approach is that tools are sufficiently developed to run reliably, use validated models, produce replicable results, and have their methods, assumptions, strengths, and limitations well documented as part of a user manual and peer- reviewed journal articles, which may include validation exercises. Tools that are well developed and documented have greater transparency and credibility, which generates trust with decision makers and the public. Table 2 provides the results of this list.

All of the tools in Table 2 produce biophysical outputs that can be valued with market and non-market valuation methods and used in CBA. Selecting an 21 | P a g e appropriate tool depends on many factors. Each tool in Table 2 is capable of producing results at different spatial scales although the accuracy of the output of each tool may be sensitive to changes in scale. Additionally, each tool requires specific types of data to produce results. Some tools require several GIS inputs, such as elevation, slope, soil types, etc., depending on the ecosystem service of interest, while other tools require less data but produce less accurate results. Running a tool can also be time consuming depending on whether input data has already been collected and formatted, whether the person running the tool has used it before, and how many outputs are needed to depict different scenarios. It is also important that an ecosystem service-modeling tool can characterize the uncertainty of its results. Reporting uncertainty and providing mechanisms and/or methods to counter large error margins will strengthen ROAM user projects. Reporting a single value can inspire false confidence in the certainty of results, so uncertainty estimates are a valuable addition to the set of model outputs.

The output from the model was used to identify low- carbon landscapes that were also identified through stakeholder workshops as being degraded and could potentially be restored. Identifying degraded landscapes with low- carbon storage could present an opportunity to attract carbon finance that could be used to pay for restoration activities that improve the landscapes carbon storage. Figure 4a: Land use cover map for Rwanda Figure 4b: Carbon storage values by land use The spatial InVest tool models carbon storage across a landscape by assigning carbon storage values to each land use represented in land-use land-cover (LULC) map of Figure 4a. A total of seven (7) different land covers were represented by Rwanda\u2019s LULC map and each land-use had to be associated with a carbon storage value for the InVest tool to represent the carbon storage in a spatially explicit way. Estimates from Willcock et al. (2012) in Figure 4b were matched with LULC data from Rwanda and used to estimate the carbon storage of each land use from five carbon pools (aboveground live carbon, litter, coarse woody debris, belowground live carbon and soil carbon) shown in Figure 4c.

The output also showed that many areas of Rwanda have low-carbon density that could be improved with restoration activities like agroforestry or improved management of timber and fuelwood plantations. The output was also useful for calculating the change in carbon storage that would occur from restoring degraded agricultural land and degraded timber and fuelwood plantations to closed forest. 23 | P a g e 2.6 Step 5: Monetize all of the impacts: Use appropriate direct and indirect methods to value the estimated impacts Economic valuation places monetary value on changes in ecosystem goods and services and puts ecological and biodiversity values on an equal footing with other economic benefits and costs. Not all values of ecosystem goods and services can be measured because they may be intrinsic or religious nature, but they need to be recognized none-the-less. Other ecosystem goods and service, like the existence value people place on knowing a certain species exists even though they may never actually see it in person, can be valued but are difficult to turn into real flows of financial values. Finally, there are ecosystem goods and services, like carbon storage or water yield, that can be both valued and monetized. Choosing a valuation technique generally depends on the impact to be valued and the availability of resources, time and data for the study. Economists have proposed several methods for valuing ecosystem goods and services depending on the nature of the good or service in question and the methods can be classified into one of three broad categories: 1. Revealed preference methods, 2. State-preference methods, 3. Benefit transfer methods. Each method has its relative strengths and weaknesses and the method that is best for a particular CBA context depends on many factors. Table 3: Valuation methods for restoration decision making Methods Revealed preference methods Stated preference methods Direct Market prices Contingent valuation Simulated markets Indirect Travel cost Attribute based models Hedonic property values Conjoint analysis Hedonic wage values Choice experiments Avoidance expenditures Contingent ranking 24 | P a g e Revealed preference methods use human behavior that is either observed directly or non-directly, to value ecosystem goods and services. For example, fuelwood and timber production can be valued by observing the market prices people are able and willing to pay for different quantities and qualities of fuelwood and timber. Indirect revealed preference methods rely on observing market transactions for other goods and services that can be used to infer the values of ecosystem goods and services. For example, the hedonic property method uses sales data from the housing market to value ecosystem goods and services like species-density and water quality. Stated-preference methods rely on hypothetical human behavior to value ecosystem goods and services, such as existence values for rare species, that are not bought or sold in markets and that are often not experienced through direct use. These methods elicit valuations by asking people, either through surveys or questionnaires, how much they would be willing to pay for a change in the level and quality of an ecosystem good or services. While stated-preference methods can elicit valuations for many goods and services that would not otherwise be valued the method is relatively more time consuming and costly than observed preference approaches. Additionally, the hypothetical nature of stated-preference methods has led to criticism and skepticism over the validity of the valuations. Benefit transfer methods value specific ecosystem goods and services by transferring the results of valuation studies of the same goods and services from other locations. For example, tourism values for rare primates in one country Box 6: Valuing crop yields in Rwanda In Rwanda, the value of improving crop yields by restoring degraded agricultural land with agroforestry was estimated using revealed preference methods. Restoring degraded agricultural land with agroforestry in Rwanda is expected to increase crop yields by returning nutrients to the soil, but the value of increasing crop yields had not been estimated. Expected maize yields of degraded agriculture and agroforestry were estimated with regression analysis using information on crop yields, land area devoted to each crop, growing season precipitation, soil type, growing season temperature, and other variables that influence yield. Table 4: Value of crop yields for agriculture and agroforestry in Rwanda The estimated maize yields, reported as tons per hectare per year, for degraded agriculture and agroforestry are shown in Table 4.

Expected yields were multiplied by market prices in order to calculate annual revenues from the sale of crops under each management system. 25 | P a g e could be estimated by transferring tourism values for rare primates estimated in a nearby, but different country. Benefit transfer methods are useful when valuation information is needed, but time and funding are not available to implement more rigorous valuation methods. There are several drawbacks to using benefit transfer. Estimates adapted from other study areas are likely to be less accurate in new settings and it may be difficult to know how much the accuracy of the valuation estimates are affected by the transfer. In other cases, high-quality valuation studies on the goods or services in question may not exist and primary valuation research will be necessary. 2.7 Step 6: Discount benefits and costs to obtain present values Restoration decisions have impacts that occur at different times sometimes several decades or even a century or more in the future. Discounting makes events at different points in time comparable by assigning a weight to future events based on society\u2019s preference for events that occur at different points in time. While the concept of discounting is not contentious, the choice the appropriate discount rate is because it has large influences on which projects are approved and which are not and it also reflects the way current generations think about future generations. The long time horizons of restoration projects, which can range between 5 \u2013 200 years, mean that restoration decision-making is especially sensitive to the choice of discount rate. The costs and benefits of each degraded and restored land use are discounted with the following equation: [1] Where the PV(X) is the present value of a stream of benefits or costs, X, that flow over time according to . The time horizon is given T and the discount rate is represented by r. The term is known as the discount factor and its value is bounded between 0 and 1. The larger the value of t, that is the further into the future something happens, the smaller the discount factor is and the less weight that event has. Similarly, the larger the value of r for a given t the smaller the discount factor and the less weight that event has. While the streams of benefits and costs are estimated in Step 4 and are empirical problems, the choice of the appropriate discount rate is a conceptual problem. The idea of discounting applies to goods and services as well as our preference for time. Discounting goods and services reflects the fact that financial capital has an opportunity cost because it can be spent on other investments that could yield returns earlier. This sort of discounting is often referred to as the opportunity cost of capital and it is measured by observing the market yields on government bonds and other low risk investments. The other type of discounting reflects the different weight society places on the welfare of current and future generations and is commonly referred to as the rate of social time preference. Unlike the 26 | P a g e opportunity cost of capital, which discounts the consumption of goods and services at different points in time, the rate of social time preference discounts the welfare of aggregate welfare of generations at different points time. It is the tension between these two concepts that leads to disagreement over the appropriate rate of discount to apply to environmental decisions. These issues are still being debating in the academic and policy literature because of the profound role the discount rate plays in environmental decision- making. Without a clear consensus on which discount rate is most appropriate for different decision-making contexts analysts must come up with their own rationale for which rate to use. Stern (2007) used a discount rate of 0.001% to estimate the optimal global response to climate change by arguing that the welfare of future generations should not be discounted at all. Most environmental CBAs use discount rates of between 0-4%, but national and global oversight agencies generally give their own recommendations for appropriate discount rates to apply to projects in their jurisdictions. 2.8 Step 7: Calculate the Net Present Value of each alternative Local communities, regional and national governments, and conservation organizations must decide whether or not to invest scarce human and physical resources into restoration projects. CBA helps inform these decisions by producing information that describes how efficient different restoration transitions are in terms of their resource use.

The net present value (NPV) concept formalizes this logic and allows discounted flows of benefits and costs to be compared on equal terms across alternative projects. The NPV of each restoration transition is calculated by subtracting the NPV of each degraded land use from the NPV of the restoration activity. If the NPV of the restoration transition is greater than zero it suggests that restoring the degraded landscape is a worthwhile endeavor. A NPV less than zero would suggest that restoring the degraded land use will generate fewer benefits than costs. The NPV is calculated following: [2] Where is the annual benefit received from the degraded land use or restoration activity, is the annual cost associated with that revenue, and is the discount factor. The decision rule for the NPV concept is straightforward. If the NPV of the restoration transition is positive then the land should be restored. In the case where multiple restoration transitions are being evaluated for the same unit of land the transition with the largest NPV should be selected. If the NPV is negative and a full accounting of the benefits has be done it suggests the benefits of the transition are less than the costs and the land should not be restored because they human and physical resources could be invested elsewhere with a larger impact. 27 | P a g e 2.9 Step 8: Perform sensitivity analysis on the results of the CBA The costs and benefits of restoration transitions depend on inherently variable economic and ecological parameters, including market prices, interest rates, precipitation, and tree growth rates. Lingering uncertainty over these values introduces an element of risk into the cost-benefit analysis. There are a number of ways to account for this uncertainty. In order to take account of this uncertainty we use a well-worn \u201crepeated random sampling technique\u201d known as Monte Carlo simulations. Several authors have used Monte Carlo simulations in forestry settings to account for risk in economic analyses (e.g., (van Kooten, van Kooten, & Brown, 1992) (Moore, Ruel, Lapointe, & Lussier, 2012)). This technique also allows confidence intervals to be constructed around the estimated NPV of restoration (Naidoo & Ricketts, 2006) on transitions as well as to identify the situations under which a restoration transition is unlikely to create a benefit. A Monte Carlo simulation creates data by drawing values from the distribution of a given variable instead of assuming a single average value. This allows for the incorporation of data into your analysis in a way that accounts for the range in values that might be observed in the field (e.g., changes in rain-fall year to year). Table 5 lists the assumptions and data sources used in our Monte Carlo simulations. Since ecological outcomes such as tree growth determine the profitability of each restoration transition we used the Monte Carlo method to generate data representing a range of outcomes one might expect on different land uses. Table 5: Distributions and data sources for Monte Carlo analysis To detail the method we use an example from Rwanda. For timber growth we parameterize distributions for three tree species using peer-reviewed or secondary data sources and assume mean annual increments are normally distributed (generally bell shaped). Detailed data was not available on the distribution of crop increase effects of agroforestry so we assume the effect is triangularly distributed because the distribution does not require information on standard errors. We sample from each distribution 100,000 times in most cases and calculate the NPV and ROI of each restoration transition based on the data from the Monte Carlo simulation. The results from the Monte Carlo analysis are themselves distributions of values as shown in Figure 5. 28 | P a g e The results from the Monte Carlo analysis generate histograms of ROI\u2019s for each degraded land use and restoration intervention that show how sensitive the results are to the values of key parameters. In Figure 5a the histogram shows the return on investment of agroforestry (blue) is larger than the return on traditional agriculture (yellow) across most of the range of ecological values simulated in the Monte Carlo analysis.

The non-overlapping distributions suggest that improving the management of existing woodlots would noticeably improve their financial performance. 2.10 Step 9: Make policy recommendations From a pure efficiency perspective, the restoration activity with the largest NPV should be recommended. Of course, other factors will also enter the conversation and influence the ultimate decision about the best way to restore degraded land to meet environmental and social objectives. That is, the NPV concept provides helpful information that can influence the conversation about what to do and where, but it is not the whole conservation. The output from the CBA can also be used to create other decision-making metrics, like Return on Investment (ROI) that can help start a conversation with investors or other private sector actors who may not be as familiar with NPV, cost-benefit ratios, or other metrics commonly reported with CBA. Output can also be used to identify land use policies to encourage land owners to restore degraded land or it can be used to create carbon cost abatement curves, which show the restoration activities that provide the largest number of benefits for each ton of carbon they sequester. Figure 5a: Degraded agriculture to agroforestry Figure 5b: Poorly managed plantations to well managed 29 | P a g e 2.10.1 Ghana carbon cost abatement curve In Ghana, deforestation and degradation are an increasingly important economic problem. The deforestation rate has remained near 2% per year since 1990, while 70% of the population depends on forests to meet at least some part of their basic food, water, and energy needs (FAO, 2010). With Ghana\u2019s Forestry Commission, IUCN used a stakeholder led process to identify restoration opportunities for GHG abatement that also created significant ecosystem service benefits. i.e. increased fuelwood, non-timber forest products, timber, and crop yields, and decreased erosion, . A carbon-abatement curve (Figure 6) was constructed to graphically illustrate that restoration was a cost-effective way for Ghana to increase terrestrial carbon stocks rather than focusing solely on avoided deforestation (red rectangle in Figure 6). Figure 6: Carbon abatement curve for restoration activities in Ghana Each bar of the abatement curve in Figure 6 represents a restoration activity in two dimensions: total carbon sequestration on the x-axis and ecosystem services per ton of CO2e on the y-axis. The wider the bar the more CO2e that activity sequesters. Similarly, the taller the bar the more ecosystem goods and services it produces for each ton of CO2e sequestered. For example, the first bar, FF:FE (Farm fallow; Fallow enrichment) indicates that if all opportunities to restore agricultural land with improved farm fallow were taken, Ghana could increase national terrestrial carbon stocks by 100 Mt CO2e. It also indicates that each 30 | P a g e sequestered ton of CO2e would be associated with approximately 95 GHC of ecosystem services reflecting gains in fuelwood and timber, decreased erosion, non-timber forest products, and increased crop yields. The carbon abatement curve helped Ghana secure USD 50 million in financing for forest restoration activities, by identifying additional cost-effective opportunities to increase terrestrial carbon stocks in addition to avoided deforestation. The curve demonstrated that nearly all restoration activities considered in the analysis produced more ecosystem goods and services for each ton of sequestered CO2e compared to avoided deforestation. Restoring degraded land can result in greater gains in ecosystem services compared to avoided deforestation because the baseline level or the production of ecosystem services of degraded land is low. 2.10.2 Rwanda ROI Analysis In Rwanda, livelihoods are largely based on subsistence agriculture and energy production. With this high dependence on limited land resources a major challenge is to manage the existing stock of resources to meet the needs of an increasing rural population. To this end Rwanda has set a target of \u201cborder to border\u201d landscape restoration. In order to support restoration activities with private sector investment, the Rwandan Government wanted to estimate the ROI for each activity. The ROI metric was used to show which activities would be expected to generate positive financial returns to investors assuming a standard set of benefits. Table 6: NPV and ROI for restoration transitions in Rwanda The return on investment (ROI) displayed in Table 6 shows that ROI varies from a low of -92% to as much as 130%. The transition from deforested land to protective forests on ridge tops and steep slopes has the lowest financial return amongst the restoration transitions because the costs of establishing the forests are relatively high compared to the discounted future carbon revenues that are used to offset the costs, and given our assumptions that carbon prices are and complete protection of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2df9a21-c4ec-4c62-b57c-3b7621ba6c10": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2df9a21-c4ec-4c62-b57c-3b7621ba6c10", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A cost-benefit framework for analyzing forest landscape restoration decisions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42c2c9f5d0c7171a04b146db407b76a076c39bed7976e14de04d9c8ac3fb11a6"}, "3": {"node_id": "cd4dca75-cb1a-417b-8619-c7a40e8399c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e768ea4e9fd82d63cd7b81a4f735562bec4685d880920347f6c01b10309b0eb8"}}, "hash": "be7ef0acba84dd2f7ddeb9efe2bc1620a2601dc570a0829343ed9f95d6fd8e97", "text": "such lands with no access to NTFPs, no valuation of water provisioning or water quality services, no explicit valuation of the erosion reduction services provided, no pollination services for adjacent agricultural land, no explicit valuation of biodiversity, no existing fire and erosion-protection measures in place on deforested lands, etc. The transition from poorly managed woodlots to well managed woodlots will generate average returns of 130% assuming some fire and erosion-prevention measures are already in place.

This poses a challenge to achieving Rwanda\u2019s restoration target because restoration activities will only be adopted by landowners if the benefits of the activities outweigh the costs. The Rwandan Natural Resource Authority (RNRA) used a stakeholder led process which policies could create incentives for private landowners to restore degraded land. Policies were selected using a land-use policy framework from Pannell (2008) and shown in Figure 7, which plots the output of a cost-benefit analysis of restoration activities in Rwanda. The distribution of costs and benefits was estimated by distinguishing between public and private benefits. Public benefits measured the value of ecosystem services produced off-site, namely carbon storage and erosion prevention. Private benefits were estimated based on gains in crop yields, fuel wood and timber production, and on-site erosion prevention. Figure 7: CBA Policy Chart for Rwanda The framework assesses not only the magnitude, but also the distribution of benefits to the public and to land managers to identify appropriate instruments to create incentives for landowners to undertake restoration for the least cost. For 32 | P a g e each activity, the costs and benefits were estimated by assigning financial values to the physical units of ecosystem services based on their public and private benefits. For example, to estimate the value of restoring land from degraded agricultural land to an agroforestry system, the value of incremental crop and timber production, and erosion prevention, were balanced against restoration costs. The difference between these estimates represents the value of additional services produced by restoring the land with agroforestry. Using this convention, we value the public and private benefits of each restoration transition. The results from the policy analysis in Figure 7 indicate that most restoration activities change the production of both public and private goods as measured through carbon storage, erosion prevention, crop yields, and fuelwood and timber production. In Rwanda, restoring degraded woodlots through the adoption of improved management practices and restoring degraded agricultural land with agroforestry both generated benefits to landowners in excess of their costs, suggesting that landowners would be willing to invest in the practices if extension services introduced the activities to them. These results suggest that restoration activities could be scaled up through modest investments in extension services provided they could reach a large number of landowners. Figure 7 also shows that restoration activities need to be carefully negotiated with landowners and applied to suitable land because it is possible for restoration activities to negatively impact landowners.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd4dca75-cb1a-417b-8619-c7a40e8399c5": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd4dca75-cb1a-417b-8619-c7a40e8399c5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "A cost-benefit framework for analyzing forest landscape restoration decisions", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "42c2c9f5d0c7171a04b146db407b76a076c39bed7976e14de04d9c8ac3fb11a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2df9a21-c4ec-4c62-b57c-3b7621ba6c10", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/cost-benefit-framework-analyzing-forest-landscape-restoration-decisions", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be7ef0acba84dd2f7ddeb9efe2bc1620a2601dc570a0829343ed9f95d6fd8e97"}}, "hash": "e768ea4e9fd82d63cd7b81a4f735562bec4685d880920347f6c01b10309b0eb8", "text": "For example, in some cases restoring degraded agricultural land with agroforestry reduced crop yields to such an extent that the additional ecosystem service benefits of reduced erosion and additional timber and fuelwood do not fully compensate landowners.

While these results could be misconstrued as evidence that restoration is not cost-effective, instead it should be viewed as evidence that investments in restoration, like any other investment, need to be fully evaluated and understood. 33 | P a g e 3.

In other words, there is a need to target the landscapes that provide the largest return on investment. In the Rwandan context, our analysis found that, if carbon prices are low and constant, and reforestation of deforested steep and very steep slopes yields no quantifiable benefits other than carbon, then landscapes with large areas of poorly managed woodlots are likely to generate the largest returns due to the low costs of restoring productivity, the relatively large amount of timber that could be produced, and the assumption that this timber can be harvested and sold. However, if priority is given to restoration interventions that produce the largest variety of ecosystem goods and services then restoring agricultural landscapes may be a high priority. What is clear is that any landscape has a unique set of costs and revenues that create different ROIs to be evaluated and compared. While restoration decisions can be based on a wide variety of criteria, including ecological priorities and restoration costs, an integrated approach that accounts for both the costs and benefits of restoration is one most likely to lead to successful outcomes. This framework shows how ecological and economic information can be combined in order to provide actionable information to decision-makers - information that can allow them to direct limited financial resources to the most promising landscapes. Given the amount of degraded land across the world, it will be important to have a tool that gives one the ability to identify the most beneficial landscapes to restore first. The framework presented in this report is useful for prioritizing investments in restoration across a variety of criteria including NPV, ROI, and multi-criteria decision-making. This information is useful for policy makers, restoration professionals, and natural resource managers who are interested in understanding more about the economic opportunities and trade-offs of restoring deforested and degraded landscapes. The information provided by the framework can help these professionals to use the limited funds available for restoration as efficiently and effectively as possible. 34 | P a g e Works Cited Africa Forest Forum.

Adopting a forest landscape restoration (FLR) approach, the country has committed to the Bonn Challenge: a global aspiration to restore 150 millioan hectares of the world\u2019s deforested and degraded lands by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, Rwanda needs to undergo five restoration transitions as recommended by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Resources Institute in the paper Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunity Assessment for Rwanda (MINIRENA, 2014). If implemented, these transitions will constitute a significant FLR achievement and contribute towards multiple sustainable development objectives, including: increased agricultural productivity, food security, and rural incomes; increased resilience to climate change; improved water supplies; and reduced vulnerability to landslides and other disasters. Current official development assistance (ODA) and government funding, however, cannot meet the financial needs of Rwanda\u2019s FLR plans. For Rwanda to meet its goal of restoring two million hectares, it will require attracting new sources of financing, including private investors. This desk-based study assesses the feasibility of attracting private investments to finance FLR in Rwanda. It provides a detailed review of the main factors that will determine if and how Rwanda can attract private (return-motivated) investors. These factors include the alignment of policies, the country\u2019s investment profile, availability of public funds, investment potential of specific FLR activities, and potential private investors in Rwanda\u2019s FLR. The study also provides recommendations on how Rwanda can move forward and mobilize the resources and technical assistance needed to secure private investment in FLR. Rwanda has a complex policy environment as it relates to investment in FLR. The country\u2019s Vision 2020 promotes the expansion of both forest cover and Rwanda\u2019s forest-based industries as a means of raising per capita incomes. Rwanda\u2019s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy promotes the use of key performance indicators to guide the distribution of resources from Rwanda\u2019s national environmental fund. The National Green Growth Strategy \u2013 Vision 2050 promotes low-carbon economic development and aims to reduce the impact of climate change on the national economy. Central to achieving the objectives of these national policies are sectoral strategies, as well as private sector, export and other finance- related strategies. The selected strategies include the National Forestry Policy, aimed at improving management and competitiveness, various agricultural policies and institutional frameworks, and the Private Sector Development Strategy, which promotes greater investment and improved financial tools for businesses and entrepreneurs. It also includes the Finance Strategy, which promotes improved financial inclusion, institutions, and markets, and the National Export Strategy, aimed at increasing the value and competitiveness of domestically produced goods.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d108d5a-1a0a-4d14-871e-47d504766368": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d108d5a-1a0a-4d14-871e-47d504766368", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b50a2be9a4471820d8bea6b18bdcf5fbc3e40fd680baa4e00c8ff5b2fd0be065"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e55f15f-3d8a-42ea-ad32-44c8f1252195", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9349891f4fdb6fbbf7003cb167b9e85ee57127678777e672d4b117204d0ef4e"}}, "hash": "0ba3ee196ca1a4df967d5f9efd18cfb345c3c3a4c0b41a25f0c633fe95160e63", "text": "Rwanda\u2019s attractive World Bank \u201cease of doing business\u201d ranking is the highest in East Africa, with inflation and currency exchange remaining stable over the past decade.

The government is making a concerted effort to promote private investments through the Rwanda Development Board. Their current set of investment offerings, however, lack the professionalism needed to attract private investment, particularly from international sources. Although the government has prioritized public sector support for agriculture by allocating over 10% of the budget for agricultural activities, there remains a large financing gap of as much as ten times the annual national budget that is needed to implement its policy objectives. This budget allocation is also broadly applied to agriculture and does not specifically focus on FLR. Rwanda has seen a growth in ODA, with over a third of the allocation dedicated to agriculture. There is the potential to dedicate some of these programmes to attracting matching private investment funds. Development finance institutions (DFIs) have provided a limited amount of grant funding. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the International Finance Corporation have provided political risk and weather insurance products for private investors in Rwanda, and if scale can be achieved to create investment packages of at least US$ 10 million, DFIs could be a valuable source of funding for FLR. Promoting the transition from traditional agriculture to agroforestry will require smallholder farmers to adopt crops grown in integrated agroforestry systems. For these productive systems to be investable, they will need to combine fast-growing and tree crops that can produce high value exports. These will include selected fruits, nuts, essential oils and pyrethrum. There are numerous private companies in Rwanda that can be leveraged to promote commercially viable agroforestry practices with farmers. Promoting the improved management of woodlots and plantations can be addressed with better silvicultural practices for woodlots, as well as reducing the demand for wood through fuel-efficient stoves and green charcoal. However, unless investors target large wood and charcoal producers or there is adequate market demand for emission reductions from these activities, investment opportunities in this area may be limited. Instead, forest plantations could offer attractive long-term investment opportunities by replacing imported wood with local sources. For the improved management of natural forests, there are two potential investment opportunities; including expansion of ecotourism and cultivation of non-timber forest products such as honey and bamboo in the buffer zones. Investment opportunities for the improvement or establishment of protective forests includes the installation of small-scale hydropower; a cost-effective, multi-use energy source for rural communities that reduces wood energy usage. Another potential investment opportunity could come from the FLR activities that produce emission reductions for voluntary and compliance markets. However, this would require the demand for emission reductions to improve; given Rwanda\u2019s limited forest areas, this would primarily come from afforestation. Smallholder farmers will be a key source of private investment if they adopt commercially viable FLR activities at scale while still balancing their food security needs. Although Rwanda\u2019s banks and the Business Development Fund offer programmes that can be expanded to finance FLR, additional capital and the tailoring of the programs to fit FLR are needed. Rwanda\u2019s microfinance sector is geographically dispersed and has the potential to assist in FLR financing. By leveraging mobile banking channels, microfinance programmes v could effectively supply funds and distribute weather insurance to smallholders without expensive intermediaries. Existing impact funds, DFIs, and private equity funds with active agricultural investments (primarily coffee) in Rwanda and the region, will be important private investors to approach once commercially viable FLR activities in Rwanda are identified. Additionally, there are active public-private partnership (PPP) programmes that can be tailored to FLR, including loan guarantees by the United States Agency for International Development. This study demonstrates that Rwanda is well positioned to attract private investment for FLR from both a policy and ease of doing business perspective. Moreover, there are existing financial products that can be leveraged. The process of attracting private investment at scale will require Rwanda to implement a program that: (1) identifies and promotes commercially viable FLR practices and partners, (2) supports the commercialisation and preparation of the business case for these FLR activities, (3) organises fundraising to secure private investments for FLR, and (4) designs and operationalizes a Rwanda FLR-dedicated PPP entity. vii vii Contents Executive summary ......................................................................................................................... iii Abbreviations ..................................................................................................................................... x 1.

Introduction Around the world, governments, private enterprises, communities, non-governmental organisations and land managers are pledging their support to the Bonn Challenge; a global goal of restoring 150 million hectares of deforested and degraded lands by 2020 and 350 million hectares by 2030. In an effort to provide support to those defining and implementing pledges, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is assessing the feasibility of creating investment packages to finance forest landscape restoration (FLR), with Rwanda as the pilot country. This study was designed as a desk review to assess potential investment packages for Rwanda. It looks at how different types of private sector actors could be incentivized to invest in FLR and its associated products, such as: timber, non-timber forest products (NTFPs), agricultural products, emission reductions and other value chains that are linked to FLR activities. The FLR activities considered for the study were defined by IUCN and the World Resources Institute (WRI) in the report Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunity Assessment for Rwanda (MINIRENA, 2014). The study recommends five FLR transitions necessary for Rwanda to implement in order to reach the goal of restoring two million hectares of trees: 1. Traditional agriculture Agroforestry systems for crops and livestock; 2. Poorly managed eucalyptus woodlots and plantations Improved management of existing woodlots; 3. Poorly managed eucalyptus woodlots and plantations Improved management of existing woodlots, with best practices for tree spacing, erosion and fire prevention; 4. Deforested land Improvement or restoration of natural forests; and 5. Deforested land Improvement or establishment of protective forests. From the perspective of an investor, transitions 2 and 3 are very similar. As such, this study treats them as a single FLR transition type. The goal of this study is to evaluate each of the five desired FLR transitions and determine which activities are, or could become, commercially viable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b34c8b1-9d21-49f0-a754-943c3a6ea653": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b34c8b1-9d21-49f0-a754-943c3a6ea653", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae358a29556f1a1394c3c7d7976c1cfeaf6cd4d194007f0cf56933da7e35f9d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "d9cb3556-b22d-4961-81ff-97709b947ce5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0728485b4d11fae090ce18ed68f2d01569a90ccd287d9799c8f4a656d215e874"}}, "hash": "6fd564b982c97fcedf34735ff07cf26531a15e319551cf5eb48f3a79142f13b0", "text": "It also provides the Government of Rwanda with a roadmap for attracting private investors to FLR and serves as a resource to investors interested in the country\u2019s FLR investment opportunities.

The competitiveness of Rwanda\u2019s investment landscape is determined by how well the country\u2019s policies and strategies are aligned with FLR and private investors. Section 2 evaluates Rwanda\u2019s key policies and strategic priorities and how these can impact FLR investment opportunities. Section 3 provides a profile of the major country- level indicators that investors will evaluate in determining whether to make investments in Rwanda; assessing the country risk of any FLR investments. Section 4 identifies the investment potential for specific FLR value chains. The focus of this section is on defining the specific revenue generating activities within the targeted FLR transitions that could be commercially viable, 2 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well are appropriate within Rwanda\u2019s smallholder- dominated environment, and are within the context of Rwanda\u2019s limited forest landscape. For each of the five FLR transitions, the steps needed to create commercially viable opportunities, as well the specific types of FLR investment and projects/partner entities are identified. Given that this study was desk- based, it is not possible to provide the specific details of any particular investment opportunity; including business model, size of potential investment, and investee entity (producer groups, small and medium-sized enterprises [SMEs], and companies). Section 5 discusses sources of public funds and risk mitigation instruments for FLR in Rwanda. Section 6 identifies the potential private investment funding sources for FLR in Rwanda, reviewing the types of private investors that are investing in FLR globally. Where available, specific examples of private investments in Rwanda\u2019s FLR-related activities are provided. This section identifies the spectrum of private investors that can be mobilized by Rwanda and how each of their investments could be used to support FLR. At present, there appears to be a limited amount of private investment in the FLR transitions identified in the IUCN and WRI report. There is significant private investment in cash crops (largely tea and coffee), but these are primarily made in downstream value chain activities, such as: transport, storage, milling and export. There has been little private investment in Rwanda\u2019s upstream FLR activities such as: inputs, smallholder producers and local processing. In conclusion, Section 7 provides guidance for the Government of Rwanda on the process and technical assistance that is needed to attract private investment for FLR, as well as the barriers that will need to be overcome. 3 A country\u2019s ability to attract investment is largely dependent on its strategic priorities and national policies, as these determine the overall investment landscape. These also provide insights and foundational data needed for investments in a given sector and highlight the government\u2019s programs and publically funded activities that can be leveraged to source and support attractive investment returns. This section provides an overview of Rwanda\u2019s national policies and strategic priorities as they relate to investments in FLR. Given the integrated nature of FLR, this review includes the following documents: Vision 2020, National Green Growth Strategy, EDPRS, NFP, agricultural policies and institutional frameworks, PSDS, Finance Strategy, and NES. 2.1 Vision 2020 Vision 2020 is a government development program launched in 2000 by Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda. The goal of Vision 2020 is to transform Rwanda from a low-income,1 SECTION HIGHLIGHTS This section highlights key national-level policies and strategies relevant to FLR in Rwanda. These policies and strategies demonstrate the ways in which FLR-related activities and related priorities, including sources of funding and/or investment, have been mainstreamed by the Government of Rwanda, and how numerous social, economic and environmental objectives are supported across overlapping policies. Rwanda has a complex policy environment as it relates to investment in FLR. The Government\u2019s Vision 2020 promotes the expansion of both forest cover and Rwanda\u2019s forest-based industries as a means of raising per capita incomes. The Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) promotes the use of key performance indicators (KPIs) to guide the distribution of resources from Rwanda\u2019s national environmental fund. The National Green Growth Strategy, Vision 2050, aims to reduce the impacts on the national economy that result from climate change while promoting low-carbon economic development. Central to achieving the objectives of these national policies are sectorial strategies, as well as private sector, export and other finance-related strategies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f204a922-9c7f-4102-aa3c-3d1ec9c8793c": {"__data__": {"id_": "f204a922-9c7f-4102-aa3c-3d1ec9c8793c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba16a877969b99ccab7d254934e1ddabb8f66511eb9b7593c325db3e6a21d359"}, "2": {"node_id": "542f2708-c3e5-4795-acad-abdaede0db18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a3831daf8fec579e548f74dfb0e4e91613603ec5be6554f13cd8017a2495443"}}, "hash": "f63edd9fb2783a6c6d9e656af9b2183e2bcd616178b1b2531e2ffb9f5b8bfe74", "text": "The selected strategies covered in this section include: the National Forestry Policy (NFP), aimed at improving management and competitiveness; various agricultural policies and institutional frameworks; and the Private Sector Development Strategy (PSDS), which promotes greater investment and improved financial tools for businesses and entrepreneurs.

Average per capita incomes have increased year over year since 2003. In 2012, Rwanda\u2019s gross national income2 (GNI) per capita was approximately US$ 600, against a GNI of US$ 200 in 2000 (World Bank, 2014a). The primary forestry objective of the Vision 2020 program is the maintenance and good management of existing forest stocks, while increasing forested areas to 30% of total national area by 2020. Currently, approximately 435,000 ha, or nearly 18% of total national area, is considered forested (World Bank, 2014b). In addition, the programme intends to create a favourable environment for thriving forestry business and wood-based industries, which includes increasing forest-generated incomes. 2.2 Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy Rwanda\u2019s EDPRS has existed in two iterations. The first, EDPRS I, was executed from 2008 to 2012, while the second, EDPRS II, began in 2013 and will continue through 2018. As part of the government\u2019s effort to mainstream climate change in the policy sphere, the EDPRS was revised in 2012. Key to these revisions, as well as the revisions to Rwanda\u2019s Vision 2020 programme, is the use of KPIs as a means of guiding Rwanda\u2019s National Fund for Environment and Climate Change (FONERWA) outreach to key sectors critical to achieving EDPRS objectives. In order to operationalise FONERWA, environment and climate change-related issues must be mainstreamed, including the formulation and monitoring of at least three KPIs by key ministries, as well through the inclusion of at least three KPIs in sectoral monitoring and evaluation frameworks (Government of Rwanda, 2012). 2.3 National Green Growth Strategy \u2013 Vision 2050 Rwanda\u2019s National Green Growth Strategy \u2013 Vision 2050 \u2013 is an umbrella strategy aimed at mainstreaming climate resilience and the 2 GNI represents total annual national income divided by the total population and reflects the average income of a country\u2019s citizens.

The costs of climate change in Rwanda could be as much as 1% of gross domestic product (GDP; Government of Rwanda, 2011a), due to, among other things, a very heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture for both food and export crops like tea and coffee. By 2050, Rwanda\u2019s population will have more than doubled, from 11 million people in 2011 to 26 million (Government of Rwanda, 2011a), further exacerbating population pressures in Africa\u2019s most densely populated country.3 While there is a strong synergy between Rwanda\u2019s NFP 2010, EDPRS and Vision 2020; Vision 2050 will be achieved in part through the promotion of sector-specific strategies that will help attain the following strategic objectives at the national level: \u2022 Achieve energy security and a low carbon energy supply that supports the development of green industries and services; and \u2022 Achieve sustainable land use and water resource management that results in food security, appropriate urban development, preservation of biodiversity, and preservation of ecosystem services. Sector-specific strategies, which are detailed in annexes of the original National Green Growth Strategy documents, have been established for the following sectors: cities and the built environment, water, agriculture, energy, finance, forests and tree-based systems, land, mining, and transportation. The Vision 2020, National Green Growth Strategy and EDPRS II provide the foundational elements for sector specific strategies and polices including the NFP (last updated in 2010), agricultural policies and institutional frameworks, PSDS, finance strategy and NES, each summarized below.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf673fac-5801-4453-8a45-f999cd88607c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf673fac-5801-4453-8a45-f999cd88607c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1304083a5ad7f904b54e9451dab631654078b67b77e8db1d0af78b451104cf23"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6565338-5a18-4cdb-8674-120866308106", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5e017800f03c305a16ca2dfeabff0cdc19a49d4442bd2b115274811d2f73657"}}, "hash": "7eae2ce123592da92050d67a2a36c9323c9d081c0d819367f6b1cd3074962961", "text": "2.4 National Forestry Policy 2010 Rwanda\u2019s NFP 2010 was born out of the desire to \u201cmake the forestry sector one of the bedrocks of economy and national ecological balance for sustainable benefits to all segments of society\u201d (MINIFOM, 2010).

Other noted areas of opportunity for Rwanda\u2019s forestry sector considered in the drafting of the NFP 2010 are the NFF (which exists alongside FONERWA), and a forum for private sector engagement with the Government of Rwanda. Related to these opportunities are the guiding principles of the NFP 2010: commercialization of forestry activities including efforts by the Government of Rwanda to drive investment, and private sector involvement via a systematic \u2018phasing in\u2019 process, particularly in areas of forestry management and forest products processing. The NFP 2010 highlights the key roles that financial institutions, investors, and development partners play in the policy\u2019s outcomes. These include: \u2022 Providing access to finance for forest investors; \u2022 Requiring reasonable guarantees on loans, and provide flexibility for new entrants into the market; \u2022 Providing reasonable and low interest loans where returns on investment take time to generate; and \u2022 Providing preference in credit to investors with a good approach, since forestry business takes time to generate returns. Figure 2. Relationship between Rwanda\u2019s NFP and country-level policies 7 Alignment of national policies and strategic priorities with FLR 2.5 Agricultural policies and institutional frameworks Currently, Rwanda lacks a single, unified policy or strategy to address agricultural development in the country. Rather, the country\u2019s agricultural agenda is embedded in a series of strategies and institutional frameworks designed to simultaneously address agriculture, economic development and poverty reduction. These various initiatives are broadly regulated by 2004\u2019s National Agricultural Policy, which establishes a high-level framework for the country\u2019s agricultural priorities. National and sector-specific policies and strategies focused on agriculture are further bolstered by international and regional frameworks, such as the New Partnership for African Development, Common Markets for Eastern and Southern Africa the Central African Forest Commission, and the East African Community (EAC), which are intended to improve market access and supply chain sustainability of forest products, address food security and boost rural livelihoods through increases in agricultural productivity and modernization, as well as policy reform. Rwanda\u2019s national framework for agricultural development lies within four policies. The first, Vision 2020, has established as one of its \u2018pillars\u2019 the \u201ctransformation of agriculture into a productive, high value, market-oriented sector, with forward linkages to other sectors\u201d (Alinda & Abbott, 2012). The other pillars support agricultural development through a variety of economic, social, and resource- related development goals. Central to the successful execution of Vision 2020 will be regional integration and cooperation of markets, as noted above. Vision 2020, in turn, is driven by its implementation strategy, the EDPRS (I & II), which represents a medium-term framework for Rwanda\u2019s long-term agricultural objectives under the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6be0f9b7-f3b1-4834-8b29-dff4dc76de38": {"__data__": {"id_": "6be0f9b7-f3b1-4834-8b29-dff4dc76de38", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae98570d551c360055aa6988354cf3b67070e7bf2fbc6481c2dd50f2a41273e7"}, "2": {"node_id": "58d4494e-0806-4da3-a0bb-036c86bb2efc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b708df1020b8b52cbe94283650282fab7f181fd9a51a3e935d1424cdaa1746ff"}}, "hash": "222019bb7f22a502b7b4fbb79d6344778d35899791fb5afe120892042121a6d3", "text": "Agricultural productivity is central to increasing Rwanda\u2019s GDP, particularly through an increase in contributions from strategic exports, such as coffee and tea.

Strategies to achieve these include improved access to finance, as well as the development of a robust and efficient private sector. Since 2010, several policies have emerged under the umbrella of the PSTA-II: \u2022 National Agricultural Extension Strategy, \u2022 Agriculture Mechanization Strategy (2010- 2015), \u2022 National Post-Harvest Staple Crop Strategy (2011-2016), and \u2022 Agriculture Gender Strategy. The 2010 DDTP, a joint effort between Rwanda\u2019s Ministry of Trade and Industry and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, promotes the idea that agricultural policy in Rwanda should be development driven, rather than driven by demand.

Ultimately, the DDTP represents a call for investments with a focus on creating added value for agricultural exports and market diversification. 2.6 Private Sector Development Strategy Currently, the private sector in Rwanda consists mainly of small enterprises that provide low returns and employment opportunities, with only a few large competitive businesses. Rwanda\u2019s PSDS, developed in accordance with the country\u2019s EDPRS (2013-2018), provides an overarching framework for reforms that will help achieve the key growth targets articulated in Vision 2020 as well as the Seven-Year Government Programme. The PSDS is being implemented through seven programmes: 1. Infrastructure for Growth. This programme aims to continue and expand Rwanda\u2019s Special Economic Zone to develop locations where energy infrastructure constraints are minimized. 2. Investment Promotion. This programme aims to develop the marketing capacity within the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and to create a more streamlined investment promotion service. Part of the programme will be to provide the RDB greater powers to propose a package backed by firm inter-ministerial commitments and a clear public service delivery schedule. 3. Entrepreneurship Development. Through this programme, the government will create an enabling environment for micro, small and medium enterprises, particularly in low-cost areas where such enterprises can operate. 4. Credit Expansion. The programme addresses the significant lack of instruments to increase bank lending through significant expansion of the current credit guarantee scheme that reduces the risk to banks while also assisting enterprises in establishing credit worthiness. 5. Skills and Innovation. This programme will expand the RDB\u2019s Skill Sector Councils, bringing together the private sector, via relevant chambers of commerce, with government institutions and higher education institutions in order to address commercial skills training deficits. 6. Better Regulation. The programme will simplify the way that companies are taxed to ensure greater certainty and transparency in the system, particularly with respect to corporate and withholding taxes. It will also create tax business advisory panels to push for further reforms. 7. Market Access. Through this programme, the government is developing a strategic approach to increasing market access, reducing trade barriers and promoting activities that link producers with markets (Government of Rwanda, 2013). Additionally, the RDB has developed a detailed investment process, the Roadmap for Agribusiness Investment Facilitation (RDB, 2013), supported by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The roadmap details the agricultural investment process from the perspective of the RDB, mapping processes related to origination, information gathering, evaluation, decision to invest, implementation, and aftercare. 2.7 Finance Strategy Developing an efficient, sound and inclusive financial sector is key to meeting the Vision 2020 and the Seven-Year Government Programme targets, particularly in achieving Rwanda\u2019s long-term development plan to transform the country into a middle income country by 2020. Building on the success of its first Financial Sector Development Programme, adopted in 2008, the government is implementing the second phase of the programme. Its overarching goal is to develop 9 Alignment of national policies and strategic priorities with FLR a reputable and stable financial sector that is sufficiently deep and broad, capable of efficiently mobilizing and allocating resources to address the development needs of the country. The programme aims to achieve this goal through four main strategies: 1.

Developing financial institutions, markets and the supporting infrastructure. A particular focus of this programme is building capacity in the financial sector through partnerships between financial sector associations and institutions, and educational institutions. The programme also focuses on new entrants to the banking market that offer a new business model (e.g. focus on SMEs), refining the regulatory environment for insurance, completing the legal foundation for the country\u2019s capital markets, and strengthening the Rwanda Social Security Board governance, administration, investment and risk management. 3. Investment and savings to transform the economy. This programme aims to increase domestic credit to the private sector from 13% of GDP to 27% by 2017. Reforms include completion of the electronic land registration process, greater use of available guarantee programmes to encourage banks to lend to credit-worthy enterprises, and specialized training for lenders in agricultural credit and housing finance (Andrews, et al., 2012). 4. Protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability. Through this programme, a new financial sector unit is being created to allow consumers a redress mechanism. It will make a number of regulatory revisions, including updates to the banking legislation and prudential standards, and the central bank law. Formalized arrangements for crisis management, including failure of financial institutions, are also being put in place. 2.8 National Export Strategy Rwanda\u2019s five-year NES is driven by the country\u2019s \u201cinability to capture most of the value\u201d (Government of Rwanda, 2011b) of the products produced within its borders, leading to overdependence on unstable commodities as a base for export-driven revenue. In considering the objectives of the Vision 2020 and EDPRS, the RDB urged the creation of a comprehensive and coordinated strategy to promote export growth in key sectors while balancing cross-cutting issues through the provision of general incentives alongside well- defined interventions. Thus, the NES was put forth in 2011 with the objective to \u201cidentify prioritized actions that respond to issues that affect Rwanda\u2019s international competitiveness, or Rwanda\u2019s [ability to] upgrade to high value- added products in export clusters\u201d (Government of Rwanda, 2011b). The methodological approach is similarly two-pronged. The first activity is identifying and prioritizing actions that can improve Rwanda\u2019s overall business environment, including the competiveness of 6\ufffd Financial\ufffdinclusion\ufffdis\ufffdthe\ufffdprovision\ufffdof\ufffdlow\ufffdcost/affordable\ufffdfinancial\ufffdservices\ufffdto\ufffdlow-income\ufffdand\ufffdother\ufffddisadvantaged\ufffdcommunities. 10 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well domestic firms in the global market. The second is the identification of key sectors and sector- specific actions that can remove barriers to sectoral growth and boost export potential. It should be noted that the NES represents a framework for short- and medium-term export growth only (through 2015), though in practice, the NES should have a more longitudinal impact by addressing the priority \u2018cross-cutting\u2019 issues and their corresponding strategic actions. With regard to the issue of finance and investment, the Strategy outlines two actions to be spearheaded by the RDB: facilitate financing to address specific issues through sector-specific financing schemes, and increase the level and quality of investments in productive sectors. The results of a 2008 survey of Rwandan businesses (RPSF, 2008) determined that the following represented the three largest constraints to accessing finance: a lack of collateral for securing loans, excessive interest rates charged by lenders, and a limited availability of leasing; overall, two-thirds of Rwandan businesses identified access to finance as a major constraint. The sectors targeted by the Strategy relevant to FLR include some of Rwanda\u2019s traditional export sectors \u2013 tourism, tea, coffee \u2013 as well as non-traditional sectors like horticulture, which may include fruits, vegetables and cut flowers. These sectors were determined via an analysis of more than 50 potential export sectors in Rwanda, with the frontrunners ranked, via a weighting system, by their potential export contribution, potential for job creation, number of existing firms or cooperatives, and investor prospects, among others. The selected sectors also have value chains that would benefit significantly from the NES emphasis on addressing cross-cutting issues (Government of Rwanda, 2011b).

However, expansion of tea export has some ability to impact FLR in Rwanda. Studies in China (Liang, et al., 2013) and Kenya (Githiru, et al., 2009) on tea farm biodiversity have shown that tea forests may provide habitat for a higher number of species than even natural forests in the immediate vicinity. For example, Chinese tea farms were found to be habitat for nearly 250 species, including 15 rare or endangered plant species, while well-managed tea farms in Kenya resulted in a higher number of observed bird species, including several rare birds, than adjacent non-cultivated areas. Coffee also represents a traditional export and priority sector. Though only a small percentage of Rwanda\u2019s coffee is now fully washed, most 11 Alignment of national policies and strategic priorities with FLR of this coffee falls into the \u2018specialty\u2019 category and has attracted international demand from major retailers. Unfortunately, Rwanda has been unable to capitalise on increasing international coffee demand due to decreasing yields caused by a variety of factors. The National Coffee Strategy incorporates five priority programmes aimed at eliminating constraints to improved productivity and revenue generation. Relevant to FLR is the need for the mainstreaming of best practices in farming and integrated pest management through focused agronomic support, with a focus on value addition throughout the rest of the supply chain. 12 3. Rwanda\u2019s investment profile There are a number of country-level conditions that will determine Rwanda\u2019s potential for attracting private investment in FLR. With the limited investment capital available to developing countries for forestry and agriculture, a country\u2019s investors will evaluate the following before investing in a country: (i) risk ranking and ease of doing business, (ii) macroeconomic factors driving returns, (iii) institutional support provided by the government, (iv) financial and accounting regulations, and (v) land tenure. These are all key factors that will impact Rwanda\u2019s ability to attract investment capital for FLR over other developing countries. The sections below provide an assessment of Rwanda\u2019s investment landscape for each of these main factors. 3.1 Rwanda\u2019s risk profile and ease of doing business There are various country risk indicators that investors will review to assess the risk of investing in a frontier market like Rwanda. These risk indicators include: \u2022 Regulatory risk, such as foreign ownership restrictions, currency limits, local custody rules, local funding and registration requirements; \u2022 Currency risk, including convertibility of local currencies and inflation which could impact costs; \u2022 Governance risk related to the corruption, governance and financial reporting that is required of investment entities; and \u2022 Political risk related to political instability (terrorism, riots, coups, civil war, and insurrection). Many investors are managing geographically diverse portfolios in multiple countries and do not consider themselves political analysts. Thus, they rely on published risk rankings such as the World Bank\u2019s Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), the International Country Risk Guide published by the PRS Group, and Transparency SECTION HIGHLIGHTS This section details the factors that contribute to Rwanda\u2019s country-level investment profile. It provides the Government of Rwanda with a benchmark on how the country is positioned to compete for private capital with other countries in the region and provides private investors details on the country\u2019s investment landscape and how to assess the country-level risk. Rwanda\u2019s attractive World Bank \u201cease of doing business\u201d ranking is the highest in East Africa, with inflation and currency exchange remaining stable over the past decade. Given that 70% of the country\u2019s exports are agricultural, there is a strong basis for FLR activities that rely upon exports for returns. The government is making a concerted effort to promote private investments through the RDB, but their current set of investment offerings lack the professionalism needed to attract private investment, particularly from international sources. The financial and tax treatment for domestic and international investments is favourable in Rwanda, with laws that protect property rights.

Worldwide Governance Indicators and Corruption Perception Index scores for East African countries Sources: World Bank, 2013b; Transparency International, 2013. Figure 3. Ease of doing business rankings for East African countries 14 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) as measures of country risk. Rwanda\u2019s performance relative to other countries that might compete for investment funding in the region compares favourably on the three main indicators of risk. Based on the WGI averages over the last five years, Rwanda has the lowest risk score. Under the CPI, Rwanda has the highest score, correlating with the lowest level of corruption in the region. In addition to the positive risk rankings under WGI and CPI, Rwanda was identified as the second most improved country since 2005 for ease of doing business, and the first in its region (World Bank, 2013a). Based on the ease of doing business indicators, Rwanda ranks favourably when compared to the other four East African countries (Figure 3). This is evidenced through an evaluation of ten indicators used to measure ease of doing business.7 The closer a point is to the centre, the higher (better) the ranking. 3.2 Macroeconomic factors Macroeconomic factors will impact investment desirability, including economic growth, market supply and demand, agricultural and forestry products, labour availability, currency stability, and inflation. Rwanda was listed as one of the world\u2019s top ten fastest growing economies in 2013, with GDP growth of 7.1% since 2004 (World Bank, 2013a), and stable inflation and exchange rates. However, Rwanda still ranks as a low income, predominately agricultural country (World Bank, 2013a), as agriculture accounts for one-third of GDP, and provides 90% of the country\u2019s food supply. Agriculture is also responsible for 70% of export revenues (RDB, n.d.). Rwanda\u2019s national strategies indicate intent to continue focusing efforts on traditional cash crops (tea and coffee) and pyrethrum,8 as well as on the nascent, non-traditional horticultural crops and plants, including various fruits and vegetables, flowers (mainly fresh roses), essential oils, stevia, dairy, meat, poultry, and fish. These priorities will need to be balanced by the risk of food scarcity in Rwanda, but also highlight important opportunities. 3.3 Institutional support for investing The RDB states its vision is \u201cto transform Rwanda into a dynamic global hub for business, investment, and innovate,\u201d with the mission of \u201cfast-tracking economic development in Rwanda by enabling private sector growth.\u201d The role of the RDB is to address the needs of companies and both local and foreign investors. It is structured to report directly to the President with a board of directors from all key ministries. Rwanda hopes to transition its agricultural sector toward commercial farming; agro-processing, import substitution and increased exports are key elements of achieving Vision 2020. The RDB has a comprehensive website with 25-30 \u2018investment opportunities\u2019 in the area of agriculture alone. While this shows a strong interest in attracting investments, most documents on the website do not provide a compelling case for investors and could be upgraded to serve as a valuable investment sourcing portal. Another resource to help investors navigate Rwanda\u2019s processes and procedures for establishing a company and making investments is the recently published Roadmap for Agribusiness Investment Facilitation (RDB, 2013). This comprehensive document provides a set of flow charts for making greenfield investments in Rwanda by making it easier for an investor to understand 7\ufffd Scores\ufffdfor\ufffdeach\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdten\ufffdindicators\ufffdrange\ufffdfrom\ufffd1\ufffdto\ufffd185 8\ufffd A\ufffdperennial\ufffdflowering\ufffdplant,\ufffdsome\ufffdspecies\ufffdof\ufffdwhich\ufffdhave\ufffdapplication\ufffdas\ufffda\ufffdpesticide. 15 Rwanda\u2019s investment profile the steps required to establish a new business, or ensure that they have comprehensive due diligence for their investments. The establishment of the RDB, new policies, and the simplification of formalities related to business registration in the country are among the factors that have contributed to an increase of private firms; from 3,000 operating in 2008 to nearly 18,500 in 2010 (World Bank, 2013a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cc74595-c61a-4325-a0e2-e5dd1bb753a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cc74595-c61a-4325-a0e2-e5dd1bb753a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ad600a478d837ce0405443a2968cfe9e69e1654403759786b998ceca9332312"}, "2": {"node_id": "f09bd3d9-7fb3-475e-9aa8-fc1d4f7d3c90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03b1d7335d2a32fd0782da1a73670583d79022176ffcb69f789f2f4ac5dc1c1c"}}, "hash": "beed5dd0e2696e521a51cf2f0a07edaf9ea5dcfe685b88c5334f524328970b57", "text": "3.4 Financial and accounting regulations The financial, tax and accounting treatment for onshore and offshore investments can make a significant impact on the investment outlook for Rwanda\u2019s FLR.

If an investor registers and is certified under the Rwanda Investment and Export Promotion Agency, then the compensation can be received in a convertible currency in case of expropriation; investors receive a guarantee that the compensation will be free of any tax or duty and freely transferable overseas. As far as taxation, Rwanda has made efforts over the last ten years to streamline the three functions of its tax department (large taxpayers, internal revenue, and customs) in order to build synergies in tax management and in services to taxpayers. The tax rate for corporations is 30%, but there are discounts for entities that have been established in free trade zones and for those that employ different tiers of employees. Rwanda has the lowest tax rate on profits compared to Burundi, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, and is ranked 25th of over 100 countries for their fair and transparent tax system. Rwanda is trying to encourage investment by offering discounted taxes for SMEs and zero tax for microenterprises (PWC, 2013). As far as exports are concerned, the Government of Rwanda has established tax discounts based on the percentage of value for exports that bring revenue to the country, starting as low as US$ 3 million per tax year.9 Rwanda has been an increasingly attractive destination for foreign direct investment (FDI), and in 2009 had US$ 118 million, which represents a fourteen-fold increase over 2004 (RDB, 2010). Another element that has impact on the investment environment in Rwanda is accounting standards. If the accounting standards generally used and recognized by Rwandan entities do not follow recognized international standards, investors could have difficulty understanding the financial statements of potential investment entities. A strong financial reporting regime for corporate entities in both the public and private sectors will increase FDI by improving the confidence and comparability of financial information. As of September 2008, only the banking and financial institutions in Rwanda seem to have adopted the International Financial Reporting Standards reporting framework. 3.5 Rwanda\u2019s credit rating Another indicator of investment worthiness is credit rating. According to credit rating agencies Fitch and Standard and Poor\u2019s, Rwanda\u2019s sovereign credit rating is what is known in the market as junk or speculative (B rating), after 9\ufffd RRA\ufffdtax\ufffdand\ufffdgrowth\ufffdMarch\ufffd2012. 16 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well a revision from stable to positive late last year. Credit agencies consider that Rwanda has shown strong economic growth and signs of stronger future growth, having grown at an average 8.3% since 2005 (IMF, 2013b), and being the third best place to do business in Africa according to the World Bank. This improvement in Rwanda\u2019s credit rating implies that the world perceives the country\u2019s default risk as low and therefore interest rates for loans to the country and to investors operating in the country will be lower. 3.6 Land tenure and its impact on landscape investments The ability to understand and ensure that investments are made in entities that have defined and secure tenure either individually or through a collective is of upmost importance for investors in FLR activities. Without it, there is too much uncertainty around whether the entity receiving the investment represents those who are rightfully on the land (or using the land) that generates the return. The further downstream the investment is being made, the more important it will be to have secure tenure. For example, tenure will be extremely important for investments being made to support growing new crops and less important if the investment is being made in a processing plant. Rwanda has extremely high demographic pressure, which has resulted in landless people and inappropriate land use that results in land degradation, deterioration in soil fertility and declining yields. Rwanda has been implementing a major land tenure regularisation process and is in its final stage. The process included the implementation of a Land Administration Information System, which is now the official digital land register that is used to conduct all transactions related to land. By the end of December 2012, an estimated 10.3 million parcels were demarcated, adjudicated, and digitized, and only 11,840 disputes were registered countrywide (Ruruagwa, 2013). In agriculture, women are a dominant force, and a short-term study of the impact of Rwanda\u2019s land tenure reforms has shown land tenure security for women has improved access to land for legally married women and prompted more gender-neutral recording of inheritance rights (Ali, et al., 2011). Rwanda is considered a country with \u201clow productivity in agriculture, but strong legal rights,\u201d and ranks highly in ease of doing business. However, agricultural productivity per worker remains less than US$ 1,600 (IFC, 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7915e7a5-3937-460c-8356-36e046c78eb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7915e7a5-3937-460c-8356-36e046c78eb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "daba64dadf8b83a651681b80a625b54582f15037f23024b64a123652c733476a"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f1faa29-28a4-4681-8029-bb3ba7d192e8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c70458b960c06cd4cf0b28b566cba824d4eeda2aa22fc8b6ec4c4f057c06019"}}, "hash": "46a7cefdf2994b3f7d560ec511ed121134dc6e07cf18a7ba86f02392602ebf7f", "text": "Although the amount of unclaimed land is high due to people and refugees from outside of the country and rural woman having lower registration rates because they are not aware of their land rights, Rwanda is likely among the most prepared countries in sub-Saharan Africa to meet challenges regarding land administration and management.

Actions by the Rwandan Government indicate that they look to capitalize on the positive relationship between tenure security and land-related investment (Byamugisha, 2013). 17 17 4. Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains SECTION HIGHLIGHTS The focus of this section is on defining the specific revenue generating activities within the targeted FLR transitions that could be commercially viable, are appropriate within Rwanda\u2019s smallholder-dominated environment, and are within the context of Rwanda\u2019s limited forest landscape. For each of the five FLR transitions, the steps needed to create commercially viable opportunities, as well the specific types of FLR investment and projects/partner entities are identified. IUCN and WRI, working with the Government of Rwanda, have developed a set of targeted restoration interventions that work within the mosaic of different forest land uses, including: agriculture, agro-forestry, plantations, and natural forests. This section contains: (i) a review of Rwanda\u2019s Bonn Challenge commitment of planting two million trees on their landscape, (ii) the specific land-use transitions that are recommended by IUCN and WRI in Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunity Assessment for Rwanda (MINIRENA, 2014), and (iii) an identification of the potential value chain activities that provide investment opportunities for each type of transition. 4.1 Rwanda\u2019s participation in the Bonn Challenge In 2012, the Government of Rwanda pledged two million hectares of degraded land to the Bonn Challenge, signalling their intent to restore these lands by 2020. The Bonn Challenge on Forests, Climate Change and Biodiversity was a product of the Bonn Climate Change Conference, which was the 34th session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice under the umbrella of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Bonn Challenge represents a global commitment to restore 150 million hectares of degraded and deforested land by 2020, activities that could be worth US$ 85 billion per year to national and global economies, and could reduce the current emissions gap by up to 17% (GPFLR, 2011). This practical, action- oriented approach also helps achieve goals established under other existing international commitments that require restoration activities, such as reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) goals under the UNFCCC, and the land restoration goals to come out of Rio +20. 4.2 Recommended FLR interventions for Rwanda IUCN and WRI\u2019s recommendations in the Forest Landscape Restoration Opportunity Assessment for Rwanda identify five broad restoration interventions that could be used to improve the ecological and economic productivity of degraded lands: 1. Agroforestry for crops and livestock \u2013 Involves the use of trees on agricultural land to improve soil fertility and stability, fuelwood and timber production, and 18 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well reduce fertiliser costs by using \u2018green manure.\u2019 2. Improvement or restoration of natural forests mainly in or around protected areas \u2013 Uses natural and assisted natural regeneration practices to allow native species to passively regenerate on degraded and deforested land. 3. Improved management of existing woodlots for fuelwood and timber \u2013 Improves the spacing density of trees on existing woodlots and timber plantations. 4. Improved management of existing woodlots for fuelwood and timber with best practices for spacing, erosion and fire prevention \u2013 Improves the stocking density of trees on existing woodlots and timber plantations and includes establishing anti-erosion ditches and fire lines. 5. Improvement or establishment of protective forests on ridge tops and near water bodies \u2013 Establishes native and non-native tree species on steeply-sloped ridges and hillsides and protects rivers and wetlands from the harmful effects of erosion by creating buffer zones of natural forest around these vulnerable sites.

Given the nature of Rwanda\u2019s small land holdings, averaging just 0.59 hectares per household, increasing agricultural productivity can only be achieved through either: (i) urbanisation, where landholdings are consolidated into traditional-sized agribusiness operations, or (ii) promotion of efficient and effective aggregation programmes that harness the power of smallholders to deliver investable opportunities that improve rural livelihoods (IMF, 2013a). The risks of the first agribusiness approach include land displacement and the promotion of monoculture systems, and while there is a place for agribusiness approaches, integrated agroforestry systems may be better suited to smallholders. However, a leading expert in Brazil notes the difficulties in harmonising these two approaches \u2013 public polices often support the smallholders, but most investments are made in the agribusiness sector (Gon\u00e7alves, 2013). The suggested value-chain investment opportunities in this paper focus on achieving the goal of more trees on the landscape as a vehicle for poverty alleviation for Rwanda\u2019s majority smallholders. Though to date some value chains have had limited focus on downstream investment opportunities, there is recognition that functioning value chains are a critical component of increasing productivity and profitability for smallholders, whether for new or existing products. Traditional agriculture g Agroforestry for crops and livestock Agroforestry promotion is of critical importance in Rwanda due to the wide array of ecosystem services that agroforestry provides, the role it 19 Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains can play in FLR, and the associated benefits of soil and water improvement. These include but are not limited to: food, fuel, fodder for livestock, fibre, improved water quality and quantity, promotion of biodiversity, soil stability and improved soil fertility, and improved agricultural yields on rehabilitated degraded lands. The potential for investments in agriculture and agroforestry is varied in Rwanda. Table 2 provides the estimated hectares and locations for conversion of traditional agricultural land to agroforestry for crops and livestock. Agroforestry \u2013 investment opportunities Investment in the producer end of agroforestry will require identification of investments that provide an attractive return profile. One challenge with respect to investing in the transition from a non-tree landscape to a tree landscape is that trees take time to grow and thus, \u2018greenfield\u2019 investments are generally not attractive to most investors. Greenfield investments in agroforestry promote the planting of new tree-based systems on land that does not currently produce investable revenue streams. The relative lack of investor interest in greenfield investments can be overcome by: (i) bundling agro-systems with different return profiles such as fast growing value-added crops with trees crops, or (ii) by identifying \u2018brownfield\u2019 investments that have been operating for some time that can provide a better return profile. When looking at which smallholder- linked components of the value chain would be attractive to investors in Rwanda, the combinations are virtually endless, which is a challenge for prioritising the FLR interventions. The following criteria were used to determine which agroforestry value chain activities were candidates for private investment in Rwanda: \u2022 Established demand and a competitive advantage in building demand for the revenue generating activities (international export, regional export, domestic growth); \u2022 Activity expands trees on the landscape (there may be numerous investment opportunities, such as tea, that will not promote establishment of agro-systems with trees); \u2022 The downstream components (processing, production, and distribution) are adequately in place to support the targeted growth in the activities (this may not be applicable for new products and value chains); \u2022 Evidence of commercial viability exists in the value chain for landowners/producers Intervention Unit Province National total East West North South Kigali New agroforestry on sloping land Area (ha) 272,723 87,183 63,683 250,504 31,069 705,162 New agroforestry on flat land Area (ha) 135,437 15,952 12,164 69,078 9,108 241,739 New agroforestry on pasture land Area (ha) 96,418 29,780 28,045 9,332 -- 163,575 Total 504,578 132,915 103,892 328,914 40,177 1,110,476 Table 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06575ba5-c291-4bdf-89f6-c2199f08d60d": {"__data__": {"id_": "06575ba5-c291-4bdf-89f6-c2199f08d60d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b209bfb3ece2654678bfd30e6767d465fdc80d2a10dd275130dd0b716a58f5e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "af3de4b5-eacd-4f06-a7c7-e6bd2e257566", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d90991e4901fca66eef87c6d36d29aa4d2cc51486b663e1614d636ac1895be7"}}, "hash": "ce5729e786ee8e6db88f8015dd663035d630f54672ab48cf6735bcf07e1e64a6", "text": "Opportunity areas for agroforestry interventions by province Source: MINIRENA, 2014. 20 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well and has a return profile for investors (leveraging existing operations and publically funded activities); \u2022 Activities are biophysically appropriate for landscape/ecosystem; and \u2022 There are positive social implications (improved livelihoods, food security, inclusive of women and other marginalized groups).

Though forest inventories to date have typically excluded small woodlots measuring less than 0.5 ha in area, it is estimated that 6.6% of the country\u2019s total area is comprised of small woodlots and trees outside of forests (Nduwamungu, 2011). As previously mentioned, the vast amount of energy used in Rwanda comes from biomass, comprising about 85% of the overall country energy consumption. It is estimated that 66% of biomass is used directly as fuel, 27% is converted into charcoal and the remaining 7% are crop residues and peat used directly or as charcoal. And while at least 70% of agricultural households in Rwanda have trees on their farms (Ndayambaje, et al., 2013), the 2008 National Agricultural Survey found that 9% of households own woodlots, while 34% own both woodlots and scattered trees. Improved management of woodlot and timber plantation interventions focus on improving and intensifying fuelwood and timber production. While two categories of woodlots were considered (improved management through spacing only, and improved management through spacing and best practices), these were considered as one category for investment opportunities. Given that eucalyptus is the primary source of fuelwood throughout Rwanda, it is assumed that all plots of eucalyptus have the potential to serve as woodlots for harvesting fuelwood. Conversion of charcoal is highly inefficient, losing one third of the biomass utilized (World Bank, 2012a). Biomass is an important source of labour and income, especially for people in rural areas where half of the value is distributed among woodlot owners and charcoal users. Biomass will not cease to be an important source of energy in the foreseeable future as there is not a known substitute capable of meeting the same needs at a lower price.

Unsustainable collection of wood causes deforestation, exacerbates erosion and mudslides, and contributes to desertification and loss of biodiversity, among other concerns. Fuel efficiency benefits will translate into a reduced need for fuelwood, and therefore lower deforestation rates. Advanced biomass cookstoves that use raw or processed biomass, for instance, reduce fuel use by up to 65%. Alcohol cookstoves eliminate direct use of wood fuels by utilizing ethanol or methanol, and some biogas cookstoves use biogas produced from biomass that is CO2 neutral with improved efficiency of up to 56%. Liquefied petroleum gas cookstoves have an estimated carbon impact per energy unit produced that is under that of biomass, and reduces the fuel to cook by 90% when compared to open-fire cooking. Plancha cookstoves utilize biomass or charcoal and, depending on their design, reduce 50-80% of fuel (biomass or charcoal) utilization. Rocket cookstoves use raw or processed biomass as fuel and, when properly designed, can reduce fuel utilization from 40-50%. Finally, solar cookstoves are the cleanest, using direct solar thermal energy with no additional fuel inputs needed (GACC, n.d.). Utilization and improvement of efficient cookstoves represents an important business opportunity in Rwanda for large producers/ designers and SMEs, as well as for research institutions and distributors (wholesalers and retailers). The government\u2019s Biomass Energy Strategy not only encourages improved charcoal efficiency and diversification of fuel sources, but also stimulates the aggressive promotion of improved charcoal stoves. It sets forth a goal to eradicate inefficient cookstoves in 86% of Figure 4. Improved cookstoves value chain 23 Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains the urban and 63% of the rural market by 2020. Currently, the ICS value chain is composed of four steps as follows (Blodgett, 2011). According to SNV\u2019s report Charcoal Value Chain and Improved Cookstove Sector Analyses (Blodgett, 2011), there are a number of inefficiencies in this value chain that can be addressed and provide opportunities for businesses. For example, there is insufficient coordination and lack of standards for the design of ICS. On the production side, some businesses are informal, the quality is low, there is a lack of cooperatives, financial resources are scarce, there is insufficient infrastructure and material costs are high. Financial service providers have the important role of providing loans, which are currently limited, especially to SMEs. There is also limited communication between research institutions, the Ministry of Infrastructure, and SMEs, which is critical for long-term coordination. For retail and distribution, roughly 60 informal and seven international businesses purchase ICS from producers to sell them to consumers; however, there is lack of proper marketing for the products, including the differences between them and their potential benefits. Research Institutions sell cookstoves mainly to the institutions of the government, such as ministries and prisons, which is also an obstacle for SMEs. Financial service providers should provide microfinance loans to consumers, but there is an absence of low interest loans. There are no long-term studies or monitoring and evaluation of the use of ICS in Rwanda, and there is a lack of awareness and understanding of the benefits among the 72% of Rwanda\u2019s urban population that use these stoves. Rwanda has a high penetration rate for ICS; however, only 50% of the households in the country have an ICS, and only 48% of them use them regularly (partly due to quality issues) (World Bank, 2012a). Thus, there are significant opportunities to introduce new highly efficient stoves. According to the Rwanda Market Assessment Sector Mapping report compiled by Accenture, the potential demand for cookstove intervention as of 2012 is approximately 2.4 million households (ADP, 2012). Innovative finance tools exist in the impact investment sector to potentially support greater ICS use in Rwanda. For example, INYENYERI, a for- profit social enterprise which aims to create sustainable social impacts while increasing access to financial capital lends Rwandans ICS for free. The company makes its profit by contractually requiring that pellets are bought or exchanged for dry, clean biomass in one of INYENYERI\u2019s locations. Attracting impact investors such as INYENYERI can create business opportunities for local technicians, researchers and manufacturers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2cbf21ca-8f31-440f-80f4-150ed4560b52": {"__data__": {"id_": "2cbf21ca-8f31-440f-80f4-150ed4560b52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "384d72a4978431f2d215989529408238240e5ce171e278387b9afe0b04b40d3d"}, "2": {"node_id": "4fdf4bb7-1c27-4f43-a30d-6f89160be581", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3f4a7fee3e2f30f9aca66dba995c1cb902ded4dc7338fe90b9d01e254795cf8"}}, "hash": "69531c7c9469093c8a42bb70c19158f405a5011e84f24a2a45a588c4a5f997a6", "text": "Other impact investors could provide access to credit for SMEs via microfinance or loan guarantees \u2013 filling an important gap not covered by the Rwandan financial sector.

This challenge can be turned into an opportunity, as farmers could implement agroforestry practices that allow them to grow shorter yield crops along with fuelwood trees. This includes, for example, horticulture and bee keeping. The Sustainable Energy through Woodlots and Agroforestry in the Albertine Rift (SEW) programme (The New Times, 2013) demonstrated that smallholders can save existing trees and plant new ones without threatening food production by strengthening the soil and soil fertility. The programme also decreased tree consumption by improving the organisation of the fuel and charcoal value chains, making the carbonisation process more efficient, and introducing ICS and Project developer Description Atmosfair Use of Sae80 stoves initially in Kigali and potentially expanding to rural areas Uganda Carbon Bureau East Africa programme of activities (POA) for all cookstove types INYENYERI Use of World Stove and construction of biomass pellet factories Impact Carbon Use of locally made or Ugandan efficient charcoal and wood stoves CO2 Balance Stove type unknown Manna Energy Developed locally made industrial EE cookstoves Wonderbag Use of Wonderbag cookstoves MININFRA Write policy recommendations for the Government of Rwanda, test and select best canamake stoves, train entrepreneurs in production of selected canamakes, promotion campaign for ICS use Global Environment Facility Sustainable Energy Development Project Promotion campaigns to support urban and rural cookstove programme, introduction and market testing of high efficiency cookstoves, support professionalism and semi-industrialisation of stove producers Millennium Village Institutional Cookstove Project Install institutional cookstoves in five new schools in Bugesera District CARE CASE Project A 2008 market survey for charcoal and cookstove use was conducted for the four districts where the project works.

It is important to mention that charcoal producers (called \u2018masters\u2019) are responsible for the relationship with local permitting authorities; permits are required for plantations over 0.5 ha. Key challenges include non-standardised permits, rates and durations throughout the districts, as well as long terms (two months) and lack of clarity on duration. Farmers applying for exploitation permits face restrictions and requirements that significantly delay operations while increasing transaction costs and the risk of corruption. Additionally, tight time frames force farmers to exploit wood that is not ready, causing further inefficiencies. The charcoal transformation process usually starts with one to two weeks of processing. This process can also be inefficient due to the widespread use of traditional methods, such as a mound kiln or a rectangular hillside kiln. Once processed, the charcoal cools down, and is bagged and taken to the closest roadside to be sold. Final prices vary due to numerous factors, including the type of wood used. Acacia is more expensive than eucalyptus by at least 20% (World Bank, 2012a). Carbonization with modern kilns produces better quality charcoal, and sellers closer to roads are able to offer charcoal at lower prices.

In order to achieve this, the World Bank proposes a set of recommendations to improve the value chain and generate further income (World Bank, 2012a). Among the recommendations are to: engage in more sustainable wood production (e.g. improved forestry plan, more secure land tenure); improve the charcoal production process (e.g. simplifying the process to acquire permits; Box 1: Potential corruption in the charcoal value chain in Rwanda Rwanda has one of the lowest levels of perceived corruption in both Africa and the world \u2013 3rd in the region and 49th among 175 countries (Transparency International, 2013).

The World Bank proposes that these value chain interventions be piloted for three years and with a budget of US$ 20 million. Sustainable woodlots \u2013 investment opportunities Plantations in Rwanda are commonly monocrops, with eucalyptus covering at least 59% of total plantation area, and Pinus plantations accounting for more than 28% (World Bank, 2012a). According to the World Bank, private plantations account for roughly 26% of forested land (World Bank, 2012a), while according to GIZ, that figure is closer to 35%. Most (89%) of woodlots are smaller than two hectares in size. Woodlots in Rwanda are primarily of two types. Traditional woodlots are characterised by wood production that competes with food production in the same space, while rotational woodlots utilise interrelated phases to alternately grow trees and crops. Traditional woodlots have the potential to undermine sustainability, particularly on small farms without adequate land to meet both food and fuel needs. While rotational woodlots are beneficial to wood productivity, they can be detrimental to soil health and fertility over time. In either case, large farms with enough land are able to dedicate a portion of land exclusively to woodlot cultivation, but generally only when woodlot products are market-driven and not subsistence-based (Ndayambaje, et al., 2013). Rwanda\u2019s NFP specifically targets the promotion of on-farm forestry, but woodlot promotion at the national level is constrained in the following ways: \u2022 Information on the relative efficiency of woodlots as a land-use strategy in the Rwandan context is unavailable or inadequate. This includes data on biophysical parameters and detailed and up-to-date information on socio-economic conditions driving wood use and extraction rates. \u2022 There have been no more than a handful of studies conducted on when, where, or why agricultural households in Rwanda choose to plant woodlots on their property, and what species are needed or desired (Ndayambaje, et al., 2013).

Currently, the Government of Rwanda relies on its own budget for financing woodlot promotion, with some support received from NGOs and development partners in Belgium and the Netherlands. These donor-backed initiatives have provided direct investment toward reforestation activities and capacity building at the central and district levels within both public and private forests. Despite the many advantages of promoting woodlots in a country where population pressures and land scarcity limit or prevent forest expansion, there appear to be very few organised efforts to promote woodlots.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "45809307-8f6b-48b2-a5d6-399fe21f2d09": {"__data__": {"id_": "45809307-8f6b-48b2-a5d6-399fe21f2d09", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cc73e4c1f5cd2d04f49bf6fd80b3bc77a95f78e9c7bc5ba53801ad40fa5d19e"}, "2": {"node_id": "6f96edef-c2bf-471d-b5c0-0d49c0e06a49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "629f1d39ff59c46c867f987eadf14da298f07576a900f45a6499adefc89e2d78"}}, "hash": "fdac8fb593723b61591cdedb595f52b393745d2eda4186030f79924c7e29ccc3", "text": "Production in woodlots is highly inefficient, mainly because woodlots are primarily owned by small farmers with less than two hectares of land; more than 60% of households cultivate just 0.7 ha or less.

Furthermore, most seeds used in Rwanda are supplied by the Tree Seed Center of the Rwanda Agricultural Research Institute. There has been evidence of genetic degradation of germplasm12, which has primarily affected eucalyptus and has resulted in decreased plantation yields (Nduwamungu, 2011). As such, productivity is currently low, at 18-30% efficiency. Site quality is also low, mainly due to inappropriate management practices during planting, thinning and harvesting. Forest plantations \u2013 investment opportunities Plantations in Rwanda constitute over 42% of all forests, and are predominated by Eucalyptus spp. (AFCN, 2012), which produce low quality timber due to poor species choice and poor management. Currently, good quality timber and finished wood products are imported from China, Dubai, Uganda or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Improving the quality of domestic timber and wood products could be an important income opportunity. For this to be possible, it is necessary to: (i) support plantations that promote indigenous species, (ii) improve the quality of seeds, and (iii) improve processing facilities13 and stacking techniques. Indigenous species grow more slowly but consume less water than eucalyptus and pine, and are better adapted to local conditions, improving pest and disease resistance. Higher quality timber is more valuable, and indigenous species can be part of multi-use agroforestry systems. In addition, these native species support alternative activities such as bee keeping, ecotourism and horticulture. Some adequate indigenous species that can be considered for plantations include: \u2022 Entandrophragma excelsum \u2013 The wood is used for construction, furniture, toys, and carvings. \u2022 Podocarpus falcatus \u2013 A high quality wood used for building timber, floors and roofing, furniture, and shelving. The ripe fruit is edible. \u2022 Markhamia lutea (or M. platycalyx) \u2013 It provides good bee forage. The trees are a source of fuelwood and produce good charcoal. The wood is used for furniture, poles, posts, tool handles and boat building.

Decreasing quality of genetic stock represents an important opportunity to source pure seeds and use stricter seed selection to enhance yields for farmers. New and improved seed suppliers and nurseries could be managed by small businesses enabled by loans using microfinance or equity schemes from impact investors or the government. There are no large plantations that are in the position to offer high quality timber or timber products, and thus there is little potential for investment in existing plantations without processing improvements. This would require investment in modern sawmills, wood based panel plants, timber treating plants, training, and introduction of certification systems. Investments can be enabled by loans, equity, and loan-to-rent schemes, which can be part of private impact investment initiatives in the case of cooperatives and/or small farmers. The CDM and voluntary markets offer income opportunities for projects that use waste woodchips and sawdust for biomass.14 There is an opportunity for the government to increase the budget for forest activities if taxation and royalties are more explicitly allocated. Today, taxes from harvesting operations and fines go to a common \u2018bag\u2019 and cannot be differentiated from other taxes or fines in other sectors. Rwanda should leverage the NFP, which provides for a phasing out of the government from forestry activities, shifting management to the private sector.

In Gishwati, for example, just 700 ha of natural habitat remain, while in Mukura Forest Reserve, just 800 ha of degraded natural habitat remain. Investable opportunities for expanding and restoring Rwanda\u2019s natural forests are limited, given the very small amount of natural forest left and the extent to which population and land pressure have almost entirely eliminated the availability of land for expansion of natural forests. This implies a need to interact closely with the communities living in the periphery of national parks and/or areas containing natural forest. The RDB plans to diversify attractions in VNP and create new attractions at Nyungwe National Park. Suitable FLR interventions aimed at habitat restoration could potentially mesh with private sector interests in maintaining and expanding their offerings. Meanwhile, the creation of buffers can serve as an investable opportunity through the production of NTFPs and the creation of purchase agreements between local landholders and hotels and other businesses. Ecotourism \u2013 investment opportunities Rwanda\u2019s national export and tourism policies both outline objectives related to the expansion of ecotourism in the country, particularly around Rwanda\u2019s remaining natural forests and national parks and reserves. Masozera (2008) used the contingent valuation method to determine that the estimated biodiversity conservation value conferred to ecotourism operators in the vicinity of Nyungwe National Park is US$ 2 million per year; by comparison, the total recreation and tourism value in Nyungwe is approximately US$ 3.34 million annually. Tourism revenue is the primary source of funding for the Rwanda\u2019s national parks and reserves, so a synergistic relationship between the parks and those who use them is essential. Simple interventions and partnerships between local communities and the ecotourism sector could promote an expansion and maintenance of buffers and wildlife habitat that can also serve as a source of NTFPs. Potential for greater tourism revenue through the expansion of habitat for chimpanzees, birds and other wildlife has been identified in Gishwati, Mukura and Nyungwe. The conservation of these areas often comes at the expense of local communities that are unable to utilize or benefit from the natural resources they contain. Fires contribute to the spread and propagation of bracken ferns (Pteridium aquilinum), whose fire-resistant roots and airborne spores prevent the successful establishment of tree seedlings. The promotion of improved forest management or improved vegetation management practices have been found to be useful in stimulating accelerated regeneration in fire-affected areas overtaken by bracken ferns. For example, in buffer zones around national parks and other areas disturbed by wildfire, cutting of ferns once per quarter over three years allows tree seedlings to eventually grow taller. In five years, areas treated with quarterly cutting exhibited Intervention Unit Province National total East West North South Kigali 100 m buffer of closed natural forest Area (ha) 557 2,085 499 315 - 3,456 Restore degraded forest in parks/ reserves Area (ha) - 3,629 - 6,848 - 10,477 Table 7.

The creation of three new \u201cbirding routes\u201d in Bugesera, Nyabihu and Rugezi wetlands in mid-2011, as well as additional on-going promotion of avitourism in the country, is expected to generate US$ 12 million annually (RDB, 2011). Due to the inability of Rwanda to support mass tourism given its small size, \u2018high value\u2019 tourists will need to be targeted. It is also important to note that birders visiting Rwanda may have interest in visiting areas others than those identified as most appropriate for FLR transitions in and around national parks and/ or protected areas. There appear to be a very limited number of private tourism operators currently offering bird-related activities, and fewer still offer avitourism independently of more \u2018traditional\u2019 ecotourism opportunities, like gorilla tours. Those that offer an avitourism component may not even offer these tours in areas best suited for FLR. Two notable operators are Birding & Educational Tours Ltd. and Wildlife Tours \u2013 Rwanda, both of which are Rwandan owned and operated. The latter reports that as much as 90% of its revenues go back into local communities, setting a strong precedent for community-based avitourism in the country. NTPFs in/around protected areas \u2013 investment opportunities Knowledge of NTFPs in Rwanda appears to be widespread, and some of Rwanda\u2019s most common NTFPs include medicinal plants, honey, bamboo, fruits, and tree seeds. NTFPs are an important component for rural economic growth because they can be marketed and provide cash income without deforestation. In a survey of households surrounding VNP, it was found that bamboo, beekeeping and medicinal plants are the most common NTFPs, with 44.8%, 43.3% and 34.3% of respondents benefitting, respectively. One kilogram of honey can command a price of up to RwF 3,500 (US$ 5), while a chair produced from bamboo and sold to a nearby hotel can be worth RwF 5,000 (US$ 7.30). Together, honey and bamboo are responsible for 60% of the value of NTFPs produced in some districts (Nahayo, et al., 2013b). Most of Rwanda\u2019s NTFPs are produced within buffer zones, providing additional benefits when buffers are created and restored around natural forests and national parks. NTFPs are also important during the dry season, when a larger number of poor households use them as an income source. NTFPs differ from traditional agricultural products due to the importance of wild harvesting in the production process, which inherently limits yields for individuals or households. The development of some type of organizing or oversight body is essential to ensure a supply substantial enough to make subsequent processing and distribution steps economical. In instances where NTFPs are harvested from common land, community organizations are typically well positioned to 31 Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains manage these activities. In instances where NTFPs are harvested primarily from smallholder plots, cooperatives are more likely to form to reduce costs and improve bargaining power. Purchase agreements between ecotourism operators and/or urban retailers and community groups engaged in the production of NTFPs could provide an income source for households. Hotels in Rwanda have already begun sourcing furniture crafted from bamboo, the cultivation of which is being promoted in Rwanda. Deforested land g Improvement or establishment of protective forests Evidence of soil erosion is exhibited in 50% of Rwanda\u2019s agricultural land (Andrew & Masozera, 2010). Protective forests on ridge tops and steep and very steep sloping hillsides have the potential to prevent 9-31 tonnes of erosion per hectare per year. From the perspective of erosion control, reforestation of these areas has far greater reduction potential than agroforestry or the conversion of woodlots from poorly managed to well-managed. In fact, erosion control is one of the few \u2018investable\u2019 opportunities related to watershed management in Rwanda. Watersheds are, in many ways, the limiting factor for many of Rwanda\u2019s industries. Without the services they provide, Rwanda\u2019s agricultural, energy, and export sectors would be severely jeopardised, and smallholders would face even more challenges in meeting subsistence and domestic needs in the face of an unpredictable climate and competitive water use scenario.

The Strategic Plan of Action for the National Disaster Management Policy (MIDIMAR, 2012) includes three phases, two of which are relevant to protective forests (not to be confused with protected forests): prevention and/or mitigation of risk prior to disaster occurrence; and, rehabilitation after a disaster takes place. Risk factors related to protective forests identified in the National Disaster Risk Management Plan (MIDIMAR, 2013) include Rwanda\u2019s hilly topography, high annual precipitation, which has markedly increased over the last decade, deforestation, inappropriate hillside farming practices, and the effects of climate change. Protective forests play an important role in maintaining ecosystem services, particularly as they relate to watersheds. Protective forests planted on ridge tops and sloping hillsides help to prevent erosion and mudslides by acting as a buffer and promoting soil health and stability, thereby safeguarding rivers and wetlands from the harmful effects of siltation15 and sedimentation.16 In Rwanda, these forests fall into five categories of intervention representing these two types of landscape restoration activities: first, protective forests on ridge 15\ufffd The\ufffdincreased\ufffdconcentration\ufffdof\ufffdsuspended,\ufffdfine\ufffdparticulates\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdwater\ufffdcolumn\ufffdand\ufffdincreased\ufffdaccumulation\ufffdof\ufffdfine\ufffdsediments\ufffdon\ufffd the\ufffdbottom.\ufffdIn\ufffdrural\ufffdareas,\ufffdclimate\ufffdchange\ufffdand\ufffdpoor\ufffdland\ufffdmanagement\ufffdpractices\ufffdcommonly\ufffdcontribute\ufffdto\ufffdsiltation\ufffdof\ufffdwaterways. 16\ufffd The\ufffdtendency\ufffdfor\ufffdparticles\ufffdin\ufffdsuspension\ufffdto\ufffdsettle\ufffdout\ufffdof\ufffdthe\ufffdfluid\ufffdin\ufffdwhich\ufffdthey\ufffdare\ufffdcontained\ufffdand\ufffdcome\ufffdto\ufffdrest\ufffdagainst\ufffda\ufffdbarrier.\ufffd Sedimentation\ufffdis\ufffdparticularly\ufffdproblematic\ufffdin\ufffdthe\ufffdcontext\ufffdof\ufffdhydroelectric\ufffdplants. 32 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well tops and steep or very steep slopes provide watershed protection through erosion control; and second, \u2018other\u2019 watershed management- related interventions help Rwanda achieve its objectives under an integrated water resource management approach as prioritized in its National Adaptation Programme of Action on climate change. The five specific categories of intervention are: 1. Planting of protective forests on ridge tops and hillsides with very steep slopes, categorised as having slopes greater than 30 degrees, or a 55% incline. 2. Planting of protective forests on ridge tops and hillsides with steep slopes, categorised as having slopes between 12-30 degrees, or between 20-55% incline. 3. Creation of 20 m buffers planted with native tree species along non-forested river courses. 4. Replacing existing Eucalyptus spp. with native tree species within 20 m of river courses. 5. Planting of native species to be used as buffers within 50 m of wetlands. The greatest opportunities for planting protective forests on ridge tops and hillsides with steep and very steep slopes are within the North, South, and West Provinces; in total, there are roughly 42,000 ha, or 2% of Rwanda\u2019s total area, that are potentially suited for the creation of protective forests. Opportunities for activities under the watershed management categories exist nation-wide, and Rwanda\u2019s extensive network of rivers, streams, and wetlands represents an important opportunity for mitigating the flow of sediment into these crucial water bodies. The potential for 20 m buffers of native tree species along rivers and streams in non- forested areas or the replacement of existing Eucalyptus spp. stands is 23,000 ha in total, or 1% of Rwanda\u2019s total area. The level of opportunity is roughly equal across all five provinces, although there is a slightly higher concentration in the South Province. Opportunity for the establishment of 50 m buffers of native species around the perimeter of wetlands totals approximately 57,000 ha. Parts of all five provinces show potential, but the East and South Provinces have the greatest area available for these interventions.

Africa as a whole contains nearly 30% of the world\u2019s total hydropower potential, but 93% of that potential currently remains unexploited. In East Africa, hydropower is expected to provide 79% of total new additional generation capacity (Quirke, 2012). Africa\u2019s hydroelectric production costs are the lowest in the world, and SSHP is one of the few energy sources able to confer multiple benefits to communities, the environment, the government and the private sector alike. Rainfall and topography are two key determinants of a country\u2019s hydropower potential, and \u2018the Land of 1,000 Hills\u2019 is very well suited for SSHP in particular. Rwanda receives an average of 1,100-1,200 mm18 of rainfall annually, and the steeply sloping hillsides that make up the country\u2019s landscape are typically between 1,500 m and 3,000 m in elevation.19 Despite these figures, Rwanda remains a water-scarce country due to a combination of poor land-use management practices, including: deforestation on hillsides and ridge tops protecting watersheds; population pressures that have resulted in human encroachment and agricultural cultivation in delicate riparian zones up to the very edges of water bodies; inefficient water use in irrigation and large-scale hydropower (LSHP) systems; and competing extractive uses of water that are largely unregulated. The strategy employed by the Government of Rwanda to address water scarcity has mainly focused on law enforcement and the expansion of infrastructure, with little to no inclusion of environmental management instruments aimed at water and soil conservation. As of 2008, Rwanda\u2019s available per capita renewable water was 977.3 m3/year, less than a quarter of the average per capita amount of 4,008m3/year for the whole of Africa (MINIRENA, 2011).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0769e370-0401-4b5b-8920-632edd6e13b6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0769e370-0401-4b5b-8920-632edd6e13b6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8333063d37307f28a9e715410a0a49f5f11b29b67fa9e86bd963f24652133f7"}, "2": {"node_id": "046b9526-47e1-4ba0-a4b0-1b0ec74a8012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d613b4ec09e5f009adf9d6dfa99d27b9ff6fcb58fd01397005d8b241de5673a4"}}, "hash": "1383b1b967de3fd84cf743b720eb8c13668bca5119e1f6b0b2f69ac72d921a5d", "text": "SSHP represents a unique opportunity to promote a renewable alternative to biomass for rural Rwandan communities alongside activities that will promote conservation of the country\u2019s waterways as an energy source while restoring and reforesting forest landscapes in Rwanda\u2019s watersheds. In further conjunction with payments for watershed services (PWS), which should include riparian zone restoration, investment in SSHP can help Rwanda achieve its myriad poverty reduction, economic development and landscape restoration goals. Importance of SSHP in meeting development goals and reducing landscape degradation Compared to other countries with similar hydrologic and topographic potential for SSHP, such as Nepal,20 Rwanda\u2019s current rural electrification rate is just 1.3% (Bensch, et al., 2010). Electricity is a critical component for rural development. It allows for a greater diversification of livelihood activities, supports efficient agriculture value chains, promotes literacy and education, and helps reduce the outflow of youth and young adults to urban areas by creating new opportunities in their home communities. While market penetration of SSHP in Rwanda is still fairly limited, the adoption of this technology in similar geographies has resulted in four-fold increases in personal incomes21 due to the ability to power productive enterprises, such as mills, welding shops and woodworking enterprises.

A clean energy source also reduces the health risks associated with burning biomass, particularly for women and children. SSHP schemes are also the most environmentally friendly means of generating electricity as they are typically \u2018run-of-river\u2019 and do not significantly alter the flow of waterways. There are also few large rivers in Rwanda capable of providing a sustainable, year-round supply of water to LSHP plants; however, smaller rivers and streams are less vulnerable during times of drought and other climatically-induced irregularities in precipitation, providing a more reliable and diffuse source of hydroelectric potential. This can also provide a large cost- savings to the Government of Rwanda by avoiding the high cost of emergency power when large dams fail due to drought or when production must be halted to maintain turbines clogged with sediments. Perhaps the greatest benefit of SSHP as a strategy for reducing deforestation while improving rural livelihoods is the low capital requirement. For example, a 5 kW system, which could drive an electric mill and provide light for a community of 500 people, costs approximately US$ 5,200-7,800 to establish (Quirke, 2012; Meier & Fischer, 2011). Capital requirements for establishing SSHP in Rwanda are also less than many other countries that employ micro- and pico-hydropower. The cost of establishing such a system in Rwanda is approximately 20% less than the cost of establishing the same system in Indonesia, for example (Meier & Fischer, 2011). Though SSHP does not benefit from economies of scale the way LSHP does, it clearly confers greater benefits toward achieving national energy security and rural electrification of diffuse communities. Because the value placed on electricity is so high in these rural areas, technology transfer occurs quickly, and SSHP schemes are more likely to be \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 because they can be created from common, and often recycled, materials. In fact, several of Rwanda\u2019s private SSHP \u2018success stories\u2019 are from self-taught entrepreneurs that created marketable solutions to meet the everyday needs of their communities. In general, rural Rwandans in non-electrified areas exhibit a high willingness-to-pay, particularly since household connection fees, ranging from just US$ 33-9022 in some areas, are below the subsidised costs of connection to the national grid. Monthly payment plans make SSHP accessible to poorer households and, in many cases, community members have successfully formed cooperatives, raising as much as 50% of the cost of a pico-hydropower plant (Meier & Fischer, 2011). Investable opportunities in SSHP in Rwanda While rehabilitation and reforestation of protective forests on steep and very steep hillsides and ridge tops does not generate a positive return on investment in and of itself, micro-hydropower can reduce pressure on these areas, allowing them to regenerate both naturally and with the help of local communities via activities promoted alongside micro- hydropower. All the while, it creates a return for investors through the sale of energy to the Government of Rwanda and private third parties. The Ministry of Infrastructure Rwanda (MININFRA) has identified over 333 sites for SSHP (micro- and pico-) with a combined installed capacity of 96 mW (Hove, et al., 2011) in its Hydropower Atlas. However, it seems likely that this figure does not reflect the true SSHP potential in Rwanda, particularly in places where pico-hydropower or a cascade of several pico-hydropower plants could be developed.

Rwanda has started to attract private investment in SSHP. There are currently at least seven private sector site developers operating approximately 30 pico-hydropower sites. They are primarily Rwandan entrepreneurs, and the first efforts have been made to attract private commercial participation in micro-hydropower in the country. The first effort to engage the private sector has been through the Private Sector Participation in Micro-hydropower Project (PSP Project), supported by the Dutch-German energy partnership \u2018Energizing Development\u2019, implemented by GIZ, and in partnership with MININFRA and the Energy, Water and Sanitation Authority (EWSA). The project\u2019s objectives were to provide more people with electricity via micro-hydropower projects, and sector development with the aim of creating a self- sustaining SSHP sector. In 2006, when the project began, there were no private companies working in renewable energy in Rwanda. The project was structured in such a way that subsidies for private sector participants, primarily independent power producers (IPPs) that are responsible for the construction and operation of SSHP plants but are not themselves utilities, were below 50% of the investment costs, enough to make the individual SSHP projects profitable while still closing the viability gap.25 In addition to the creation of new, privately-owned and operated SSHP plants, MININFRA is also interested in the privatisation of all SSHP plants with a generation capacity of 2,500 kW or less, opening up additional opportunities for private sector engagement in the SSHP space. At least five micro-hydropower plants are currently slated for privatisation, and the first proposals from private sector companies have already started to come in. The PSP Project issued two rounds of tenders for SSHP projects to be included under this co-financing arrangement, and memorandums of understanding were signed with the district in which a project was to take place, MININFRA, and RBD. The companies that were ultimately included in the project were ENNY, CALIMAX, SOGEMR, REGREPOWER, RED/REPRO, and REPRO, and direct and indirect support provided by the PSP Project will support the generation of nearly 15,000 kW across 20 sites.

There are effectively three ways of generating a return on investment for IPPs operating SSHP plants, both of which were utilized under the PSP Project. The first is a power purchase agreement (PPA), which EWSA negotiates with and issues to private sector operators. PPAs are likely to be \u2018take-or-pay\u2019 arrangements, in which the Government of Rwanda is obliged to purchase the power produced or pay a penalty to the IPP. PPAs decrease risks for developers and are a convincing mechanism to obtain debt financing from banks. Under the PSP Project, Banque Rwandaise de Developpement, Banque Commerciale du Rwanda, and Banque de Kigali have all given commercial loans and/or turbine leases to micro-hydropower project developers. Conditions are flexible for both parties, and a standard tariff is applied for nine years, renewable annually. There are no penalties for failure to deliver a minimum quantity of electricity.

Initial analysis indicates that private sector IPPs in Rwanda would gain the most economic benefit from using both distribution mechanisms simultaneously (Pigaht & van der Plas, 2009). Related to PPAs is the establishment of a feed- in tariff, in which IPPs receive compensation about retail and, as the percentage of adopters increases, the feed-in tariff is reduced to the retail rate. This scheme was first introduced in Rwanda in February 2012 as part of the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariffs Programme. The third vehicle for generating return on investment is known as a wheeling agreement, whereby IPPs generating electricity in their privately owned and operated SSHP plants are able to sell electricity to private third parties while using the national EWSA grid.

Landscape restoration activities that can be promoted alongside the implementation of micro-hydropower systems in Rwanda could include, but are not limited to the following list. Support for these activities could come from a variety of funding sources related to SSHP, such as tariffs charged by operators of pico- hydropower plants or from money generated from buy-backs that are part of PPAs. These activities could also fall under the umbrella of PWS: 1. Targeted hillside and ridge top reforestation initiatives in key watersheds. This particular activity was undertaken in Rwanda as part of the Kirehe Community-Based Watershed 38 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well Management Project, and was intended to address erosion risks related to degraded landscapes and guarantee increased wood production for communities, with a \u2018first round\u2019 target area of approximately 1,500 ha.26 While it is recommended that appropriate tree species are determined through close consultation with communities, the project assumed reforestation with a mix of 30% Acacia mearnsii, 40% Eucalyptus spp., and 30% Pinus spp. at a density of 1,111 plants per ha. As part of soil and water conservation measures, reforestation could be supplemented with progressive and/ or bench terraces, as well as the creation of hedgerows. These initial targeted reforestation initiatives would ideally be promoted alongside the following listed activities. 2. Production of tree seedlings and/or nurseries. Since Rwanda\u2019s remaining natural forests are relegated to just a few areas around the country, and because micro-hydropower will reduce pressure on but will not eliminate the need for tree-based forest products for fuel and other needs, it is likely that any hillside reforestation initiatives will still need to incorporate, at least partially, reforestation with hardwoods and/or agroforestry- appropriate species such as fruit trees. Rwanda has a history of annual community tree planting and reforestation activities, which have been largely unsuccessful in achieving lasting landscape restoration due to a low survival rate of planted seedlings. Of particular importance for riparian zones is the creation of a source of seeds or seedlings for deeply rooted trees, such as Grevillea robusta, which provide soil stabilisation and which can replace water- intensive species like Eucalyptus spp. These may or may not include species suitable for agroforestry, but would ideally be promoted in conjunction with perennial crops. The creation and maintenance of nurseries for reforestation efforts has been mainstreamed in other SSHP projects, such as the Namche Bazaar Small Hydro and Rural Electrification Project in Nepal. 3. Farmer-managed natural regeneration (FMNR). FMNR is a technique that utilizes existing stumps, roots and shrubs on farmers\u2019 land, as well as seeds and seedlings to enhance restoration. It offers a low-cost, low-risk opportunity for farmers in Rwanda to meet their own productive needs while restoring forested landscapes and their biophysical conditions in watersheds. Like SSHP technology, FMNR has the advantage of being easily spread via word of mouth and replicable without any formal training. In Niger, for example, FMNR has spread, largely through informal channels, to encompass more than five million hectares of agricultural land (Reij, et al., 2011). FMNR can utilize existing stumps, roots and shrubs on farmers\u2019 land, as well as seeds and seedlings produced as a separate restoration activity, and FMNR-related practices such as coppicing allow for use of biomass without irreversibly damaging entire trees. FMNR can also provide a strong basis for community- managed forestry activities, particularly since land holdings in Rwanda tend to be quite small and fragmented. 4.

Drawbacks and limitations of LSHP in advancing Rwanda\u2019s development agenda While LSHP many be a more traditional investment vehicle, there are numerous reasons why it is not suggested as a key component for funding landscape restoration. There are constraints to and externalities associated with the creation, operation and maintenance of LSHP projects. In addition to the high initial capital and start-up costs, which must often be vetted by international lenders and are frequently funded in a foreign currency, dam and reservoir construction can result in mass displacement of communities and the flooding of vast swaths of arable land. Beneficiaries are often located miles away from the rural areas where LSHP plants are constructed, with power produced in rural areas directed to urban centres, and costs associated with transmission are high. A return on investment for investors is not guaranteed, and dams are a \u2018useless asset\u2019 unless fully constructed and operational (Everett, 2014). Creation of reservoirs also negatively impacts a country\u2019s greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction strategies. Decomposing organic material in reservoirs, from soil erosion and plant matter and other debris that enter waterways, results in the emission of methane and carbon dioxide. Globally, studies have attributed as much as 4% of anthropogenic GHG emissions to large hydroelectric infrastructure, with tropical reservoirs contributing more than their temperate counterparts (McCully, 2007; Lima, et al., 2008). Degradation of wetlands and deforestation of hillsides, ridge tops and riparian zones have resulted in further soil erosion, landslides and flooding, contributing to a loss of energy generation potential and leading to power shortages and water scarcity. Further shortages occur when operators are forced to shut down plants for maintenance to address the damage and degradation to turbines resulting from sedimentation. These factors have resulted in an incremental reduction in watershed services over the last 20 years, and some of Rwanda\u2019s LSHP plants are now operating at just 20% of their energy generating capacity.27 LSHP installations are also increasingly at odds with other uses of water, particularly as the impacts of climate change increase competition for limited water resources. This makes LSHP a poor choice for addressing Rwanda\u2019s energy and energy security needs, at least in the short and medium term. Many large waterways that were once counted on as being perennial during periods of normal precipitation are no longer reliable as rainfall becomes more unpredictable. More frequent and prolonged periods of drought, and the severity of flooding events, makes capturing water for electricity generation more challenging. Communities downstream from hydroelectric plants that are not \u2018run-of-river,\u2019 thereby requiring dams and reservoirs to generate the necessary hydraulic head for energy production, may face water shortages, the impacts of which are further exacerbated by the effects of climate change. LSHP plants are generally not multipurpose, and are thus unable to help smallholders appropriately manage water and cope with the effects of drought, most notably crop failure 27\ufffd Rwanda\u2019s\ufffdNtaruka\ufffdplant\ufffdis\ufffdnow\ufffdgenerating\ufffd2.5\ufffdMW\ufffdof\ufffdpower,\ufffddown\ufffdfrom\ufffd11.25,\ufffdwhile\ufffdits\ufffdMukungwa\ufffdplant\ufffdis\ufffdgenerating\ufffd5\ufffdMW,\ufffddown\ufffd from\ufffd12.45\ufffdMW. 40 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well and the other consequences of being forced to choose between water for basic survival and subsistence agriculture. Rwanda\u2019s water- intensive commercial sectors, such as the tea industry, also jeopardise a steady supply of water for power generation from large plants, as they are able to utilize Rwanda\u2019s \u2018free\u2019 water resources to any extent necessary, including the construction and operation of their own hydropower systems. Rwanda\u2019s current energy profile results in high environmental and economic costs. The limited availability of electricity overall, coupled with chronic power shortages that result from water scarcity, have caused the retail price per kilowatt-hour to increase from US$ 0.05/ kWh to US$ 0.21/kWh in less than ten years. The household tariff is even higher, at US$ 0.24/kWh, as the domestic electricity supply is supplemented by a high proportion of diesel- generated energy (Pigaht & van der Plas, 2009). It is anticipated that the price per kWh for energy generated from LSHP will continue to increase due to reductions in energy production and increased water scarcity resulting from an increased demand driven by economic and population growth.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c892be34-1067-4771-af50-8593a9ddd164": {"__data__": {"id_": "c892be34-1067-4771-af50-8593a9ddd164", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f158db4140d12d55fcd05b020a9ff576ec3b2727205b6a3c3556f642ab0f4cde"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf071860-e640-411b-bbd7-70359f0208dc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "99bcd28834edbb26406df570e6dc2f919a79fe794f941d026d06eaa90c508267"}}, "hash": "87737daddc7f09714dbfa2a2dab8e5d7b3db57966b83d7089262cae9ebe486b8", "text": "Payments for watershed services by major beneficiaries \u2013 investment opportunities The annual economic value of watershed protections services provided in Nyungwe National Park alone is nearly US$ 118 million (Masozera, 2008).

The applicability of this method was applied in the context of Rwanda\u2019s IPPs and tea industry, and is discussed later. The top three most valuable \u2018uses\u2019 of watershed services are: 1. Tea production (US$ 804/ha/year), 2. SSHP supply potential (US$ 164/ha/year), 3. Flood prevention for tea estates and hydropower producers (US$ 137/ha/year) (Masozera, 2008). Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that tea producers and IPPs may represent two private sector interests to serve as investors in watershed services. Beyond benefits to industrial sectors, investments in watershed management are capable of producing a 30% increase in household incomes from agriculture, and investors can expect a return of 7% per year. In fact, for every dollar invested in watershed management in Rwanda now, three dollars will be generated by 2020 (REMA, 2012). However, information on activities related to watershed management and protection is limited. Case studies conducted by the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA) have identified a handful of potential investable watershed interventions: riparian zone protection and restoration, bench terraces on watersheds, construction of gabions28 along widened river channels, and the installation of three additional gauge stations for purposes of enhanced hydrologic modelling. Two fundamental barriers exist to establishing PWS in Africa: the financial health of institutions benefitting from watershed services, and a lack of \u2018consumers\u2019 of ecosystem services with the ability to pay (Andrew & Masozera, 2010). As detailed above, there are effectively three types of private sector interests that would not only benefit from promoting PWS, but which are not inhibited by these barriers in Rwanda.

Riparian zones, defined as the interface between land and a river or stream in which channels, corridors, and/or vegetation are typically present, are critical to the country\u2019s development agenda. These zones are critical for the provision of vital watershed services; reducing soil erosion and the resulting siltation (and eventual sedimentation) of waterways, increasing infiltration capacity of soils, flood prevention, drought mitigation, and recharge of ground and surface water that are central to maintaining and increasing Rwanda\u2019s hydroelectric potential, safeguarding its agricultural productivity, and improving the quality of Rwanda\u2019s freshwater resources. These key areas have become degraded over time due to the deliberate draining and cultivation of wetlands and riparian zones, and population pressure has resulted in human settlements extending to the very edge of waterways and wetlands. The promotion of NTFPs in buffers around Rwanda\u2019s waterways is a potential opportunity for safeguarding watershed services and improving community livelihoods. A survey regarding knowledge and use of NTFPs around VNP found that bamboo was the single most commonly utilized NTFP, with 44.8% of households producing goods from bamboo, and that NTFPs are most commonly produced within barriers around waterways. By supporting the creation of fast-growing bamboo buffers in riparian zones, investors also enable the production of a valuable NTFP that has further value when transformed into furniture or other uses. Limited information is available on riparian zone restoration and the use of bamboo in Rwanda. A bamboo promotion project in the Burera District is being carried out by the Rwandan Association of Ecologists (ARECO). With nearly \u20ac400,000 in support provided by the European Union, the project, which runs through January of 2015, is intended to build on a national policy established by the Government of Rwanda promoting bamboo for its economic potential. Additionally, the riparian zones around the Rugezi Wetlands have been prioritised for environmental protection alongside VNP, with the hope that planting bamboo in vegetative buffers will reduce siltation in the former while curbing illegal bamboo harvesting in the latter. The importance of the Rugezi Wetlands, and the larger Rugezi-Bulera-Ruhondo watershed, was realised in light of the electricity crisis faced by Rwanda in the mid-2000s.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a33ed41d-0058-4180-a04e-f5069c58e6b2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a33ed41d-0058-4180-a04e-f5069c58e6b2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c6a35605de48b2b4e1785bba565639f5995cd8fe7b821dc29ed97268d059815"}, "2": {"node_id": "39000f56-0a67-4b26-8cc0-19255b895631", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f16528cd2c3d223f1d979917faec42fbdab18db051011f0a5f82caab793ee06"}}, "hash": "a666e0e59f41de79cf4b66b08018682a6b537a0325bafe90be0dc62d4067c978", "text": "Rwanda sought to halt the degradation of these wetlands by disallowing on-going drainage activities in Rugezi, as well as banning agricultural and pastoral activities within and along its shores.

The total area of Rugezi Wetland is 6,725 ha; of this area, the project aims to create 470 ha of bamboo plantations. The success of the project and the larger adoption of bamboo cultivation as a conservation and livelihood activity in Rwanda will require a variety of community- oriented interventions, ideally backed by private sector water users and/or watershed service beneficiaries. As two of the largest beneficiaries of watershed services, IPPs and the tea industry are in a position to safeguard their own supply 42 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well chains while promoting landscape restoration interventions that help Rwanda achieve its development goals. Independent power producers Watershed services benefit IPPs primarily in the form of: (i) avoided costs resulting from sedimentation leading to a loss of generation capacity; (ii) the associated costs due to a reduction of energy production, including the inability to meet obligations under PPAs with the Government of Rwanda; and (iii) economic losses due to maintenance, which requires a temporary yet full halt in electricity generation from a plant. Case studies on watershed services in Rwanda, or lack thereof, have found staggering decreases in productivity. Masozera (2008) found that the annual cost associated with sedimentation of one hydropower plant in Gishwati is approximately US$ 1.15 million, equating to an energy loss of 38% of total production. It could be concluded that these costs are directly tied to sedimentation resulting from deforestation of the Gishwati Forest Reserve. In the Nyungwe watershed case study conducted by Masozera (2008), the avoided cost method was used to determine the cost savings received by IPPs and EWSA, the state electricity agency, related to water treatment and water quality. Commercial treatment of water by using reactants to remove sediments is one of the most costly steps in the water treatment process, particularly when using aluminum sulphate (Al2(SO4)3). Without erosion control provided by watersheds, the costs of water treatment can quickly escalate. Based on variable annual average sediment loading, it is estimated that EWSA saves US$ 30,000 or more in Al2(SO4)3 alone each year. Tea industry Tea in Rwanda is primarily rain-fed bulk black tea. While the national water footprint of one kilogram of black tea is lower than the international average29 at 8.25 m3/kg, the average value of a cubic metre of water for tea production in Rwanda is higher than its Nile Basin counterparts, at US$ 0.60/ m3. When compared to the average value of a cubic metre of water for coffee and sugar production in Rwanda and its neighbours, this difference in value is even more apparent. The same cubic metre of water to produce coffee and sugar costs just US$ 0.12 and US$ 0.13, respectively (Zeitoun, et al., 2010). The impacts of climate change have caused a noticeable decline in precipitation over the last several years, with resulting decreases in productivity and yields of Rwanda\u2019s tea crops. Water represents a strategic commodity for the tea industry. Irrigation is now becoming increasingly imperative for maintaining yields, particularly as Rwanda aims to shift its cultivation to higher quality varieties of tea that are more competitive on the international market. Tea estates are among the primary industrial users of water in Rwanda. Like other industries, the tea industry is largely self-supplied and is not connected to a distribution network. In addition to the water used for growing tea, water is used for processing leaves into black tea, which requires both adequate quantity and quality. The \u2018free\u2019 water provided by the Nyungwe watershed to tea estates and the Rwanda Tea Authority, which amounts to 58,240,000 m3 per year, provides an avoided cost of US$ 81,536,000 annually (Masozera, 2008). Flood prevention is also an important consideration for the tea industry. A 2007 flood affected 90 ha of tea estates, resulting in over US$ 500,000 in opportunity costs. However, avoided flood-related costs due to the presence of approximately 100,000 ha of forests in Nyungwe were nearly an estimated US$ 14,000,000 (Masozera, 2008). 29\ufffd The\ufffdaverage\ufffdinternational\ufffdvirtual\ufffdwater\ufffdcontent\ufffdof\ufffdblack\ufffdtea\ufffdis\ufffd10.4m3/kg.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "38e6ed66-5022-4ff7-b654-092abf710a71": {"__data__": {"id_": "38e6ed66-5022-4ff7-b654-092abf710a71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf9df594836094199222503e90812c9f0e967a62a5659d955026f16d04418924"}, "2": {"node_id": "0197e2de-bf38-4f85-ad21-8abef209e4ed", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e6b3fd76733d12ecdc411ff9fbab82972abd996657052e20ad1fe043f474761"}}, "hash": "1d1445856ca99c3b4669d9df1c4a7452b0b42ae99c8d5c9e3e44fc3d6ddb54d9", "text": "43 Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains 4.4 Emission reductions potential An overview of the emission reduction markets (carbon markets) is included in Section 6.7, which demonstrates that current markets are small and fragmented making investments that count solely on selling carbon credits, a difficult investment proposition.

However, according to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Rwanda GHG emission baseline projection, the country has slowly become a small contributor to global GHG emissions. The electricity matrix is mainly comprised of domestically produced thermal power (32%), domestic hydropower (36%) and imported hydropower (17.8%). The rest is a mixture of biogas, off-grid hydropower (including pico- and micro-), solar and thermal. According to the Designated National Authority (DNA) of Rwanda, the weighted emission grid factor is 0.65 tCO2e/ mWh (UNEP RISO, 2013), mainly due to the small generation capacity. As observed in Figures 6 and 7, the agricultural and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) sectors are determinants of Rwanda\u2019s GHG emissions balance, with agriculture being the largest net source of emissions and LULUCF traditionally an emissions sink. However, in 2010, LULUCF generated emissions. Within the agricultural sector, the uncertainty and lack of data are significant; however, most of the analyses available include information on fermentation and manure management, burning of savannah, burning of agricultural residues, cultivated soils, and flooding rice. It has been calculated in the Vision 2020 (Steibert, 2013) that population and GDP growth (projected at 6% average between 2010 and 2030 according to the World Bank) will trigger further demand for forest and woodlands by about 2.3% (see Figure 8). According to FAO, however, Rwanda experienced a forestation rate of around 2.4% per year between 2005 and 2010, but current and projected estimates of emissions in LULUCF indicate that this sector will be a net emitter over the seven years. Figure 6. Energy sources in Rwanda (Source: UNEP RISO, 2013) 44 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well Cookstoves and green charcoal There are currently four standalone registered Rwandan CDM projects: two solar energy projects and two household energy efficiency projects. Additionally, there are several programmes of activities (POAs) registered on energy efficiency for households: one at validation, one on energy efficiency of households, two on hybrid renewables and two on energy efficiency services (UNEP DTU, n.d.). POAs are an interesting option, and cookstoves comprise the majority of the CDM POAs pipeline, which makes sense when considering the dominance of fuelwood and firewood as sources of energy. Rwanda counts on bilateral assistance through Multilateral Figure 7. Historical emissions by sector (Source: Steibert, 2013) Figure 8. Forest and woodland net emissions (Steibert, 2013) 45 Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains Environment Agreements in Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries funded by the European Commission, which builds capacity to develop CDM projects and specific project activities. One cookstove project in Rwanda is being developed by Atmosfair Gmbh and is generating 60,771 tCO2 per year. It is commonly known as the SAVE80 cookstove, a state of the art technology for efficient stoves. These stoves are portable, made of stainless steel, developed a prefabricated by a German manufacturer and assembled locally by Energie Domestique Ltd to create employment. Fuelwood is the dominant energy source, especially in the domestic sector, causing forest degradation and GHG emissions. Some estimate domestic emissions contribute up to 18% of total national GHG emissions (UNEP RISO, 2013). An important opportunity exists for household energy efficiency interventions, such as ICS and other alternatives for cooking. There are some exiting government plans to install ICS in homes. By 2008, 50% of the households in the country had already been supplied with ICS. The government expects that fuelwood utilisation will go down to 40% of total energy consumption by 2020 through implementation of energy efficiency projects and fuel switching; mainly through the utilisation of biogas and briquettes produced using agricultural residues and animal waste. Consumption of charcoal (potential to reduce more than 37,000 tCO2/year) is major, having become the main source of fuel in urban areas and a significant source of income and degradation in rural areas. Efficiency in production of charcoal presents important emission reduction potential, as charcoal production releases methane. Projects can be implemented to reduce methane emissions during production and capture methane emissions from plants while generating additional energy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6389f86e-c136-4a95-9ffa-1efc1515708d": {"__data__": {"id_": "6389f86e-c136-4a95-9ffa-1efc1515708d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f553085a4edfd7c010b9771e46c512bbf29f92038f6a2be99a63dfa7cdb338f2"}, "2": {"node_id": "6d6488ae-70c5-4fdb-95b1-ffa91c13a13e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b738bdb290fa3efe0bc0ffb5f0004419a7436cc7be0ff40e27da8fab72df2b31"}}, "hash": "de0a8864a377b03f6c3870dc70731c29b708b58c658061b423818cb5b1629ba9", "text": "Additionally, charcoal could be sustainably sourced by allocating dedicated woodlots and replanting trees that would, at the same time, work as a natural sink for carbon emissions.

Moreover, the country was initially excluded from pilot projects under UN- REDD and the Forest Investment Programme, and deforestation has been significantly reduced in recent years.

The majority of the forest is humid natural forest (33%), while the rest is composed of eucalyptus plantations (26%) and degraded natural forest (15.7%) (UNEP RISO, 2013). The definition of forest in the country requires a minimum crown cover of 10%, minimum tree height of 3 m, and minimum forest area of 0.05 ha. The main opportunity for REDD+ is on the protection of parts of national parks and protected areas that still face some deforestation and degradation threats such as the VNP, Nyungwe and Gishwati forests. REMA and the DNA consider this potential to be low as they describe these areas to be well protected already (REMA, 2012). However, there is some significant pressure on national parks; as such, the total area of national parks has been reduced since 1960, largely due to conversion to agricultural land and settlements. The national green growth strategy (Government of Rwanda, 2011a), as one of the main priorities within its finance pillar, encourages conservation through payments for ecosystem services schemes that go beyond existing pilot projects in Gishwati and Nyungwe forests. This priority could include some REDD+ initiatives. It is worth highlighting that the relevance of REDD+ 46 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well in Rwanda in terms of co-benefits, mainly biodiversity co-benefits, could be significant, as Rwanda is located in the western arm of Africa\u2019s Rift Valley. This valley is considered to have the highest species richness in Africa, with around 40% of the continent\u2019s mammal species. This includes 30% of the global population of mountain gorilla, listed by IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\u2122 as Endangered, more than 700 bird species, around 300 reptiles and amphibians, and almost 6,000 higher plants (REMA, 2013). Rwanda has seven identified KBAs that cover almost 3,000 km2, include about 56 Mt of carbon (18 Mt of biomass and 38 Mt of soil carbon), and comprise almost 90% of the high carbon area (UNEP WCMC, n.d.). Around 2% of the land that is relevant for carbon and biodiversity is not included in protected areas, and represents a good opportunity to structure REDD+ projects with significant biodiversity co-benefits. Some of the major co-benefits and ecosystem services are: economic and livelihood support, including food security; and poverty alleviation (the value of ecosystem services provided by Nyungwe Forest alone has been calculated at US$ 285 million a year) (REMA, 2013); ecotourism (from under US$ 5 million in 2002 to US$ 33 million in 2006); and research and medicine. Main threats to biodiversity are the same as those to forests: population pressure, land scarcity, conversion of natural habitats, mining, agriculture and introduction of non-native species. According to the Carbon Market and Forestry Assessment elaborated by REMA and the DNA, the work on REDD+ at the project level has been limited so far. The approach in Rwanda is to integrate the local communities into the sustainable management of forest resources and to link the protection of the natural forests to the reduction of the poverty of the waterside populations (REMA, 2010). The Carbon Market and Forestry Assessment also cites two project idea notes that are under process of approval by the Congo Basin Forest Fund (CBFF). One has been proposed by the National Forest Authority (NAFA), aimed at: increasing forest and tree cover in state and district forests, both in remnant natural and plantation areas as well as on private lands; conducting forest carbon assessments and the application of a monitoring system; and improving the livelihoods of forest-dependent communities. The second, proposed by the Woods Hole Research Center, aims to \u201cdevelop human capacity in forest policy and management using novel applied research as a vehicle for regional training and capacity building in advanced economic, social and remote sensing methods\u201d in four basin countries including Rwanda (REMA, 2010). The country has not yet developed a comprehensive REDD+ strategy and some work remains to be done on elaborating a newer national forest inventory and the inclusion of carbon biomass estimates.

The agencies leading these negotiations with the developers will include RDB, REMA, NAFA and the National Land Centre (REMA, 2010). Afforestation, reforestation and revegetation Rwanda\u2019s Vision 2020 seeks to increase forest cover from 17% to 30% by 2020. As such, great efforts need to be made in order to reach this goal. This represents an important opportunity to implement afforestation, reforestation and revegetation (ARR) projects with the additional benefit of reducing emissions. It has been estimated that there is the potential to reduce more than 109,700,000 tCO2/year via the ARR methodologies under the CDM, Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions and voluntary schemes. Although the government has engaged in tree planting, there is still room for improvement and financing is still an issue, which make a case for the additionality of potential projects. The main obstacle for ARR projects is the lack of demand in the carbon market, as ARR projects are not accepted for compliance within the EU Emissions Trading System. The CDM process for this particular type of project is complex, and the certified emission reductions (CERs) awarded to them are only temporary as a way to address non- permanence risk. Currently, there are no ARR CDM projects in the country, and the opportunity and potential remain significant. According to the emissions profile elaborated by UNEP RISO (2013), increasing forest coverage from 17% to 30% could translate into more than 100 million tonnes emission reductions per year. As for REDD+, for ARR projects to be successful, there needs to be more clarity and simplicity regarding carbon credit ownership and revenue sharing, stronger institutional arrangements that increase transparency, and a demonstration of additionality. Agricultural land management As previously mentioned, most of the Rwandan population participates in agriculture (almost 90%), as such, along with energy it is the largest source of GHGs. Emissions from agriculture come mainly from soil cultivation (N2O), enteric fermentation (CH4), and land-use change due to expansion of crops for food and biofuels, and pasturelands (UNEP RISO, 2013). Under Vision 2020, the government expects to move towards a comprehensive approach that includes productive market-based agriculture compatible with the protection of the environment and resource management. This plan acknowledges the importance of the sector for the country\u2019s welfare and the economy; however, it has also raised concerns over increased CO2 emissions due to extensification and use of fertilisers. Furthermore, Rwanda faces a problem of agricultural land scarcity and deteriorated land fertility due to demographic pressure. Extensification will require improved nutrient management, low impact farming practices, improvement of soil carbon retention, and reduction of CH4 emissions from the livestock sector. There are important opportunities in climate-smart agriculture as promoted by the World Bank and FAO, sustainable extensification (e.g. agroforestry), and sustainable agricultural land management. 4.5 Role and value of standards and certifications for value chain activities Standards and certifications play a significant role in promoting more sustainable land-use practices and encouraging greater quality in the agricultural value chain; and for emission reductions for woodlots, charcoal production, ICS and other land-use related mitigation activities. For example, under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol, AFF, and ICS projects, may be eligible through applying approved methodologies to receive carbon credits 48 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well called CERs that can be sold to industrialized countries to meet emission reduction limitation targets.

The VCS, combined with the Climate, Communities and Biodiversity Standards (CCB Standards), which certifies land management projects that deliver net positive benefits for local communities and for biodiversity in addition to climate change mitigation, is currently the most credible standard available in the voluntary market. In Rwanda, there are currently a number of voluntary market forestry projects planned. This includes: two projects in the Gishwati Forest, two projects in the Eastern Province, a project in the VNP and a project in the Nyungwe National Park. Currently, there are no records of Rwandan projects validated by the VCS, a preeminent standard for REDD+ projects. The DNA Secretariat, which coordinates carbon market projects, is based within the REMA and supports the required approvals under the CDM. REMA maintains CDM project approval procedures and a technical committee is nominated to review each project (REMA, 2010). REMA is currently working on voluntary market project approval procedures to ensure that all voluntary market projects in Rwanda contribute to sustainable development and apply an established voluntary carbon standard, such as the VCS and CCB Standards. These procedures would apply to all voluntary forest carbon projects in Rwanda, including REDD+. The projects will be assessed by forestry related technical committees with the final letter of approval signed by the Director General of REMA (REMA, 2010). In addition to standards that certify emission reductions, there are a number of standards that could be used to demonstrate sustainable and value-added forest product or agricultural supply chains. For national-level standards, the Rwanda Bureau of Standards (RBS) is a public institution that undertakes all activities pertaining to the development of standards, quality assurance and metrology in the country. It is the only body that has the power to define national standards. Public and private firms must present their standards to RBS for adoption at the national level. While the RBS has been focused on ensuring safety in the food value chain, other standards and certifications are taking shape. For example, systems and structures are underway that will see RBS mainstreamed as a key player in the honey value chain, positioning RBS to vet, certify and standardize honey, including that intended for export. RBS has outlined the desired properties by which honey producers, refiners and exporters will have to adhere to acquire certification (SNV, 2009). There are a whole host of international and some regional standards that apply to forestry and agricultural supply chains and value-added products. The EAC developed the East African Organic Products Standard which Rwanda has adopted through joining the EAC. This organic standard covers plant production, animal husbandry, and beekeeping, the collection of wild products, and the processing and labelling of the products (ITC, 2007). Other standards specific to sustainable forest management include those under the Forest Stewardship Council and the Canadian Standards Association. Some of the barriers and potential solutions to increased adoption of organic standards are summarized in Table 10. As mentioned earlier, there is also a significant 49 Identifying investment potential in FLR value chains opportunity to improve quality within the charcoal and cookstove value chains through the introduction of standards. For example, there is no standard on the quality of charcoal being produced and sold, and there is no standard on the weight of charcoal bags. Further, there is no standard for ICS, which often results in poor quality stoves and hampers consumer trust in ICS. While there are currently no plans for the RBS to introduce such standards, there is an ICS standard being developed by Practical Action, a non- governmental organisation contracted under MININFRA. Barrier Solution High costs of certification Bundled certification through farmers\u2019 cooperatives and farmers\u2019 groups that have helped reduce the certification costs. Proliferation of standards Larges organic markets, such as the European Union, the United States and Japan, vary in acceptable standards; thus producers must be knowledgeable about their target to adopt certification standards relevant to that market. Technical hurdles Organic agricultural production and processing require knowledge and equipment (particularly for processing); thus investments must be made to ensure successful production and certification.

Public funds and risk mitigation instruments for Rwanda FLR Although there is ample evidence of increasing investment in developing country agriculture and forestry, it is difficult to quantify the exact amount of investment due to the lack of reliable data.

Public funds are grants that are concessional in nature, meaning that they do not require repayment or have non-market terms for returns and repayment. These sources of funds include Rwanda\u2019s government budget, official development assistance (ODA), and private donors. These sources are very important, as in many cases they must be leveraged to create commercially viable investment opportunities. One challenge in typifying these funding sources is that grant and concessional funds providers often refer to them as \u201cinvestments,\u201d though these are not the same as private investments, which require repayment of principal and generation of risk-adjusted investment return. While these public sources are presented separately in this section, creating investment grade opportunities that support smallholder FLR will require innovative combinations of SECTION HIGHLIGHTS In most cases, Rwanda\u2019s FLR activities will only become commercially viable with initial, and possibly on-going, public funding that is concessional in nature. This section reviews the sources of domestic, multilateral and bilateral ODA funds in Rwanda, which could support making FLR activities commercially viable and should be directly leveraged. It also provides details on return- motivated public funds from DFIs that have made direct FLR related investments, or indirect investment into private funds that could support FLR. The Government of Rwanda has succeeded in spending more than 10% of its national budget on agricultural development. However, there is still a large financing gap of as much as ten times the annual national budget that is needed to meet its estimated agricultural spending to implement its policy objectives. Moreover, this allocation is broadly applied to agriculture and does not specifically focus on FLR. Recently, ODA funding has grown; a third of which is allocated to agriculture. Some of these programmes could potentially be oriented towards attracting matching private investment funds. DFIs have provided a limited amount of grant funding and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) have provided political risk and weather insurance products for private investors. If scale can be developed to create investment packages of at least US$ 10 million, DFIs could be a valuable source of funding for FLR. 51 Public funds and risk mitigation instruments for Rwanda FLR these sources to attract private investment at any scale. Rwanda\u2019s government budget Rwanda\u2019s main source of government funds come from taxes, budgetary/capital grants, and loans, with a total estimated annual budget of US$ 2.4 billion in 2013/2014. Rwanda\u2019s debut US$ 400 million, 10-year Eurobond was issued in May 2013, and was eight times oversubscribed. It fetched one of the best yields for countries of the same category, at 6.875%. Bond issuance can provide new sources of upfront funds for investment in infrastructure and income producing activities, potentially including FLR. The Government of Rwanda has surpassed the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme requirement for investing more than 10% of the national budget in agriculture, and estimates a 45% growth in spending per annum in the next three years (MINAGRI, 2012). The government committed in 2013/2014 to spend RwF 52.4 billion (approximately US$ 80 million) to support the agricultural sector by: multiplying and improving distribution of seeds, breeds and fertilizers, promoting irrigation schemes, protection of soil erosion, as well as facilitating commercialised agriculture and the creation of farmers\u2019 cooperatives (MINECOFIN, 2014). However, the government estimated that in agriculture specifically, there was a financing gap of US$ 324 million (MINAGRI, 2012) for the three-year period from 2009-2012 that was needed to fund their key programmes (see Table 11). In the forestry sector in 2012/2013, there was RwF 16 billion (US$ 23.5 million) (MINECOFIN, 2013a) spent by the government in forestry, including land registration, plantation of forests, and protection of river and lake borders. Official development assistance to Rwanda Total ODA aid to Rwanda in 2011/2012 grew to US$ 1.19 billion (MINECOFIN, 2013b), a 22% growth over 2010/2011.

Agricultural funding gap in Rwanda 52 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well in grants versus loans, and the agricultural sector received the third largest allocation (US$ 133 million) compared to other sectors (see Figure 9). The majority of agricultural support came from the US (US$ 50 million), African Development Bank (AfDB) (US$ 32 million) and the World Bank (US$ 26 million). Most of the ODA estimates do not include funds provided by development finance institutions (DFIs), which represents an additional source of funds that can be leveraged (see Section 5.2). An important role of ODA helping to attract private investment is project risk mitigation. Often the long development phase and high upfront costs make FLR projects un-investable. In addition, emission reduction projects are particularly lengthy in their development phase as they need to go through many steps: a national process of approval; a process of validation by third parties; registration with the CDM executive board or other certification body; verifications by a third party; issuance by the CDM executive board in the case of the CDM; validation with one standard or more; plus periodic verifications by third parties and credit issuance in the case of voluntary projects. These emission reduction projects also require stakeholder consultations and free, prior and informed consent (FPIC), as well as data gathering and payments before the income from credits starts to flow. All these processes are lengthy and can be expensive, and do not guarantee successful implementation. In the case of pure agricultural projects, the process also usually involves capacity building and investment in infrastructure that needs to be made upfront, but generating adequate yields can take five or more years for most crops. Concessional public and private funds can implement cost-sharing mechanisms, whereby Figure 9. ODA to Rwanda in financial year 2011/12 by sector (MINECOFIN, 2013b) 53 Public funds and risk mitigation instruments for Rwanda FLR all or some of the project development and/ or upfront costs can be covered with public funds. Sharing initial capital expenditures, the risk to the investor at the most uncertain stage is mitigated, and the investment into implementation is incentivised. Furthermore, governments can simplify and expedite processes such as approvals and licensing so that starting a project is not as lengthy and expensive for the investor. Multilaterals and bilaterals The following section provides an overview of the key publically funded projects that could provide strong leverage possibilities for private investment. World Bank The World Bank has a project called the Third Rural Sector Support Project, which runs from February 2012 to October 2017, for US$ 85,000,000, and is structured as a highly concessional form of credit. The objectives of the project are to: (i) Increase the agricultural productivity of organized farmers in the marshlands and hillsides of sub-watersheds targeted for development in an environmentally sustainable manner, and (ii) strengthen the participation of both male and female beneficiaries in market-based value chains (World Bank, 2012b). The target beneficiaries are 100,000 people and include extension approaches to support intensification of rain-fed hillside production, including the establishment of fruit tree nurseries and adapted fruit tree management techniques (grafting, pruning, root pruning, fertilisation). While not all aspects of this programme will promote increasing the number of trees on the landscape, Sub-component 1.2: Sustainable Land Management on the Hillsides, with a budget of US$ 18.6 million, supports: (i) grass strips, contour bunding and improved terracing, (ii) pasture improvement through trees and grass planting, (iii) dam and canal buffer zone protection, and (iv) afforestation of critical hillside ecosystems unsuitable for intensive agriculture and animal production. Public investments under this component will be high, at US$ 7,000/hectare. Under Sub-component 1.3, an investment of US$ 5 million will be made to improve value chains, which could help to support businesses and cooperatives in becoming bankable. These activities include collection centres, storage facilities, input facilities (seeds, organic and inorganic fertilizers), processing, agribusiness centres, including half-bulk markets, drying areas, and storage facilities. The investments made under this component will be driven by community demand and directly linked to the establishment of a business plan developed by cooperatives.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "114c10b1-299c-4b9e-a38e-d714e78834e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "114c10b1-299c-4b9e-a38e-d714e78834e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c3f020f26df40adb351c7b1030fe70d1348de8d9723e0b063ca019e68a52a58"}, "2": {"node_id": "36dcf824-4430-4a59-bc2e-d2b41d51aa88", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d525e98a45c478c7088511d1df9d3bbb089ee7b1819e631dc29ea3de3492891"}}, "hash": "29b4180b461ed376bf42865ab8d5280c7c4f78ce3c9a488081e3cf941959342f", "text": "Contributions from the community are also required; either in-kind or through linkages with rural finance.

IUCN will leverage additional funding from other bilateral and private sector organisations, given their active and diverse network of donors in the region estimated at US$ 2.33 million. The objectives of the Landscape Approach to Forest Restoration and Conservation Programme are well suited to support FLR, particularly under Component 2, which includes two key activities that will promote the improvement or restoration 54 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well of natural forests: (i) establishing biological corridors; and (ii) community-based sustainable forest management systems established for at least 5,000 hectares. USAID USAID leads the US Government\u2019s Feed the Future initiative (FTF), which grew out of the 2009 G8 Summit where US President Obama called on global leaders to reverse the decline in investment in agriculture and strengthen global efforts to reduce poverty, hunger and under- nutrition. The US pledged US$ 3.5 billion to this effort over three years, and helped to leverage an additional US$ 18.5 billion in support from G8 members and other donors. In response to the food security challenges in Rwanda, as well as the Government of Rwanda\u2019s demonstrated commitment to strengthening the agricultural sector, the FTF began working in Rwanda in 2010. The programme is working throughout the country to achieve the following impacts: \u2022 Assist more than 700,000 vulnerable Rwandan women, children and family members \u2013 mostly smallholder farmers \u2013 in escaping hunger and poverty; \u2022 Reach nearly 190,000 children to improve their nutrition to prevent stunting and child mortality; and \u2022 Reach significant numbers of additional rural populations to achieve improved income and nutritional status from strategic policy engagement and institutional investments. To achieve these goals, core investments are being made in: driving systems transformation in targeted staple and high-value crop value chains by developing sustainable market linkages and undertaking complementary infrastructure and nutrition investments; delivering innovations to enable sustainable agricultural growth and improved nutrition; and advocating for improved food security policy. All FTF investments are aligned with the Government of Rwanda\u2019s PSTA-II, Agriculture Sector Investment Plan, and National Multi- sectoral Strategy to Eliminate Malnutrition in Rwanda (FTF, 2011). Currently, there is an anticipated FTF project in Rwanda called the Private Sector Driven Agricultural Growth Project that is expected to increase smallholder incomes by promoting private sector investment internationally and domestically that contributes to the objectives of Vision 2020. The objectives of the project are to: (i) assist the Government of Rwanda in increasing private sector investment, and (ii) facilitate increased private sector investment in upgrading agricultural value chains (USAID, 2013). DFID The Department for International Development (DFID), the international development agency of the United Kingdom, has provided significant bilateral support to Rwanda in terms of funding and technical expertise to increase investment and invigorate the private sector, improve access to health and education, increase the accountability of the state, and address potential causes of conflict and fragility. DFID\u2019s Rwanda Operational Plan 2011-2015 (DFID, 2013) indicates most of DFID\u2019s support has been delivered through the Government of Rwanda. However, DFID\u2019s approach over the past four years has shifted from almost exclusively supporting the government to increased support to private sector and civil society, including increased engagement of the private sector to promote economic development, regional trade and integration (DFID, 2013). The projected DFID support for 2014/2015 is estimated to be nearly US$ 100 million, of which approximately 30% is for agriculture (Stone, et al., 2011). In 2011 DFID and MINAGRI commissioned Oxford Policy Management to develop an effective Rural and Agricultural Financial Services Strategy aimed at improving access to and use of financial services in rural areas in Rwanda (Stone, et al., 2011). The report 55 Public funds and risk mitigation instruments for Rwanda FLR focuses heavily on the challenges faced by the agriculture sector, particularly relating to financial services \u2013 bottlenecks in the financial sector that cause these challenges, and the strategy options for overcoming bottlenecks. The main strategic options proposed include linking banking and other product innovations, collateral management and warehouse receipts, dealing with information gaps, remote access banking, and longer-term finance. The proposed strategy includes an implementation framework. In addition to the support provided by DFID, the United Nations and US Government have jointly supported a programme called Building Inclusive Financial Sector in Rwanda (BIFSIR), a programme set within the strategic framework of the National Microfinance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0d911829-2bb9-40e8-9abb-77b3ca9ce1cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "0d911829-2bb9-40e8-9abb-77b3ca9ce1cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "266d4e42a3fec9b96ea61483fb7abaf185138dd3ee481148b846122536b0645f"}, "3": {"node_id": "28484655-0f40-4f66-897e-921e60f891fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47a5b0ec938efbcde82a8ab57dcc74abc17dd49c1d1073b05911e4666a618918"}}, "hash": "0d118eec1e168eeab65cc30adea338b6a1272246b98af35d22ee742f226b08a1", "text": "Strategy that aims to contribute to poverty reduction and achievement of the MDGs. The main objective of the programme is to contribute to building capacity of the various stakeholders at the macro-, meso- and micro-levels to support the development of sustainable, quality, and diversified services accessible by less advantaged Rwandans. In 2011, the BIFSIR programme was expanded with an additional US$ 2,239,758 from the Korea MDG Trust Fund, which would increase BIFSIR\u2019s programming reach to the client level and contribute further results. In total, the programme now has a budget of US$ 7,099,258 over five years (2010-2014), with joint funding from the United Nations Development Fund (US$ 2,000,000), United Nations Capital Development Fund (US$ 2,400,000), One UN Fund (US$ 459,500), and the Korea MDG Trust Fund (US$ 2,239,758). The additional funding increases BIFSIR\u2019s scope; as such, the programme has been renamed the BIFSIR Expansion. This increased scope provides entrepreneurial capacity building, financial education, and financial linkages to target groups (e.g. women and youth), including vocational training for graduates (MINECOFIN, 2013c). Others The Belgian and Dutch-backed SEW project produced nearly a million seedlings for woodlots and agroforestry, with an additional 2,000 ha of agroforestry sites created during the period from 2009-2013. In 2010, SEW prepared 2,967,100 seedlings for woodlot trees in Rwanda, and established 4,000 ha of woodlots during a three- year period. Private donors The Gates and Rockefeller foundations are two notable private donors for Rwandan agriculture. In 2011, the Rockefeller Foundation provided US$ 288,600 in support of a project with the Rwanda Meteorological Service and the Walker Institute of the University of Reading to improve the climate risk modelling capacity of Rwandan agricultural scientists, produce a national climate change risk map, and evaluate adaptation strategies that could improve the resilience of smallholder farmers in Rwanda to climate change (Rockefeller Foundation, 2011). While the specific size of grants may not compare to ODA, private donors have flexibility and could prove valuable in catalysing further private sector investment through the support of innovative financial structures. 5.2 Public return-motivated sources of funds for FLR DFIs are supported by public money, and their missions lie in servicing the investment shortfalls of developing countries and bridging the gap between commercial investment and state development aid (Dickinson, n.d.). However, a majority of the funds provided by DFIs are structured to resemble private investments, and are expected to repay principal and generate a return. The large DFIs include: IFC, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, OPIC, Government Employees Pension Fund, and the European Development Financial Institutions (EDFI). 56 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well EDFI is a group of 15 bilateral investment organizations, including BIO and BMI-SBI (Belgium), the CDC (United Kingdom), COFIDES (Spain), DEG (Germany), Finnfund (Finland), FMO (Netherlands), IFU (Denmark), Norfund (Norway), OeEB (Austria), Proparco (France) and SIFEM (Switzerland), SIMEST (Italy), SOFID (Portugal), and Swedfund (Sweden). DFIs offer an array of financing and risk reduction instruments, including debt/loans (senior and subordinated), equity (direct investments through pooled funds), debt/loan guarantees, and political risk insurance. Some provide limited technical assistance grants on a concessional basis. As DFIs operate much like institutional private investors, they expect that projects will be fully commercialized, and a large proportion of funds are allocated for larger infrastructure projects. Given their development- oriented mission, they play a key role in agricultural and forestry investing \u2013 European DFIs, as a group, invest 7% in agribusiness (King & Wood Mallesons, 2013). In Africa, they have also been instrumental in supporting the growth of African private equity funds, and have accounted for nearly half of the investment capital in private equity funds investing in sub- Saharan Africa (IFC, 2011).

At the time of writing, it has one insurance contract but no loans to Rwanda. Other DFIs IFC provided a grant to MicroEnsure, its microinsurance arm, in November 2010 to incentivize MicroEnsure to: (i) design new and affordable index-based insurance products, (ii) develop an effective distribution network that expands outreach to low income farmers, and (iii) scale-up agricultural index insurance to cover 24,000 farmers by the end of December 2013. IFC also has vehicles to support investments in SMEs, and provides guidance on the criteria for and importance of investing in biodiversity and high conservation value areas. Political risk insurance Political risk insurance can cover a number of risks in two broad categories: expropriation and political violence. Expropriation covers any action a national government undertakes that deprives a project or investor of their fundamental rights. For OPIC, traditional expropriation coverage protects against nationalisation, confiscation, and creeping expropriations, which result in a loss of the total investment. They also include government interference in a project in other forms, including: \u2022 Abrogation, repudiation, and/or impairment of contract, including forced renegotiation of contract terms; \u2022 Imposition of confiscatory taxes; \u2022 Confiscation of funds and/or tangible assets; and \u2022 Outright nationalization of a project. 57 Public funds and risk mitigation instruments for Rwanda FLR Political risk insurance can be used to protect investors in FLR activities that involve agroforestry, forestry and emission reductions. For example, OPIC underwrote US$ 1.9 million in insurance on a tea importer in 2012 (OPIC, 2012), and US$ 19.4 million to insure the Rwanda Trading Company, a subsidiary of Little Rock, Arkansas\u2019 Westrock Coffee Holdings LLC, to support its investment in modernising a coffee milling and processing plant in Kigali (OPIC, n.d.). The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency has also provided political risk insurance and has insured a renewable energy project in Rwanda. 58 6. Potential private funding sources for Rwanda FLR There is great importance in properly aligning financing sources with the appropriate producer value chain investment opportunities (DGDA, 2011). Table 12 matches the scale of FLR enterprises with the typical use of funds, funding sources, and funding amount. 6.1 Local communities Smallholder farmers remain, by far, the largest investors in agriculture, and must remain central to any strategy for increasing investment in this sector (OECD, 2013). Their investments are crucial to enhance capital accumulation, labour productivity and farm incomes, thereby reducing rural poverty. It is imperative that communities are part of the financing chain that promotes larger private investments in FLR. Without having \u2018skin in the game,\u2019 there is a disconnect between the farmers\u2019 outcomes and the investors\u2019 outcomes. Farmers make individual investments by providing labour, but they are also formal investors through accessing microfinance credit facilities. Farmers organising SECTION HIGHLIGHTS IUCN and WRI, working with the Government of Rwanda, have developed a set of targeted FLR interventions that work within the mosaic of different forest land uses, including: agriculture, agroforestry, plantations, and natural forests. This section reviews Rwanda\u2019s Bonn Challenge commitment of planting two million trees and the specific land-use transitions that are recommended by IUCN and WRI in the Restoration Opportunity Assessment for Rwanda. For each of the four recommended land-use transitions, the potential FLR value chain activities that could attract private investments have been identified. Promoting the transition from traditional agriculture to agroforestry will require smallholder farmers to adopt crops grown in integrated agroforestry systems. For these productive systems to be investable, they will need to combine fast growing crops that can produce high value exports. There are numerous companies in Rwanda that can be leveraged to promote commercially viable agroforestry practices with farmers. Promoting the improved management of woodlots and plantations can be addressed through enhanced silviculture practices for woodlots, as well as reducing the demand for wood through fuel-efficient stoves and green charcoal. Investment opportunities in this area, however, may be limited unless they target larger wood/charcoal producers.

Scale of FLR enterprises and funding sources themselves around agricultural production- related activities may join cooperatives or multipurpose associations, which allow them access to credit facilities. Sustainability of cooperatives largely depends on the income- generating capacity of production, access to value chains, and management capacity of the cooperatives (Wennink & Heemskerk, 2006). In Rwanda, cooperatives have grown significantly over the last 20 years, and it is estimated that there are well over 5,000 now registered. The largest of these cooperatives represents as many as 2,000 farmers, like the Abikudakawa Coffee Farm in Northern Rwanda. The investments made by smallholder agricultural cooperative members and the benefits that cooperatives can bring to private investors make them a critical part of the solution to Rwanda attracting private investments. A key component of FLR investments should include promoting farmers\u2019 investments by providing technical assistance and/or extension services to farmers, which make them more \u2018bankable\u2019 by supporting higher yields and/or incomes from value-added crops. Smallholder investment is typically in-kind. Providing inputs is often the role of an aggregator, who also purchases from cooperatives or individual farmers using off-take agreements (formal or informal), that in turn secure smallholder loans. These aggregators become entrenched in the local community, and farmers will sell their produce to them, usually because the aggregator has provided credit, inputs, and/ or advice (IFC, 2012). There must be a strong relationship built between the producers and the aggregator to ensure that \u2018side selling\u2019 does not occur. Additionally, farmer investments must also be supported by a functioning and effective supply chain to ensure that products can be processed, transported and sold effectively, delivering value to both producers and aggregators. 6.2 Domestic financial institutions Commercial banks Domestic banks can play a key role in financing FLR by providing loans to finance activities along the value chain. However, based on reports from 13 banks (BCR, BK, ECOBANK RWANDA, FINA BANK, ACCESS BANK, COGEBANQUE, KCB, BPR, EQUITY, 60 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well AGASEKE, UNGUKA, URWEGO and BRD), as of June 2013, only 3% of the loan portfolio was provided to the agricultural, fisheries and livestock sector (BNR, 2013). Banks and microfinance institutions (MFIs) focus on lending to individuals, but these loan providers seem to have concluded that a group guarantee is insufficient compensation for the extra administrative cost of dealing with a group, especially in the set-up phase (Stone, et al, 2011). Banks are reluctant to lend to smallholder agriculture and livestock producers. However, the Banque Populaire du Rwanda has a loan programme to finance any type of agricultural activity, including production, processing, distribution, purchase of farm inputs, tools, machines, agro-processing, livestock farming, and other farm-related expenses (BPR, n.d.). These loans are made under the Rural Investment Facility and have up to five- year terms and flexible collateral requirements, including for those farmers/projects qualifying for a special guaranteed fund; they may not even need to provide any collateral. For small and medium-size farmers, mobile banking can serve as a viable link between rural areas and formal banking services (IFC, 2012). They also support MFIs, which at times have large deposits but are unable to access banks to place these deposits, thus exposing them to high risk and theft. Most main commercial banks in Rwanda offer mobile banking, an initiative aimed at reaching underserved clients, particularly in the rural areas where mobile penetration rates are relatively higher when compared to those of formal financial institutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6fd20335-12b3-4c0d-af7a-35de88765129": {"__data__": {"id_": "6fd20335-12b3-4c0d-af7a-35de88765129", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "da30bc7970d9b19347350ea2b2fb72e969e7a78fa18f9eec58f69ba469982dff"}, "2": {"node_id": "64a0981c-c5e5-43c3-845b-51c6e13a6599", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0b2108b59cd3b0599f11cf17c3edabe9dcb61c28173b1f65d2ae676ecccef9ac"}}, "hash": "dda87cdc516021a82cda7cea7d44e822ac0c33a86c987e16a29fd5f2a6bdf1d6", "text": "Microfinance Microfinance will play a key role in Rwanda for promoting FLR due to the very nature of smallholders and the need to invest in new growing practices.

Due to the high density of microfinance providers, it is estimated that 90% of the Rwandan population lives within five kilometres of a microfinance outlet (MINECOFIN, 2013d). The small, rurally focused MFIs will play a key role in both providing investment capital to smallholders and serving as aggregation vehicles for larger investments. Table 13 provides details of the larger microfinance providers in Rwanda (MF Transparency, 2011). Some MFIs in Rwanda have a track record for smallholder agricultural lending to support cash crop production, including Opportunity International, which is one of the largest MFIs in the world. Opportunity International has started agricultural lending under the \u201cInformed Lending\u201d Production Finance Model. \u201cInformed lending\u201d is a parametric lending model anchored on: (i) the exact mapping of the borrower farm\u2019s plots (plot sizes, altitude, access to water); (ii) a diagnostic of the borrower\u2019s household profile (demographics of the family, breakdown of all farm enterprises such as crops/land used, other sources of income/activity, access to water/roads/banks, mobile phone use); and (iii) the crop profile, including costs of inputs and labour, and returns based on yield and price data. Opportunity International seeks to secure loan recovery by concentrating on cash crops with regulated output, reducing the risk of side- selling through advanced cash provision to farmers during the lean season, when farmers are most likely to succumb to the temptation of side-selling (IFC, 2012). 6.3 Impact funds Impact investment funds could be an important source of funding for smallholder-driven FLR, as they prioritize improved livelihoods as part of their investment mandate. Getting information on the impact funds that are (or will) invest in Rwanda\u2019s FLR will require a thorough review of an emerging but fragmented sector of impact investors. The Global Impact Investment Network provides a valuable source of information on impact investments through its Impact Database, which is available to subscribers and lists impact funds and their areas of investment. Impact funds make investments in companies, organisations, and funds with the intention of generating measurable social and environmental impacts alongside a financial return. Impact investment usually brings together a diversified group of actors: supply side (private foundations, impact investment funds, financial institutions, etc.); demand side (charities, social enterprises, cooperatives, etc.); and enabling actors (governments, standard setting bodies, NGOs, consultants, etc.). The suppliers of funds are often high net-worth individuals, family offices, foundations and endowments. Some impact funds use microfinance-type loans that are offered to producers and SMEs and are secured by future purchases of value-added crops. That is the case of Root Capital; in eight years, they have provided nearly US$ 2 million to a coffee cooperative in the northern highlands of Rwanda called Musasa, which represents over 2,000 smallholders farmers, 80% of whom are women. The cooperative was able to attract premium prices for their coffee, and used the increased profits to purchase mini coffee processing-stations and a vehicle to transport beans to a central facility. Other impact funds use convertible and mezzanine debt investments in local companies, as evidenced by the Acumen impact investing firm\u2019s US$ 1.2 million convertible debt investment to KZ Noir that sources smallholder coffee. Impact investments in coffee are most common because it is a high-value cash crop. In some cases, these investments will include promotion of FLR, and could be targeted to prioritise shade-based growing systems. 62 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well Equity investments are also made by impact funds, where they gain some form of ownership in the business or land being financed. 6.4 Private equity investors Private equity funds are generally sector and/ or regionally focused. Their fund structures vary, but are structured with long tenures (8-12 years) and make investments using a myriad of financing structures. These funds are often referred to as \u2018private equity,\u2019 but they include funds that invest through: (i) equity, (ii) debt, (iii) debt and equity, (iv) microfinance (at wholesale level), (v) the provision of guarantees, and (vi) other financial structures.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3cdb807-4683-487e-91c8-9ab2f42ac160": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3cdb807-4683-487e-91c8-9ab2f42ac160", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aca10c8909beb42880fb8b829c9ed91a14edbef83632c3c80bcc43f4f3e164cb"}, "2": {"node_id": "a0d04711-e5f4-4557-be95-1453b83d8d05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "108b791e22bb37fb430d23d129951ed4d8d75c440048352d0ab9b7ce7d1075ce"}}, "hash": "f40b206963c647fba2e50dbb2f2f972bde6f057a0062bc3d4a50df86a572cd85", "text": "It is estimated that globally in developing countries, private equity funds targeting agricultural investments have a capital base of about US$ 3.7 billion (FAO, 2010).

This process will take time, and will require that high quality FLR opportunities are presented and that a compelling proposal can be made for why these investments should be supported over other opportunities. There is evidence that investments will be made in smallholder agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. One investor, active in Africa, highlighted the fact that his group was able to invest in downstream entities that provide off-take agreements to local farmers, who previously were limited to selling their products in the cash market to local buyers. The scale and reach of this downstream entity helped to jump-start the integration of local communities into the wider market economy. While private equity funds are return motivated, most recognize the importance of strong and lasting relationships with local populations and local governments. The New Forest Company, a UK-based sustainable and socially responsible forestry company, announced its first sustainable forestry operations in Rwanda in April 2013. Under the concession and lease agreement signed with the government, the company will have access to over 10,000 ha of mature planted timber, and about three million tonnes of mature wood. This provides the right to harvest pine, cypress, eucalyptus, and acacia planted as a buffer zone around the Nyungwe National Forest in the southwest of the country (Hanna, 2013). This type of investment requires true sustainable management to protect the remaining natural forests in key protected areas. A full list of potential private equity investors is included in Annex A. 6.5 Private company sourcing of sustainable agricultural products With a lack of clear regulatory and market signals for GHG emission reductions, the motivation of the private sector to purchase offsets is quite low. However, numerous private companies are now recognising that sustainable sourcing of agricultural products is critical to their business\u2019 success. In some cases there may be a link to measured emission reductions, but most companies that are prioritising building sustainable supply chains are doing so for one or more of the following reasons: (i) increased revenue opportunities, (ii) reduction in costs, (iii) brand building, and (iv) risk reduction. Some corporations trying to green their supply chains or make them resilient to climate change have expressed interest in participating in projects that reduce emissions and use carbon as a measure, but that are in line with their corporate objectives. In this way, carbon becomes a 63 Potential private funding sources for Rwanda FLR secondary aspect and a way to measure results, but not the primary goal of the project. A major effort in building global support for sustainable supply chains is called the Tropical Forest Alliance 2020. It is led by USAID, which brings together governments and the Consumer Goods Forum (more than 400 companies with sales of over US$ 3 trillion a year) to invest and work together to improve management and planning of forest conservation, agricultural land use and land tenure, share best practices, work with smallholder farmers and producers on sustainable agricultural intensification, use degraded lands, and reforest. The rationale behind this initiative is compelling for the private sector and for governments that see a complementarity that allows for conservation to happen while still allowing for economic development to take place. This effort is primarily focused on the four major commodities that are leading deforestation globally: palm, cattle, soy, and pulp and paper. However, a number of the private companies that are committed to the sourcing of sustainable agricultural products (i.e. sustainable land use, smallholder livelihood improvement and organic), could have interest in Rwanda\u2019s exports, and this market should be explored. 6.6 Capital markets The Rwanda Stock Exchange started its operations in January 2011. Although it operates in close association with the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, and the Uganda Securities Exchange, the level of operations in Rwanda is still very small (Stone, et al., 2011). This limits investors\u2019 ability to raise money through the issuance of equity, which is instrumental for funding agriculture expansion and new ventures. Outside the domestic capital markets, interesting debt mechanisms that could be explored for Rwanda are Impact Bonds, Green Bonds or Social Bonds. These bonds are financial instruments that consist of issuance of debt from a sovereign entity or a company in order to fund certain activities in exchange for the payment of a periodic coupon, and return of the principal at the end of the tenure. Bond buyers or capital market investors (e.g. pension funds and insurance companies) are usually looking for stable returns over the long-term.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f3cd956-e6e6-40c6-8c0e-7e03e40cabcd": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f3cd956-e6e6-40c6-8c0e-7e03e40cabcd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2336c6607c7e10d9dcb98514bca53e7e635d3ed10ba3089859b48c31eef41c1e"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c58bcdb-66c8-4b20-a0c1-b9a92c4083e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dafa0699b91ec6f967126765724f46946996bd4ee215f44e4dbb8fe53bd428fe"}}, "hash": "b62aab6f119b35687459a0cb7c9863f16210f317a7b48443b434f3dd6b5bb40c", "text": "Institutional investors are often limited in the allocations to private equity, so in this context, bonds are becoming an increasingly attractive option for investors who seek longer-term fixed income, and who want to make an impact on society and the environment. According to the Bonds and Climate Change 2013 Report (Climate Bonds Initiative, 2013), there are currently US$ 364 billion in outstanding climate-themed bonds globally (including: transport \u2013 76%, energy \u2013 11.8%, finance \u2013 9.2%, buildings and industry \u2013 1.4%, agriculture and forestry \u2013 0.4%, and waste and pollution control \u2013 1.2%), compared to US$ 174 billion in 2012. Most of the bonds included in the report were issued by either state owned corporations, or are backed by governments through guarantees. In 2012 alone, 79% of bonds were backed by governments. As of 2013 there were at least 1,200 bonds from 260 different issuers that classified as climate change bonds, with an outstanding value of more than US$ 34 billion. Unfortunately, the agriculture and forest sector has the smallest share of the pie, with only US$ 1.5 billion. There is no record of climate bonds that have been issued in Africa, and no record of a REDD+ and/ or climate resilience bond. There is an important opportunity for Rwanda to raise funds directly through sovereign debt to finance its FLR activities, or to back sub-regions or companies to do so themselves. Rwanda issued its first ten-year bond in the international market early in 2013. The issuance was a success, with buyers showing confidence in the resurgence of Rwanda. The country raised almost US$ 3 billion in orders for an issuance of US$ 400 million, which brought down the yield (and the cost for the government) from the 64 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well initial 7.5% to 6.8%. An interesting part of this issuance is that part of the funds raised will be used for the construction of a hydropower plant. The Government of Rwanda could put together a portfolio of FLR projects to be issued by the government, a sub-regional entity, or a financial intermediary, to be guaranteed by the government. The bond should have the clear mandate to be invested into the portfolio so that investors will be incentivised by the yield and the environmental and social impacts of the bond. 6.7 Forest and land-use carbon markets and other payments for environmental services markets Depending on the development of the market for GHG emission reductions, this could provide an opportunity for Rwanda to generate new funding. According to the State of Forest Carbon Markets 2013 (Peters-Stanley, et al., 2013), the global market for emission reductions generated from agriculture, forestry and other land-use projects transacted 9% more volume than in 2011, for a total of 28 MtCO2e. However, the value of the market was lower than the previous year (8% less), with US$ 216 million, as prices fell from an average of US$ 9.2/tCO2e to US$ 7.8/tCO2e. The main source of demand for offsets came from voluntary buyers (95% of the market), mainly from international private sector buyers (70% of market). The remaining demand came from pre-compliance buyers from California and Australia. Remarkably, forestry was the dominant sector in the voluntary market with 34% of market share, followed closely by renewables with 33% of the market. Buyers have different motivations, with the most common being resale to end buyers (intermediaries), followed by demonstration of corporate social responsibility and climate leadership to regulators (Figure 10). Given the limited standing forests in Rwanda, the greatest opportunity for emission reduction generation is through reforestation, agroforestry, and sustainable agriculture. The market demand for emission reductions from reforestation projects has traditionally come from Kyoto compliance buyers (non EU Emissions Trading System) and philanthropic tree planting. However, as 2012 saw the end of the first Kyoto period, demand fell slightly compared to 2011. Prices for CDM projects in general crashed and some project developers preferred to take their projects into the voluntary market to achieve higher prices. Demand for REDD+ credits grew timidly as projects matured and availability of offsets increased. It is relevant to mention Figure 10.

REDD+ projects, for instance, only contracted 25%-29% of their potential yearly volume in 2012, when they needed to sell at least five years of potential emissions to finance upfront costs and activities. Reforestation projects, for instance, needed to sell 11.5 years of credits in order to have their financial needs covered; unfortunately, they contracted less than a year\u2019s worth of ERs on average. For improved forest management the case is similar; they had to sell at least five years\u2019 worth of ERs to cover their needs, but managed to sell just under a year\u2019s worth. As observed (Figure 11), projects cannot be financed solely by selling offsets; therefore, some additional finance sources are identified, particularly those that involve private sector participants. Some sources anticipate that jurisdictional REDD+ activities could be the key to bring together public interests and private demand, as jurisdictional REDD+ projects are managed by governments and can be financed by private funds (or a mix of public and private). This has incentivized project developers to synchronize and coordinate with governments to make sure projects can eventually be nested into national/subnational schemes. If international REDD+ were to be accepted for compliance in the California market, for instance, only jurisdictional projects would be accepted, as recommended by the REDD+ offsets working group in June 2013. 6.8 Leveraging public-private partnerships By their very nature, public-private partnerships (PPPs) involve sources of funds with different primary return motivations. However, PPPs play a pivotal role in promoting sectors for which the risk profile is perceived as high. Some relevant options have been identified through which the Figure 11. Sources of finance for forest carbon projects (Peters-Stanley, et al., 2013) 66 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well Government of Rwanda could partner with the private sector to mitigate the risk and incentivize its active participation in landscape activities. Advanced market commitments This is a private sector favourite and seeks to ensure some degree of demand in low or non- demand scenarios. For the basic mechanism to work, two parties are necessary \u2013 the administrator (e.g. the government) and a private investor, and a project or a portfolio of projects (emission reductions or productive landscape projects). The private investor commits to investing a determined amount of capital that enables the development and/or implementation of the identified project or activity. Usually, the investment consists of upfront payments on the back of a future delivery of goods and/or services to be generated by the project (e.g. voluntary carbon units in the case of REDD+ projects or a specific commodity in the case of agroforestry). In case of lack of demand for the goods or services or lower-than-expected prices, the administrator, in this case the government, makes a commitment to buy back the goods or services at an agreed price that protects the investor from major losses. It is as if the investor had a put \u2018right to sell\u2019 on the credits at a strike agreed with the government. One of the most appealing aspects of this type of partnership is that, just like in a put option, if the investor does not need to exercise its option, then the government will not have to disburse (buy back) any amount. The mechanism can be set in such a way that if the market price is favourable for the investor, it will be required to share the upside with the government, and profits will be reinvested into similar activities. Loan guarantees Through this mechanism the private investor provides a loan to a company or community that is usually perceived as high risk/not credit worthy. The government provides a full (100% of the loan or losses) or a partial (a percentage of the loan or losses) guarantee in case the borrower defaults fully, or in part, on its obligation for pre-agreed reasons (e.g. lack of demand for the final product, inability to complete implementation of project activities, or changes in the foreign exchange rate). This mechanism has been widely used globally by USAID\u2019s Development Credit Authority to encourage lenders to finance development mainly in the agricultural sector.

Some donors provide specific platforms to promote public private partnerships. USAID, through their Global Development Alliance, in partnership with SC Johnson, has provided support for the development of the pyrethrum production value chain and links to international markets. The USAID Global Development Alliance facility and other PPP programmes provide an excellent model for engaging private companies in Rwanda to establish linkages between Rwandan farmers and the international markets. The government\u2019s promotion of PPPs with the private sector for agriculture-related infrastructure could include warehouse facilities for improved storage of commodities, cold storage, irrigation infrastructure, basic processing of certain products, and food commodities for local consumption. 67 67 7.1 Barriers to attracting private investment in FLR Attracting investments to Rwanda\u2019s FLR activities will present challenges similar to those experienced for smallholder agriculture and forest conservation-based activities in other developing countries. There are barriers that are both value chain and country-specific. The former barriers must be addressed for each FLR investment opportunity, while the latter must be addressed in order for private investors to favour investing in FLR in Rwanda over other countries. The value chain-specific barriers, causes and solutions to be addressed for each FLR investment opportunity are outlined in Table 14. Not all the desired FLR activities can be supported by private sector investments, as a business case cannot be made that offers an attractive risk return. These activities are most appropriately funded with public or other concessional funds, and in some cases, it may be possible to integrate them with other investment-worthy opportunities, even at the risk of diluting returns. Successfully attracting private investment to FLR will require overcoming these barriers. The solutions in Table 14 are generic for smallholder FLR, but Rwanda will need to have a detailed set of prioritised interventions designed for each specific FLR value chain investment opportunity identified in Section 4.3. A high-level needs assessment for some FLR value chain activities (macadamia, ecotourism, honey, essential oils) is provided in the SME Product Clusters in Rwanda report which, through sectoral and regional analyses, has identified 20 priority clusters of SMEs by value chain and region (MINICOM, 2012). The Government of Rwanda, in addressing these needs, should evaluate how 7. Attracting investments for FLR: Barriers and recommendations SECTION HIGHLIGHTS This section identifies barriers and provides recommendations on ways that Rwanda can achieve its goal of attracting new sources of investment capital for FLR activities, and how best to leverage public money to attract and structure these investments. Without promoting the aggregation of smallholders into investable entities with compelling investment risk and return profiles, Rwanda will face a significant barrier to attracting private investment for FLR. The current focus on agricultural policy and investment does not explicitly promote FLR, thus, dedicated technical assistance and financing sources need to be specially allocated to FLR. To attract private investment for FLR, Rwanda will need to implement a set of four recommendations: 1. Identify and promote commercially viable FLR practices and partners; 2. Support the commercialization and preparation of the business cases; 3. Secure private investment for FLR; and 4. Design and operationalise a Rwanda FLR-dedicated PPP entity. 68 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well its investments could be matched to attract private investment. In addition to addressing value chain-specific barriers, Rwanda will need to convince investors that the country is an attractive place to make investments in FLR. Private investors have limited capacity to engage in a large number of countries, and are likely to focus on the countries they believe will provide the most attractive risk and return. Investors will consider the country\u2019s investment profile (Section 3), and the country-specific criteria in Table 15 when considering whether to invest in a specific country\u2019s FLR activities. Table 16 provides an assessment of Rwanda against these country-specific criteria. The government should focus on improving conditions where barriers are highest; including building more attractive investment opportunities through promoting scaled aggregation schemes, and expanding the capital markets to provide liquidity for investors in local SMEs. Many of the value chain-specific barriers can be overcome by providing financial expertise partnered with local, commercially oriented SMEs and cooperatives to bring together the two worlds of smallholder opportunities and institutional-style capital (i.e. filling the \u2018missing middle\u2019 of rural agricultural finance) (Doran, et al., 2009).

To attract meaningful levels of private investment that can finance multiple scales and a varied set of FLR value chains activities, Rwanda should focus in four main recommendations: 1. Identify and promote commercially viable FLR practices and partners, 2. Support commercialisation and making the business case to investors, 3. Identify and secure private investments for commercially viable FLR activities, and 4. Design and operationalise a Rwanda FLR public private partnership entity. For the first three of these recommendations, Rwanda would need to: (1) prioritise the FLR activities they most want to attract private investment, and (2) implement these three recommendations from the ground-up, with multidisciplinary and multi-organisational teams. This effort would deploy dedicated teams comprised of government, local and international finance professionals, private sector business managers, industry and cooperative associations, and natural resources/ agricultural NGOs; with skills ranging from local rural community engagement specialists, international investment finance experts, and other technical specialists. Equally as important as the skills of the team are that the motivations are aligned to serve rural communities who want to engage in FLR, and that the team collectively 70 Rwanda\u2019s Green Well Investment criteria Assessment Rationale Investment opportunities high barrier \u2022 Rwanda is a small country, and setting up local operations/ partners and gaining local knowledge may not yield a large enough investment opportunity. \u2022 Landholdings are very small, making gaining scale for a given investment challenging and underscoring the need for aggregation.

Table 16. Assessment of Rwanda\u2019s country-level investment enabling conditions 71 Attracting investments for FLR: Barriers and recommendations defines success as the ability to source investment capital. For the final recommendation, a feasibility analysis should be carried out to determine the viability of establishing a PPP fund dedicated specifically to attracting new sources of private investment for FLR. The country\u2019s SME policy set Rwanda\u2019s policy priorities of promoting SMEs supported by private investments, resulting in the formation of the Business Development Fund. The Fund provides a range of financial instruments, some of which can promote FLR, but it is not well capitalised and is not dedicated specifically to financing FLR activities or attracting larger pools of private investment. A properly capitalised targeted PPP fund that is designed to address FLR-specific barriers and finance only FLR investment opportunities is a critical instrument needed to promote more trees on Rwanda\u2019s landscape. While not FLR focused, there are a few examples of large-scale PPPs that can be evaluated for use in Rwanda, including a significant programme in Tanzania called the Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor (SAGCOT). This PPP is designed to catalyse over US$ 2.1 billion of private investment over 20 years, leveraged by US$ 1.3 billion in public investments. The targeted impact is to triple production in the target areas to 350,000 ha, all profitably farmed by smallholders (SAGCOT, 2011). The following sections provide guidance for implementation of the four recommendations that are designed to support Rwanda\u2019s goal of attracting scaled private investment capital to fund FLR activities. Identify and promote commercially viable FLR practices and partners The biggest complaint from larger investors trying to identify new African opportunities is that there are not enough \u2018investable opportunities\u2019 (Spector, 2013), or that opportunities that do exist are too small. To overcome this barrier, Rwanda needs a dedicated effort to identify and promote aggregation groups/entities that can be financed through SMEs or cooperatives. For private investors to engage at any scale, the activities seeking investment need to operationalise aggregation groups or entities due to the large number of smallholders in Rwanda, allowing the investors to make one larger investment to a group. Rwanda has a strong network of cooperatives, which need to be consolidated and organised by FLR value chain such that investors can evaluate them for investments, and benefit from risk reduction and scale provided by these aggregation entities. The implementation of this recommendation also requires government support of a detailed commercial readiness assessment to identify a pool of potential investments for each of these FLR value chain activities, and that identifies specific investee entities who could be engaged with the private investors. To scope this commercial readiness assessment, the government would provide further guidance on priority locations and specific FLR activities, and identify the universe of current programmes and entities that could be leveraged to produce a curated list of specific investments that would be evaluated in detail in the commercial readiness assessment. Table 17 provides a summary of Rwanda\u2019s FLR value chain investment opportunities (detailed in Section 4.3) and initial indication of the investment potential of each. The commercial readiness assessment would evaluate each of Rwanda\u2019s prioritised FLR opportunities using the basic criteria in Table 18. In Rwanda, there are multiple ways to identify FLR activities that may have commercial viability. One way is to \u2018follow the money.\u2019 This would include evaluating the FLR entities and activities that are publically funded, contained in domestic banks and loan portfolios, received DFI", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dac6e702-532b-4f86-8c6e-c61057b9870d": {"__data__": {"id_": "dac6e702-532b-4f86-8c6e-c61057b9870d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Rwanda's green well", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33e7ccea6aa2315036482ae65263c7f49914732ddca8f972ef31995cfcdfb27e"}, "3": {"node_id": "0d98b028-3372-4730-995b-2326e40b3578", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/rwandas-green-well", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "711e2a32dea809d267e3bbd9bec326b9224bb1f728ecd6ee1d48cda5a3fecea5"}}, "hash": "d4b921709532baa54fb3072bbcc74f945368bb151baf021e09bf02a055d5a61c", "text": "investments, and are involved in international private investments.

To implement this recommendation, a package of tailored technical support would be provided to entities/businesses that facilitate the activities in Table 19. The final set of products for each commercially viable business would be a complete investment prospectus and due diligence questionnaire that would allow them to credibly present their investment opportunities. This would also include the development of financial and operational capacity for the managers of the investment entities to interface with investors and understand the investment structures being sought. Identify and secure private investment for FLR Once commercially viable investments have been identified and are fully commercialised with professional business plans and due diligence materials, the success of attracting finance will depend on understanding both the details of the investment funding requirements as well as the full landscape of potential private investors that could provide capital. This recommendation supports the identification of potential investors for each commercially ready FLR investment opportunity. This could include sourcing private capital that would be directly invested in Rwanda\u2019s FLR activities, as well as sourcing private investments to increase capital in domestic financing entities that on-lend. To attract investments from private equity funds, DFIs, regional/international banks, and institutional investors, it is necessary to use qualified financial professionals. These investment professionals would have a strong understanding of the specific FLR investment opportunities, would understand the motivations of the targeted private investors, and would be able to represent the investment opportunity in the investor vernacular. These professionals would be able to represent the FLR investee entities in structuring/executing the transaction and meeting the due diligence requirements.

That way capital pools for Rwanda FLR can be grown over time through providing attractive returns for private investors. Producing financial returns can be supported with technical assistance to investee entities/ businesses such that they can: (i) establish performance reporting requirements to ensure effective management by leveraging existing systems and extension services, mobile and remote sensing technologies; (ii) develop programmes for the on-going training of investees; (iii) establish programmes to promote greater and broader adoption among new smallholders for scaling investors; (iv) support the production of quarterly performance reports to investors and share success stories more broadly; (v) support the integration of risk mitigation products into the investment; and (vi) provide oversight support (broad seats or external experts) for financial and operational management of investment entities. Design and operationalise a Rwanda PPP entity dedicated to FLR The purpose of the Rwanda FLR PPP would be to coordinate investment and mobilise Investment sourcing and execution support Technical deliverables Identify and secure private investments for commercially viable FLR activities \u2022 Review each set of FLR investments for suitability for each type of target investors and develop target prospect list \u2022 Develop professional quality investment pitch materials tailored for specific investors \u2022 Preform screening of investment prospects\u2019 interest and map FLR investments to potential investors. \u2022 Plan and conduct \u2018roadshows\u2019 and targeted meetings with the engagement of key implementing partners \u2022 Provide support for due diligence \u2022 Structuring/negotiation of transaction documents Table 19. FLR commercial readiness technical support Table 20. Private investment sourcing and deliverables Commercialisation support Technical deliverables Provide support for FLR investment opportunities to become commercially ready Facilitate the establishment and operationalisation of aggregation investment entities, including enhancing operational and financing management expertise Preparation of high quality financial projections to demonstrate cost effectiveness and the risk and return profile Identification and contracting of key implementation partners Documentation of entities\u2019 roles, contractual arrangements, and financial flow mechanisms 75 Attracting investments for FLR: Barriers and recommendations commitments for action across the broad range of actors needed to implement and fund FLR; thus initiating an environmentally sustainable, socially beneficial, and commercially viable approach with highly leveraged returns of private over public investments. Organisational design features of the PPP would include: \u2022 Independent legal status \u2013 entity is unaffiliated with any individual stakeholder and independent decision making power from the government; \u2022 Professionally staffed \u2013 drawing on Rwandan and international expertise in agriculture, forestry, water resource management, finance, SME entrepreneurship, and rural development; \u2022 A board of directors \u2013 oversees work, mobilises political support, receives and responds to any complaints; and \u2022 Accountable for results \u2013 metrics could include: quantity of landscape investments and their impact on smallholder livelihoods, food security, and the environment. The establishment of the PPP would follow this basic set of steps: \u2022 Attract a nucleus of politicians, large donors and private sector companies with stakes in Rwanda who will to agree to support the initiative; \u2022 Secure funding to fully develop the PPP concept; \u2022 Develop the concept note; \u2022 Secure start-up funding for development of the PPP; \u2022 Create an \u2018investment blueprint\u2019 that details the objectives, targeted results and operational management and governance of the PPP; and \u2022 Operationalise the PPP. Partnerships will need to be identified upfront and expanded over time to support the following: \u2022 Conceptualisation, \u2022 Promotion, \u2022 Administration, \u2022 Partnership facilitation, \u2022 Seed funding, \u2022 Implementation funding, and \u2022 Private investments. Drawing from SAGCOT and other similar PPP structures (e.g. USAID\u2019s Private Capital Group for Africa) that empower smallholders to be commercially viable producers and reduce environmental impact while improving productivity, will provide Rwanda a framework for developing their own focused PPP which would be customised to support Landscape Restoration and to address the barriers specific to Rwanda. The formal establishment of the PPP would aid in bringing scale and focus to attracting investment. There are key activities that can be supported in the absence of the PPP or can be integrated into the PPP once operationalised and capitalised. 76 [ADP] Accenture Development Partnerships (2012).

Such properties include biological structures that develop in vertical and horizontal layers of live and dead plants, complex processes at multiple vertical levels from within soil layers up to the canopy, the capacity for self-renewal in the face of constant small and large disturbances, co-evolved plant-animal and plant-plant interactions, and the influence forest landscapes can have on micro- and regional climates, especially in closed- canopy tropical forests. Forests are comprised of multiple ecosystems that are associated with variable edaphic and microclimate conditions across broad landscapes. Thompson, I., Mackey, B., McNulty, S., Mosseler, A. (2009).

The rural poor, in particular, benefit extensively from forest goods and services (such people are approximately 1.6 billion in number).ii IUCN has estimated the economic benefits of forests at USD 130 million per year.iii On the other side, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) calculate the costs in lost value from forest destruction to be between USD 2-5 trillion per year.iv Forest Landscape Restoration Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) is a process that aims to regain ecological integrity and enhance human well-being in deforested or degraded forest landscapes. It involves people coming together to restore the function and productivity of degraded forest lands - through a variety of place-based interventions, including new tree plantings, managed natural regeneration, or improved land management. The idea is to restore forest ecosystems as part of larger, negotiated landscape management changes, rather than through isolated restoration projects or piecemeal land use alterations. In light of the immense benefits provided by forests, FLR provides a great opportunity to address pressing global challenges. Indeed, more than two billion hectares of land offer opportunities for restoration across the world, in both tropical and temperate countries.v The Bonn Challenge, established at the invitation of the Government of Germany and IUCN in 2011, calls for the restoration of 150 million hectares (m/ha) of deforested and degraded lands by 2020.

This is a voluntary partnership between governments, international and non-governmental organizations and others, which \"facilitates exchange and learning, generates new knowledge and tools, acts as vehicle to mobilize capacity and expert support to address the practicalities of in-situ landscape restoration.\"vii Currently, nearly 60 m/ha of land have been pledged from countries like Ethiopia, Rwanda, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and the United States and the Altantic Forest Restoration Pact in Brazil, with several million further hectares in contributions expected in 2015. viii Forest Landscape Restoration has the potential to provide immense benefits for climate change mitigation and, if carried out in a climate smart manner, provide equally large adaptation benefits. Previously forests were mainly considered for mitigation purposes and largely ignored for adaptation. Now, recent studies suggest their importance in linking both mitigation and adaptation. ix 3 The Study The purpose of this study is to understand the current discourse and practice on climate change mitigation and adaptation in FLR, as well as to analyze the implications for a better understanding the complementarities and synergies between mitigation and adaptation, specifically in the context of FLR. Both mitigation and adaptation are considered equally important to address with climate change. Developing countries, least developed countries (LDCs) and island states all now agree on instituting mitigation efforts as well as adaptation. The results of the study will help develop and implement IUCN\u2019s strategies and actions to establish linkages between climate mitigation and adaptation in forest landscapes. As compared to other sectors, there is potentially more opportunity to demonstrate these linkages in the broad forest sector. The involvement of local communities in mitigation efforts through forest restoration provides an ideal opportunity to enhance the adaptive capacity of those communities. It is thus critical to appraise and better understand the links between mitigation and adaptation in the context of both policy relevance and field implementation. This would help develop a joint mitigation and adaptation conceptual Box 1 Important Aspects of Forest Landscape Restoration \u2022 It focuses restoration decisions on how best to restore forest functionality (that is, the goods, services and processes that forests deliver), rather than on simply maximizing new forest cover. In other words, FLR is much more than just tree-planting; \u2022 It encourages landscape managers to take site-based decisions within a landscape context, ensuring, at the very least, that such decisions do not reduce the quality or quantity of forest-related functionality at a landscape level and, ideally, that the decisions contribute towards improving landscape-level functionality; \u2022 It requires that local needs are addressed and balanced alongside with national-level priorities and requirements for reforestation, thus making local stakeholder involvement in planning and management decisions an essential component; \u2022 While promoting the need for site-level specialization, it discourages actions that would result in human well- being being traded off against ecological integrity at the landscape level, or vice versa. Such trade-offs are unsustainable and tend to be counterproductive in the medium to long term. Rather such tradeoffs should be part of landscape level negotiations; \u2022 It recognizes that neither the solutions to complex land-use problems nor the outcomes of a particular course of action can be predicted accurately, especially as ecosystems and land-use patterns change over time. FLR is therefore built on adaptive management and requires that necessary provision is made for monitoring and learning; \u2022 Given the complex challenge of restoration, FLR normally requires a package of tools. Silver bullet type- solutions or approaches seldom provide the practitioner with sufficient flexibility; and \u2022 Over the longer term, FLR cannot be driven solely by good technical interventions alone but will require supportive local and national policy frameworks. In many situations it is likely that policy change will follow on from good innovative practice. Therefore, practitioners need to familiarize themselves with how other land- use policies impact the restoration and management of forests. Source: IUCN 2005 4 Box 2 UNEP has specified that forests have four major roles in climate change: 1. They currently contribute about one- sixth of global carbon emissions when cleared, overused or degraded; 2. They react sensitively to a changing climate; 3. When managed sustainably, they produce woodfuels as a benign alternative to fossil fuels; 4. And finally, they have the potential to absorb about one-tenth of global carbon emissions projected for the first half of this century into their biomass, soils and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66380ef6-639a-4244-ad04-9bc84d5f16c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "66380ef6-639a-4244-ad04-9bc84d5f16c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergies-between-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-forest-landscape", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergies between climate mitigation and adaptation in forest landscape restoration", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergies-between-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-forest-landscape", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8a99168fb2f6ea4519c8fdee05ee3ec28d1741d94fff4d6b0b4af987b4e579e"}}, "hash": "f8a99168fb2f6ea4519c8fdee05ee3ec28d1741d94fff4d6b0b4af987b4e579e", "text": "products and store them - in principle in perpetuity Source: http://www.fao.org/forestry/climatechange/53459/en/ model and strategy to optimize investment on FLR projects and initiatives based on empirical knowledge and experience, even though it may still be politically necessary to separate mitigation and adaptation at a policy level, or at least see one as a co-benefit of the other, and vice versa The idea is to synthesise the rich learning, evidence and expertise for integrated adaptation-mitigation options in FLR and make this available for policy makers, such that it can be used to inform policy and on-ground practice. This will help to ensure that the success stories of mitigation-adaptation integration in forest landscapes can be replicated in other sectors also. It will also help in bringing technical expertise from international and national arenas to the local field levels. Methodology The study entailed extensive literature review of linkages between adaptation and mitigation at the global policy level, through analysis of relevant policies and protocols in the context of climate change in general and FLR in particular. Initially, results of UNFCCC Conference of Parties were assessed to summarise the various decisions that have been taken over the years. This was followed by literature review regarding the current discourse and understanding of adaptation and mitigation options and the synergies between the two, specifically in the context of FLR. An important aspect of the study was to develop case studies to explore linkages between national policies on mitigation and adaptation in 7 priority countries (India, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Vietnam, El Salvador and Mexico). In addition, the case studies also highlighted FLR related mitigation and adaptation options in the countries, their role in UNFCCC, and the way forward for them in promoting synergetic mitigation and adaptation options for forest landscapes. The final section provides recommendations for integrated mitigation- adaptation options at international and national policy levels after reviewing the current thinking on this aspect. Climate Change and Forest Landscapes Over the past two decades it has become increasingly clear that climate is changing across the globe. The Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its first assessment report in 1990, highlighting this aspect. Since then, its subsequent reports have continued to provide further and increasingly stronger evidence that human induced climate change has immense effects on humans societies and ecosystems. Forests are important ecosystems and provide countless goods and services to people across the globe. These goods and services are in the form of food, fuel, medicine, employment and income. Wood and NTFP (non-timber forest products) are used for various purposes by local communities as well as at the national and global levels. Forests also support extensive biodiversity; providing habitat and food sources for various species. The impact of climate change, can therefore, be felt across the board in forest ecosystems, affecting human societies in a multitude of ways. Climate change impacts humans directly, and can affect both humans and biodiversity indirectly through its influence on forest landscapes. Since local communities are also dependent on biodiversity, they are again affected when species are affected. Furthermore, forests - like other ecosystems across the globe, are not 5 only being affected by climate change (Box 2) associated disturbances such as flooding, droughts, wildfires and insects but also by other drivers of change such as land use, pollution and overexploitationx. Global vegetation patterns are heavily dependent on climate and human influence, which specifically influences the distribution, structure and ecology of forests.xi This fact has been repeatedly proven by various studies, showing that particular climate regimes are associated with particular plant communities or functional types xii and as such it can be assumed that climate change would therefore have extensive impacts on the configuration of forests.xiii This was also highlighted in the Third Assessment Report of IPCC, which showed that forest ecosystems are likely to be seriously impacted by future climate changexiv and this may happen even if global warming is less than projected in this century, with the result still being changes in species composition, productivity and biodiversity.xv According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), the increase in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 due to change in climate, will directly affect forest growth and production. On the other hand changes in temperature and precipitation will result in indirect impacts through complex interactions in the forest ecosystems. Although warmer temperatures in temperate and boreal zones will have a positive effect, a decline in precipitation and an increase in decomposition rates will nullify this.xvi Furthermore, the increase in productivity in some tropical zones will be temporary and in drylands the increase in temperature will lead to increased", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "42139589-897f-4e2e-877a-882b72a45a0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "42139589-897f-4e2e-877a-882b72a45a0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergies-between-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-forest-landscape", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergies between climate mitigation and adaptation in forest landscape restoration", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergies-between-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-forest-landscape", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fc8373e2a94af1421af486c3a5de5ebd23dfd817457b66effc2039b587c7f778"}}, "hash": "fc8373e2a94af1421af486c3a5de5ebd23dfd817457b66effc2039b587c7f778", "text": "plant stress decreasing their productivity.xvii It is clear that changes in forest productivity are likely to have a multitude of impacts on natural and human systems. It will impact the production of wood and wood products thus leading to losses in income for forest communities and the timber industry. Forest biodiversity will also be impacted as forests shift towards the poles and vulnerable species could be lost.xviii Not only this, the higher predicted incidences of extreme events will also have a devastating effect on the forest flora and fauna as will the increase in forest fires due to droughts.xix Changes in precipitation and runoff patterns will result in decrease in the availability of water in many parts of the worlds forested watersheds, thus decreasing the goods and services they provide.xx Incidences of pest outbreaks are also expected to rise as the defenses of host species change with a changing climate, as well as with the change in the abundance of parasites and predators. FAO cites examples where insect and pathogen lifecycles or habits have been altered by local or larger-scale climate change (e.g. mountain pine beetles in North America and pine and oak caterpillars in Europe).xxi It is therefore, necessary to implement strategies and approaches in forest ecosystems to increase their resilience and adaptive capacity, thus decreasing the vulnerability of the human societies dependent on them. As such, adaptive and sustainable forest management is crucial to reduce vulnerabilities of forests and the human populations dependent on them. Importantly, approaches such as afforestation, reforestation, restoration, and avoided deforestation (REDD+) are essential approaches to ensure the continuation of carbon sequestration for mitigation of GHGs. FAO recommends 10% forest cover per a country's land area.xxii Forest landscape restoration provides extensive opportunities for the implementation of these climate related options. Current Strategies to Deal with Climate Change: Definitions Mitigation and adaptation are the two main strategies that are used effectively to address climate change and its impacts, especially on forest ecosystems. Adaptation IPCC defines adaptation \"as an adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.\" xxiii According to the UNFCCC \"Adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts. It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate 6 Box 3 UNFCCC Requirements \uf0b7 Requires all Parties, taking into account their responsibilities and capabilities, to formulate and implement programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change \uf0b7 Also requires all Parties to develop and periodically update national inventories of GHG emissions and removals \uf0b7 Commits all Parties to promote, and cooperate in, the development, application and diffusion of climate friendly technologies \uf0b7 Requires developed countries to adopt national policies and measures to limit GHG emissions and protect and enhance sinks and reservoirs \uf0b7 States that the extent to which developing countries will implement their commitments will depend on financial resources and transfer of technology potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change.\" IPCC also defines the types of adaptation: anticipatory or proactive adaptation (\u201cthat takes place before impacts of climate change are observed\u201d), reactive adaptation (\u201cthat takes place after impacts of climate change have been observed\u201d), autonomous or spontaneous adaptation (\u201cthat does not constitute a conscious response to climatic stimuli but is triggered by eco- logical changes in natural systems and by market or welfare changes in human systems\u201d) and planned adaptation (\u201cthat is the result of a deliberate policy decision, based on an awareness that conditions have changed or are about to change and that action is required to return to, maintain, or achieve a desired state\u201d). xxiv In forest landscapes, adaptation means changing management practices in order to decrease the vulnerability of forests to climate change as well as implementing activities to reduce the vulnerability of the forest dependent populations, and adopting climate smart restoration and management approaches, for example restoration with species appropriate to the evolving changes in climate. Vulnerability is central to adaptationxxv and the IPCC defines vulnerability as \u201cthe degree to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Vulnerability is a function of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variation to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive capacity\u201d. It elaborates on the components of vulnerability, which are: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.xxvi Using the IPCC definitions \"exposure is the nature and degree to which a system is exposed to significant climatic variations\u201d. Forests are", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b317037-cddf-4126-b990-3c921652227c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b317037-cddf-4126-b990-3c921652227c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergies-between-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-forest-landscape", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Synergies between climate mitigation and adaptation in forest landscape restoration", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/synergies-between-climate-mitigation-and-adaptation-forest-landscape", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "820fff07c44e3c30707598dd754b618cca2ef593ea109a903e0daa4c59ca25a5"}}, "hash": "820fff07c44e3c30707598dd754b618cca2ef593ea109a903e0daa4c59ca25a5", "text": "exposed to different aspects of climate change (and other factors such as land use and pollution that may exacerbate climate change impacts). xxvii Sensitivity means the \"degree to which a system is affected, either adversely or beneficially, by climate-related stimuli.\" This indicates that forests are impacted by climate change by varying degrees and these impacts may be positive or negative and may be through changes in tree level processes, species distribution or disturbance regimes.xxviii Finally, the IPCC definition refers to adaptive capacity that is \u201cthe ability to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the consequences.\" In terms of forests the extent of their adaptive capacity to climate change is not clear and therefore we do not know how well forest landscapes would be able to adjust to climate change. xxix This needs to be considered when developing adaptation strategies for forests. The success of adaptation strategies depends on governments and other stakeholders including civil society, communities, international organizations and the private sector.xxx Mitigation The IPCC defines mitigation as \"an anthropogenic intervention to reduce the emissions sources or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.\" The Fourth Assessment Report of the International Panel for Climate Change highlights that global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have grown since pre-industrial times. xxxi Approximately 70% of this increase occurred between 1970 and 2004. According to the 7 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) these emissions will continue to grow over the next few decades even with the current level of climate change mitigation policies and sustainable development practices.xxxii Both the UNFCCC and IPCC maintain that societies can respond to climate change by reducing GHG emissions and enhancing sinks and reservoirs, depending on governments' capacity to do so, and based on socioeconomic and environmental situations and the availability of information and technology. A wide variety of policies and climate change mitigation instruments are available to encourage and assist governments to provide incentives for mitigation activities.xxxiii The convention also lays down requirements for the parties (Box 3). Carbon is one of the main contributors to climate change and is mainly stored in fossil fuel reserves, atmosphere, oceans, ocean sediment and terrestrial ecosystems.xxxiv According to the IPCC, terrestrial ecosystems store approximately 2,400 Gt C with a gross carbon exchange with the atmosphere at approximately 200 Gt C per year.xxxv It is important to note that almost 50% of terrestrial carbon stocks are in forest ecosystems in the form of biomass and soil carbon.xxxvi Since almost half the world\u2019s forests have been converted to agriculture and other land uses xxxvii and extensive degradation has also taken place in the remainder, this means that \"the current terrestrial stock of ~2,400 Gt is possibly about 40% below the natural reservoir when at equilibrium with current climate.\" xxxviii According to the FAO, mitigation strategies in the forest sector can be grouped into four main categories: \uf0b7 Reducing emissions from deforestation; \uf0b7 Reducing emissions from forest degradation; \uf0b7 Enhancing forest carbon sinks; and \uf0b7 Product substitution (use of wood instead of fossil fuels for energy and the use of wood fiber in place of materials such as cement, steel and aluminum that involve the emission of larger quantities of GHGs). xxxix Countries are being encouraged, especially through REDD+, to undertake mitigation actions in forest landscapes, by incorporating the above strategies. A variety of policies and instruments have effectively reduced GHG emissions in many countries and according to the Fourth IPCC there is significant potential in the coming decades also.xl Both mitigation and adaptation are crucial strategies if this planet is to deal with climate change and is impacts. As a result, countries have come together to increase their own understanding of climate change and its impacts, to build their capacities and to implement mitigation and adaptation activities. The next section (Section 2) outlines this global response to climate change. 8 Global Response to Climate Change \"Climate change is a complex problem, which, although environmental in nature, has consequences for all spheres of existence on our planet. It either impacts on-- or is impacted by-- global issues, including poverty, economic development, population growth, sustainable development and resource management. It is not surprising, then, that solutions come from all disciplines and fields of research and development.\" UNFCCC xli It was this global understanding that led to the establishment of various responses to climate change. The crucial need was to reduce emissions and in 2010 governments agreed that emissions need to be reduced such that global temperature increases are limited to below 20C.

Organizations such as the IPCC and the World Bank provide the technical and socioeconomic information (and funding for projects also, in the case of The World Bank) regarding climate change, which assists countries in implementing actions for mitigation and adaptation. While the UNFCCC is a framework where national parties influence decisions on actions on the political and economic climate change agenda. Therefore, to understand global actions it is necessary to briefly review these organizations and frameworks to assess how they influence climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organisation in 1988, as the leading international body for the scientific and socioeconomic impact assessment of climate change. xlii It is responsible for reviewing and assessing the most recent global scientific, technical and socioeconomic information. The scientific aspects of climate are assessed by the IPCC Working Group I (WG I). It looks at changes in greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere; observed changes in air, land and ocean temperatures, rainfall, glaciers and ice sheets, oceans and sea level; historical and paleoclimatic perspective on climate change; biogeochemistry, carbon cycle, gases and aerosols; satellite data and other data; climate models; climate projections, causes and attribution of climate change. Adaptation, impacts and vulnerability are assessed by the IPCC Working Group II (WG II), which also takes into consideration the interrelationship between vulnerability, adaptation and sustainable development. Mitigation options are assessed by the IPCC Working Group III (WG III).xliii The Task Force on National
