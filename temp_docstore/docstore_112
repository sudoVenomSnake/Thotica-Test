A study carried out by the Planning and Development Company (SOPDE) for the Provincial Council indicates that this project will have an economic impact of more than 40 million euros (24 million will be generated by managing the trail for tourism and another 16 million will result from its construction) and it may support around 400 jobs per year. Of these, around 270 will be created and maintained annually for tourism activities and for operating the trail, while some 130 will be created for five years to carry out the works needed to complete the project. The economic effects of the final commissioning of the Coastal Trail are based on four main factors: \u2013 changing the activities of tourists, who will include their tour as a part of their holiday; \u2013 increasing the average length of stay because of this new attraction; \u2013 capturing new visitors; and \u2013 the economic effects for the construction industry and associated businesses. The study also takes into account the multiplier effect, i.e. the set of increases that will occur in the province\u2019s income as a result of an external increase in consumption and investment. 135 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Inclusive governance CRITERIA 5. NbS are based on inclusive, transparent and empowering governance processes INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 5.1 A defined and fully agreed upon feedback and grievance resolution mechanism is available to all stakeholders before an NbS intervention can be initiated The Coastal Trail of M\u00e1laga Province is a project led by the Provincial Council that has the collaboration of the 14 coastal municipalities, the coastal communities, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Sustainable Development of the Andalusian Regional Government and the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment through the Department of Coasts and Maritime Environment. 5.2 Participation is based on mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status, and upholds the right of Indigenous Peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) Participation takes into consideration the effects of green areas of high ecological value on the municipalities that the Coastal Trail crosses by. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention No evidence found during the evaluation. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders No information available or accessible in English. 5.5 Where the scale of the NbS extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, mechanisms are established to enable joint decision making by the stakeholders in those jurisdictions affected by the NbS It is conceived as a green infrastructure scheme that connects many sites of high ecological value along the coastline. Thus, touring the coast will allow people to see up close areas of great natural value that mark out the municipalities in M\u00e1laga province and add huge appeal to this Coastal Trail. Examples include the Cantales de La Ara\u00f1a, the Rock of the Raven, Punta Chullera in Manilva, the Dunes of Artola, the delta of the River V\u00e9lez, the mouth of the Guadalhorce or the rocky stretch between Calahonda and Calaburras, in Mijas.

NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change The Coastal Trail will in itself be an important tourist resource because it can really be travelled between Nerja and Manilva along the coast, and this opens up alternative marketing and business opportunities for our entrepreneurs, hotels and hospitality, sports and active tourism businesses. It is a sister project of the Great M\u00e1laga Path (Gran Senda de M\u00e1laga \u2013 GSM), the circular route through the province along roads and trails, which has already become a national landmark for active tourism. Some of its sections will be shared with the Coastal Trail (such as stage 1 of the GSM, M\u00e1laga to Rinc\u00f3n de la Victoria, or stage 30, Estepona to Marbella). In addition, the Coastal Trail will help to promote the Costa del Sol as a single product that covers the entire coast of the province, from east to west, since there is often talk of the Eastern and Western Costa del Sol, but this distinction must be only geographical because the brand belongs to our entire province. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support their uptake and mainstreaming No evidence found during the evaluation. 8.3 Where relevant, NbS contribute to national and global targets for human well-being, climate change, biodiversity and human rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) No explicit evidence found during the evaluation.

The first phase of the International Ideas Competition for the former Italsider industrial area was successfully concluded. By the deadline of the call, scheduled for 11.00 a.m. on 7 January 2020, 36 applications from groupings of architectural firms had been submitted, which included over 160 studies, 40 of them international, testifying to the strong interest that the initiative aroused. This stage influences the result of the assessment of the project; nevertheless, it could be a good opportunity to test the potential of the standard in order to identify gaps or variables to be improved, since we are at the very beginning of the project\u2019s conceptualisation. The project is being developed under the framework of the Environmental Remediation and Urban Regeneration Programme (Programma di risanamento ambientale e di rigenerazione urbana) (Excerpt pursuant to Art. 11a of Decree-Law No 210 of 30/12/2015), Bagnoli\u2013Coroglio Site of Major National Interest (Sito di rilevante interesse nazionale di Bagnoli- Coroglio) (30/04/2019), the main aim of which is to set out a programme of environmental regeneration for the area focusing on the following objectives or actions: To restore urban parks along the coast, to mitigate urban pollution; To cultivate botanical species under glass, in order to reduce the environmental impact of the area; To treat wastewater to depollute the coastal zone.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "85d94894-cb55-48e9-bdef-1776d7e0fee4": {"__data__": {"id_": "85d94894-cb55-48e9-bdef-1776d7e0fee4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "112b65e6586a5821ae594eaa113b7f71cc8e0eecc912d6d0092c391d8c586b02"}, "2": {"node_id": "4e4350d4-b1d9-4870-a332-713eadcb4721", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "722e10a1e645697fc5dce2b6cce5ad91dad5bf47e98dd74d292d20a9c454a34c"}}, "hash": "b804720950efc430606731606193a91f7adb1ef7c095c4cc4f4ffe46dc9b5f83", "text": "The project contributes to the aim of developing a public beach and park for the city.

This plan is designed to upgrade and restore the green area, and to mitigate urban pollution. The International Ideas Competition for the Bagnoli area is intended to design the new landscape for the former industrial area of Naples, which covers an area of 250 hectares, transforming it into one of the largest and most fascinating international urban parks. The future of the Bagnoli site, as in the Environmental Remediation and Urban Regeneration Programme, is to make the most of geographic, landscape, environmental, social and cultural resources to restore the quality of life and general well-being for citizens and future users of this area. Invitalia, the National Development Agency based in Rome, has launched this competition, which is part of an ambitious environmental remediation and urban regeneration project. This vision is planned to be materialised through a low-density settlement project within a high- quality environment, the key elements of which are green areas and a range of new residential, commercial and tertiary activities. At its core is a large urban park of about 120 hectares, which is expected to develop into a new green heart of Naples. It will be an attraction hosting industrial archaeology artefacts, research spaces, leisure and sporting activities, and with its 2 km of waterfront it will form an ideal link with the Gulf of Naples.

In this respect, the projected future of the Bagnoli site, as shown in the Environmental Remediation and Urban Regeneration Programme (PRARU), is to make the most of geographic, landscape, environmental, social and cultural resources to restore the quality of life and general well-being for citizens and future users of this area. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors The intervention to regenerate the Bagnoli coastal area is included within the PRARU. The regeneration of the Bagnoli coast is also associated with other plans concerning mobility, industrial and cultural heritage, environment, coast, water, etc. Therefore, a more general project framework is conceptualised, in which urban planning is the cross-cutting variable. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site The intervention programme includes a health\u2013environmental risk analysis based on existing legislation (Environmental Code: Part IV", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbfc6922-65d0-4482-869f-89e14834e5cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbfc6922-65d0-4482-869f-89e14834e5cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "862294bdda708998b22dd79c912821f7bd4e7593894fbe1ebcc0f290af78c62d"}, "3": {"node_id": "82b80bfb-f1cc-4dc2-abf1-9b18d8bc0846", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "558c8ce2538aba13c1326255c8aaf72a2b60fedbc02a53e907689d9400ccce65"}}, "hash": "510bd38d02e8c0d62e7471d34afb515d58d3a8e6779a232792bea89e6c0f7cf1", "text": "- Legislative Decree 152/06 and subsequent amendments), which makes use of baseline data, once validated by the Control Bodies, and defines the objectives of the remediation interventions in accordance with the intended use of the area (green/residential or commercial/industrial).

NbS result in net gain to biodiversity and ecosystem integrity INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 3.1 NbS actions directly respond to evidence-based assessment of the current state of the ecosystem and prevailing drivers of degradation and loss The environmental remediation and urban regeneration strategy for the area is based on an analysis of the context: a classification of the Bagnoli-Coroglio area which includes the following elements: Main characteristics of the reference area subject to intervention: land use classification, history, archaeology and landscape, the industrial history of the site, recognition of the interventions, programmes and implementation plans underway in the area of interest, constraints of the area; the history of remediation and the pollution situation on land and at sea; the energy potential of the Bagnoli\u2013Coroglio area; the current state of infrastructure: waterfront, tourist port, piers, water supply network; the mobility, size and structural characteristics of the population, the fight against social exclusion; and the economic and social system: research and tourism. 3.2 Clear and measurable biodiversity conservation outcomes are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed No evidence found during the evaluation. 3.3 Monitoring includes periodic assessments of unintended adverse consequences for nature arising from the NbS The monitoring system is related to the second general objective of the project: creating a smart city using sensors to support the exploitation of the area and ensure high resilience to territorial changes. Bagnoli Smart City is conceptualised as a set of infrastructure networks and monitoring and early-warning systems capable of ensuring a high degree of resilience to territorial changes (natural and anthropic), protecting the infrastructure itself, all buildings and people from the risks associated with bradyseism, climate change and hydrogeological instability, while offering innovative services to users to improve the usability and sustainability of the area, such as smart parking, smart transportation, smart lighting, etc. The variables that are most considered for monitoring are water and energy, with a view to developing a transportation system providing access to the area to meet the demand generated. 3.4 Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity are identified and incorporated into the NbS strategy No evidence found during the evaluation. ISSUES ADDRESSED Economic feasibility CRITERIA 4. NbS are economically viable INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 4.1 The direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits, are identified and documented The estimated cost of remediation will be part of the exercise, considering the information presented in the project on the modelling process; there will be a part for determining the reclamation costs of the dry land and flooded areas, a part for determining the costs of remediation measures on the coast above sea level and on the seabed, and a part for estimating of the costs of remediation and environmental remediation. Nevertheless, no information is available about economic benefits except the cost-benefit analysis for transport infrastructure, which uses a procedure to select an optimal transport scenario to ensure adequate access to the area of the Bagnoli\u2013Coroglio Site of National Interest. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies No evidence found during the evaluation.

The overarching Plan is put into practice through several projects and actions. Figure 1 below shows the general complex of plans and programmes under the umbrella of the GI and Biodiversity Plan. The Plan has two phases: The First Phase mainly covers the period 2016\u20132019 and the Second Phase or New Plan (currently under development) will cover 2021\u2013 2030. The Plan includes urban planning and specific interventions (around 65 projects in the First Phase) and other actions all contributing to the Plan\u2019s implementation. The New Plan marks a major departure from the previous phase in the classification and management of green spaces, and it places particular focus on Biodiversity as a main goal in response to the EU Biodiversity Strategy approach and requirements.The challenges of the Plan are presented in the technical and legal documentation, and in the urban transformation projects. It is worth mentioning that the development of this Plan has placed Biodiversity issues within the Department of Legal Services and Urban Planning \u2013 an extraordinary achievement for the city of Barcelona, and an example for other cities around the globe.

One of the key goals of the Plan is the signing of the Green and Biodiversity Charter and Manual, based on a common strategic Green Urban Development Model for the city of Barcelona. This vision is being partly defined by the Superblocks Mobility and Urban Model (http:// www.bcnecologia.net/en/conceptual-model/ superblocks), an ambitious project that improves mobility and quality of life and increases the green areas in the urban fabric by 91%. There has been a major paradigm shift in the way Green Spaces are managed and maintained in Barcelona. In the First Phase of the Plan, green spaces were classified in four maintenance intensity levels depending on their character and attributes. The New Plan takes an integrated, holistic approach classifying all green spaces in 3 broad categories or types of spaces: biodiversity, cultural heritage and urban. The three different types of spaces correspond to differences in management. The new green management model means working not only with the new types of green spaces described above but also with new approaches, topics and challenges regarding the flora and fauna: unique flora, invasive species, vertebrates and invertebrates. New governance has also been promoted, with cross-cutting work with those involved and affected (BCASA, IMPUQV, Animal Rights Directorate, ASPB, Projects, etc.), in which participation is incorporated as a tool to improve organisation and management. The challenges of the Plan are shared, promoted and worked on through exchanges and innovation beyond the EU. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ecologiaurbana/sites/default/files/PlanVerde_2020.pdf Plan del Verde y de la Biodiversidad de Barcelona 2020.

Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan The New Plan improves knowledge about green spaces and biodiversity and works through an information system; there are a number of projects supporting this action (Lines 3 and 7 of the Plan). Some of these projects are: Biodiversity indicators (in preparation); Annual survey of common birds (Catalan common bird survey \u2013 SOCC), amphibians, butterflies, hedgehogs, bats; Ponds: Water quality, benthic fauna and macroinvertebrates; Study on the identification and mapping of invasive plants in the city and its surroundings; Geolocation of orchids; Species nurseries, aromatic spirals for pollinators; Inventory of urban donors; Study of the seabed and biodiversity in the Parc dels Esculls; Monitoring the city\u2019s vegetation cover (NDVI); Inventory of all the green spaces in the city managed by Parks and Gardens (NEV); Studies of the ecosystem / socio-environmental services of the city\u2019s green spaces; calculation of the ecosystem services of the trees in the urban area, by the I-tree method; Selection, description and assessment of new species for gardening with the potential to adapt to climate change; Atlas of the nesting birds of Barcelona and Digital Atlas of Biodiversity of the city of Barcelona. The Digital Atlas of Biodiversity of the city of Barcelona is one of the tools that helps to display a large amount of information on green spaces. It is a map of the city of Barcelona divided up into 73 neighbourhoods that provides a snapshot of the city\u2019s trees, green-space plants, birds, butterflies, vertebrate animals and other features, either separately or together. The tool provides information on the inventory of species (flora and fauna). The inventory is updated every 5\u201310 years and the study is subcontracted by the municipality via a public procurement process, requiring huge effort in resource mobilisation. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: https://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/ecologiaurbana/sites/default/files/PlanVerde_2020.pdf 148 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Documents IUCN (2016) \u201cNature-based Solutions to address global societal challenges\u201d.

Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 149 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Societal challenges Climate change / Water security / Human health / Economic development CRITERIA 1. NbS effectively address societal challenges INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 1.1 The most pressing societal challenges for rights holders and beneficiaries are prioritised The prioritised global societal challenges are biodiversity, climate change (resilience) including water management, alongside human health and social development. The Plan aims to create a city where natural heritage and biodiversity are preserved and enhanced, where maximum green infrastructure (GI) and connectivity are achieved, as well as maximum social and environmental services from GI, and a city that is more resilient in the face of climate change. Restoring and enhancing GI through this plan provides the inhabitants of Barcelona with many ecosystem services such as air purification, noise reduction, regulation of urban climate and temperature, reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, water cycle regulation, recreation, improvement in mental health and general well-being. In addition to these benefits to humans, GI supports biodiversity, provides habitats for flora and fauna and creates ecological connectivity. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented The main goals are explicit and well detailed in the documents regarding the Plan and the programme which deploys it. 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed During the First Phase of the Plan, a specific study analysed the provision of ecosystem services by the green areas of the city, including: climate change adaptation (thermal regulation, for instance), well-being (social interaction and contact with nature) and environmental co-benefits including noise and air quality improvements and biodiversity. Finally, positive economic impacts were also reported. BARCELONA. Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale City-wide / District / Urban acupuncture CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems The Plan and programmes that deploy it adopt an holistic approach to socio- ecological systems, in which interactions between natural ecosystems and society are reported and analysed. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors The Plan acts as an umbrella for a number of initiatives and plans which are aligned with each other and work towards a common vision of the City. GI is a factor that cuts across different urban plans and policies, especially those linked to the Programme to Boost Green Infrastructure, the Citizens\u2019 Commitment to Sustainability 2012\u201322 and the Barcelona Climate Commitment. In that respect it has become a common driver of urban policies on planning, public health, sustainability, social rights and culture. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site The Plan incorporates risk identification and management from the perspective of climate change. 150 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Biodiversity net-gain CRITERIA 3.

It is to be updated every 5\u201310 years. 3.4 Opportunities to enhance ecosystem integrity and connectivity are identified and incorporated into the NbS strategy These opportunities are identified at different points in the development of the Plan and are a common item that is continuously addressed. The development of permeable areas and corridors to link biodiversity areas is explicit in the project. Creating a general presence of green elements in the city is a main goal. With the increase in biomass, biodiversity and green cover, more urban spaces will be taken over by new green areas (rooftop gardens, green walls, etc.) and trees (Trees Master Plan). ISSUES ADDRESSED Economic feasibility CRITERIA 4. NbS are economically viable INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 4.1 The direct and indirect benefits and costs associated with the NbS, who pays and who benefits, are identified and documented The Programme for 2017\u20132030 includes a municipal activity budget for investment in greening and green space management. However, no cost-benefit analysis has been undertaken per se. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies No evidence found of cost-effectiveness study per se. The Urban Green Infrastructure Promotion Programme aims to deploy the strategy to increase and improve the green heritage and biodiversity already existing in Barcelona. The budget allocated for the maintenance and conservation of this heritage has a direct impact on the achievement of the programme. For this reason, the financial framework is proposed in accordance with the current expenditure forecast of chapter 2 of the Municipal Institute of Parks and Gardens of Barcelona and in accordance with the municipal investment proposal (PIM) for Urban Ecology for the remainder of the mandate.

This process enriches the results and also increases public awareness and the maintenance of GI. Participants included multi-level government representatives, researchers and social, environmental and private institutions. Also, in 2008, a citizens\u2019 opinion survey was carried out, which concluded that citizens associate green areas with health, freedom, nature and relaxation and provided proposals for specific interventions to increase cleanliness and security in these areas. 5.2 Participation is based on mutual respect and equality, regardless of gender, age or social status, and upholds the right of Indigenous Peoples to Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) Yes. The involvement, participation and collaboration of the general public, groups and organisations, and both public and private entities in municipal projects is made effective through a variety of instruments and consultative and participatory bodies: Citizen involvement, Citizens\u2019 Council for sustainability, Barcelona + Sustainable Network, International projects, Mobility Pact, Anti-Pollution Working Group and Working Group on Health and Noise. 5.3 Stakeholders who are directly and indirectly affected by the NbS have been identified and involved in all processes of the NbS intervention Yes, it has been done for the various processes and projects related to the Plan. 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders The Second Phase of the Plan reinforces the promotion of a new governance model, with cross-cutting work with those involved and affected (BCASA, IMPUQV, Animal Rights Directorate, ASPB, Projects, etc.), in which participation is incorporated as a tool to improve organisation and management.

BARCELONA. Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 152 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Adaptive management CRITERIA 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 7.1 An NbS strategy is established and used as a basis for regular monitoring and evaluation of the intervention The New Plan improves knowledge about green spaces and biodiversity and works through an information system which contributes to the adaptive management approach. There are a number of projects working in this direction: \u2013 Biodiversity indicators (in preparation); \u2013 Annual survey of common birds (SOCC), amphibians, butterflies, hedgehogs, bats; \u2013 Ponds: Water quality, benthic fauna and macroinvertebrates; \u2013 Study on the identification and mapping of invasive plants in the city and its surroundings; \u2013 Geolocation of orchids; \u2013 Species nurseries, aromatic spirals for pollinators; \u2013 Inventory of urban donors; \u2013 Study of the seabed and biodiversity in the Parc dels Esculls; \u2013 Monitoring the city\u2019s vegetation cover (NDVI); \u2013 Inventory of all the green spaces of the city managed by Parks and Gardens (NEV); \u2013 Studies of the ecosystem / socio-environmental services of the city\u2019s green spaces; calculation of the ecosystem services of the trees in the urban area, by the I-tree method; \u2013 Selection, description and assessment of new species for gardening with the potential to adapt to climate change; \u2013 Atlas of the nesting birds of Barcelona and Digital Atlas of Biodiversity of the city of Barcelona. 7.2 A monitoring and evaluation plan is developed and implemented throughout the intervention lifecycle Yes, and several initiatives contribute to the monitoring and evaluation of the plan\u2019s implementation- i.e. the Programme for the Promotion of Urban Green Infrastructure and the specific actions deployed within it. 7.3 A framework for iterative learning that enables adaptive management is applied throughout the intervention lifecycle Yes, see 7.1 BARCELONA. Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan ISSUES ADDRESSED Balance trade-offs CRITERIA 6. NbS equitably balance trade-offs between achievement of their primary goal(s) and the continued provision of multiple benefits INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 6.1 The potential costs and benefits of associated trade-offs of the NbS intervention are explicitly acknowledged and inform safeguards and any appropriate corrective actions This still remains a challenge in the Plan and the programmes and initiatives that support its deployment. This kind of analysis is subcontracted on demand and linked to specific interventions and not developed at the scale of Barcelona city. These studies are highly time and resource consuming. 6.2 The rights to, usage of and access to land and resources, along with the responsibilities of different stakeholders are acknowledged and respected No evidence found. 6.3 Established safeguards are periodically reviewed to ensure that mutually agreed trade-off limits are respected and do not destabilise the entire NbS No evidence found. 153 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES ISSUES ADDRESSED Mainstreaming CRITERIA 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change \u2212 Challenges. It is difficult to balance the intensive use of green space with its maintenance and conservation. City officials noted that integrating urban greenery into densely built urban environments and obtaining ownership of the required land is challenging. Developing green infrastructure is a slow process in a city of Barcelona\u2019s size. \u2212 Keys to success. Political support and willingness are essential for implementation to be successful (Hansen, 2015). Successful management of biodiversity and ecosystem services must be based on multi-scale, multi- sectoral, and multi-stakeholder involvement (Schewenius et al., 2014). Regular dialogue with urban policy makers and planners in the research process facilitates knowledge transfer (Schewenius et al., 2014). \u2212 Impact of GI.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80dd4485-89a2-4551-976e-4877bad4702b": {"__data__": {"id_": "80dd4485-89a2-4551-976e-4877bad4702b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Planning and delivering Nature-based Solutions in Mediterranean cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8deb17a4d7c045bc8b3e2ae474f705b805c1f934e8d216059dacd2f2e8de1039"}, "2": {"node_id": "d7f31cfc-e1de-4e31-b414-c60b94e7e238", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/planning-and-delivering-nature-based-solutions-mediterranean-cities", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "460ee53c5e9fb546de53d6434e9de9f3a0731002d043a4ce9fa5095e2bbc50da"}}, "hash": "e553923f525d2cb3df57f7a1388ab90b59ade5c2a8449410b8d721d6759dc2cd", "text": "\u2212 Impact of GI. GI strategies at the municipal level have only limited effects on local air quality and greenhouse gas emissions offsets but could complement other policies intended to meet air quality and climate change mitigation policy targets.

It is worth mentioning that the development of this Plan has placed Biodiversity issues within the department of legal services and urban planning \u2013 an extraordinary achievement for the city of Barcelona, and an example for other cities around the globe. GI and biodiversity are, in a sense, becoming a driver of urban policies on planning, public health, sustainability, social rights and culture. 8.3 Where relevant, NbS contribute to national and global targets for human well-being, climate change, biodiversity and human rights, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) The New Plan marks a major departure from the previous phase in the classification and management of green spaces, and it places particular focus on Biodiversity as a main goal in response to the EU Biodiversity Strategy approach and requirements. BARCELONA. Green Infrastructure and Biodiversity Plan 154 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES Slovenia Establishing connectivity in the Ljubljanica River and Green Parks Strategy The main goal of this intervention is to restore the Ljubljanica River corridor and improve the river\u2019s flow regime in the framework of the connection of two Natura 2000 sites, i.e. Ljubljansko Barje (Ljubljana Marshes) and Sava\u2013Medvode\u2013Kresnice. The project goals will be achieved through the removal of fish migration barriers, improvement of the water regime (thus restoring habitats), improvement of water infrastructure, water management and establishment of hydrological monitoring. The target fish species, whose habitats are to be improved, are Danube salmon (Hucho hucho L.), Danube roach (Rutilus pigus virgo Heckel) and striped chub (Leuciscus souffia Risso). The water regime in the Ljubljanica and its tributaries affects habitats covered by Natura 2000 and also activities related to fisheries, recreational boating, drainage/ sewerage, agriculture and, ultimately, the entire infrastructure. During low water levels excessive soil drainage and subsidence occur, deteriorating the state of the entire infrastructure. In essence, the project is multipurpose and multifunctional. Fu\u017eine Castle and the sluice gate on the Ljubljanica at Ambrose Square will be refurbished and renovated. This will enable the migration of fish, which is now severely impeded. The existing chain lift mechanism provides rather coarse control of the gate and, consequently, of flows and water levels, resulting in the sudden emptying of the river upstream. Upgrading or improving the gate will allow for a finer degree of control of the Ljubljanica\u2019s water levels, especially during low flows and droughts. This is vital since keeping the river at the right level affects the entire water regime of the Ljubljana Marshes Initially, the river engineering measures will include sealing the weir located above the railway bridge over the Ljubljanica in Zalog. ,That will mean that during dry conditions the water level will not fall and the conditions in the oxbows of the Ljubljanica upstream will improve. The engineering activities mainly focused on the river are linked to other urban projects related to the improvement of urban green spaces, improving the connectivity of the city in terms of green infrastructure by helping to creating linkages between biodiversity and culture. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: http://ksh.fgg.uni-lj.si/ljubljanicaconnects/ANG/08_photo/default.htm FINALISED SLOVENIA.

In the case of green spaces, biodiversity is also a variable that is addressed, but social development has relatively more importance since it considers cultural variables and takes into account tourism. In general, improving climate change resilience is a cross-cutting variable. 1.2 The societal challenges addressed are clearly understood and documented Several documents have been created to explicitly describe the social challenges and the way they are addressed in the different projects of the initiative. 1.3 Human well-being outcomes arising from the NbS are identified, benchmarked and periodically assessed It is recognised that nature-based solutions provide key ecosystem services to residents, both improving citizens\u2019 well-being and attracting more tourists, while at the same time improving the city\u2019s climate change resilience. No information about benchmarking or periodic evaluations has been found. ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale City-wide / District / Urban acupuncture CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems Sustainability and the transversal consideration of the projects is something that is constantly addressed in the various projects of the initiative. The framework is the Vision Ljubljana 2025, which defines the goals of the city in terms of interaction between the economy, society and ecosystems. The specific projects also take account of the interaction, giving priority, in each case, to the variables that have more relative importance depending on the type of project. 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors The integration of this intervention with other projects and programmes in the city at different levels is relevant: \u2013 At the Ljubljana city region level: The most important instrument at this level is the Regional Development Programme for the Urban Region of Ljubljana 2014\u20132020, which is a non-binding strategic document. \u2013 At the city level: The most important documents are the binding Municipal Spatial Plan and the non-binding Strategic Spatial Plan of Ljubljana. \u2013 Environmental Protection Programme 2014\u20132020, and the Sustainable Energy Action Plan to 2020. The most important change affecting the planning process in Ljubljana was the revision of the Municipal Spatial Plan in 2010, replacing a plan more than two decades old and closely following Vision2025, a long-term vision for urban development. 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site The initiative includes the removal of dams and other longitudinal barriers, which, in combination with other measures including reconnection of floodplains, oxbow lakes and other water retention bodies, can help reduce the flood risk.

Promote biodiversity in the city, increasing spatial and functional connectivity between urban and peri-urban green spaces; 2. Increase the ecosystem services in the city, enforcing urban metabolism processes closer to natural processes and decreasing the consumption of natural resources; 3. Integrate ecological and hydrological processes and flows in the urban area through adequate planning; 4. Mitigate urban heat islands, curb climate change and improve conditions and adaptation processes; increase the resilience of the territory and reduce its vulnerability; 5. Promote compatible public use of green spaces, increase leisure and recreational opportunities, increase accessibility and rural-city connections, preserve cultural heritage and traditional landscapes and extend the sense of identity and belonging; 6. Create environments that contribute to health, collective well-being and the general habitability of the city; 7. Raise awareness about the relationship between nature, biodiversity and society and about ecosystem goods and services, including their economic value; 8. Contribute to economic development through green employment. The area of Vitoria-Gasteiz is highly suitable for the provision of ecosystem services. These will be promoted through actions that facilitate future ecological connections between the places of greatest importance, and between natural spaces and urban and peri-urban green spaces. Bringing the ecological framework of the municipality to the very heart of the city is one of the goals that will be delivered through the Urban Green Infrastructure System. In its urban and peri-urban environment Vitoria-Gasteiz has many spaces and features of different types that already behave as components of an Urban Green Infrastructure System because they perform important environmental and social functions. \u00a9 IMAGE SOURCE: https://www.vitoria-gasteiz.org/wb021/http/contenidosEstaticos/adjuntos/eu/32/95/53295.pdf FINALISED VITORIA-GASTEIZ.

Among its numerous benefits are the improvement of air quality, the tempering of the urban climate and consequent reduction of the \u201curban heat island\u201d effect, the reduction of air pollution and the social and communal functions played by urban green spaces; all of these aspects are related to the general habitability of cities. Some spaces, such as community gardens, create a strong sense of community, since they allow civil society to get involved through voluntary work, helping to combat social exclusion and isolation. Other spaces have an important educational component, such as vegetable gardens, which promote the connection between local food production and consumption. In addition, urban green networks facilitate the connection of urban green areas with rural and natural areas. ISSUES ADDRESSED Design at scale City-wide / District / Urban acupuncture CRITERIA 2. Design of NbS is informed by scale INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.1 Design of NbS recognises and responds to the interactions between the economy, society and ecosystems Ecosystem Services (ES) have economic benefits as well as environmental and social ones. This interaction is reflected above all in Objective 7: \u201cRaising awareness of the relationship between nature, biodiversity and society and about ecosystem goods and services, including their economic value.\u201d In terms of spatial scale, Green Infrastructure is conceptualised as a cross- cutting intervention in the city. In this respect, Green Infrastructure not only forms a network of interconnected green spaces that are fundamental for the conservation of biodiversity, but it also produces a large number of environmental, social and economic benefits derived from the multiple functions and ecosystem services that nature provides, such as water regulation, erosion control, water purification and the mitigation of climate change, among others. Nature-based Solutions at the heart of Green Infrastructure have proven effective in this area, from both the environmental and the social and economic points of view.

Urban Green Infrastructure System INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 2.2 Design of NbS is integrated with other complementary interventions and seeks synergies across sectors This Green Infrastructure System maintains close and active links with other plans and programmes in order to share views and resources. Due to its multifunctional nature, the Vitoria-Gasteiz Urban Green Infrastructure System shares objectives with many other municipal strategies and plans, which are complementary or with which it creates synergies, among which the Biodiversity Conservation Strategy, the Plan for the Fight against Climate Change and the Climate Change Adaptation Plan especially stand out. It also has synergies with the Sustainable Mobility and Public Space Plan, the Health Plan and, of course, the General Urban Planning Plan, currently under review, which constitutes the regulatory and legal framework for the Urban Green Infrastructure System (and this plan should have the appropriate fit in the new General Urban Planning Plan to guarantee its implementation). 2.3 Design of NbS incorporates risk identification and risk management beyond the intervention site This approach is framed with the ecosystem regulation services that help promote adaptation to and mitigation of climate change (water retention, reduction of run-off and reduction of the risk of flooding), which are addressed in more detail in pilot projects. The different projects will deal with different risks and will assess the variables that are required for the characteristics of the case considered.

The available documentation contains no detailed information on the analysis of costs associated with the NbS, although it mentions that cost-benefit studies of the transformation and rewilding of green spaces will be carried out, probably linked to the pilot case studies. 4.2 A cost-effectiveness study is provided to support the choice of NbS including the likely impact of any relevant regulations and subsidies Detailed information has not been identified, nevertheless cost-benefit studies of the transformation and rewilding of green spaces are proposed. 4.3 The effectiveness of the NbS design is justified against available alternative solutions, taking into account any associated externalities An inventory of current NbS projects and potential future ones is being developed for Vitoria- Gasteiz. It includes information on the location of each project, its benefits and co-benefits in environmental, social and economic terms, and information about the reliability and viability of implementation in technical and legal terms. 4.4 NbS design considers a portfolio of resourcing options such as market-based, public sector, voluntary commitments and actions to support regulatory compliance No evidence of such specific information was found during the evaluation.

VITORIA-GASTEIZ. Urban Green Infrastructure System INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 5.4 Decision-making processes document and respond to the rights and interests of all participating and affected stakeholders The transformation process in the programme must address various objectives and consider the different sensitivities of the multiple social agents expected to participate. For this reason, since its inception, it has been regarded as an open process in which proposals and approaches are agreed upon before decisions are made. 5.5 Where the scale of the NbS extends beyond jurisdictional boundaries, mechanisms are established to enable joint decision making by the stakeholders in those jurisdictions affected by the NbS Yes, a governance framework is well established among the municipalities and the provincial and regional governments, and it has been operational since the early 1990s. ISSUES ADDRESSED Adaptive management CRITERIA 7. NbS are managed adaptively, based on evidence INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 7.1 An NbS strategy is established and used as a basis for regular monitoring and evaluation of the intervention There is a specific Knowledge, Monitoring and Assessment work stream that is devoted to the analysis and diagnosis of the ecosystem functionality of green spaces in the city and its surroundings by means of a periodic monitoring system that measures the benefits provided by the system so that the effectiveness of the measures and actions carried out can be evaluated. Based on Spain\u2019s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment project (http://www. ecomilenio.es/sobre-eme), sponsored by the Biodiversity Foundation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment and launched in 2009, this is the first analysis to be carried out on the state and trends of Spain\u2019s terrestrial and aquatic ecosystem services and their contribution to the well-being of its inhabitants. 7.2 A monitoring and evaluation plan is developed and implemented throughout the intervention lifecycle Yes, it is primarily linked to the environmental assessment procedure required by law for the approval of any plan or project. 7.3 A framework for iterative learning that enables adaptive management is applied throughout the intervention lifecycle No evidence for this specific aspect was found during the evaluation. However, Vitoria Gasteiz acknowledges the importance of the adaptive planning and management approaches in order to move towards territorial resilience and urban development, particularly in the context of climate change and the uncertainties that it implies. 166 PLANNING AND DELIVERING NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS IN MEDITERRANEAN CITIES VITORIA-GASTEIZ. Urban Green Infrastructure System ISSUES ADDRESSED Mainstreaming CRITERIA 8. NbS are sustainable and mainstreamed within an appropriate jurisdictional context INDICATORS DESCRIPTION 8.1 NbS design, implementation and lessons learnt are shared to trigger transformative change Given the innovative nature of the Green Infrastructure concept, it is considered essential to search for and analyse successful novel solutions conforming to good practice to support decision making at the local level. In this respect, collaboration arrangements with R&D entities, such as research centres, universities, knowledge networks, etc., can be invaluable. To work towards this goal, the participatory tools used in the project and the stakeholders involved create an optimum framework to promote and enhance the knowledge and benefits deriving from GI. 8.2 NbS inform and enhance facilitating policy and regulation frameworks to support their uptake and mainstreaming One of the more remarkable examples of this, considering its significance for the city, is the integration of GI in urban planning. This approach has helped to create a new paradigm in the practice of urban planning, which consists of the incorporation of ecosystem services in the functioning of the city through the inclusion of a new concept of urban infrastructure. How to accommodate the various elements of the Green Infrastructure System in urban planning documentation and legislation is still a pending issue in terms of knowledge and practice.

Acknowledgements VII North Africa is a region rich in natural and cultural heritage, characterised by high levels of species diversity and endemism. The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation (IUCN-Med) works to leverage its knowledge, stan- dards and tools to influence policy and to support action in the Mediterranean region, particularly where these measures are undertaken by IUCN Members. Better knowledge about biodiversity, including threats and conser- vation measures, will help drive action. In that context, Regional Red Lists are an important tool for scientifically assessing and communicating the status of species. They provide comprehensive information about the situation of biodiversity in the region and are an important practical mechanism for implementing national and regional strategies for biodiversity conservation under the Convention on Biological Diversity. The Red List in North Africa will help to contribute to the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, in particular to those targets which call for the prevention of extinction of known threatened species and improvement of their conservation status. Mediter- ranean Red List assessments are carried out in partnership with organisations and individuals around the region and will help to deliver these various targets. Birds of prey are key organisms for ecosystem functioning, providing several environmental services vital to hu- man well-being, such as rodent pest control, removal of dead animal remains through scavenging, and wealth generation through ecotourism. Furthermore, they are fundamental elements in the food web as apex predators and scavengers, which make them good indicators of ecosystem\u2019s health. They are thus species that can be used as flagships to encourage the protection and proper management of the territory in which they live. How- ever, they are also a group highly impacted by human activities due to competition for game prey and livestock, especially in the case of larger species such as the great eagles. For this reason they are often persecuted and their populations in many cases have come close to extinction.

This Red List is further evidence that efforts to halt biodiversity loss in the region need a major boost in the coming years to safeguard our natural capital for future generations. Antonio Troya Director IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation Foreword VIII Aim This report summarises the results of a review of the conservation status of the 36 species of birds of prey that are con- sidered to breed in North Africa according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. It identifies those species that are threatened with extinction at the regional level to guide appropriate conservation actions for improving their status. Scope All birds of prey having current or historic breeding populations in North African countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt) Conservation status assessment The conservation status of species was assessed using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria 3.1 (IUCN Species Survival Commission, 2001). The assessments followed the guidelines for application of the Categories and Criteria at regional levels 4.0 (IUCN Species Survival Commission, 2003). They were compiled by a network of 34 regional experts, reviewed during a workshop held in Tunis (Tunisia) in February 2020 and followed up through correspondence until completion. North African birds of prey There are 46 species of birds of prey within the assessment region. Of these, 10 species were excluded from this study as their distribution in the region is marginal, wintering or passage. The conservation status of the remaining 36 species was assessed and analysed. There are no species endemic to North Africa, though there are two (5.5%) possibly near-endemic species (defined as having \u226570% of their global range in the region): the Pharaoh eagle-owl Bubo ascalaphus and the sooty falcon Falco concolor. All species are typically from the Palearctic, but there are five breeding species (13.9%) with an Afrotropical origin, all of which very rare. Results Overall, 12 of the 36 breeding raptors evaluated are threatened in North Africa. Four species are classified as Near Threatened (NT), three species are assessed as Regionally Extinct (dark chanting-goshawk Melierax me- tabates, cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus and Spanish imperial eagle Aquila adalberti) and 17 species as Least Concern. The current main threats to North African birds of prey are illegal killing, illegal trade, poisoning, and death be- cause of human infrastructure such as power lines, which are reducing breeding populations. Another important threat is the use of pesticides and rodenticides in agriculture, which can have a negative impact on breeding success, reduce prey density and lead to secondary poisoning by consumption of contaminated corpses. In addition, loss of forest habitats, agroecosystems and wetlands due to the growth and spread of the human pop- ulation is another major threat to raptors in the North African region, in one way or another potentially affecting most or possibly almost all of the species present there. There is a significant lack of information on distribution, population size and trends, as well as threats, with 42 % of species with unknown population trends. There is an urgent need for collaborative research and monitoring, especially on the size and distribution of breeding populations and the specific impact of threats on them. Executive summary IX This assessment can be considered a baseline for developing conservation actions and monitoring breeding and dispersing populations in order to understand their conservation status and to determine, protect and manage potential breeding sites and key dispersal areas. Conclusions and recommendations Despite their importance as predators and scavengers and their key role in food web dynamics, the breeding populations of birds of prey in North Africa are poorly known. Current information gaps regarding population status, trends and geographical distribution reflect how little we know about them. However, this regional assess- ment has revealed that 48.5% of breeding raptors in North Africa are threatened, due to illegal killing, accidents involving power lines and wind farms, and habitat loss. It means that failure to act soon could result in the collapse of the regional populations of birds of prey, particularly vultures, all species of which are threatened.

Conclusions et recommandations Malgr\u00e9 leur importance en tant que pr\u00e9dateurs et charognards, et leur r\u00f4le cl\u00e9 dans la cha\u00eene alimentaire, les populations nicheuses d\u2019oiseaux de proie sont mal connues en Afrique du Nord. Les lacunes actuelles en mati\u00e8re d\u2019information sur l\u2019\u00e9tat de la population, les tendances et la r\u00e9partition g\u00e9ographique, refl\u00e8tent le peu de connais- sances \u00e0 leur sujet. Et pourtant, l\u2019\u00e9valuation r\u00e9gionale des rapaces nicheurs a r\u00e9v\u00e9l\u00e9 que 48,5 % des rapaces nicheurs en Afrique du Nord sont menac\u00e9s en raison d\u2019abattages ill\u00e9gaux, de collision avec des lignes \u00e9lectriques et \u00e9oliennes, et de la perte d\u2019habitat. Cela signifie que le fait de ne pas agir rapidement pourrait entra\u00eener l\u2019ef- fondrement des populations r\u00e9gionales d\u2019oiseaux de proie, en particulier dans le cas des vautours (dont toutes les esp\u00e8ces sont menac\u00e9es). Les esp\u00e8ces menac\u00e9es sont concentr\u00e9es dans la partie la plus septentrionale du Maghreb, du Maroc \u00e0 l\u2019Alg\u00e9rie, mais aussi \u00e0 Gebel Elba, dans le sud de la vall\u00e9e du Nil et au sud du Sina\u00ef en Egypte. Malgr\u00e9 le manque actuel de donn\u00e9es, les r\u00e9sultats de cette \u00e9valuation montrent que sans des mesures de conservation urgentes, la r\u00e9gion pourrait faire face \u00e0 l\u2019extinction massive d\u2019oiseaux de proie, ce qui pourrait d\u00e9stabiliser les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes \u00e0 mesure que les principales esp\u00e8ces pr\u00e9datrices disparaissent. Les mesures de conservation recommand\u00e9es pour am\u00e9liorer l\u2019\u00e9tat des esp\u00e8ces comprennent : \u279c La mise en place d\u2019un suivi des populations nicheuses dans les diff\u00e9rents pays.

Introduction This report comprises a summary of the regional conservation status of breeding birds of prey in North Africa. The IUCN Centre for Mediterranean Cooperation, in collaboration with the IUCN Species Programme and a key group of regional experts, presents the overall results and findings of the regional Red List assessment. The objective of this report is to provide the baseline status of this group of birds in the region. It includes in- formation about their distribution and natural history, and highlights those species that have been found to be of greatest conservation concern. It also reveals that very little or no information is available for a large number of species, for which more research and awareness is urgently needed. It is envisaged that the information contained within this report will facilitate the development of priority research, conservation and management actions for the region. 1.1 The assessment region The assessment region covers the whole of northern Africa bordering the Mediterranean Sea (Figure 1). The five countries of North Africa (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia) cover a total area of 5,275 million km\u00b2.

The region\u2019s ecosystems and landscapes are also remarkably diverse. Much of this territory has for centuries been subject to increasing human use of resources, particularly in the coastal areas. Figure 1. The North Africa region as defined in the current report. Map based on FAO GAUL. \u00a9 IUCN 2 The North African Region lies in the Western Palaearctic biogeographic realm and borders the Afrotropical realm to the south, which is reflected in the existence of elements of the tropical flora and fauna along its borders. It is a hot spot of endemism for both fauna and flora. Moreover, many species considered threatened at international level or that have disappeared in other parts of the world are still present. Although many types of ecosystems exist in the region, a large part of it is made up of arid or sub-arid zones with large areas of desert. The arid conditions to which much of North Africa is subjected accentuate the vul- nerability of the region\u2019s species and ecosystems, despite the adaptations to aridity shown by many animal and plant species. The region\u2019s ecosystems may be grouped into the following main categories: \u25cf Arid and sub-arid ecosystems \u25cf Steppe ecosystems \u25cf Forest ecosystems \u25cf Wetland ecosystems \u25cf Marine ecosystems Arid and sub-arid ecosystems exist in all five countries; they are located mainly in the southern part of the region, but they also exist in some of its Mediterranean coastal zones. Although their natural productivity is rel- atively low, the arid and sub-arid zones of the region are home to a wide diversity of fauna and flora with a high degree of vulnerability and they are particularly sensitive to human impacts. Steppe ecosystems, although widespread in the region, exist mainly in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, where they often form a transition be- tween hyper-arid or Saharan and humid and sub-humid environments. Forest ecosystems are present in all the North African countries apart from Egypt. In Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, mountain and/or forest areas cover appreciable areas of the territory and are the site of diversified human activities, with great dependence on natural resources and often relatively low standards of living and little basic infrastructure development. A large part of the wetlands of North Africa consists of artificial environments created by damming rivers during the last 50 years; however, there are also natural wetlands, many of which are of international importance and play a significant social and economic role at local and national level. As in many other regions, North Africa\u2019s wetlands are subject to great pressures, most of which are caused by human activities either in the wetlands themselves or in their catchment basins. Marine ecosystems constitute a significant component of the biodiversity of North African countries. All these countries face onto the Mediterranean Sea; furthermore, Morocco and Egypt have long coastlines not only on the Mediterranean but also on the Atlantic in the case of Morocco (2,500 km) and on the Red Sea in the case of Egypt (1,500 km). A great diversity of landscapes such as desert and forest ecosystems are present in North Africa.

While providing services that greatly contribute to the economic and social well-being of the populations, eco- systems in North Africa have for decades been overexploited and subject to other unsustainable forms of natural resource use and management. As a result, the status of ecosystems in the region is often reported as critical by specialists and national organisations (IUCN-Med, 2016). The economy of the North African countries is greatly dependent on natural resources, and most of the active population is employed in activities that are linked to the primary sector, such as agriculture and stock raising.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a43f514-8067-4b44-b398-7d855b24d046": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a43f514-8067-4b44-b398-7d855b24d046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ad6766034a0b5852886d0c29a623c2dcfc79b6b1947d6d7945884175ee344a13"}, "2": {"node_id": "95ac9569-6e77-45e3-9f6b-786c75d04b2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8206495e7e5328679241c9bc1ac3761a87420fd0bf5098cce02799e5cb0aa9ad"}}, "hash": "df417d426063a0e18f5fe910f97433001268ab61d817a4971470973c2c032ac7", "text": "For a long time, the agriculture sector has been neglected in the development programmes of certain countries in the region, although this sector could drive growth and development.

Ten of these species have marginal, wintering or passage distributions in the region. The remaining 36 species are breeding birds of prey belonging to three orders: Accipitriformes (22 species), Falconiformes (seven species) and Strigiformes (seven species) (Table 1). Table 1. Total number of breeding raptor species occurring in the North African region There are no species endemic to North Africa, although there are two possibly near-endemic species (defined as having \u226570% of their global range in the region): the Pharaoh eagle-owl Bubo ascalaphus and the sooty falcon Falco concolor. Many of the breeding species (16, 44.4%) are typically from the Palaearctic: 10 Accipitriformes (Spanish impe- rial eagle Aquila adalberti, Bonelli\u2019s eagle Aquila fasciata, short-toed snake-eagle Circaetus gallicus, western marsh-harrier Circus aeruginosus, Montagu's harrier Circus pygargus, red kite Milvus milvus, griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus, northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis, and Eurasian sparrow- hawk Accipiter nisus), three Falconiformes (lesser kestrel Falco naumanni, Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, and Eurasian hobby Falco subbuteo) and three Strigiformes (northern long-eared owl Asio otus, Eurasian scops- owl Otus scops, and tawny owl Strix aluco).

It is classified as Critically Endangered (CR) because it only breeds in Algeria in very small numbers. \u00a9 Andres de la Cruz The osprey breeds on the western coast of Algeria and the eastern Mediterranean coast of Morocco and along the Red Sea coast and South Sinai in Egypt. It is assessed as Endangered (EN). Together with Eleonora\u2019s falcon (Falco eleonorae), it is one of the two raptors breeding on coastal cliffs in North Africa. \u00a9 Rafa Benjumea EN CR 7 There are also five breeding species (13.9%) of Afrotropical origin, which are very rare: the tawny eagle Aquila rapax, lappet-faced vulture Torgos tracheliotos, marsh owl Asio capensis, R\u00fcppell's vulture Gyps rueppelli and dark chanting-goshawk Melierax metabates. The remaining 15 species (41.7%) have a wider global distribution. The osprey and Eleonora\u2019s falcon are the only two breeding species (5.5%) found exclusively on marine cliffs, while the rest (34 species, 94.5%) are distributed mainly inland. The long-legged buzzard Buteo rufinus deserves a special mention, since its subspecies Buteo rufinus cistenis is a common, widespread resident in North Africa, but recent studies have found that its taxonomy is not clear and it is closer to Buteo buteo than to Buteo rufinus (Jowers et al., 2019). It has been suggested it should be called the North African buzzard instead of the long-legged buzzard because of the importance of North Africa in its geographical distribution (Jowers et al., 2019; MaghrebOrnitho, 2019a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c635f83e-1234-490a-b00b-edecf10ea4ae": {"__data__": {"id_": "c635f83e-1234-490a-b00b-edecf10ea4ae", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d48c66830ae801a2f5170c944f8bc1ff0ef4f6823a1bda6125e2fda1de934fb"}, "2": {"node_id": "4560dc2b-48d4-4a61-b207-d53ae4857772", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7332a68ba4c8fc97897d04cf2247832e8b3cfc81724991b891f9aa1f453ca983"}}, "hash": "c685daf22a63898037b3300efee1e63373eb8cf5b540f2ed3046f9e70f111422", "text": "1.3 Objectives of the assessment This assessment has two main objectives: \u2022 To contribute to regional conservation planning by providing a baseline dataset describing the conservation status and distribution of North African birds of prey, and \u2022 To develop a network of regional experts to support future assessments and update the information on these species. The assessment provides two main direct outputs: \u2022 A report on the status of the breeding raptors of the North African region, including a comprehensive species list of all North African birds of prey, a Red List assessment of all the species, an identification of the main threats to each species and recommendations for the future conservation of the species and their habitats. \u2022 A database that provides a baseline for monitoring the status of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa. The data presented in this report provides a snapshot based on the knowledge available at the time of the assessment. The database will continue to be updated and made freely available. IUCN will ensure that these data are dis- seminated widely to relevant decision makers, NGOs and scientists to inform the implementation of conserva- tion actions on the ground. 8 2.

IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria are applied to individual taxon assessments (which contain information on as- pects such as ecology and life history, distribution, habitat, threats, current population trends and conservation measures), to determine their relative threat of extinction. Threatened species are listed as Critically Endangered CR , Endangered EN or Vulnerable VU . Taxa that are either close to meeting the threatened thresholds or would be threatened were it not for ongoing conservation programmes, are classified as Near Threatened NT . Taxa evaluated as having a relatively low risk of extinction are classified as Least Concern LC . Also highlight- ed within the IUCN Red List are taxa that cannot be evaluated due to insufficient knowledge, and which have therefore been assessed as Data Deficient DD . This category does not necessarily mean that the species is not threatened, only that its risk of extinction cannot be assessed from current data (IUCN 2012a). Additionally, when regional or national assessments are conducted, the IUCN Red List Regional Guidelines (IUCN 2012b) are applied, and two additional categories are used: Regionally Extinct RE and Not Applicable NA (see Figure 2). Figure 2. IUCN Red List Categories at the regional level (IUCN 2012b). For a description of each of the global IUCN Red List Categories go to: http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/categories-and-criteria/2001-categories-criteria.

The IUCN Red List of North African Raptors The extinction risk of a species can be assessed at a global, regional, or national level. A taxon can be in dif- ferent categories in the Global Red List and a Regional Red List. For instance, a species which is common worldwide and listed as Least Concern LC in the Global Red List could face a high level of threat and meet the criteria of a threatened category, for example Endangered EN , in a particular region. To avoid an over- or un- derestimation of the regional extinction risk of a species, the guidelines for application of IUCN Red List Criteria at regional level (IUCN 2012b) should be applied. Therefore, the present regional assessment examines the regional conservation status of all raptors species breeding in the North African region. The status of each species has been assessed according to the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012a) and the Guidelines for Application of IUCN Red List criteria at Regional Levels (IUCN 2012b). 2.3. Geographical scope The assessment covers the entire territory of the countries of the North Africa region that border the Mediterra- nean Sea: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt (Figure 1). 2.4 Taxonomical scope This regional assessment evaluates a total of 46 native North African species of raptors. The scope of the North Africa assessment covers only native breeding raptor species confirmed in the region, including those breeders that have become Regionally Extinct in the last 100 years: the dark chanting-goshawk, cinereous vulture and Spanish imperial eagle (Chapter 6). The last two of these species could re-colonise North Africa in the near future due to population growth in the northern Mediterranean. The list also includes 10 species that are con- sidered Not Applicable for regional assessment because their occurrence in the region is marginal or uncertain, there are no recent confirmed records or they are only wintering or migrant species (Chapter 7). Non-native species that may have established breeding populations as a result of escapes, deliberate introduc- tions or arrival on ships were not individually assessed as part of this project, in accordance with the guidelines of the IUCN Standards and Petitions Committee (2019).

CR R\u00fcppell's vulture (Gyps rueppelli) is one of the five Afrotropical raptors breeding in North Africa. It was originally distributed in the Sahel and eastern Africa, but it seems to be colonising North Africa. It is classified as Critically Endangered (CR). \u00a9 Sahara Conservation Fund 11 IUCN Red List assessments for 46 native species of raptors present in North Africa were reviewed and validated during the Tunisia workshop by the best regional experts. The status of each species was assessed according to the IUCN basic Red Listing procedures and documents, including the IUCN Red List categories and criteria (IUCN, 2012a) and the Guidelines for application of IUCN Red List criteria at regional and national levels (IUCN, 2012b). Following the workshop, the assessments were reviewed and supplementary information added from re- cent publications where appropriate; any remaining issues were resolved through communication with workshop participants. 2.6. Assessment review process Experts from North African countries as well as on some raptor species were then asked to review the species summary reports using a peer-review methodology. Their comments, together with any additional up-to-date information, were included in the assessments. Supported by relevant data sources and the scientific literature, these final regional assessments are therefore the outcome of information exchange and agreement among the numerous North African raptor specialists involved and their networks of informed colleagues.

Conservation status of North African raptors A full list of the breeding raptor species of North Africa, their regional IUCN Red List status and criteria, and a rationale is given in Table 2 and Chapters 6 and 7. The list also includes 10 species that were considered Not Applicable for regional assessment (see 2.4). The numbers and proportions of species in the various IUCN Red List Categories are presented in Table 3. Altogether, 12 species (33.3%) fall into one of the three categories (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulner- able) which are collectively regarded as \u2018threatened\u2019. Seven are Critically Endangered CR (one of them Possibly Regionally Extinct), four species are Endangered EN and one Vulnerable VU . A further four species are listed as Near Threatened NT and 17 as Least Concern LC . Three species (Dark Chanting-goshawk, Cinereous Vulture and Spanish Imperial Eagle) are Regionally Extinct.

The cinereous vulture and the Spanish imperial eagle were at the southern edge of their breeding range in North Africa, especially in Morocco, and were never very abundant.

Despite this, populations of both species are increasing in Europe, especially in Spain, and an increasing number of immature individuals are visiting Morocco (Del Moral, 2017; Morandini et al., 2019) and staying until breeding age (Godino et al., 2016; Garc\u00eda and Garrido, 2017, 2019). The Spanish imperial eagle is a regular non-breeding visitor to Morocco and Algeria, with few wintering areas in Morocco, mainly in the south but also in the east of the country (Morandini et al., 2019). There are five main temporary settlement areas in Morocco (Kenifra, Mamora, Low Draa, Missour and the western coast of Atlantic Sahara) and one in western Algeria around Tindouf (Garc\u00eda and Garrido, 2020). Therefore, there is potential for the re-establishment of a Moroccan breeding population if the main threats (electrocution, low density of prey, and human persecution and disturbance) can be mitigated. The dark chanting-goshawk is a widespread resident raptor occurring over large areas of sub-Saharan Afri- ca, which used to have isolated subpopulations of the endemic subspecies M. m. theresae in south-western Morocco. The original breeding range of the dark chanting-goshawk in North Africa included the argan forests of the Souss Valley and adjacent Anti-Atlas foothills of Morocco (Vernon et al., 2005), but now it is Regionally Extinct here with the last nesting record in 1979 (Heinze and Krott, 1979). The species was at the northern edge of its range in North Africa and was never very abundant here: it was already considered rare by Lynes (1925). In more recent years there have been only four sightings in the region of Souss but none since 2007, although it has been actively searched for many times by many experienced ornithologists (Fareh et al., 2016), which in- dicates that this species has definitely become extinct in Morocco. The species was extirpated due to changes of land use in the Souss region (P. Bergier, 2020 pers. comm.). What these three species have in common is that they nest in trees and are extremely sensitive to forest destruction and human disturbance due to the intensity of human use, resulting in the abandonment of breeding territories. 17 3.3. Threatened species Twelve species assessed in this report are threatened (33.3%), as they belong to one of the three IUCN threat categories (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable) (Tables 2 and 3, Chapter 6). The most threatened species is the red kite, which is listed as Critically Endangered (Possibly Regionally Extinct) because, after a decline in its breeding population since the end of 20th century due to poisoning, there has been no evidence of breeding since 2004. Because it nests in trees, it is affected by forest destruction and human disturbance due to the intensity of human use, resulting in the abandonment of breeding territories. Another current limiting factor to the breeding population is climate change, because Morocco is at the southern limit of the species' distribution and its breeding populations are moving to cooler northern areas. There are six other Critically Endangered species: three vultures (bearded, lappet-faced and R\u00fcppell\u00b4s), northern goshawk, tawny eagle and marsh owl. All have small breeding populations. The bearded vulture bred in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt in the past, but now the species is believed to have only two small subpopulations of fewer than 30 mature individuals in the High Atlas of Morocco and in Egypt, which have dramatically declined in recent decades because of human persecution. The lappet-faced vulture has a small population in Egypt estimated at 20\u201340 mature individuals, which is declining because of poisoning and human disturbance. It is extinct in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. The breeding population of R\u00fcppell\u2019s vulture is very small (less than 20 mature individuals in Algeria), and it seems to have colonised North Africa in the last 10 years.

It has been in continuous decline in recent decades due to forest destruction, human disturbance and nest robbery. The breeding population of tawny eagles is declining and numbers fewer than 40 mature individuals in a single subpopulation in northern Algeria, because of poaching, hunting, unintended poisoning, habitat destruction (especially of forests) and disturbance, due to an increase in the human population. Finally, the marsh owl has a small and declining population estimated at 100\u2013200 mature individuals in one subpopulation in Morocco because of the drainage and degradation of marshlands, its main suitable habitat. Significantly, three of these CR species are also tree-nesting: the lappet-faced vulture, northern goshawk and tawny eagle. Four additional species are listed as Endangered: osprey, Egyptian vulture, Montagu\u2019s harrier and Eurasian hobby. The osprey has a small population in the northern Maghreb and along the Red Sea coast (< 150 mature individuals), without any likelihood of immigration from nearby breeding sites in the Mediterranean region and with ongoing major threats (human disturbance from fishing and tourism, power lines and windfarm develop- ment). The Egyptian vulture still has a significant breeding population (750 pairs) from Morocco to Egypt, with three separate subpopulations: a Maghreb subpopulation, including Mediterranean breeding populations in Morocco, northern Algeria, Tunisia and northern Libya; a desert subpopulation in south-eastern Algeria and Libya, which is more closely related to the Afrotropical population than to the Mediterranean one; and an Egyp- tian subpopulation, isolated from the Mediterranean and desert subpopulations and more closely related to the Arabian subpopulation. However, the species has declined by 50\u201379% over three generations (53 years) due mainly to poisoning, except in Algeria. Montagu\u2019s harrier occurs on the north-western coast and plains of east- ern Morocco and north-western Algeria, with a small population of less than 105 breeding pairs that is declining because of the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land. The Eurasian hobby is a local tree-nesting breeder in forests in the northern half of the Maghreb, with an estimated 1,000\u20132,000 mature individuals, but all in one declining subpopulation threatened by degradation of open wooded areas. One native breeding raptor species is listed as Vulnerable in the region: the griffon vulture, which currently breeds only in Algeria although an increasing number of individuals are immigrating from Europe to North Af- rica. This species is extinct in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco due to human persecution and the decline of wild ungulates as food. 19 3.4. Near Threatened species Overall, four species were assessed as Near Threatened (NT) (Tables 2 and 3, Chapter 6), reflecting concern that they are close to qualifying for a threatened category and could do so in the near future. It is essential that these species are monitored closely and, where possible, management action should be taken to avoid them becoming listed as threatened in the future. One of them is a near-endemic species (with \u226570% of its global range in the region), the sooty falcon, which occurs sparsely in Libya and Egypt. It has suffered from the collec- tion of nestlings for falconry, and illegal killing may also affect the remaining population. The short-toed snake eagle occurs over a wide range in three subpopulations, with 98% of individuals in the Maghreb subpopulation. The loss of nesting sites due to logging (it nests in trees) as well as disturbance seem to be the main threats. The western marsh-harrier has a wide range in marshes and reedbed wetlands in the northern Maghreb, in a single subpopulation. Potential threats include wetland desiccation and drainage. Lastly, Eleonora's falcon currently has a growing breeding population of more than 2,200 pairs, but they are restricted to 10 islands and cliff sites in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, some of them highly dependent on conservation actions, especially access restrictions to breeding colonies, and the population could decrease drastically if these actions were to stop. Though Eleonora\u2019s falcon (Falco eleonorae) has a growing breeding population in North Africa, it is restricted to a few islands and cliffs in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia and is highly dependent on conservation actions, especially access restrictions to breeding colonies; it is listed as Near Threatened.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66da36d1-0214-4d30-85cd-a9e6821ec376": {"__data__": {"id_": "66da36d1-0214-4d30-85cd-a9e6821ec376", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7d4fefb1c1c3c211883bd9ceb1f3fd07e9337e945437d862d8a8f75f360c69a"}, "2": {"node_id": "1acbf556-89a7-4dcd-b650-8d3c1878a8b6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06ea473eb5845d9e289e3bbbc8e3d08e4b66d03dd34d7295066e01c9d5001c41"}}, "hash": "e1ce57dea064adf8e78285368d21c305334abc3dc3016f8204eab77aa7fb9c55", "text": "\u00a9 Daniel Bur\u00f3n NT 20 3.5.

This subspecies has very recently been treated as a separate species on the global Red List (BirdLife International, 2020a), and so any future regional Red Lists should assess these subspecies separately, and it is likely that the yellow-billed kite will be classed as regionally threatened. 3.6. Patterns of species richness The North African breeding birds of prey assessed show a non-homogeneous geographical distribution. Most species are distributed in the forests and steppes of the northern Maghreb, mainly from Morocco to Tunisia but also in north-eastern Libya, coinciding with the area of greatest Mediterranean influence and the southern limit of distribution for most of the Western Palaearctic species (Figure 4). It is also the area most densely populated by humans. Only Bonelli's eagle and Eleonora's falcon are found further south in Morocco. Bonelli's eagle is the most abundant large eagle in North Africa, and it is a characteristic raptor of Mediterranean environments. It is well established in the Maghreb, including the northern Sahara, with a few pairs breeding in the eastern Red Sea mountains and southern Sinai in Egypt. Eleonora\u2019s falcon breeds in colonies on islands around the Mediterranean Sea and along the north-west coast of Africa in the middle of Morocco. Other important areas are located in the Sahara desert, including the Ahaggar mountains and Tassili n'Ajjer pla- teau in southern Algeria; the Tibesti mountains, granite mountains and oasis of Kufra in south-eastern Libya; and the Nile delta and valley, Sinai\u2013Red Sea mountains and Gebel Elba in Egypt. The spatial distribution of threatened birds of prey species has a similar pattern (Figure 5), with most of the threat- ened species concentrated in the northernmost part of the Maghreb, in particular the Tingitana Peninsula in Morocco and the Mediterranean forests of Algeria, but also in Gebel Elba, the southern Nile Valley and southern Sinai in Egypt. Other areas with some threatened species occur along the coast from the Atlantic Sahara in Mo- rocco to the Red Sea coast in Egypt, the whole Nile valley and some desert areas between Algeria and Morocco, southern Algeria and south-eastern Libya. It should be noted that the North Africa region hosts five species of breeding vultures (lappet-faced, bearded, Egyptian, griffon and R\u00fcppell's), all of them threatened at regional level, with very small populations in all countries except Algeria. This country has the last breeding population of the tawny eagle, the only breeding populations of the griffon and R\u00fcppell's vultures in the region and an apparently large population of Egyptian vultures, suggest- ing that it could act as a source of individuals for these three species to recolonise the region. 21 Figure 4.

Summary of threats to all native species assessed in the North African region. The whole region of North Africa faces the problem of raptor poaching for illegal trade (Emile et al., 2014; Brochet et al., 2016; MaghrebOrnitho, 2020).

Algeria appears to be the only country where this threat did not affect breeding populations, so it is where the greatest diversity of birds of prey exists and it is the last refuge for many of the species, especially the Egyptian vulture and tawny eagle. Another important threat is the use of pesticides and rodenticides in agriculture, which can have a negative impact on breeding success, reduce prey density and cause secondary poisoning through consumption of Residential & commercial development - Commercial & industrial areas Residential & commercial development - Tourism & recreation areas Biological resource use - Fishing & harvesting aquatic resources Natural system modifications - Other ecosystem modifications Pollution - Garbage & solid waste Climate change & severe weather - Other impacts Inbreeding Invasive & other problematic species & genes - Invasive non-native/alien species Natural system modifications - Fire & fire suppression Residential & commercial development - Housing & urban areas Agriculture & aquaculture - Wood & pulp plantations Natural system modifications - Dams & water management/use Human intrusions & disturbance - Work & other activities Invasive & other problematic species & genes - Problematic native species Transportation & service corridors - Roads & railroads Agriculture & aquaculture - Livestock farming & ranching Biological resource use - Logging & wood harvesting Human intrusions & disturbance - Recreational activities Agriculture & aquaculture - Annual & perennial non-timber crops Energy production & mining - Renewable energy Transportation & service corridors - Utility & service lines Pollution - Agricultural & forestry effluents Biological resource use - Hunting & trapping terrestrial animals 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Threatened LC, NT RE 23 poisoned corpses. Internationally banned organochlorine pesticides are locally available, poisoning animals and polluting soils and water (Garrido et al. 2014). Cases of poisoning at rubbish dumps have been found in some scavenger species. Nevertheless, these places are key feeding habitats when they are properly managed (JMM and Associates, 2015). Additionally, veterinary application of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac, which has caused the near-extinction of several Gyps vultures in India, may have a negative impact on vulture species in this region too. Habitat destruction and disturbance, especially of forests due to the use of wood as fuel for cooking and heating and the felling of large trees to clear land for crops and livestock are also an important threat. This especially affects raptors that nest in trees and may lead them to abandon their breeding territories (Stuart and Collar, 1988; Garrido et al., 2005; Vernon et al., 2005; Fellous, 2017; Teller\u00eda et al., 2019). This could be the reason why Bonelli\u2019s and golden eagles have apparently stopped nesting in trees in Morocco (Cuzin, 2019). The conversion of grasslands to agricultural land is the main threat to Montagu\u2019s harrier and the marsh owl. These species are also affected by disturbance from farmers and pastoralists, and from birders in the case of the marsh owl. Finally, vultures and other scavenger species can be affected by food scarcity. Though livestock is very abundant, local traditions such as burying domestic ungulate carcasses decrease food resources for these species, especially in Morocco (Garrido et al., 2014; Allaoui and Cherkaoui, 2018). The expansion of the electric power network during the last 50 years has caused an increase in electrocutions on power lines (Garrido, 2019) (Box 1).

The data collected on the impact of power lines on birds, in particular raptors, revealed that power lines are a significant threat for several Regionally Extinct and threatened species, such as the Spanish imperial eagle and the griffon, Egyp- tian and R\u00fcppell\u2019s vultures (Chapter 6). Power lines may therefore be limiting the survival and population recovery of threatened species such as red kites and vultures, and they may also be reducing the chances of the Spanish imperial eagle recol- onising Morocco. Governments, companies, financial institutions and other stakeholders must ensure that existing and planned energy infrastructure that is harmful to birds is identified and subject to urgent remediation. A practical guide to the identification and prevention of dangerous power lines for birds in the Maghreb region (Mart\u00edn Mart\u00edn et al., 2019) is freely available through the IUCN library system. To improve bird habitats and minimise or eliminate deaths of priority bird species from these causes, the Safe Flyways project (https://mava-foundation.org/oaps/reducing-mortality-of-migratory-birds- and-vultures/) operates in the Mediterranean region developing research to support action and influ- ence policies and strategies, raising awareness amongst stakeholders about priority issues, develop- ing the capacity of local authorities and civil society to play an active role at national level, advocating the establishment of national policies and legislation, and implementing local activities to minimise threats in the most problematic localities. the rest of North Africa as well, due to the lack of policies to retrofit power lines. This threat affects breeding and wintering populations of eagles, falcons, long-legged buzzards, vultures and owls (Godino et al., 2016; UICN and DEF, 2020). Dangerous power lines may also limit the possibility of re-colonisation by Spanish imperial eagles (Morandini et al., 2019) and the survival of red kites (Radi et al., 2020) in Morocco. Collisions with vehicles cause mortality to most owls, kites and long-legged buzzards when they approach roads to feed on roadkill. Additionally, almost all species of diurnal breeding raptors are highly vulnerable to wind farm developments. The increasing number of massive wind energy projects in the migratory corridors of northern Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt could pose a huge threat to migrant and dispersing threatened species such as Spanish imperial eagles, griffon, cinereous, Egyptian and R\u00fcppell\u2019s vultures, Montagu\u2019s harriers, red kites and Eurasian hobbies. Similarly, the conversion of large eagles\u2019 feeding habitats to solar farms may also be an important potential threat. Genetic erosion through inbreeding is a significant threat to the bearded vulture, tawny eagle, northern goshawk and marsh owl. 25 4. Conservation actions Landscapes of natural and agricultural habitats in the North African region are facing major losses of birds of prey due to illegal killing, illegal trade, mortality caused by human infrastructures and poisoning, and habitat loss especially of forests and wetlands. Some conservation measures are in place for either species or ecosystems (Chapter 6), but they need to be reinforced and effectively implemented to preserve and recover raptor populations. Their protection status varies from one country to another, and there is an urgent need to implement conservation actions. 4.1. International instruments potentially relevant to the conservation and management of North African birds of prey North African countries are signatories to a number of important treaties, conventions, agreements and regional instruments aimed at conserving biodiversity. The following are the most relevant to the conservation and man- agement of birds of prey. Currently, all birds of prey are legally protected and listed in the appendices of interna- tional conventions (Table 5). More efforts are therefore needed to implement them more effectively. CITES \u2013 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is an interna- tional agreement between governments that aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.

Two of them are tasked with reducing some of the main threats to birds of prey in North Africa: - The Intergovernmental Task Force on Illegal Killing, Taking and Trade of Migratory Birds (MIKT) is intended to facilitate international cooperation and the implementation of existing guidelines and action plans for the eradi- cation of illegal killing, trapping and trade of wild birds. All the countries of North Africa are members of this Task Force and responsible for the implementation of the agreed plans in their territories. - The Energy Task Force is a multi-stakeholder initiative which works towards reconciling renewable energy de- velopments with conservation of migratory species by avoiding and minimising the negative impacts of energy developments on migratory species. Only two North African countries, Morocco and Egypt, are members of the Task Force. Given the known impacts of energy infrastructure on birds of prey, it would be advisable for the other North African countries to join as members and work to apply best practices to avoid bird collisions with and electrocutions on power lines and collisions with wind farms. The growth of electrification in North Africa has increased the number of dangerous power lines for raptors resulting in deaths by collision with wires and, especially, electrocution on poles.

Conclusions and recommendations This report represents the first regional IUCN Red List assessment of the breeding birds of prey in North Africa. Thirty-six of the 46 species occurring in the North African countries have breeding populations in the region, but 12 of them are threatened with extinction and 3 are considered extinct in the region. Threatened species are concentrated in the northernmost part of the Maghreb, in particular the Tingitana Peninsula in Morocco and the Mediterranean forests of Algeria, and in the Gebel Elba mountains, southern Nile Valley and southern Sinai in Egypt. There is a significant lack of data on population status and trends for most of the species, highlighting the need to regard census programmes as priorities for research and funding. The outputs of this assessment can be used to inform conservation measures for individual species and suites of species. They can also be applied at the regional scale to assist governments and organisations, such as IUCN, in identifying important sites for conservation, including Key Biodiversity Areas, at national or regional scales. To improve the conservation status of north African raptors urgent conservation measures are needed. In particular: \u279c Breeding and wintering populations of raptors, especially of threatened species, need to be surveyed and monitored to determine, protect and manage existing and potential breeding areas. Only regular counts can provide the data required to follow up raptor populations in detail. \u279c Satellite tracking of birds of prey should be carried out to locate key breeding, dispersal and wintering areas and to identify causes of unnatural mortality and other threats in order to reduce them. \u279c National and international legislation should be fully implemented and revised to protect the threatened species identified in this assessment and their habitats. \u279c Species/habitat action plans should be drawn up for the most threatened species to enable their popu- lations to recover to the point where they can be downlisted in the regional Red List. The provision of feeding stations is ben R\u00fcppell\u2019s Vultures. Feeding Station at The provision of feeding stations can help restore breeding populations of scavenger species such griffon and R\u00fcppell\u2019s vultures. Feeding station in northern Morocco. \u00a9 Rachid El Khamlichi 29 \u279c The strong regional cooperation between experts must continue and new cooperation efforts must be initiated with experts from countries where information is scarce, so that the work carried out to produce this first evaluation of the conservation status of native North African raptors can be updated as new information becomes available. \u279c Links between IUCN and its partners and decision and policy makers must be maintained and strength- ened, and the data must be made freely available to all individuals and organisations. \u279c Important nesting areas need to be identified and protected and human disturbance around nest sites must be avoided, especially in the case of tree-breeding species. Appropriate management of wood- lands should maintain old trees, prevent fires and mitigate the impact of road construction. \u279c Wide-scale habitat conservation measures are required, including the maintenance of low-intensity farming with the preservation of hedges and careful management of pesticides. Any unavoidable affor- estation or deforestation should occur outside the breeding season and should only result in partial, not total, habitat change. \u279c Raptors need to be effectively protected in breeding and wintering areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes the carrion of domestic animals).

North Africa Raptor Red List Extant & Vagrant (passage) Cinereous vulture, Aegypius monachus - (Linnaeus, 1766) POPULATION SIZE AOO EOO TREND - - - - NORTH AFRICA REGIONAL ASSESSMENT: REGIONALLY EXTINCT (RE) This species is listed as Regionally Extinct in North Africa because there is no evidence of breeding for the last 80 years. However, movements of Span- ish birds through Morocco every year indicate it could recolonise Morocco due to an increase in the Iberian population, as long as management measures are adopted to mitigate the impact of threats such as electrocution and disturbance. A possible reintroduction programme should also be considered. DISTRIBUTION The original breeding range of the species included Morocco and Egypt, but it was extirpated during the 20th century and now it is a rare migrant to Mo- rocco and north-eastern Egypt (mainly dispersing juveniles) (Raw, 1921; Goodman and Meininger, 1989; Andevski, 2017; Andevski et al., 2017; Clark and Davies, 2018). The species probably bred until the 1930s in northern Morocco (southern Tangier, Central Plateau and Middle Atlas) (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003) and in the Nile Valley in Egypt (Goodman and Meininger, 1989). It was also sighted in Algeria in the 19th century but it could have been confused with the lappet-faced vulture (Isenmann and Moali, 2000). The species was at the southern edge of its range in North Africa and it was never very abun- dant. Vagrant individuals coming from Europe have been sighted in Tunisia (Isenmann et al., 2005), passing through Algeria (Andevski et al., 2017) and even into Mauritania and Mali (GREFA, 2020; F. L\u00f6rcher pers. comm.). It is a regular non-breeding visitor in Morocco, passing on to more southern countries (MaghrebOrnitho, 2018c). 6.

REGIONALLY EXTINCT RE RE 31 POPULATION The North African population of the species is likely to have survived because of immigration from the larger Spanish population, but its decline during the 20th century was too strong. Nowadays, populations are increasing in Europe, especially in Spain, where there are at least 2,550 breeding pairs (Del Moral, 2017), and since 2003 individuals have been regularly recorded crossing the Strait of Gibraltar \u2013 mainly juveniles (El Khamlichi, 2016, 2017; MagrhebOrnitho, 2017, 2018a), but also older birds (MagrhebOrnitho, 2018b). Therefore, there is a potential for the re-establishment of a Moroccan breeding population if threats disappear. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY The cinereous vulture used to breed in trees at low altitudes in North Africa (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Clark and Da- vies, 2018) in sparsely inhabited forested areas similar to its Iberian habitats. The species is a partial migrant (Bild- stein, 2006), and sedentary in some areas, but many individuals winter south of the breeding range and there is a considerable degree of nomadism. In Europe, the adults are mostly sedentary while the juvenile birds disperse over larger areas (Andevski, 2017).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0c5e6e2-fe53-414a-a745-26b0174b9df2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0c5e6e2-fe53-414a-a745-26b0174b9df2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a90064983a2cf44897fdec42e3ffcf9fbb44ef98822ce5362ed0695cfcd5481d"}, "2": {"node_id": "6e2071ad-40c2-4715-a463-5d578a392350", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0380f082ff5a11bd584034996b7329a52acf551416a1e424ff6db4adff8f92f"}}, "hash": "35ebdf4b29b082902a0b706268023f8c13821cf9f7faa199bc9ddc401b26d54e", "text": "Currently, a few birds \u2013 probably only a few dozen annually \u2013 visit Morocco and reach as far south as West Africa (MaghrebOrnitho, 2018c).

Additionally, although livestock are very abundant, local traditions such as burying domestic ungulate carcasses decrease food availability for scavengers, especially in Morocco (Garrido et al., 2014; Allaoui and Cherckaoui, 2018). Felling trees to clear land for agriculture and disturbance due to the intensive use of forests for timber extraction pose a particular threat to tree-nesting raptors (such as the cinereous vulture) and can lead them to abandon their breeding territories (Margalida et al., 2011). In the Middle East, Andevski (2017) indicates other threats: poisoning at dump sites because of the lack of waste management, hunting, poaching and collisions with wind turbines and power lines. Another threat is likely to be electrocution on energy infrastructure as in other areas of its range (Shimelis et al., 2005). CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CITES Appendix II, CMS Appendix II. Included in a multi-species action plan for African\u2013Eurasian vultures (Botha et al., 2017). There are some initiatives to build feeding stations, rescue and release sick and injured wild individuals, and tag vultures (including attaching GPS loggers) in Morocco (R. El Khamlichi, pers. comm., 2019; K. Rousselon, pers. comm., 2020). Conservation actions needed: Non-intensive livestock management systems should be maintained to ensure a food supply; feeding stations could be beneficial when food is scarce. Reintroduction has been successful in parts of its range (Botha et al., 2017). Effectively managed open landfill sites could be key feeding habitats (JMM and As- sociates, 2015). The ban on poisoned carcasses should be enforced and the leaving of dead animals encouraged. Surveys of the migrant European population should be conducted to determine, protect, and manage potential breeding sites and the key dispersal area. Diclofenac and other harmful NSAIDs should be controlled. Legislation regulating the trade in pesticides used to poison meat baits should be strengthened and enforced.

How- ever, it could recolonise Morocco either naturally through an increase in the Iberian population or via a possible reintroduction programme, provided that management measures are adopted to mitigate the impact of threats such as electrocution and disturbance. DISTRIBUTION Most of the population of this eagle breeds in Spain, with a small but increasing population in Portugal. The orig- inal breeding range of the species included the Iberian Peninsula, northern Morocco and Algeria. The species bred in northern Morocco (Tangier Peninsula, northern Rharb, Mamora Forest, Za\u00ebr, Western Middle Atlas and Rif) until the first half of the 20th century, with only three breeding records later in 1977, 1991 and 1995 in the Rif Mountains (Fouarge, 1992; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). It was also cited as a breeder in Algeria in the 19th century (Isenmann and Moali, 2000). The species was sighted in the second half of 20th century in western and northern Algeria and Libya (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2016; Morandini et al., 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "229d5471-211c-465b-90cc-7bc687926b91": {"__data__": {"id_": "229d5471-211c-465b-90cc-7bc687926b91", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e369a078c02f7b0c0569ffc120d5506174649b9770237a2f06fc28c6918a4040"}, "2": {"node_id": "6df50021-e40d-43be-b59f-7d8a622dfd2a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db2054666b9cf1ad1eb7d6a0bbf71c652a2c726e544199f23ca2fb1c6c0b39c2"}}, "hash": "f3c1aa7bc91c2f65835fd341796c07aa8d934a04c9084d185e9b0a936082689b", "text": "The species was at the southern edge of its range in North Africa, and survived here thanks to immigrants from the larger Spanish population (Ferrer, 2001), although it was never very abundant in this region (Teller\u00eda et al., 2019).

Young Spanish imperial eagles have been visiting Morocco since 2000 and wintering in the Guelmin/Tan-Tan region because of the high periodic abundance of prey, such as fat sand rats (Psammomys obesus) (Bergier et al., 2017; Garrido, 2019). Several dozen juveniles are observed each year crossing the Strait of Gibraltar and this number is increasing (A. Onrubia, pers. comm.). In 2016\u201319, tagged Spanish imperial eagles with GPS\u2013GSM transmitters from southern Spain moved throughout Morocco, including the north, the Middle and High Atlas, the Anti-Atlas, the Atlantic coast, the Sahara and the eastern provinces, and even into western Algeria and Mauritania (Morandini et al., 2016, 2019; Garc\u00eda and Garrido, 2017, 2019; Spanish Imperial Eagle Action Plan of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, pers. comm.). Although most of the eagles returned to Spain in less than a year, there are data showing individuals staying in Morocco for two and three years, until breeding age (Godino et al., 2016; Garc\u00eda and Garrido, 2017, 2019). As a result of the population increase in Andalusia and the Iberian Peninsula an increasing number of im- mature Spanish imperial eagles are visiting Morocco, so there is a chance that a Moroccan breeding population may become re-established (Morandini et al., 2019). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY This species used to breed in large, tall trees in forested plains and hills in North Africa, including in open cork oak woodlands surrounding lowland marshes (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). These sparsely populated Mediterranean for- ests were similar to the species\u2019 current Iberian habitat. In Spain, tree height and distance from human activities are the most important variables that explain nest site selection (Bisson et al., 2002), but many recently colonised territories are located in human-modified habitats, especially farmlands with high rabbit abundance (Gonz\u00e1lez and Oria, 2004; Casta\u00f1o, 2005; Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2006; Margalida et al., 2007; Garc\u00eda and Garrido, 2019). Breeding birds are sedentary, but immature birds are nomadic, dispersing in Morocco and Algeria through open feeding areas (Moroccan Sahara, eastern Morocco, forest hunting reserves in western Morocco, and the Parc Culturel de l'Atlas Saharien in eastern Algeria) where eagles find sufficient prey, including fat sand rats, Barbary ground squirrels, partridges and large lizards (Morandini et al., 2016, 2019; Fellous, 2017; Garc\u00eda and Garrido, 2017, 2019). There are several main temporary settlement areas in Morocco and Algeria (Morandini et al., 2019). The small number of settlement events in North Africa may be due to the difficulty of finding optimal food patches because of the absence of the eagles\u2019 usual prey (rabbits) and the irregularity of possible alternative prey, such as small rodents of arid zones that have demographic explosions associated with periods of seasonal rains (Morandini et al., 2019; Spanish Imperial Eagle Action Plan of Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, pers. comm.). This irregular, seasonal distribution of alterna- tive prey may have led the birds to disperse over greater areas to find food and to move longer distances during exploratory forays, resulting in greater dispersion in their tem- porary settlements in North Africa (Moran- dini et al., 2019). \u00a9 IUCN Distribution range of the Spanish imperial eagle, Aquila adalberti - Brehm, 1861 in North Africa.

Unintended poisoning, even resulting from Moroccan government measures, was the main reason for the extir- pation of raptors, including Spanish imperial eagles, in the 20th century. The poison was introduced into the envi- ronment to target livestock predators such as jackals, wolves, feral dogs or leopards. However, this threat seems to be less important today (Garrido et al., 2014). In Morocco tagging of large eagles (Spanish imperial, golden and Bonell\u00ed's eagles) with GPS loggers is showing they are being shot and hunted (K. Rousselon, pers. obs.). The increase and spread of the human population has also led to habitat destruction and disturbance (Stuart and Collar, 1988; Garrido et al., 2005; Vernon et al., 2005; Fellous, 2017; Teller\u00eda et al., 2019), especially in forests due to the use of wood as fuel for cooking and heating and the felling of large trees to clear land for crops and livestock. Forest destruction and human disturbance due to intense human use especially threatens tree-nesting raptors like the Spanish imperial eagle, leading them to abandon their breeding territories. Human population growth caused a decline of wild ungulates and other prey because these animals were hunted to feed people. Other anthropogenic threats are fragmentation of habitats due to the increase of road networks, buildings, dams, power lines, etc. (BirdLife International, 2018a). Similarly, the increasing number of massive wind energy projects in northern Morocco could kill Spanish imperial eagles crossing the Strait of Gibraltar. CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CITES Appendix I. CMS Appendices I and II. There are some initiatives to res- cue and release sick and injured wild individuals and to tag eagles (including attaching GPS loggers) in Morocco (K. Rousselon, pers. comm., 2019). Conservation actions needed: Efforts are needed to increase awareness about biodiversity conservation. Ac- tions to reduce mortality, particularly from electrocution, should include establishing priority areas for power line mitigation work, modifying dangerous power lines, and avoiding the construction of wind farms in key areas for the species. Additionally, new power lines should be constructed using only safe designs, and similar legislation should be in place for fixing existing dangerous power lines. Also a species reintroduction programme could ac- celerate any eventual successful recolonisation. Finally, surveys are required of the Iberian dispersing population to determine, protect and manage potential breeding sites and the key dispersal area.

Intense human use of forests especially threatens tree-nesting raptors like the dark chanting-goshawk, leading them to abandon their breeding territories.

Sighting records from Morocco between 1985 and 2020 show the population in the region has potentially been in continuous decline for the last 21 years (3 generations). Threats such as forest destruc- tion, human disturbance and nest robbery are still ongoing and have a major impact on nest abandonment. The species is listed as Critically Endangered (CR C2a(i,ii); D) based on the small number of mature individuals, the distribution in a single subpopulation and the low probability of immigration from other subpopulations. DISTRIBUTION The northern goshawk is predominantly a wintering bird from Europe, and North Africa marks the southern limit of its distribution. An increasing population has been observed in Europe but it is a very rare and local breeder in northern Morocco, where its distribution has been reduced drastically since the 1980s (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Clark and Davies, 2018; Cuzin, 2019). Currently, the species seems to be confined to the Tangier region, in refor- estation forests of pines and Eucalyptus (Cuzin, 2019), but it used to inhabit forests up to ca. 2,000 m, mainly of oak (Quercus suber and Q. faginea) in the Rif (Maes, 1978), but it has nested in Pinus halepensis and mixed Atlas Cedar and oak forests in the Middle Atlas (Go-South, 2016). It is possible that breeding still occurs in northern Al- geria and Tunisia (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005; Azafzaf et al., 2015), but there have been no recent observations. Migrant and wintering birds visit Egypt, along the River Nile and in the Red Sea Mountains (Clark and Davies, 2018), and eastern Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016; S. Buirzayqah, pers. obs.). CR \u00a9 Manuel Talavera 38 POPULATION Th\u00e9venot et al. (2003) estimated no more than 100 breeding pairs in Morocco in 1985, but Cuzin (2019) only found 6 breeding pairs.

In Libya, the species is observed from October to April (S. Buirzayqah, pers. obs.), while sightings during the migration period in Tunisia come from March to May (H. Azafzaf, pers. obs.). Individuals prey on small to large birds and mammals (del Hoyo et al., 1994; Clark and Davies, 2018). Northern goshawks build nests high in tall trees, usually in extensive forests (Clark and Davies, 2018), and breed from February to June (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). They used to breed in oak (Quercus suber and Q. faginea) forests in the Moroccan Rif (Maes, 1978) and in Pinus halepensis and mixed Atlas Cedar and oak forests in the Middle Atlas, also in Morocco (Go-South, 2016), but today it only uses pine and Eucalyptus forests (Cuzin, 2019). Two nests found by Maes (1978) were placed 10\u201312 m above the ground in Quercus faginea. Usually only three eggs are laid in Morocco (Maes, 1978; Go-south, 2016). THREATS The increase and spread of the human population is causing habitat destruction and disturbance especially in forests because of the use of wood as fuel for cooking and heating; felling trees to clear land for crops and pas- ture is an additional threat factor (Bergier, 1987; Stuart and Collar, 1988; Garrido et al., 2005; Vernon et al., 2005; Cherkaoui et al., 2009). Forest destruction and human disturbance due to intense human use especially threatens tree-nesting raptors like the northern goshawk (Cuzin, 2019), leading them to abandon their breeding territories. Habitat fragmentation results from forest fires and road construction as well. Persecution continues to be a threat, as well as nest robbery for falconry (Orta and Marks, 2014; Brochet et al., 2016; Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat). The species is also high- ly vulnerable to the impacts of wind farm developments (STRIX, 2012). The recent development of power lines is also a threat (Cuzin, 2019).

Source: The IUCN Red List of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa. 39 Endemic Conservation and research actions needed: Wide-scale habitat conservation measures are required, in- cluding the maintenance of low-intensity farming with the preservation of hedges and a reduction in pesticide use. Appropriate management of woodlands should maintain old trees, prevent fires and limit road construction. Any unavoidable afforestation or deforestation should occur outside the breeding season and should only result in partial habitat change. Population monitoring should be conducted to provide data about the population size and trend and to determine, protect and manage breeding sites and key migration areas. In view of the multiple threats, monitoring of the North African population is crucial to track how it is being affected. Research is also needed on the impact of certain specific threats (e.g. trade), and can be used to help develop an action plan.

There is no evidence of immigration from other breeding populations. Further- more, the species is also threatened in sub-Saharan countries. For these reasons the species is listed as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(i,ii) and D. DISTRIBUTION The tawny eagle is a widespread raptor occurring over large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, with an isolated sub- population in North Africa. The original breeding range of the species in this region included Morocco, northern Algeria and Tunisia. The species bred throughout Morocco, from the Tangier Peninsula to the Sahara through Souss and the western Middle Atlas, until the first half of the 20th century (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). Since then, there have been only a small number of breeding records in Souss in 1980, 1981, 1990 and 1992 (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003).

(F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). The last nine mentions of the species (out of 29 received) accepted by the CHM (Morocco Rare Birds Approval Committee) are from 2006, at the Oued Massa estuary and in the Tan Tan region (northern Moroccan Sahara). Since then, all the reported observations of this species have been rejected: in every case a photograph revealed the bird to be a Spanish imperial eagle, since the two species are easy to confuse because of their similarities, at least at juvenile age (F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). The last known nests were in argan trees in open areas of the Souss, CR \u00a9 Leovigildo Flox 41 western High Atlas and Anti-Atlas in 1992 (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). In the Souss area, the species was extirpated due to rapid destruction of the argan forest (Bergier, 1987; Cherkaoui et al., 2009). In Algeria, the species used to be common but the last known breeding pair was recorded in 1990 (Isenmann and Moali, 2000). However, there were a few more recent sightings in northern Algeria in 2018, and the species might still be breeding in some isolated places, including the Monts des Ksour in the Parc Culturel de l\u2019Atlas Sa- harien, where it has been sighted a few times, and recently in the Oum El Bouari (north-eastern Algeria) where pictures were taken by Harzallah in 2018 and published in a magazine (per A. Fellous-Djardini and M. Saheb). In Tunisia, the population was apparently extirpated during the first half of the 20th century and there have been no records since 1988 (Isenmann et al., 2005; eBird, 2020). Finally, there is some evidence of vagrant individuals from sub-Saharan populations in the Moroccan Sahara (MaghrebOrnitho, 2018d) and in Egypt, most recently in May 2015 (OSME, 2019; A. Riad, pers. obs.). POPULATION Th\u00e9venot et al. (2003) and El Agbani and Qninba (2011) estimated there were a few dozen breeding pairs in Moroc- co, but Bergier et al. (2017) and F. Cuzin (pers. comm.) suggested that the species could be extinct, except maybe in the Atlantic Sahara. Due to the lack of recent breeding observations it can be assumed that the species is nearly extinct in the country (with less than 10 breeding pairs) (per F. Cuzin). In Algeria, there have been very few sightings of the species, though some of them are quite recent from 2017 and 2018 (Fellous, 2017; MaghrebOrnitho, 2018d). Although there are no monitoring data for this species, it is inferred that the country might host up to 10 breeding pairs (A. Fellous-Djardini, pers. obs.). Therefore, the overall population size for North Africa is thought to be a maxi- mum of 20 breeding pairs or 40 mature individuals (F. Cuzin, A. Fellous-Djardini, P. Bergier, pers. obs.). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY The tawny eagle is resident and occurs in discrete populations. It is sedentary, although individuals are nomadic and will occasionally wander long distances, especially juveniles (F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). It breeds in forested areas in North Africa. It occupies dry, open habitats from sea level to 1,200 m in North Africa (F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). In Morocco, the species occurs (or used to occur) in lowlands, hills and low mountains with argan forests and steppe vegetation in semi-desert areas (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003), while in Algeria it occurred in lowland forest (Isenmann and Moali, 2000). It avoids dense forest, true deserts and high mountains (Clark and Davies, 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e4292f2-8364-4b37-99d2-c92fd138c8ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e4292f2-8364-4b37-99d2-c92fd138c8ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a5e875252c495b06baeb00a8fdf70286dbc85110eab1fa9c7289d670b7f5dbc"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bc8aa3b-15d0-4423-9e8c-a00f8d1badb0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c32084e573210f6abd17bd918006ce3f951eb907038729a07bce528234145e34"}}, "hash": "d234ef8de045b093b9d71ff22c13c2489dcd3106b2cc3122c9fe16eb589c14e8", "text": "It avoids dense forest, true deserts and high mountains (Clark and Davies, 2018).

It also regularly consumes carrion and robs other raptors of their prey (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Clark and Davies, 2018). Nesting occurs on large stick nests at the tops of tall, isolated trees.

Its scavenging behaviour makes it vulnerable to farmers that use poisons for predator control (F. Cuzin, pers. comm.). The increase and spread of the human population has also caused habitat destruction and disturbance (Bergier, 1987; Stuart and Collar, 1988; Garrido et al., 2005; Vernon et al., 2005; Cherkaoui et al. 2009; Fellous, 2017; BirdLife International, 2018a; Teller\u00eda et al.2019), especially in forests because of the use of wood as fuel for cooking and heating and the felling of large trees to clear land for crops and livestock. De- struction and disturbance due to the intense human use of forests are a particular threat to tree-nesting raptors like the tawny eagle, leading it to abandon its breeding territories, especially in Morocco, where its habitat in the Lower Plains has been greatly altered, particularly due to the considerable areas covered by intensive crops, often in greenhouses (F. Cuzin, pers. comm.). Other anthropogenic threats are the fragmentation of habitats due to urban development, expansion of road networks (in Algeria), and construction of dams and power lines, which could also prevent recolonisation in areas where the species has disappeared (A. Fellous-Djardini, F. Cuzin, pers. comm.). Food availability seems not to be an issue for the species in North Africa as suitable prey are still present in large parts of the region. CONSERVATION Conservation and research actions in place: CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a raptor conservation strategy (https://www.iucn.org/news/mediterranean/202001/ first-steps-towards-a-moroccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance). An initiative to identify and cor- rect dangerous power lines has also started in Morocco with the collaboration of governmental bodies and NGOs (Godino et al., 2016; Mart\u00edn Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). Conservation and research actions needed: The presence of the species needs to be confirmed in Morocco and Algeria. A Conservation Action Plan should be developed, including a feasibility analysis for a reintroduction programme. Bird-friendly structures should be installed on power lines to prevent electrocution and collisions. Greater control over the use of pesticides and poisons is needed. Systematic monitoring of the species should be increased, as should the restoration and protection of its habitat. The suitability of a reintroduction programme in Morocco should also be assessed.

Cuzin, P. Bergier, H. Benmammar, A. Riad, pers. obs.). Its range has been contracting since the 20th century because of human action: in Morocco, the bearded vulture was extirpated during the 1970s in the Rif, Central Plateau, Anti-Atlas, Middle Atlas, eastern Morocco around Figuig, and Sahara (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Bergier et al., 2017; Allaoui and Cherkaoui, 2018; Cuzin and Rousselon, 2018).

In Egypt, a few breeding pairs survive in the Sinai\u2013Red Sea Mountains (Goodman and Meininger, 1989; Habib, 2016a; Andevski, 2017; Botha et al., 2017). POPULATION In Morocco there are currently 6\u201310 pairs (Cherkaoui, 2005; Cuzin and Rousselon, 2018; Cuzin, 2019), which is sig- nificantly fewer than the previous estimates of 100 pairs in the 1980s and 50 pairs at the beginning of the 21st century (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). Abdelgurefi and Ramdane (2003) estimated not more than 20 breeding pairs in Algeria with a rapid decline since the previous estimate of 30 pairs (Isenmann and Moali, 2000), and today there are very few sight- ings from the country (A. Si Bachir, pers. comm.) and no sign of breeding. However, more intensive surveys would be needed in the country to confirm the species\u2019 status. In Egypt, 2\u20134 breeding pairs have been estimated, while about 16 pairs were estimated during the 20th century (Goodman and Meininger, 1989). Therefore, the overall mini- mum breeding population size for North Africa is estimated to be 8\u201314 breeding pairs or 16\u201328 mature individuals. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY This species occupies remote, mountainous areas with precipitous terrain usually above 1,000 m, particularly in areas where there are herds of wild ungulates, sheep and goats (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). In Morocco, it is currently found between 2,000 and 4,000 m, especially above 2,500 m (Cuzin, 2019). In Algeria, it occurs above 1,300 m. It is resident where it occurs, but it has vast home ranges and juveniles will wander much more widely than adults (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). While the species can be extremely philopatric, individuals are not very territorial. In North Africa it is almost entirely dependent on carcasses of livestock (either domestic or feral) due to the rarity of wild ungulates across much of its range (Cuzin, 2019). The species will forage over vast distances (up to 700 km in one day has been recorded) using a soaring mode of flight (BirdLife International, 2020c). As scavengers, bearded vultures consume prey remains left by predators or other scavengers; 70% of the biomass of their diet is bones, 25% soft tissue and 5% skin (Botha et al., 2017), and its primary food is the marrow and bone from small to large bones (Clark and Davies, 2018). Bones too big to be swallowed whole are dropped onto a rocky surface from 20\u201370 m height, and the fragments and marrow are collected afterwards (Boudoint, 1976). Tortoises are generally treated in the same way as bones (Clark and Davies, 2018) and this has been documented in Algeria. Only during the period when they are raising young do they need to consume soft tissue (Botha et al., 2017). The species is typically monogamous, but polyandrous trios have been documented (Botha et al., 2017; F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). Nesting occurs in January, and fledging at the beginning of July. Individuals construct large nests (on average 1 m in diameter), composed of branches and lined with animal remains such as skin and wool, as well as dung and occasionally also rubbish (BirdLife International, 2020c). Nests are located on remote overhung cliff ledges or in caves and will be re-used over the years (Fergu- son-Lees and Christie, 2001), although some pairs may have more than one nest. Clutches consist of 1\u20132 eggs, but in cases where two eggs are laid, obligate \u2018cainism\u2019 occurs in which the older sibling kills the younger (Thaler and Pechlaner, 1980). Both parents take part in nest building, nest defence, incubation, brooding and feeding of chicks (Orta et al., 2020a). \u00a9 IUCN Distribution range of the Bearded vulture, Gypaetus barbatus - (Linnaeus, 1758) in North Africa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66c76f26-55f1-46a5-8e23-3187b20391a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "66c76f26-55f1-46a5-8e23-3187b20391a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9177b6e3c2bd2e9ae63222559ccc564a517b9dca9c17c5211803ab205aed2bea"}, "2": {"node_id": "d8c6d06a-7426-45ad-9b02-6bd530f8170f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1824e8dfd02d5b8517525f7b21b5cc4a33e3458d31ddd2ee5ca0bc49158242b1"}}, "hash": "be086958543836d7b9775633732c8b37b7c273aa321eb6b07403e322dd30848e", "text": "Source: The IUCN Red List of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa. 45 THREATS As with other scavenger species, widespread accidental poisoning, largely with strychnine used by many farmers for predator control, and more recently with carbofuran, has contributed significantly to bearded vulture decline and local extinctions in Morocco (Garrido et al., 2014; Cuzin et al., 2009; Cuzin, 2019), at least until the 1980s (F.

Nevertheless, poisoning was not a major threat in Algeria, where there was neither direct persecution in the 20th century nor widespread poisoning campaigns. Although there have been cases of raptor poisoning in the country, none of them is doc- umented as involving this species (A. Fellous-Djardini, H. Benmammar, pers. obs.). Poisoning is not a threat in Egypt either, although hunting and poaching are (Andevski, 2017). Abdelguerfi and Ramdane (2003) point out that the worrying situation in Algeria is due to changes in livestock-rearing practices that reduce food availability and disturb breeding birds, especially in Djurdjura National Park. The decline of wild ungulates (resulting in food scarcity) and habitat loss are also significant threats in Egypt (Andevski, 2017). Dis- turbance by human activities is also a major threat in Egypt (Andevski, 2017) and Morocco, where Cuzin et al. (2009) discovered that the decline in the breeding population might be due in part to general disturbance by shepherds and rock climbers (a very localised threat today in Taghia, High Atlas), by military activities (helicopter flights) and by \"he- li-skiing\" in the Toubkal National Park (Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat). Collision with power lines is considered a risk in Egypt (Andevski, 2017), but not in breeding areas at high al- titude in Morocco and Algeria, where there are no power lines. However, it could be important for dispersing young bearded vultures (Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat). Finally, this small, isolated population could experience a reduction in genetic diversity over time, which could influence breeding success and the long-term survival of such populations unless they are carefully managed. CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. Multi-species action plan for African\u2013Eurasian vultures (Botha et al., 2017). In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a raptor conservation strategy (https://www.iucn.org/news/mediterranean/202001/first-steps-to- wards-a-moroccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance) and in a national population monitoring programme (UICN and DEF, 2020). In Morocco, besides data collection, various local awareness-raising activities have been carried out in conjunction with Spanish Cooperation, GEF Project, Fundaci\u00f3n Gypaetus, and Fundaci\u00f3n Global Nature (Cuzin et al., 2009). A workshop to develop an \u201cAction Plan for the Conservation of the Bearded Vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) in Morocco\u201d was organised by the management of the Toubkal National Park at Imlil, High Atlas, on 21\u201322 October 2015. Conservation actions needed: Non-intensive livestock management systems should be maintained to ensure a food supply. The provision of feeding stations is also beneficial, particularly when food is scarce in winter. Ef- fective protection in areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes carcasses of domestic animals) has been shown to lead to impressive population recoveries, and reintroduction has been successful in parts of its range. Disturbance in and around nesting areas should be reduced, and the impacts of power lines should be mitigated in the species' range. Additionally, the threat of persecution should be countered by means of law enforcement and awareness-raising activities. Finally, coordinated surveys are required to monitor the species' population trend, as well as to produce a Population Viability Analysis, to investigate the specific impact of certain threats, and to come up with best practice guidelines for conservation actions.

It occurs in an area occupied by a close relative, the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), but at the moment there are no records of hybridisation between the two species in the area. The species could be listed as Not Applicable in North Africa, but given that it is listed globally as Critically Endangered and its expansion to Algeria could be the beginning of a colonisation process caused by global climate change or habitat degradation in its breeding range in the southern Sahel, the species is listed here as Critically Endangered under criterion D. Further research should be conducted to ascertain its actual breeding numbers and population trend and the importance of the North African population for the global conservation of the species.

However, in the last 15 years, the species has been recorded far away from its breeding colonies, and has reached the Iberian Peninsula via Morocco and the Strait of Gibral- tar with migrating Gyps fulvus (Botha et al., 2017). Ram\u00edrez et al. (2011) suggested that these movements could represent a range expansion, with the species becoming established as a breeding species in Europe, where there are records of adult R\u00fcppell\u2019s vultures in breeding colonies of griffon vultures in the Iberian Peninsula and exhibiting breeding behaviour. Recently, R\u00fcppell\u00b4s vultures have been sighted showing breeding behaviour in grif- fon vulture colonies in Andalusia, southern Spain (Elgorriaga et al., 2020), where the species is now considered CR \u00a9 Daniel Bur\u00f3n 47 resident (CAGPDS, 2019). In this context, the species has been sighted frequently in Morocco, especially near the Strait of Gibraltar during migration (El Khamlichi, 2016), where about 50 individuals were observed during the spring migration in 2020 (R. El Khamlichi, pers. comm.). It has also been seen in the Sahara (D\u00edaz-Portero et al., 2014; Bergier et al., 2017). In line with these data, Ram\u00edrez (2012) suggests that the species should not be considered a casual visitor or vagrant but to have regular non-breeding populations in both Morocco and Spain. Immatures also migrate with griffon vultures through Morocco and Algeria (Botha et al., 2017). R\u00fcppell\u2019s vultures may also be breeding in G. fulvus colonies in Algeria now. Although the species was consid- ered extinct in Algeria by Botha et al. (2017), J. M. Thiollay (in litt., 2016, per BirdLife International, 2020b) indicates that there are some very small breeding populations in the country. Moreover, according to Si Bachir and Abder- rahmani Said, in 2012, two juveniles captured from the nest in the Aur\u00e8s Mountains (near Babar) were given to the Belezma National Park. One of them died and the other is still in the park. Since 2014 park staff have confirmed the presence of adult R\u00fcppell's vultures in the area and local shepherds say that the species has been seen there for some years (M. Saheb, pers. obs.). POPULATION There are no population estimates for the species. The number of breeding individuals is likely to be extremely small, with probably fewer than 10 breeding pairs in north-eastern Algeria (M. Saheb, pers. obs.). Appropriate monitoring is necessary to accurately determine its population size. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY This species frequents open areas of woodland, grasslands and montane regions, and it is gregarious, congregat- ing at carrion, soaring together in flocks and breeding mainly in colonies on cliff faces and escarpments at a broad range of elevations, and sometimes in trees far from cliffs in West Africa. It locates food entirely by sight, subsisting almost entirely on carrion (Clark and Davies, 2018). It follows other vultures and migrant game or stock herds to locate much of its food (Del Hoyo et al., 1994). The species is considered an irruptive and local migrant by Bildstein (2006). Movements across the Strait of Gibraltar to Europe are in the company of migrant griffon vultures (Botha et al., 2017). THREATS The species faces similar threats to griffon vultures, due to similar habitats, behaviour and potential breeding distribution. It is almost entirely dependent on livestock carcasses due to the almost complete absence of wild ungulates (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Abdelguerfi and Ramdane, 2003; Garrido et al., 2014; Orta et al., 2020b; Andevski, 2017). Therefore, its scavenging behaviour makes it vulnerable to farmers that use poisons for predator control in Morocco, but poisoning does not seem to be a problem in Algeria.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f90873a-e26d-4198-a733-b53af060f725": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f90873a-e26d-4198-a733-b53af060f725", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84b0394162026fdf335fe4752eaab2b9bc1f1c6336c119d39deefa3a3200eab7"}, "2": {"node_id": "50ea5d44-6e3c-4245-bc44-9932cee43d57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a360b2cd645a67dd9eb6f6fe6410ac89977eee744f2adf25ccb36d71becb4f7"}}, "hash": "2b9fa6b3a8f1f4dc80bd30cc8fce3a70653eb8f5a966f4c387d3b89340b3d4ba", "text": "It is sensitive to mor- tality due to collision and electrocution on power lines, as has been found in southern Spain (I.

Lastly, this small, isolated population could experience a reduction in genetic diversity in the long term because of inbreeding and also hybridisation with griffon vultures. Interbreeding behaviour has been ob- served in Spain (Ram\u00edrez et al., 2011) and could influence breeding success and the long-term survival of such populations unless they are carefully managed. CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. Bern Convention Appendix II. There is a Multi-species Action Plan for the conservation of African\u2013Eurasian vultures (Botha et al., 2017). In Morocco, the species is included in a national population monitoring programme (UICN and DEF, 2020). An initiative to identify and correct dangerous power lines has also started in Morocco with the collaboration of governmental bodies and NGOs (Godino et al., 2016; Mart\u00edn Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). There are also initiatives to rescue and release sick and injured wild individuals and to tag eagles (including attaching GPS loggers) in Morocco (MaghrebOrnitho, 2018b). In northern Morocco a feeding station and a rehabilitation centre have been set up, where individuals are captured and marked with wing tags and GPS loggers (R. El Khamlichi, pers. comm., 2019). Conservation actions needed: There is only a small breeding population in Algeria, so it is important to try to conserve it because of the species\u2019 global Red List status (see BirdLife International, 2020b). Effective protection of breeding sites and areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes carcasses of domestic animals) is therefore necessary. The provision of feeding stations is also beneficial, particularly when food is scarce. The ban on poisoned carcasses should be enforced and the leaving of dead animals encouraged. The construction of wind farms in key areas for the species should be avoided, and where they are already built, wind farm staff should be trained in bird monitoring. In addition, the population should be surveyed to determine, protect and manage potential breeding sites and key dispersal areas. Finally, and more broadly, awareness of biodiversity conservation should be increased.

After a decline in the breeding population in the late 20th century, there has been no evidence of breeding since 2004. The nearest populations in southern Europe are also declining, including wintering populations, so the likelihood of immigration is shrinking.

The sparsely populated Mediterranean forests where the species used to breed in Morocco were similar to its Iberian habitat. According to Mougeot et al. (2011), North African countries can be considered the current southern limit of the species' distribution. Its range seems to be retreating northward due to climate change (Huntley et al., 2007) with local extinctions also occurring in southern Spain (Molina, 2015) and declining numbers of resident breeding birds in Iberia and France, and of migrants wintering in Spain (BirdLife International, 2018b). The North African population is likely to have survived because of immigration from the larger Spanish population, but with the decline in this Iberian population during the 20th century further immigration is now unlikely to occur. Additionally, the majority of the global population used to winter in Spain and North Africa, but increasingly birds are remaining in their northern European breeding grounds because of climate change (Huntley et al., 2007; BirdLife International, 2018b). Therefore, wintering red kites are also declining in North Africa, although they are still sighted in this region (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005; eBird, 2020; Radi et al., 2020), even in the Moroccan Sahara (Bergier et al., 2017), Egypt (Goodman and Meininger, 1989) and even as vagrants in Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016). Wintering red kites in Morocco are associated with feeding at rubbish dumps, which could be the reason for their remaining in the region (JMM and Associates, 2015), but it is also a major threat because of the risk of electrocution on power lines close to landfills (Radi et al., 2020). POPULATION The red kite is extinct as a breeding species in Algeria and Tunisia (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005). The species occurred in Morocco but there have been no successful breeding attempts since 2004 when one breeding pair was found nesting in a cedar tree in the Middle Atlas, with 2 chicks (Cherkaoui, 2004). Recent sightings of an adult during the breeding season in Aguelmam Afernourrir (Middle Atlas) in late May \u2013 early June 2013 could be considered the last known breeding attempt (I. Cherkaoui, pers. obs.). Therefore, it is likely that the species is extinct as a breeding species in North Africa, but further surveying is required to confirm this. If a hitherto unknown population does persist in North Africa, wide-ranging ongoing threats such as climate change make it likely that it will be declining. The North African population probably survived because of immigration from the larger Spanish population, but the decline in this Iberian population during the 20th century due to widespread accidental poisoning (Aebischer, 2009; Garrido et al., 2014) and climate change (Huntley et al., 2007; BirdLife International, 2018b) has made fur- ther immigration unlikely. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY The species occurs in open woodland and adjacent open areas (Clark and Davies, 2018). In winter, it also occupies farmland without trees, wasteland, scrub and wet- lands (BirdLife International, 2018b) and also rubbish dumps and slaughterhouses (Clark and Davies, 2018; Radi et al., 2020). In Mo- rocco the species bred in sparsely populat- ed Mediterranean broadleaf woodlands and forests mixed with farmland and pasture, similar to its Iberian habitat (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Cherkaoui, 2004). Red kites are less gregarious than black kites, though small groups will gather at abundant food sources (Clark and Davies, 2018) especially in winter. \u00a9 IUCN Distribution range of the Red kite, Milvus milvus - (Linnaeus, 1758) in North Africa.

One to three eggs are laid between March and April (Mougeot et al., 2011; Clark and Davies, 2018). In Morocco, fledglings have been observed in May and June (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). THREATS As with other scavenger species, widespread accidental poisoning, largely with strychnine used by many farmers for predator control, and more recently with carbofuran, has contributed significantly to red kite decline (Aebischer, 2009; Garrido et al., 2014). Internationally banned organochlorine pesticides are still locally available and kill wildlife and pollute the environment (Garrido et al., 2014). Indirect poisoning from pesticides and secondary poisoning from the consumption of rodents poisoned by rodenticides spread on farmland to control vole plagues threatens the species particularly in its wintering ranges in France and Spain and possibly in North Africa, where it is driving rapid population declines (Aebischer, 2009). There is a strong correlation between rapid declines and those populations that winter in Spain (Carter, 2007), which will be the source of the kites that winter in North Africa. The decline of livestock grazing and the intensification of farming leading to chemical pollution, homogenisation of landscapes and ecological impoverishment also threaten the species (Knott et al., 2009). Destruction and distur- bance because of the intense human use of forests to extract wood as fuel for cooking and heating and because of the felling of large trees to clear land for agriculture especially threatens tree-nesting raptors like red kites, leading them to abandon their breeding territories. Wind turbines are also a potentially serious future threat (Mammen et al., 2009) so the increasing number of massive wind energy projects in northern Morocco could pose a huge threat to the population migrating across the Strait of Gibraltar. Other threats include electrocution on and collision with power lines (Mionnet, 2007; Radi et al., 2020), hunting and trapping (Mionnet, 2007), roadkill, deforestation, and possibly competition with the generally more successful black kite (Milvus migrans) (Ferguson-Lees et al., 2001; Cardiel and Vi\u00f1uela, 2007; Mammen, 2007). Climate change seems to be shifting optimal breeding areas north- wards (Huntley et al., 2007), so survival on the southern edge of their range (i.e. North Africa) will become harder. CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. An initiative to identify and correct dan- gerous power lines has started in Morocco with the collaboration of governmental bodies and NGOs (Godino et al., 2016; Mart\u00edn Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). Conservation actions needed: A conservation Action Plan is required, including a feasibility analysis for a reintro- duction programme and the suitability of providing supplementary feeding stations. Bird-friendly structures should be installed on power lines to prevent electrocution and collisions . Greater control over the use of pesticides and poisons is needed. Populations should be monitored to determine, protect and manage potential breeding and wintering areas. Such research can also survey for any potential breeding activity. Actions to increase awareness of biodiversity conservation are required, as well as training for law enforcers. A management plan should be devel- oped for open landfill sites as key feeding habitats for red kites and other raptors in North Africa. It is also important to work with landowners to protect habitats and prevent any potential persecution.

In the 20th century it bred in Libya (in the southern Sahara in 1998: Massa, 1999; Isenmann et al., 2016 ), Tunisia (until 1950 in the eastern Sahara: Isenmann et al., 2005), Algeria (maybe until the 1960s in the western Sahara: Isenmann and Moali, 2000) and Morocco (until the 1950s in the Atlantic Sahara: Bergier, 1987; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Bergier et al., 2017). Previ- ously, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it used to breed in non-desert habitats in the Central Plateau and Middle Atlas in Morocco (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003) and Algeria (Isenmann and Moali, 2000). It has also disappeared from northern Niger and northern Mali (Thiollay, 2006) so any recolonisation of Algeria from these countries does CR \u00a9 Daniel Bur\u00f3n 53 not seem to be possible soon. However, it could still be breeding in Mauritania (Botha et al., 2017). Vagrants are also occasionally recorded in Algeria, Libya and Morocco (Botha et al., 2017). There is passage migration of lap- pet-faced vultures through Sinai and Nile Valley according to eBird (2020), probably from the Arabian Peninsula. POPULATION Data from Shimelis et al. (2005) and Habid (2016b) suggest that the Egyptian subpopulation (the only one re- maining in North Africa) consists only of 10\u201320 breeding pairs. This gives a total population of 20\u201340 mature individuals, although further surveys are required given the current trends for this species across the world and the apparently severe declines in the Middle East (Botha et al., 2017). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY This species inhabits open habitats usually with scattered trees (Clark and Davies, 2018) such as savanna-like forests with Acacia (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). It ranges widely when foraging (BirdLife International, 2020) and is mainly a scavenger, feeding predominantly on any large carcass or its remains (Mundy, 1982; Mundy et al., 1992). Lappet-faced vultures gather at carcasses with other vultures, which they dominate, and they steal prey from other raptors and can also take live prey, including fish and terrapin eggs (Clark and Davies, 2018). They build solitary nests (containing just one egg) on cliffs and in Acacia trees in Egypt (Habid, 2016); the species\u2019 distribu- tion is sometimes limited by that of Acacia trees (Boshoff et al., 1997). Lappet-faced vultures do not breed until they are at least six years old, and then fledge ca. 0.4 young/pair/year (Mundy et al., 1992); ringing studies have revealed a very low return rate (Simmons and Bridgeford, 1997). The species' minimum home range has been suggested to be 8 km2, expanding to 15 km2 in some habitats (Shimelis et al., 2005), but now 80\u2013150 km2 may be more appropriate (BirdLife International, 2020d). THREATS As with other scavenger species in North Africa, widespread accidental poisoning, largely with strychnine used by many farmers for predator control, and more recently with carbofuran, has contributed significantly to lappet-faced vulture decline and local extinctions (Garrido et al., 2014; Andevski, 2017; Botha et al., 2017). Food availability for the species is decreasing due to the almost complete absence of wild ungulates, which is caused by the increase and spread of the human population and habitat alteration, at least in the Maghreb (Garrido et al., 2014; Andevski, 2017).

It has also been impacted during the breeding season by human disturbance near nests in desert areas, where low tree densities mean that homes are often built under or near trees used by this spe- cies for breeding, contributing to the abandonment of nesting sites (Botha et al. 2017). Another threat could be electrocu- tion or collisions on energy infrastructure, as in other areas of its range (Shimelis et al., 2005). The potential introduction and use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammato- ry drug diclofenac, which is fatal to Gyps spp. when ingested by birds feeding on livestock carcasses, may become a threat to the species in the region as well.

In 2008, feeding stations were set up at Shalatin in southern Egypt, following the decline of vultures in the area (BirdLife International, 2020d). Conservation actions needed: Coordinated surveys and monitoring should be instigated throughout its range to clarify population size and rates of decline, beginning with a census of the Egyptian population, including use of satellite tracking; further ecological research is also needed. Awareness campaigns should be initiated aimed at farmers (livestock grazers), local communities, developers and ecotourists to reduce mortality from persecution and disturbance. Actions to reduce mortality from electrocution and collisions on power lines are desirable, including education campaigns, establishing priority areas for power line mitigation works and retrofit- ting dangerous power lines. The provision of feeding stations is also beneficial, particularly when food is scarce. The laws protecting existing nature reserves in Egypt should be enforced so as to maintain an adequate area of legally protected habitat, and lobbying to outlaw the sale of diclofenac for veterinary purposes could be useful, in addition to the establishment of legal protection for the species in range states.

Based on historical localities, it is estimated that its extent of occurrence (EOO) has been reduced by 50 to 70% in the last 22 years as a consequence of the elimination and degradation of marshlands, its main suitable habitat. Its area of occupancy (AOO) is estimated to be less than 100 km2 and its EOO 9,698 km2. Recent observations indicate the species could be colonising new habitats, but more research is needed to in- crease knowledge of its current distribution, ecological requirements and population status. However, based on the small and declining population, the species is listed as Critically Endangered under criterion C2a(ii). DISTRIBUTION This is a widespread Afrotropical owl occurring over large areas of sub-Saharan Africa, with isolated populations of the endemic subspecies A. c. ssp. tingitanus in North Africa. The Marsh Owl currently occurs in Morocco, though it formerly also bred in Algeria (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann and Moali, 2000). In Morocco, the species used to be found from Tangier to Essaouira and Fez, but currently it occurs on the plains and hills of northern and central parts of the Atlantic coast, between Tangier and Essaouira and inland around Mekn\u00e8s, where it almost exclusively inhabits marsh vegetation in coastal wetlands (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). To date, five breeding localities have been identified: the wetlands of Merja Zerga, Lower Loukkos, Sidi-Boughaba and the Tahaddart estuary (MaghrebOrnitho, 2014b, 2018e), and an unknown forest habitat in the Mamora Forest, which could be a newly colonised site (Hanane and Cherkaoui, 2014). CR \u00a9 Brahim Bakaas 56 POPULATION In the late 19th century, marsh owls were considered common in Morocco (Reid 1885), but the population has undergone a considerable decline since the end of the 19th century (Hanane and Cherkaoui, 2014), and especially since the 1970s in most areas, due to the increase in the human population and the resulting modification, distur- bance and destruction of wetlands (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7a89b7f-4bfe-4ab9-bd95-1776b82b9c21": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7a89b7f-4bfe-4ab9-bd95-1776b82b9c21", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9914c2b463df427745251bf7e729490a9ac2e8b20a2b8262f9823504a1ed9697"}, "2": {"node_id": "c807ae7b-3d92-4cf7-befc-a7b1c2221835", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f144f2a7efce02557f857b2cd0e04e8a65aaf5d77f3f42a9d12ed14f2914ee8"}}, "hash": "643a0cba180adf1091311f106a8f144e5289c66f624303577213e185543be9e9", "text": "By 1991, the population in Morocco was estimated at 50\u2013140 breeding pairs (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991), a number which was repeated by El Agbani and Qninba (2011). However, Qninba et al. (2008) found a decline of 40% from the 1980s to 2008 in the second most important location in Morocco, Lower Loukkos. Thus, if the decline is assumed to be the same across the country, and considering the threats that wetlands are facing (Franchimont and Saadaoui, 2001; Sayad, 2007; MaghrebOrnitho, 2012), the breeding population in the country may be estimated to be around 50\u2013100 breeding pairs (100\u2013200 mature individuals). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY The typical habitat of the species in Morocco is permanent wetlands surrounded by well-developed marsh vegetation (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991), especially in coastal wetlands (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003), but also in cereal fields (El Agbani and Qninba, 2011), rice fields (K.

The marsh owl nests on the ground or, exceptionally, in trees in old corvid nests, and lays an aver- age clutch of 3.22 eggs with a hatching rate of 78%; with young birds recorded from April to June (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991). The species\u2019 diet varies from one site to another and includes micromammals and invertebrates, but in largely unspoilt wetlands it consists mainly of insects (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991). The species is mainly sedentary but some birds disperse over long distances (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991), even as far as Spain (De Juana and Garc\u00eda, 2015). The habitat of the recent breeding record from the Mamora forest consists of dense Quercus suber forest with tall Chamaerops humilis and Cistus sp. shrubland (Hanane and Cherkaoui, 2014). THREATS The marsh owl is very vulnerable to habitat loss resulting from drainage of marshland (due to the increasing human population and the expansion of agriculture) and to disturbance by farmers, pastoralists and especially birders at their main breeding sites (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991; Franchimont and Saadaoui, 2001; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Sayad, 2007; MaghrebOrnitho, 2012). Nests are vulnerable to fires (Olsen, 1999), which have occurred a few times at breeding sites (MaghrebOrnitho, 2012), as well as vandalism, such that very few broods succeed at the species\u2019 best breeding site in Morocco (A. Qninba, pers. comm., 2020). Increasing populations of wild boars may also be having a negative impact on breeding success (I. Cherkaoui, pers. comm., 2020). Rodenticides used on farmland may also be adversely affecting the population but there are no available data (K. Rousselon, pers. comm., 2020). Marsh owls are also killed by traffic (Bergier and Th\u00e9venot, 1991; MaghrebOrnitho, 2014b). Finally, all owl species are illegally traded in North Afri- ca (Brochet et al., 2016), and in Moroccan popular belief, all nocturnal birds of prey are used for magic rituals. Overall, this small, isolated population could suffer a reduction in genetic diversity over time, which could influence breeding success and the long- term survival of the population unless the sites are carefully managed. \u00a9 IUCN Distribution range of the Marsh owl, Asio capensis - (Smith, 1834) in North Africa. Source: The IUCN Red List of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa. 57 CONSERVATION Conservation and research actions in place: CITES Appendix II. Conservation and research actions needed: A Conservation Action Plan must be developed to conserve and restore breeding locations, including a population and habitat viability assessment and prospection to find new populations. Strict and effective protection of all known breeding sites is required, and the destruction of wetland vegetation for agricultural purposes or by fire must be prevented. Local ornithological guides should be trained to avoid disturbing the breeding and wintering population, and best practice guidelines for birdwatching should be established, including a ban during the breeding season. Populations should be monitored to deter- mine, protect and manage key breeding, wintering and dispersal sites. Road signage should be installed in areas of high traffic collision risk (e.g. near breeding sites) alerting drivers to the presence of marsh owls and warning them to reduce speed. Research is needed into the feasibility of a captive breeding programme to reinforce existing populations and to reintroduce individuals to suitable localities where the species has become extinct.

Chokri and H. Azafzaf, pers. obs.). It is a common passage migrant from Eurasia in all North African countries (Clark and Davies, 2018). POPULATION In the late 20th century, the population in Morocco was estimated at 500 breeding pairs, but numbers have declined markedly to ca. 100 breeding pairs (Bergier, 1987; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; I. Cherkaoui, pers. obs.). EN \u00a9 \u00c1lex Colorado 59 There has been only one recent breeding record in Algeria, a breeding pair observed at Dayet El Fed, and the population in this country is unlikely to be more than five breeding pairs (H. Benmammar, pers. obs.). In Tunisia, there have been no breeding records in the last 20 years (M. A. Chokri and H. Azafzaf, pers. obs.). Therefore, the breeding population in North Africa can be estimated at ca. 105 breeding pairs (210 mature individuals). North Africa is the southern limit of the species\u2019 range, so the North African population probably survived due to immigration from the larger Spanish population, but this too has suffered a major decline in the last decade (Arroyo, 2017) due to conversion of its habitat to intensive agricultural land (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Bergier, 1987; Orta et al., 2020d). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY The species occurs in open grasslands, cereal fields, upland plateaux, wetlands and marshes in coastal regions (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Clark and Davies, 2018). It nests in tall vegetation on the ground. The nest is a small, nar- row platform, 20\u201340 cm wide, made of grass stems or thin twigs. Clutches normally consist of three to five eggs (Orta et al., 2020d). In North Africa, the breeding season lasts from early April to early June (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). It is a migratory species, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Orta et al., 2020d). It leaves its breeding grounds from the end of July until mid-October and begins its return in March and April (Snow and Perrins, 1998; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Orta et al., 2020d). This is a loop migration, with birds passing further to the west in autumn (Garc\u00eda and Arroyo, 1998). Birds tend to migrate on broad fronts, but there are concentrations in Gibraltar and along the Rift Valley (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Orta et al., 2020d). Nevertheless, they will readily migrate over expanses of water (Brown et al., 1982). Birds tend to hunt alone, although they do gather at high prey concentrations and will roost in groups of often more than 50 individuals, sometimes communally with Circus macrourus and C. aeruginosus (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). They mainly feed on small mammals, birds, reptiles, sometimes insects (particularly in winter) and occasionally birds\u2019 eggs (Clark and Davies, 2018). THREATS In the past, the use of organochlorine pesticides seemed to cause a decline in Europe (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001), which could still be happening at least in Morocco (Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat). The species is currently in decline owing to the conversion of its habitat to agricultural land, an environment in which crop gathering by combine harvesters causes frequent breeding failure (Orta et al., 2020d; Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat). Intensification of agricul- ture increases this threat (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). It is commensal with some forms of agriculture, and therefore changes in these practices could make it potentially vulnerable by depleting the supply of small birds and mammals for it to prey on (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Orta et al., 2020d).

Conservation actions needed: Tall vegetation should not be removed during the breeding season due to the high rates of chick mortality when it is harvested on agricultural land. Key management practices that include moving nestlings to safe places during harvesting, and leaving areas around nests unharvested should be im- plemented (Orta et al., 2020d). Removed chicks can also be reintroduced in other suitable areas. Mediterranean populations are highly dependent on these measures owing to high nest-failure rates in the absence of interven- tion (Orta et al., 2020d). Where possible, strict and effective protection of breeding sites should occur, and more broadly there should be an effort to increase awareness of biodiversity conservation. In addition, research on migration routes and on the location and structure of stopover sites and wintering quarters of the species would assist the development of conservation measures (Trierweiler, 2010). A population and habitat viability assess- ment should be produced in addition to a management plan and conservation action plan; and the populations should be monitored to determine, protect and manage key breeding, wintering and dispersal sites.

Most of the available data come from Morocco, where there has been an estimated population decline of at least 98% in the last 40 years (2.2 generations). However, the population size in Algeria and Tunisia seems stable, while little information is available from Libya and Egypt. Based on the available data it is likely that the ongoing decline in the species in this region is in the range of 50\u201379% over three genera- tions (ca. 53 years). Therefore, it is assessed as Endangered under criterion A4bcde. DISTRIBUTION The species is uncommon to rare and a local summer breeder in North Africa, mainly along the Mediterranean coast from Morocco to Egypt (Clark and Davies, 2018). Apart from in Algeria, the species' population has de- clined throughout its range in North Africa, mainly because of indirect poisoning, as has happened throughout its global distribution area (Botha et al., 2017). In Morocco it currently seems to survive only in the Middle Atlas and Tazekka National Park, since it was extirpated in the rest of the country during the 20th century, mainly by poison- ing (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Amezian and El Khamlichi, 2016; Cuzin, 2019; UICN and DEF, 2020). However, it may still occur in unsurveyed areas which need more field work (Cuzin, 2019), and a possible breeding pair has recent- ly been located in Missour in eastern Morocco, but this still needs confirmation (UICN and DEF, 2020). In Algeria the Egyptian vulture appears to breed from the coast southward to the Saharan Atlas and beyond (Isenmann and Moali, 2000), with a large resident population in the south-east (Clark and Davies, 2018; Buij et al., 2017); the EN \u00a9 \u00cd\u00f1igo Fajardo 62 country has the largest population in the Maghreb (North African Birds, 2014a).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d4b5dc7-bde1-468b-b5b0-746095e3047b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d4b5dc7-bde1-468b-b5b0-746095e3047b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3e50d6efe5469b4b7e99c8520958b8513e380f8a0bb8abb672a683d5576328c8"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8f9a56a-01a8-48c5-86df-be81adaa55e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2fc90777d232ed366e78963989c322408b0aca2135e043eccb1b66c4664304e"}}, "hash": "6f7479fa79e325a94958d37792d9c21b9d3a6e86d28171e00f2160e76cc7e7b4", "text": "It also occurs in north-western Tu- nisia (Isenmann et al., 2005), northern and south-eastern Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016) and south-western Egypt (Aswan, Shalateen, and Wadi El-Gemal National Park), as well as in the Sinai Peninsula, although it is extinct in the western desert of Egypt and the Nile Valley (Goodman and Meininger, 1989; Buij et al., 2017; Habib, 2016c). A large part of the Eurasian breeding population passes through the Strait of Gibraltar and the Red Sea Flyway on migration to its wintering sites in Africa (Phipps et al., 2019), but some individuals also pass through Cap Bon and the Tunisian coast (Isenmann et al., 2005; M.

POPULATION The North African population can be estimated at more than 750 breeding pairs or 1,500 mature individuals. There are ca. 20 pairs in Morocco (M. Amezian and R. El Khamlichi, pers. obs.; Cuzin, 2019; UICN and DEF, 2020), which is significantly less than the previous estimate of 500\u20131,000 pairs in the 1980s (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). There are around 500 breeding pairs in Algeria, where they are more frequent in the south and less abundant in the western part of the country (M. Saheb, A. Fellous-Djardini, pers. obs.). There are 100\u2013150 pairs in Tunisia, where the population seems stable (I. Essetti, pers. obs.). And there are fewer than 20 pairs in Egypt, with only two in Sinai (A. Riad, pers. obs.). There are no available population estimates from Libya, although the species has not been seen since 2010 in the Cyrenaica region, where it is suspected to have disappeared, but this information is difficult to verify (K. Etaleb, pers. obs.). More than 4,000 individuals have been observed on migration across the Strait of Gibraltar (A. Onrubia, pers. obs.). Based on these data, the ongoing decline in the species in this region is likely to be 50\u201379% over three generations (ca. 53 years). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY The species occurs in a variety of habitats, from Mediterranean woodlands to arid areas, but also near human habitation, especially rubbish dumps and cultivation (Clark and Davies, 2018). In Morocco it is currently observed in cultivated plateaux and wooded environments, where there are gorges with cliffs at moderate altitude (400 to 1,400 m) (Cuzin, 2019). This species typically nests on ledges or in caves on cliffs (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). Egyptian vultures usually build nests with sticks but also use artificial materials and they raise one or two chicks, rarely three (Clark and Davies, 2018; H. Benmammar, pers. obs.). Cases of polyandry have been reported in Europe (Perennou et al., 1987; Tella, 1993). According to Clark and Davies (2018) it is primarily a scavenger, though it is less de- pendent on large carcasses, on which it can feed only after other large vultures have eaten. It can also capture live prey such as turtles and insects, and it will feed on birds\u2019 eggs and on organic remains at rubbish dumps and slaughterhouses. In Algeria, groups of Egyptian vultures are present at all rubbish dumps, along with common ravens (Corvus corax) and black kites (Mil- vus migrans) (A. Fellous-Djardini, M. Saheb, pers. obs.), whereas in Egypt, it occurs in \u00a9 IUCN Distribution range of the Egyptian vulture, Neophron percnopterus - (Linnaeus, 1758) in North Africa. Source: The IUCN Red List of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa. 63 areas with low human population density (A. Riad, pers. obs.). The species is usually solitary, but vultures con- gregate at feeding and roosting sites (Ceballos and Don\u00e1zar, 1990; Amezian and El Khamlichi, 2016). The majority of individuals from northern breeding populations are long-distance migrants that overwinter in sub-Saharan Africa, with juveniles often remaining in the winter range for more than a year after their first migra- tion (L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2014; Oppel et al., 2015; Buechley et al., 2018). A few migrants presumably winter in Egypt (Goodman and Meininger, 1989). Communal night roots of non-breeding birds are formed, usually on cliffs, but also occasionally in trees (Ceballos and Don\u00e1zar, 1990; Clark and Davies, 2018).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61dc4a9f-4d00-4a0c-a256-ac58ee489d08": {"__data__": {"id_": "61dc4a9f-4d00-4a0c-a256-ac58ee489d08", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0c887e79df316afa44cc8c6339359f5b3f7391121bec114b847148d429ecbf67"}, "2": {"node_id": "2cc9e265-c871-436d-b3d0-f6126b24d55f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f794baae4656f52f0ba6a4d720dbf50853f3948576562f6c32d4ef4f439560ce"}}, "hash": "53cd68d77c2423fb3a53664810b4340c9ab724d967dd207add20b9e9fb723846", "text": "In North Africa, only one communal roost has been found in the Middle Atlas breeding area in Morocco (Amezian and El Khamlichi, 2016) and two in Ain Mlila (Mount Kef Nsser) in Algeria (M.

Poisoning is also a potential threat in Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016). In Tunisia, some very local cases of poisoning have been observed and this threat must be properly evaluated (M. Petretto, pers. comm., M. Amezian, pers. obs.). However, it does not seem to be a conservation problem in Algeria and Egypt, according to local experts. Due to its diet, the species might also be susceptible to poisoning when feeding at landfills (Cuzin, 2019) but these could actually be key feeding habitats if properly managed (JMM and Associates, 2015).

Collision with and electrocution by power lines is a further threat (Andevski, 2017; Botha et al., 2017; AMFCR, 2018; UICN and DEF, 2020; Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat), and the species is highly vulnerable to the effects of wind energy developments (STRIX, 2012; Andevski, 2017), so the increasing number of massive wind energy projects in northern Morocco could be a major threat to migrants crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, and the future wind farm near Taza could affect the Moroccan breeding population in Tazekka National Park. The on- going hydroelectric project in the Gorges of Sebou is also being built next to the only known breeding site in Morocco (Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat; Red List review workshop Tunisia, 2020). Other potential threats are disturbance, hunting and poaching (North African Birds, 2014b; Andevski, 2017; MaghrebOrnitho, 2018f; Cuzin, 2019; Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, Rabat). In con- trast, there do not seem to be any major threats to the largest breeding population in Algeria, or in Libya and Egypt. CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CMS Appendix I. CITES Appendix II. It is included in a multi-species action plan for African\u2013Eurasian vultures (Botha et al., 2017). In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a raptor conservation strategy (https://www.iucn.org/news/mediterranean/202001/first-steps-towards-a-mo- roccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance) and in a national population monitoring programme (UICN and DEF, 2020). An initiative to identify and correct dangerous power lines has also started in Morocco with the collaboration of governmental bodies and NGOs (Godino et al., 2016; Mart\u00edn Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). There are some initiatives to rescue and release sick and injured wild individuals and to tag vultures (including attaching GPS loggers) in Morocco (AMFCR, 2018). In northern Morocco a vulture restaurant and a rehabilitation centre are in operation (R. El Khamlichi, pers. comm., 2020). In Algeria, the Tlemcen National Park has developed an action plan for the species, which was implemented in 2017\u201319 (H. Benmammar, pers. comm., 2020). 64 Conservation actions needed: Efforts to increase awareness of biodiversity conservation and to build local capacity should be conducted in countries along the migration flyways and in the breeding and wintering areas. All known breeding sites in Morocco should be conserved, and the construction of energy infrastructure in key areas for the species should be avoided. The ban on poisoned carcasses should be enforced and the leaving of dead animals encouraged, while open landfill sites can become key feeding habitats for Egyptian vultures if properly managed. Indeed, further supplementary feeding stations should be set up. Work is needed to halt the illegal taking of vultures for traditional medicine in Morocco and for illegal trade throughout the species\u2019 range. Finally, surveys of the population should be conducted to determine, protect and manage potential breeding sites and key dispersal areas, including migration corridors in the western and eastern flyways. Such work could also more accurately estimate the size of the population and identify the specific impacts of certain threats.

Although the population is suspected to be stable, the probability of immigration of individuals from nearby breeding sites in the Mediterranean region is low. Moreover, the main threats are ongoing and some may even be expected to increase in the future (e.g. human disturbance due to fishing and tourism, power lines and windfarm development).

In Morocco it breeds in the Al Hoceima National Park (Monti et al., 2013). Here, two unused nests were found near Jebha, 30 km from Cala Iris, outside the protected area. Also in Morocco, in the Chafarinas Islands, the last breeding pair was recorded in 2012 (Monti et al., 2013; Siverio et al., 2018). In Algeria, it is present on the Mediterranean coast at Oran (Monti, 2012) and possibly on the east coast of the country near El Kala. Many wintering birds are observed in Tunisia but the species has not nested there since 1953 (Isenmann et al., 2005; Monti, 2012). In Egypt, it breeds only on the Red Sea coast and South Sinai (Habib, 2019a). Although there are no detailed studies available, the ospreys breeding in North Africa seem to behave as year-round residents or doing short inter-breeding movements. The great ma- jority of Mediterranean ospreys winter within the Mediterranean basin including North African coastal wetlands, but there are records of trans-Saharan migration, indicating that at least a few individuals from the Mediterranean region winter in sub-Saharan Africa, as their conspecifics from northern Europe commonly do (Monti et al., 2018). EN \u00a9 Rafa Benjumea 66 POPULATION In Algeria the population size is estimated at 30\u201334 mature individuals, based on the number of breeding pairs counted in 1989\u20131993 (Boukhalfa, 1990; Thibault et al., 1996; Monti, 2012). In Morocco, there may be 10\u201315 breeding pairs or 20\u201330 mature individuals (producing 8\u201312 chicks per year) (Monti, 2012; Monti et al., 2013), but a census performed in 2019 indicated there were about 16 active nests (AGIR, 2018; H. Nibani, pers. obs.). Reports indicate the Moroccan population decreased by 35.7% between 1990 and 2013 (Monti et al., 2013), but the population trend seems to have been stable since then. In Egypt, 80 mature individuals (40 active nests) were counted on islands in the Red Sea in 2013\u201315 (Habib, 2019a). Therefore, the total population size for North Africa is estimated to be between 130 and 146 mature individuals. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY Ospreys tend to be opportunistic, adapting their behaviour to the location and the water bodies available, with fish- ing opportunities probably being the most important requirement. In marine environments, its diet consists almost entirely of live epipelagic fishes (e.g. Liza spp., Diplodus spp.) (Poole, 2020). At times, individuals will frequent estu- aries, marshes and other coastal waters as well as lakes and pools inland. During migration, any kind of water body where fishing may be possible (with medium-sized fish no deeper than one metre below the surface) can be used. The species is generally intolerant of disturbance, especially when the source of the disturbance is directed toward the nest (Monti et al., 2018), but in some cases it has locally adapted to intense human activity (Bai et al., 2009). Nesting sites in the Mediterranean are rocky cliffs close to marine or brackish water fishing environments (Monti et al., 2013). The nest is a large collection of sticks and flotsam, lined with grasses and moss where available, usually wedged high (up to 30 m above the ground) in an exposed tree or sometimes on cliffs. The breeding season lasts from early March to July, with egg laying from early March to early April (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003); clutches consist of from one to four eggs. In Egypt pairs start courtship and nest building from the first week of December in the south to the first week of January in the north. Fledglings appear from late March to late April (Habib, 2017). In North Africa, the species is mostly resident with some individuals moving short distances outside the breeding season. Migratory movements to the Sahel may also occur (F. Monti, pers. obs.). THREATS In Morocco, detrimental fishing activities such as trawling and dynamite fishing are the main cause of both direct and indirect disturbance for the species in the Al Hoceima National Park (H.

In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a raptor conservation strategy (https://www.inationalucn.org/news/ mediterranean/202001/first-steps-towards-a-moroccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance) and a na- tional population monitoring programme (UICN and DEF, 2020). An initiative to identify and correct dangerous power lines has also started in Morocco with the collaboration of governmental Conservation and research/monitoring actions needed: Awareness raising and education campaigns will be important for this species' conservation. Disturbance during the breeding season can be reduced by establishing protective zones 200\u2013300 m wide around nests (Monti et al., 2018a). This, along with nest wardening, rebuilding of damaged nests and the provision of artificial nests in safe locations where necessary, should improve breeding success. The spread of pollutants should be reduced. Fish-farms visited by migrating birds should use equipment to scare birds away and prevent access to fish stocks in order to avoid accidental entanglement (for example, over- head lines instead of nets laid on the water surface could be an effective measure for reducing osprey mortality). Actions are needed to reduce mortality, particularly from collisions and electrocution; they should include the modification of dangerous power lines. It would also be beneficial to maintain an adequate area of legally protect- ed habitat and improve the level of protection at sensitive sites in North Africa. In the short term, current legisla- tion to reduce illegal hunting, including in areas that do not have formal protected status, should be reinforced; breeding sites should be protected and disturbance avoided or limited (Monti et al., 2018a); regional recovery plans should be developed and implemented; and reintroduction and population reinforcement programmes, only if necessary, should take into consideration the genetic structure and migratory strategies of potential source populations, selecting those that are most similar to the North African population (Monti et al., 2018b). Research is recommended to fill gaps in our knowledge of the population status in some regions, trends and the threats facing the North African population of the species, in particular in Algeria. It is also recommended to monitor demographic parameters such as the number of birds, and annual estimates of breeding and their hatching and fledging success.

Benmammar, pers. obs.). It has also been observed as a breeding species in the Parc Culturel de l\u2019Atlas Saharien, at Mount Ksour (Fellous, 2017). The griffon vulture has never bred in Libya. In Morocco, it used to breed in the east, the Middle Atlas, the Central Plateau, the High Atlas, the western Anti-Atlas and the Saharan Atlas (Bergier, 1987; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003), but in the 21st century there has been no active breeding in the country (Garrido et al., 2005; Hajib, 2005; UICN and DEF, 2020). Similarly, it formerly bred in north-eastern and southern Tunisia (Isenmann et al., 2005), and it used VU \u00a9 Daniel Bur\u00f3n 69 to breed in eastern Egypt (Andevski, 2017), but more recent information confirms the species no longer breeds in the country (A. Riad, pers. obs.). Immatures, mainly juveniles, migrate from Eurasia through Morocco, Algeria and Egypt to sub-Saharan Africa to win- ter, and some vultures seem to winter in the southern Moroccan Sahara and eastern Egypt (Clark and Davies, 2018). POPULATION The Algerian population was estimated at 126 breeding pairs in Kabylia and Constantinois by Benmammar (2012). More recent data show a wider distribution (North African Birds, 2015; Sahnoune, 2016; Bara and Khiter, 2017; Rebbah et al., 2019). The population in Algeria (and North Africa) can be conservatively estimated at around 200 breeding pairs or 400 mature individuals. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY Breeding adults are largely sedentary, but most juveniles are migratory or nomadic, overwintering in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in eastern Egypt (Botha et al., 2017; Clark and Davies, 2018). Migrating birds congregate in some specific locations, such as Gibraltar and Suez (Botha et al., 2017). The species relies heavily on soaring flight, and has been shown to fly at altitudes of 10,000 m and higher, and it needs thermals because it prefers gliding and soaring over active flight, to save energy (in Botha et al., 2017). The species roosts and nests on large cliffs and soars over surrounding open countryside from mountains to semi-deserts in search of food, occurring from sea level up to 2,500 m (Botha et al., 2017). The nest is usually built on a rocky outcrop, with sheltered ledges or small caves preferred (del Hoyo et al., 1994). It is a thin, fairly small platform of branches, sometimes stolen from other large raptors. A single egg is laid (Orta et al., 2020e). It feeds almost exclusively on carcasses of medium-sized and large domestic and wild animals, often in large numbers, although there are a few records in Spain of birds approaching live but injured or weak sheep or cattle (Botha et al., 2017). Rubbish dumps can be good feeding sites, but they may also have detrimen- tal effects through the consumption of inappropriately disposed of poisoned animals and the impact of human infrastructure nearby (JMM and Associates, 2015). THREATS The griffon vulture was extirpated in Morocco in the 20th century because, through their scavenging habits, individ- uals became unintended victims of poisoning for predator control by farmers (Garrido et al., 2014; Andevski, 2017; Botha et al., 2017).

Also in Morocco, every year dozens of migrant vultures are found drowned in artificial ponds where they go to drink or bathe during the summer months (R. El Khamlichi, pers. comm.). Additionally, although livestock is very abundant, local traditions such as burying domestic ungulate carcasses decrease food availability for scavengers, especially in Morocco (Garrido et al., 2014; Allaoui and Cherckaoui, 2018); in Algeria carcasses should also be buried, but they normally are not (A. Fellous-Djardini, M. Saheb, pers. obs.). There is also a widespread problem across North Africa of poaching to supply the illegal trade in raptors and raptor body parts (Emile et al., 2014; Brochet et al., 2016), which is known to impact the griffon vulture (Gar- rido et al., 2014; Andevski, 2017; Botha et al., 2017; MaghrebOrnitho, 2020; A. Fellous-Djardini, M. Saheb, pers. obs., Moroccan Strategy for Conservation of Birds of Prey Workshop, 2020, Rabat). In Tunisia the major causes of extinction are not known, but the last small population was exploited in the past for European collections. CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. It is included in a multi-species action plan for African\u2013Eurasian vultures (Botha et al., 2017). In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a raptor conservation strategy (https://www.iucn.org/news/mediterranean/202001/first-steps-towards-a-moroc- can-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance) and in a national population monitoring programme (UICN and DEF, 2020). An initiative to identify and correct dangerous power lines has also started in Morocco with the collaboration of governmental bodies and NGOs (Godino et al., 2016; Mart\u00edn Mart\u00edn et al., 2019). There are some initiatives to rescue and release sick and injured wild individuals, and to tag them (including attaching GPS loggers) in Morocco (AMFCR, 2018). In northern Morocco a vulture restaurant and a rehabilitation centre have been set up, whose work includes capturing and marking individuals with wing tags and GPS loggers (R. El Khamlichi, pers. comm.). Conservation actions needed: There is only a single small breeding population in Algeria, so it is important to try to restore the breeding population in the species\u2019 former range. Effective protection in areas with a plentiful supply of food (which often includes the carcasses of domestic animals), has been shown to result in impressive population recoveries in other areas, and reintroduction has been successful in parts of its range (del Hoyo et al., 1994); such measures could be implemented in Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt if threats are controlled. The provision of feeding stations is also beneficial, particularly when food is scarce. The ban on poisoned carcasses should be enforced and the leaving of dead animals encouraged. The griffon vulture population should be sur- veyed to determine, protect and manage potential breeding sites and key dispersal areas. The construction of wind farms in key areas for the species should be avoided, and where they have already been built staff should be trained in bird monitoring. Artificial ponds in breeding, migratory and wintering areas should be adapted to prevent vultures drowning while drinking or bathing. Finally, and more broadly, awareness of biodiversity conser- vation needs to be increased amongst local people.

The entire breeding population in Europe and North Africa winters in the Sahel zone and in eastern and southern Africa, passing through all the North African countries on the way (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005, 2016; Clark and Davies, 2018). EN \u00a9 Karim Rousselon 72 POPULATION In the late 20th century, the breeding population was estimated at between 500 and 1,000 breeding pairs in Mo- rocco (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003), with 50 breeding pairs in Tunisia at the beginning of the 21st century (Isenmann et al., 2005), although further validation of this estimate is needed. Recent road surveys (2015\u20132017) during raptor breeding seasons throughout Morocco suggest the species could actually be at a low density in Morocco, with only one individual seen in 500 km (A. Onrubia, pers. obs., 2015\u201317). Therefore the figure of 500\u20131,000 pairs may now be an overestimate. There are no data from Algeria. Considering the unknown breeding population in Algeria, the North African population may be estimated at no less than 500\u20131,000 breeding pairs (1,000\u20132,000 mature individuals). Ongoing population decline is inferred to be occurring in the species' range, given the observed degradation of open wooded areas, its main suitable habitat, and sightings in recent road censuses in Morocco. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY Most individuals of the species are migratory. European and North African birds mainly winter south of Sahara (Clark and Davies, 2018). Autumnal migration occurs from late July to November, peaking in late September and early October. Spring migrants are sighted in mid-February, and passage lasts until early June, with the majority appearing between mid-April and early May (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005, 2016; Strandberg et al., 2009). The species migrates along broad fronts and usually does not concentrate at narrow sea crossings as do many other migratory raptors (Snow and Perrins, 1998; Strandberg et al., 2009; Orta et al., 2020c). Birds are usually seen singly, in pairs or family groups, even on migration, with larger groups being rare except at rich winter feeding sites and wintering communal roosts, where it usually joins other small fal- cons (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Clark and Davies, 2018). Individuals hunt mainly birds and flying insects, but also bats, small mammals and reptiles, and they are often more active at dawn and dusk (Clark and Davies, 2018). They also kleptoparasitise other small raptors by stealing their prey (Clark and Davies, 2018). Eurasian hobbies breed in open wooded areas, using corvid nests (and also other raptors' nests, del Hoyo et al., 1994), so they do not nest until summer when corvid nests are available, and this also coincides with more passerine fledglings being available to feed their chicks (Clark and Davies, 2018). They breed in oak woods and pine forests in North Africa (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005) and avoid completely deforested areas (del Hoyo et al., 1994). The clutch typically consists of three eggs (Orta et al., 2020c). In winter the species may be found in a wide variety of habitats, including woodlands, savannas, grasslands, wetlands, agricultural areas, town parks and mountain grasslands (Clark and Davies, 2018). Although it does not have strict habitat requirements, it is very sensitive to human disturbance. THREATS The clearing of old forest patches has caused local declines (Orta et al., 2020c). Agricultur- al intensification threatens Eurasian hobbies through the clear-felling of nesting trees and the reduction in prey such as insects and farmland birds (Sergio et al., 2001). Pesticide use against locusts has been reported as a potential threat in wintering grounds (Sergio et al., 2001), and so this could be an additional threat within this re- gion too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "359b0edd-4220-49c9-a570-c5902b5e524d": {"__data__": {"id_": "359b0edd-4220-49c9-a570-c5902b5e524d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d044a8df4c002ab9d0a5c1d935cfdc2643199fdd5db4741de89f1da6a931a8da"}, "2": {"node_id": "235c69cb-9ce8-4177-a06f-8e2655c22981", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5334d8bb9b3df6ce6c1b26cd71872b89264a32a4f828a509ef3965b70346304d"}}, "hash": "0ef9c0f5e3d08b2d0c5ad1117b0504e0c9620cce4bd6282347a118da39b38119", "text": "However, pesticide poisoning has likely had only minor impacts, as has egg collecting, which tends to be a local issue (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). \u00a9 IUCN Distribution range of the Eurasian hobby, Falco subbuteo - Linnaeus, 1758 in North Africa.

Woodlands should also be managed appropriately, avoiding the complete removal of all trees. The provision of artificial nests can also help this species when there is a lack of natural nests of other species for it to use. Policies should also look to control hunting along migration routes. Additionally, suitable impact assessments should be conducted for wind energy developments, especially in the southern part of the Strait of Gibraltar. Surveys and monitoring of the population should be conducted to determine, protect and manage potential breeding sites and key dispersal areas, including migration corridors in the western and eastern flyways. Other key research should investigate this species\u2019 migration strategies and ranging behaviour by deploying GPS loggers. In addition, as this species is migratory, work should not only focus on North Africa; wintering areas and their ecological requirements and threats should be identified to protect them; and further research is needed to determine any additional potential threats to the species in North Africa and its wintering grounds. More broadly, work is needed to increase awareness of biodiversity conservation. Assessor(s): Cherkaoui, I., Rousselon, K., Onrubia, A., Radi, M. & Fellous-Djardini, A.

There are signs of decline in the past for the Maghreb subpopulation, but currently the species is considered common and thus does not seem to be in ongoing decline. Therefore, this species is listed as Near Threatened C2a(ii) in North Africa. DISTRIBUTION This eagle breeds in North Africa, including Morocco, northern Algeria, north-western Tunisia and north-eastern coastal and west-central Libya (Cowan, 1982; Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005, 2016; Clark and Davies, 2018; S. Buirzayqah, pers. obs.). It has bred locally in Egypt as well and there are two recent confirmed observations of breeding pairs in Sinai and on the southern coast (A. Riad, pers. obs.). There are also recent records of breeding in Moroccan Atlantic Sahara, but they are considered isolated (Bergier et al., 2017). The Tunisian range does appear to have shrunk though, due to deforestation (Isenmann et al., 2005). A few migrants winter in North African countries, e.g. Morocco and Algeria (P. Bergier, A.

Essetti, pers. obs.), whereas in Libya only 15 breeding pairs are regularly reported (S. Buirzayqah, pers. obs.). There are also two recently confirmed sightings of breeding pairs in Sinai and on the coast of southern Egypt (A. Riad, pers. obs.). In total there are three subpopulations: a Maghreb subpopulation covering Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, a Lib- yan subpopulation and an Egyptian subpopulation. The total breeding population in North Africa is estimated at around 1,300 to 1,350 breeding pairs or 2,600\u20132,700 mature individuals. HABITATS AND ECOLOGY This species inhabits open areas but nests in a wide variety of wooded habitats (such as Acacia savanna, Ber- gier et al., 2017), from sea level up to 2,300 m elevation in Morocco (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). Although it occurs in open habitats, the species generally requires some degree of tree cover (del Hoyo et al., 1994), and it has been observed to visit oases (e.g. in Algeria, A. Fellous-Djardini, pers. obs.). It breeds from late March until early May (Is- enmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005). Nests can be found in large trees, usually in the crown, and are constructed of sticks and twigs, and lined with green leaves or grass, occasionally even pine needles (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Orta et al., 2020g). Usually only a single egg is laid (Orta et al., 2020g). Birds breeding in the Palaearctic are migratory. Migrants move south between August and November, and north between February and May (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). Breeding birds arrive at their North African nest- ing sites around February and March (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005). Birds are usually observed singly or in pairs, even during migration, though migrants sometimes form groups of up to 12 (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). During good rainy years, the species makes quite prolonged pre- nuptial migratory stopovers, individually or in pairs, south of the Atlantic Sahara, tak- ing advantage of the abundance of snakes and lizards (A. Qninba, pers. comm.). Short-toed snake-eagles prey primarily on snakes and lizards, but also take mice, amphibians and birds, and hunt them from the air, spending much of their time hov- ering and kiting (Clark and Davies, 2018).

The growth and spread of the human population has resulted in disturbance of raptors and destruction of their habitats, especially in forests because of the use of wood as fuel for cooking and heating and the felling of large trees (which are used for nesting) to clear land for crops and livestock (Bergier, 1987; Stuart and Collar, 1988; Garrido et al., 2005; Vernon et al., 2005; Cherkaoui et al., 2009; BirdLife Inter- national, 2018a; Teller\u00eda et al., 2019). This is of particular importance for this species because it seeks suitable habitats outside the most populated areas (Teller\u00eda et al., 2019). In addition, snake populations may have been reduced by the increase in monocultures, hedge destruction, pesticide use and the abandonment of traditional farmland and subsequent afforestation.

NORTH AFRICA REGIONAL ASSESSMENT: NEAR THREATENED (NT) C2a(ii); D1 (IUCN version 3.1) This species occurs over a wide range, with a resident population estimated to be around 1,500 mature indi- viduals in a single subpopulation. There are signs of decline in the past in Morocco, but currently the species is considered common and thus does not seem to be in ongoing decline. Therefore, this species is listed as Near Threatened C2a(ii); D1 in North Africa. DISTRIBUTION The western marsh-harrier breeds mainly in north-western Africa. The subspecies Circus aeruginosus ssp. harterti is an uncommon, local breeding resident in marshes and reed wetlands of northern Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, and the subspecies C. a. ssp. aeruginosus is a fairly common winter visitor and passage migrant from Eurasia (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005; Clark and Davies, 2018). In Algeria the species breeds from the coast to the Saharan Atlas, with confirmation of breeding in the Eastern Erg (Oued Righ); (A. Fellous-Djardini, pers. obs.). There are doubts about its breeding in northern coastal Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016) and northern Egypt (Goodman and Meiniger, 1989; OSME, 2019). The species winters in the same range but also south to the Moroccan Sahara (Bergier et al., 2017), in northern Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016; Clark and Davies, 2018) and in the Nile Delta and Valley (Clark and Davies, 2018). The Eurasian subspecies also occurs as a passage migrant in all North African countries (Clark and Davies, 2018). The creation of new oases by irrigation projects in Libya resulted in attractive new habitats for migrant birds, leading to reduced mortality from migration through the desert (Isenmann et al., 2016). POPULATION In the 1980s, there were an estimated 500 breeding pairs in Morocco, but numbers have declined since then (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). The nesting population in Tunisia was estimated at 50 to 70 breeding pairs in 2005 (Isenmann et al., 2005) and the species is considered an irregular breeder there. In Algeria it is considered a common breeder NT \u00a9 Joan Sala 78 (A. Fellous-Djardini, pers. obs.) and even abundant in some areas in the western part of the country (H. Benmammar, pers. obs.). Overall the breeding population in North Africa is estimated to be around 1,500 mature individuals.

It is found mostly in marshes, reed beds and farmland, but also in coastal creeks, mudflats, sewage dumps, mangrove swamps (Clark and Davies, 2018) and arid areas. It is a generalist predator taking a variety of prey types, with small birds generally preferred (del Hoyo et al., 1994). In winter, it also feeds on carrion (Clark and Davies, 2018). The species nests in North Africa from early February to June (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann et al., 2005). A breeding pair builds a large nest of many materials, including sticks and reeds, on dry ground in wet areas and occasionally on dry farmland and raises from one to four chicks (Clark and Davies, 2018). It breeds at up to 2,000 m elevation at the Moroccan Middle Atlas lakes (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003). In North Africa it is sedentary, but C. a. aeruginosus is migratory and migrants pass through from mid-August to early November (mainly in the second half of September). Spring passage is from late February to early May, reaching a peak in mid-March to mid-April, with males preceding females. Some thousands of these migrant birds winter in the region (A.

Re- cent observations north of the Atlantic Sahara (March 2020) confirm that the western marsh-harrier migrates in mixed groups with Circus pygargus (A. Qninba and F. Cuzin, pers. obs.). Hundreds of birds occasionally gather at roosting sites, sometimes with other harriers such as C. pygargus, but otherwise they are usually solitary, associating only tem- porarily at especially rich feeding sites (Snow and Perrins, 1998; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Orta et al., 2020h). THREATS No major threats to this raptor are reported at the regional level. Potential threats might include wetland desicca- tion and drainage, and pollution. However, the species has been recorded in some wetlands contaminated with organic pollutants in Algeria (A. Fellous-Djardini, pers. comm., 2020). Nests may be destroyed by human activities and chicks captured by young men to sell in markets, and the species may also be affected by feral dogs (Red List review workshop Tunisia, 2020).

NORTH AFRICA REGIONAL ASSESSMENT: NEAR THREATENED (NT) D1 (IUCN version 3.1) Although the number of individuals in North Africa is small (1,100\u20131,800 mature individuals) and distributed in a single subpopulation, current population data from Egypt indicate that previous surveys may have underestimat- ed populations and that the species is not in continuous decline. The species is assessed as Near Threatened under criterion D1. DISTRIBUTION The species' breeding records are discontinuously and highly locally distributed from the Libyan Desert east- wards through Egypt, including the Sahara Desert, the east coast and the Red Sea islands (Gallo-Orsi et al., 2014, unpublished; Isenmann et al., 2016; Clark and Davies, 2018; Habib, 2019b). The majority of the population winters in Madagascar, but an unknown proportion winters in coastal Mozambique and South Africa (Clark and Davies, 2018). It migrates through Libya and Egypt, with vagrants recorded in Tunisia and Algeria (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005). POPULATION The Egyptian population was estimated at 190 breeding pairs in 2012\u201317, a drop of 27% in less than two decades (Habib, 2019b). However, more recent surveys in the western desert have indicated that a better estimate of the population in Egypt may be in the range of 300\u2013400 pairs, and the previous figure may have underestimated the population size, and in fact the species is not in continuous decline (A. Riad, pers. obs.). In Libya, 250\u2013500 breed- ing pairs are estimated to exist (S.

It nests in a hole or on a cliff ledge, but sometimes at other sites such as old herons\u2019 nests and camel markets (Clark and Davies, 2018). Clutches consist of two or three, occasionally four eggs (Jennings, 2010). Eggs are laid from July to August and young birds are fed with migrant passerines (Isenmann et al., 2016). It is a migratory species; birds arrive in their wintering grounds in Madagascar and south-east Africa from late October, and return to their breeding sites in April (del Hoyo et al., 1994). During migration, they occur in a variety of well-watered open habitats (Clark and Davies, 2018). Migrants generally travel singly, in pairs or in small flocks (Brown et al., 1982; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). In the non-breeding season these birds are gregarious and forage for large insects over grasslands and open habitats, while small mammals, bats and fish have also been found in their diet (Clark and Davies, 2018).

CONSERVATION Conservation and research actions in place: CITES Appendix II. CMS Appendix II. There is a draft Interna- tional Single Species Action Plan (Gallo-Orsi et al., 2014, unpublished). Conservation and research actions needed: Awareness of the species should be raised. Research should be conducted to inventory, survey and monitor the population to determine, protect and manage potential breed- ing sites and key dispersal areas, including migration corridors. Research on the ecology of breeding, non-breed- ing and migrating birds is needed, involving GPS tagging and on-the-ground investigations, to assess potential threats to the species. Habitats should be protected in the species\u2019 wintering areas as well as along some of its migratory routes, while within North Africa the provision of nest boxes or suitable rock shelters for nesting might enhance the breeding populations in some areas. The proposed draft International Single Species Action Plan should be completed, and efforts should be made to decrease poaching and the illegal trade as much as possible and to control the export of wild birds.

Although the population was decreasing in the past, it is currently increasing in some localities thanks to increased monitoring and restricted access to the islands. Some threats such as poisoning, distur- bance by people, nest disturbance and predation are still ongoing in some areas. Emerging threats from tourism activities could affect the main subpopulation in Morocco in the future if access restrictions are not maintained in the long term. The introduction of predators to the islands is also a potential threat which could drastically reduce the number of nest sites, the area of occupancy and the number of mature individuals, especially if it affects the main colony in Morocco. The species is evaluated as Near Threatened under criterion B2ab(v) based on the number of locations, small area of occupancy and high dependency on current conservation actions, especially restrictions on access to breeding colonies. DISTRIBUTION The species breeds only in colonies on islands in the Mediterranean Sea and along the north-west coast of Africa (Clark and Davies, 2018). There are ten colonies in total in the region from the Atlantic coast of Morocco (Sidi Moussa cliffs [Sal\u00e9] and Essaouira islands), through Algeria (western islands in Oran\u2013Honaine and eastern islands in Collo\u2013Annaba) to Tunisia (Galite Islands and Fratelli Islands) (Azafzaf, 2004; Rguibi et al., 2012a; Qninba et al., 2015a; Peyre et al., 2018; Cuzin, 2019).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60df6df9-31fa-4d04-9e21-e8564d33547e": {"__data__": {"id_": "60df6df9-31fa-4d04-9e21-e8564d33547e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "636701dc5035ee1099712c861be1555a258cbd8dda870ddb25b18034f32fdbae"}, "2": {"node_id": "16a9bfde-f6e8-424d-b14b-52ccc7edd0b4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fe22556773138e713fad94b56ae4501dd7efa71f39ffbd9c1c8e06853b05c17"}}, "hash": "e8142dc83b1b7cd12c5c0707981c0f95802df0645a3db953c8048caa51e4fa46", "text": "The entire population migrates in autumn to winter mainly in Madagascar but also in the islands of R\u00e9union, Mauritius and Rodrigues as well as eastern and south-eastern Africa (Clark and Davies, 2018), crossing nearly the whole of Africa including the Sahara desert (L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009).

Based on these estimates, the total regional population could fall in the range of 2,000\u20132,200 pairs (4,400 mature individuals). The population is increasing throughout the species' North African range (Rguibi et al., 2012a; Qninba et al., 2016; Peyre et al., 2018), basically thanks to direct and indirect conservation actions which restrict access to the colo- nies. The largest colony in the Essaouira Archipelago in Morocco has doubled its population since 2010 (Cuzin, 2019). However, some small colonies are decreasing and some have even gone extinct in Algeria and Morocco (Touati et al., 2017; Cuzin, 2019). HABITATS AND ECOLOGY Eleonora\u2019s falcon occurs on islands and coastal cliffs during the breeding season (Rguibi et al., 2012a; Clark and Davies, 2018) and hunts in the coastal area, moving up to a few tens of kilometres in search of food in various environments (dunes, river mouths, steppes, cultivated land, cities etc.) (Cuzin, 2019). It occurs in a wide variety of habitats on migration, including coastal seas, islands, islets, open forests, woodlands, savannas, grasslands, agricultural areas, wetlands and deserts (L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009; Clark and Davies, 2018). The species is fully migratory, leaving its Mediterranean breeding grounds in October and November to winter in Madagascar, East Africa and the Mascarene Islands (Clark and Davies, 2018). The return journey begins in late April and May (Orta et al., 2020f). They are generally gregarious (though sometimes solitary), tending to move in small, loose flocks, and on migration often associate with other species flying at high altitudes, including Falco subbuteo (Snow and Perrins, 1998; Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001). Eleonora's falcons nest in colonies numbering from a few up to a hundred or more pairs during late summer and early autumn at strategic sites where they can hunt migrant passerines and other small birds like common hoo- poes (Upupa epops), swifts (Apus sp.) or European turtle-doves (Streptopelia turtur) to feed their chicks (Rguibi et al., 2012a; Clark and Davies, 2018). It has been estimated that about one and a half million small migrating birds are consumed annually by the large falcon colony in the Essaouira islands in Morocco (Rguibi et al., 2012b). Eleonora\u2019s falcons even keep some of their captured prey alive as a form of fresh food storage behaviour (Qninba et al., 2015b). They are mainly insectivorous outside the breeding season, feeding predominantly on cicadas, locusts, grasshoppers and Coleoptera in their winter quarters, and they only hunt while flying (Rguibi et al., 2012a; Clark and Davies, 2018). Birds nest in the holes and ledges of sea cliffs, or on the ground, never far from the sea (del Hoyo et al., 1994; Rguibi et al., 2012a). Clutches usually consist of two or three eggs, laid in late July (Orta et al., 2020f). The female broods for 28\u201333 days and during this period is supplied with food by the male; the young birds remain in the nest for 28\u201335 days (Rguibi et al. 2012a).

The entire North African region faces the problem of raptor poaching for illegal trade, and falcons are the main species affected (Bergier, 1987; Emile et al., 2014; Brochet et al., 2016; Elhalawani, 2016; MaghrebOrnitho, 2019b,c). In Egypt, Eleonora's falcons may be also trapped for use as lures to attract other target species (Porter, 2005; BirdLife International, 2015). In Libya, individuals are trapped for falconry and fetch high prices on the national market (K. Etayeb, pers. comm.), and in Morocco chicks are collected from the Sal\u00e9 colony and sold in the markets of Sal\u00e9 and Rabat. Human disturbance and urbanisation associated with tourism development has also been reported to negatively influence birds\u2019 breeding success (Mart\u00ednez-Abra\u00edn et al., 2002; Orta et al., 2020f; Touati et al., 2017; Peyre et al.,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "276217c7-5fb9-4c43-a90a-eaae6d0fa723": {"__data__": {"id_": "276217c7-5fb9-4c43-a90a-eaae6d0fa723", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "55b2a6c3b03bd39e12591b016d409d1a3ec3fb1cb8fad7339d50a9e160ef1dab"}, "3": {"node_id": "a4905ea3-70e6-48eb-8caf-766f9797b052", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8b1bd68a2fe5dd88b0ec33e089cd01144f5a8e5a4ec2b7db510e2aa0fc2e2c5"}}, "hash": "524b458ae11006c7231711a207cc15b1386f79f81f0718863ddcf40e7b66e269", "text": "2018; M. Saheb, pers. obs.), particularly in relation to the decline of the only breeding colony on the mainland in Morocco, at Sal\u00e9 (Rguibi et al., 2012b; Cuzin, 2019). Urban expansion is pushing this colony towards the north- ern cliffs of Sal\u00e9. The colony in the Essaouira Archipelago is also threatened by the development of large tourist projects on the stretch of coast opposite the Archipelago, in particular around the mouth of Oued Ksob, where Eleonora's falcons find fresh water for bathing and drinking; in this regard, the construction of a dam upstream on Oued Ksob has stopped the summer water flow and falcons are currently forced to go much further upstream to find temporary pools (A. Qninba, pers. obs.). Predation by rats, cats, dogs and yellow-legged gulls (Larus michahellis) is also important on some breeding islands (Ferguson-Lees and Christie, 2001; Rguibi et al., 2012a; Touati et al., 2017; Cuzin, 2019). Interspecific competition with Scopoli\u2019s shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) for nesting crevices has also been found in Algeria (Touati et al., 2017). Additionally, pollution by ornithocide substances was thought to be responsible for the de- cline in some breeding populations (Rguibi et al., 2012a), and on Hadibas Island (Algeria) some adult falcons have been found poisoned with rodenticides (M. Saheb, pers. obs.). The species is also sensitive to the effects of wind energy developments (STRIX, 2012). It is important to note that Eleonora\u2019s falcon is a long-distance migrant and, hence, population changes may be influenced by factors occurring in widely separated breeding and non-breeding areas and during migration (L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez et al., 2009; Mellone et al., 2013). The importance of humid forests for the conservation of the Ele- onora\u2019s falcon should be of concern, given the current loss of this habitat in Madagascar (Mellone et al., 2012). CONSERVATION Conservation actions in place: CMS Appendix II. CITES Appendix II. Barcelona convention: Annex II. An In- ternational Species Action Plan was published in 1999 (Ristow, 1999) and was reviewed in 2010. Since 2005 the Conservatoire du Littoral has been coordinating an international programme for promoting and assisting with the management of small Mediterranean islands, known as the PIM Initiative, which is financed by the Fonds Fran\u00e7ais pour l\u2019Environnement Mondial (FFEM \u2013 French Global Environment Facility), the Agence de l\u2019eau Rh\u00f4ne M\u00e9diter- ran\u00e9e\u2013Corse and the City of Marseille. This programme has supported monitoring programmes in Tunisia and Morocco, where Eleonora\u2019s falcon has been monitored for a long time at its main colony in the Essaouira islands (Qninba et al., 2016). Research on the species has been conducted in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. A net expan- sion of the species has been observed in Morocco thanks to the end of direct persecution (Rguibi et al., 2012a). In Morocco, the species is included in the preparation of a raptor conservation strategy (https://www.iucn.org/ news/mediterranean/202001/first-steps-towards-a-moroccan-strategy-raptor-conservation-iucns-guidance).

Effective actions to protect coastal areas should be implemented and Environmental Impact Assessments conducted on all developments in coastal areas. National and international coastal tourism policies should discourage the development of new resorts and favour environ- mentally friendly, sustainable tourism, especially around the only mainland colony in Morocco. 84 Although some colonies are currently undisturbed because access is limited, all colonies should be protected from intrusion by employing staff to monitor and guard the colonies, if necessary, and banning access from 1 July to 1 November.

It used to be widespread in Morocco during winter (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003) but the number of migrant birds has declined from several hundred in the 1980s to a few dozen currently due to climate change; the same might be happening throughout North Africa (Mart\u00edn et al., 2014). Hen harrier Circus cyaneus NA Rare winter visitor from Eurasia to the Mediterranean coast of North Africa, which is the southern edge of its wintering range (Clark and Davies, 2017). Scarce winter visitor in Morocco down to the Saharan coast (Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Bergier et al., 2017), Algeria (Isenmann and Moali, 2000), Tunisia (Isenmann et al., 2005) and Libya (Isenmann et al., 2016). It also occurs inland and along the River Nile in Egypt (Clark and Davies, 2017). Lesser spotted eagle Clanga pomarina NA This species breeds in central and eastern Europe and Iran, wintering in Africa (Bosch and Meyburg, 2012) with marginal breeding in Algeria (Isenmann and Moali, 2000). The breeding population migrates over Israel and Egypt in spring and au- tumn (Krumenacker, 2013; BirdLife International, 2016), and over the Strait of Gibraltar and Italy to pass through Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya (Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005; Onrubia et al., 2011; Bosch and Meyburg, 2012; Isenmann et al., 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdd834e3-a229-45e7-aa2f-f9de01775e5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdd834e3-a229-45e7-aa2f-f9de01775e5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The conservation status and distribution of the breeding birds of prey of North Africa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c933675178f9b2bd60bce9c3e0c177d4f078cb325409eb9b1cc1cd06eadf626"}, "2": {"node_id": "04b22350-08f8-487e-a397-9082964aa70d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/conservation-status-and-distribution-breeding-birds-prey-north-africa", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59e841ec9b1ced00b1fcc3a9a69b90ccc12f293e1e3707cfc526426cb4a29635"}}, "hash": "14ecb8950e620dd88b7758fa96ad7ea4837516d863ab28b33888aaaa49f29d58", "text": "White-tailed eagle Haliaeetus albicilla NA This species breeds and winters in Asia, northern and eastern Europe and south-eastwards to the eastern side of the Per- sian Gulf (BirdLife International, 2016), with marginal breeding in Algeria until the last quarter of the 20th century (1\u20132 pairs in 1975, Isenmann and Moali, 2000), Egypt in 19th century (Goodman and Meininger, 1989) and maybe Tunisia (Heim de Balsac and Mayard, 1962). It is now a very rare winter vagrant in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt (Goodman and Meininger, 1989; Th\u00e9venot et al., 2003; Isenmann and Moali, 2000; Isenmann et al., 2005; Clark and Davies, 2018).

As these changes take hold and negative effects accelerate, it will be important to keep track of the full impact of such issues in order take the necessary mitigation and adaptation actions that are needed to keep our activities in proper balance with the natural world. A central aspect of this is fully understanding the changes and impact our actions are having on the ocean, which provides most of the living space for species on the planet and has a central role in regulating global temperature and climate. In 2018 IUCN, in partnership with AXA XL, produced a landmark report on ocean risk. Not only did this report define, for the first time, what ocean risk is in terminology that resonates with the global insurance industry, but it also tracked major changes already happening in the ocean and how their effects ripple out into society. The 2018 report also postulated that the full impact of ocean risk was not only increasingly financially significant at global, regional, and national levels but remained under-assessed.

This report is a follow on and update from the 2018 report and explores whether there is a case to answer for better analysis and understanding of ocean risk, leading to a more accurate assessment of costs and impacts. The report updates information around the five original focal areas: extreme weather events, coral bleaching, harmful algal blooms, food security via fisheries and aquaculture, and human health and disease. It also analyses this from the national perspective using the case examples from three Western Indian Ocean countries: Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania. These case studies show that sea-level rise is an increasing threat on some densely populated areas and extreme weather events are likely to increase with ever greater unpredictable consequences. Mass coral bleaching events are occurring with increasing regularity and are potentially of major concern. The full extent of the impact of climate change on artisanal fisheries is as yet unquantified. Harmful algal blooms are having an increasing impact on human health especially those working in the marine environment. The work concludes, from the global and regional observations in this report, that ocean risk is material. For many hazards, impacts are both already significant and increasing. It recommends that more in-depth assessment is urgently needed to inform policy makers, investors, insurers, and communities about the substantive and rising costs of these impacts on developing countries, and the extent to which ocean risks impact economic and subsistence activities.

Introduction 1 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities 1. Introduction The ocean has always presented humanity with a mix of substantive opportunities and serious threats. From bountiful fisheries to devastating storms, the ocean has impacted human societies and settlements for centuries. What is different today, however, is the scale of these impacts and the increasing risk of negative impacts. Globalisation, as evidenced in the increasing scale and scope of global trade and the extraction of resources \u2013 including fish and other marine resources \u2013 is increasing our demand for ocean goods and services. Our ever-expanding technical and financial capacity is enabling us to harvest the ocean at unsustainable levels. At the same time, environmental pressures on the ocean \u2013 climate change, plastic waste, land-based pollution \u2013 are also increasing, resulting in disruptive ocean events as never seen before. This report highlights what is known about the economic value, cost and losses associated with five major global issues: extreme weather events, coral bleaching, harmful algal blooms, food security via fisheries and aquaculture, and human health and disease. The aim of this report is straightforward \u2013 to make the case for better assessment and management of ocean risk. This is achieved by first observing what is known about ocean risk regarding several key issues and by looking at three Western Indian Ocean countries. This is followed by a discussion of what is not known and should be known in order to better assess and manage ocean risk. The report ends with a call to develop a more strategic approach to ocean risk assessment and management at the national level. In particular, the report hopes to stimulate discussions around the following questions: \u2022 What are the major economic sectors at risk in the country/region? \u2022 Who would need to be involved in national or regional-level talks? Government officials? Private sector representatives? Universities? NGOs? \u2022 How much capacity is there already for monitoring changes in ocean-related economic trends? \u2022 Can ocean risk management be integrated into countries national strategies and approaches to natural disaster risk reduction? 1.

The experts discussed the nexus between hazards, exposure, and risks and agreed on the following relationship: Hazard x Exposure Vulnerability = Degree of ocean risk They then proceeded to draw up an initial list of potential ocean hazards, which included the following: Changes in ocean physics and chemistry Methane Acidification Changes in ocean chemistry Rising temperature and stratification Ocean currents", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "491f7b46-80c9-4805-9bcf-e68e10b6593e": {"__data__": {"id_": "491f7b46-80c9-4805-9bcf-e68e10b6593e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "128c0de8da1883eb19f5161c2d23b567706f56a77c4b836538cd810afbec85e7"}}, "hash": "128c0de8da1883eb19f5161c2d23b567706f56a77c4b836538cd810afbec85e7", "text": "and winds Hypoxia Nutrient changes The workshop explored the risks of ocean hazards and the potential impacts of these risks on coastal communities. They concluded with the recommendation that: The true financial costs of ocean risk impacts - such as extreme storm events, coral bleaching and harmful algal blooms - is unclear, either in terms of total number of events or in terms of the total scale of impacts. This means that the impacts are not fully assessed because events are seldom isolated and they are rarely without multiplier effects. Moving forward, it will be important to gather more consistent and in-depth facts on the true scale of what is happening, including the knock-on effects on small to medium-sized enterprises that are often the life-blood of the economy. This report responds to this recommendation by highlighting what is known and what yet needs to be known about ocean risks.

It set out to \u201cexplore the hazards and risks associated with ocean warming from a variety of angles, and by using innovative graphics, look at how these \u2018simple\u2019 temperature-related changes to the ocean can ripple out into many aspects of society.\u201d These ripple effects are used in this report as the investigative framework for further research to identify what is known, and what is not known, about the economic risks of climate change. The ripple effect of ocean risks was investigated for 5 key areas: \u2022 extreme weather events; \u2022 human health and diseases; \u2022 harmful algal blooms; \u2022 coral bleaching; and \u2022 food security via fisheries and aquaculture. These ripple effects were set out in bubble diagrams. The right-hand sections of these diagrams \u2013 reproduced here \u2013 provided the investigative framework for further research on finding out what we know and what we should know about the changing risk landscape. Extreme weather events The societal vulnerability to risks arising from extreme weather events include the following costs: \u2022 Costs to life \u2022 Costs to property and infrastructure \u2022 Costs to repair and insure \u2022 Costs to operate \u2022 Costs to income \u2022 Costs to recreation and tourism \u2022 Costs to agriculture What do we know and what do we need to know about these costs? 2.

For instance, traditional sectors such as fisheries are seeing ever-increasing demands on already-declining stocks. These pressures come not only from climate impacts, but also from 2. Background 7 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities overfishing and from more recent and growing sectors such as tourism and aquaculture, which are vital sources of revenue for many of the poorest communities in developing countries and regions. Considering these challenges, it is somewhat surprising that no comprehensive figures exist on the scale and nature of economic impacts already being felt by affected local communities and others throughout the world. The research undertaken by IUCN confirms that we know a good deal about what is happening, but we still do not have a comprehensive understanding of the cumulative impacts, particularly in terms of costs. Not knowing these figures is hampering the assessments of the scale, nature, and urgency of the actual investments needed to counter these problems. The research also highlights that several distinct areas of work related to development, disaster risk reduction, climate change and particular economic sectors each have their own distinct approaches to some aspects of ocean risk, although none comprehensively incorporate all ocean risks. 2.3.1 Disaster risk reduction and ocean risk Globally, annual economic losses to all types of disasters due to natural hazards has increased from US$ 14 billion in 1985 to US$ 140 billion in 2014 (UNDRR, 2019). Partial information on the scale and nature of economic impacts from disasters are available from resources provided by - and supporting - global efforts on disaster risk reduction, including: the knowledge platform on disaster risk reduction1, the disaster loss data for the Sustainable Development Goals and Sendai Framework Monitoring System2, and the International Disasters Database (EM- DAT)3. Unfortunately, even with these global databases, economic data are not provided for over 60% of disaster reports in EM-DAT (CRED, 2018). 1 https://www.preventionweb.net/knowledgebase/disaster-statistics 2 https://www.desinventar.net/ 3 https://www.emdat.be/ Economic data and information are most available regarding geophysical hazards (earthquakes, volcanoes, and mass movement), hydrological hazards (floods and landslides), meteorological hazards (storms and extreme temperatures) and climatological hazards (droughts and wildfires) (CRED, 2018). Biological hazards including disease, pests/infestations, biotoxins and harmful algal blooms are less commonly reported to these global platforms. In addition, many platforms are inconsistent in what and how they report, with large gaps for developing countries on economic costs and little information on many ocean risks such as coral bleaching, harmful algal blooms and human health and diseases. Impacts of disasters on economic sectors such as fisheries or tourism are rarely reported using a standardised approach or incorporated consistently into global databases. 2.3.2 Climate change and ocean risk The IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) highlights the range of hazards and risks that have been, and will continue to be, exacerbated by climate change (IPCC, 2019). The physical changes to the ocean (temperature, oxygen, acidity and sea level) will affect all ocean and coastal ecosystems with knock-on effects on human systems and ecosystem services (fisheries, tourism, transportation/shipping, cultural services, and carbon sequestration) (IPCC, 2019). Climate change has increased the severity and extent of hazards, while population growth, coastal and ocean-based economic activities and socio-economic development have increased the exposure of people and their assets to these hazards. Whilst adaptation actions are being taken, it seems highly likely that they will not be achieved at the speed or scale commensurate with the ocean risks now being faced, with the poorest communities likely to be the most affected. 2.

Economic costs represent a growing problem. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) covered an almost 40 year range, from 1970 to 2012, and reported economic losses of US$ 2.4 trillion (Golnaraghi et al., 2014). These figures seem to be validated by other studies, which report losses of US$ 1.4 trillion, between 1980 and 2004 (Mills, 2005) and US$ 1.5 trillion between 2003 and 2013 (Baas et al., 2015). The UNDRR estimated that economic losses were US$ 2.24 trillion from 1998 to 2017; US$ 932 billion more than those reported for the prior 20-year period (i.e. from 1978 to 1997) (Wallemacq and House, 2018). Considered together, the reports show an overall increase in economic costs associated with extreme weather events, despite the systematic underreporting of the losses in developing countries. Surprisingly, while high- income countries reported losses from 53% of disasters between 1998 and 2017, low-income countries only reported them from 13%. No data are thus available on the losses incurred by 87% of the disasters in low income countries (Wallemacq and House, 2018). Costs to operate Global growth could be hindered by rising operational costs as the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events increase. In the worst-case, this could reduce annual GDP growth by up to 1% (Wade and Jennings, 2015). The transportation departments (Venner and Zamurs, 2012) and power industries (Campbell and Lowry, 2012) are expected to be the most heavily impacted by rising maintenance costs, although very few data exist on these topics. 3. Evidence of impacts globally 10 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Costs to life A key risk area from the potential increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events is the costs to life, not only in terms of lives lost, but also people who suffer from health problems (physical injuries and psychological trauma) or displacement from their homes from an extreme weather event. The saddest and most troubling cost remains the number of fatalities caused by extreme weather events, which stands at 967,616 for the period ranging from 1900 to 2015 (Bouwer and Jonkman, 2018) and 552,766 in the period ranging from 1998 to 2017 (Wallemacq and House, 2018). In 2018 alone, extreme weather events claimed more than 13,500 victims (Swiss Re, 2018). Costs to property and infrastructure Extreme weather events are thought to inflict US$ 18 billion worth of damage a year to power and transport infrastructure in low- and middle-income countries. Natural disasters also cause significant disruptions to infrastructure that are thought to be worth between US$ 391 billion and US$ 647 billion a year to households and private firms. Water infrastructure systems such as reservoirs, groundwater pumps, and transmission lines are extremely vulnerable to natural disasters. However, no information currently exists on the economic cost absorbed by these sectors (Hallegatte et al., 2019). Costs to repair and insure In terms of annual losses, estimates since 1980 have ranged from a few billion US dollars to more than 300 billion, and still, these estimates do not include indirect and intangible losses (Handmer et al., 2012; Hoeppe, 2016). Annual material damage from extreme weather events increased 8-fold between the 1960s and the 1990s, and insured damage increased 17-fold (Mechler and Kundzewicz, 2010). More recent losses have been among the highest on record. The losses associated with extreme weather topped US$ 330 billion in 2017, of which US$ 135 billion was insured (Munich Re, 2017). While in 2018, losses amounted to US$ 165 billion, with US$ 85 billion insured. These two pay-outs represent the first and fourth largest annual pay- outs of all time. (For comparison, the previous 10-year annual average was US$ 71 billion). Figure 1. The increase in insured catastrophe losses between 1970 and 2018. Source: SwissRe 3.

It is much easier to calculate the costs of extreme weather events on corporate income. In the financial year of 2017, for example, 500 companies publicly stated that extreme weather events reduced their revenue (S&P Global Ratings, 2018), yet only 18 companies quantified the effect. The average reduction amounted to 6% (S&P Global Ratings, 2018). Costs to recreation and tourism Recreation is conducted in proximity to the home, whereas tourism involves an overnight stay. Recreational activities are not expected to be heavily impacted by extreme weather events; people will simply switch activities or seasons in which they practise their hobby. Tourism on the other hand, will be much more heavily impacted by extreme weather events. The tourism industry is one of the world\u2019s largest, accounting for 9% of global GDP and generating more than US$ 6 trillion in revenue each year (Handmer et al., 2012). The majority of assessments to date have been carried out in the Caribbean region because of its disproportionate reliance on tourism for GDP (Layne, 2017). A 2016 report from CISL reported that the costs of rebuilding tourist resorts as a result of sea level rises of 1m would be between US$ 10 billion and US$ 23.3 billion. The cost of extreme weather events for Barbados alone, were estimated to range from US$ 5.127 billion (129% of GDP) to US$ 7.648 billion (193% of GDP) (ECLAC, 2011). 3.2 Coral bleaching Coral reefs provide a range of ecosystem services including coastal protection, recreation, and tourism. They also act as nursery grounds, supporting artisanal and commercial fisheries and they are a hotspot for novel drug discovery. Estimating the global value of coral reefs is complicated because many of the values of the services they provide overlap. Nonetheless, estimates do exist. In 1997, the annual value of coral reefs was calculated as being US$ 375 billion (Costanza et al., 1997). In 2012, this value was expressed relative to the spatial extent (in hectares per year). The average value was US$ 352,915 ha-1yr-1 although values ranged from 36,794 ha-1yr-1 to 2,129,122 ha-1yr-1 (De Groot et al., 2012). In 2014, the global service estimate was revised to between US$ 9.9 trillion and US$ 21.7 trillion (Costanza et al., 2014). Valuations of coral reefs have also been conducted at the national level. The services provided by the Great Barrier Reef, Australia for example, have been valued at between AUS$ 15 billion and AUS$ 20 billion per year (Stoeckl et al., 2014), while Hawaii\u2019s reefs contribute an estimated US$ 360 million to the economy each year (Cesar et al., 2003). Coral bleaching (the characteristic whitening of coral resulting from the loss of its symbiotic algae) is threatening the very survival of coral reefs and the ecosystem services they provide. The first global mass bleaching events were reported in 1998 (Aronson et al., 2002; Baird and Marshall, 1998). The second occurred in 2010 (Alemu and Clement, 2014; Krishnan et al., 2011; Moore et al., 2012). In 2015 and 2016, NASA reported that seawater temperatures were the warmest since measurements began (Northon, 3. Evidence of impacts globally 12 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities 2017). Seventy-five per cent of the world\u2019s reefs were affected in the latter year (Hughes et al., 2018). It is widely accepted that 20% of the world\u2019s corals are dead and that the rest are under substantial threat. In this section, we will assess the effects of coral bleaching on the value of the ecosystem services provided by the reef. Costs to recreation and tourism Tourism is one of the biggest industries associated with coral reefs, and is worth at least US$\u00b036 billion to the global economy every year (Spalding et al., 2017). The average value of tourism-related income on coral reefs has been estimated to be US$ 96,300 ha-1 yr-1. Although this varies from a few hundred US$ ha-1 yr-1 for small remote reefs to over US$ 2 million ha-1 yr-1 for heavily visited reefs in the Caribbean (De Groot et al., 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6cf4ef9-62a0-4eee-a201-4f051fed66f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6cf4ef9-62a0-4eee-a201-4f051fed66f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7e39f069992932cf7ac14c1593f6ba48d6a11cd6e39e6fb57aae5b46057e1d2"}, "2": {"node_id": "06ab9e2c-7d97-49f2-8962-86e17a307046", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "493479ec9d4e1a247850f44eee60f3f8f616a1fcc3e3438dfbdbac649d6e43ef"}}, "hash": "99c60091c380041ac1b2d37a9a2ec10eda511c0ffdf754cde1dbeed01b9bdad1", "text": "Such high variability makes extrapolating values to a larger scale difficult and thus, unwise.

The GBR aside, most coral reefs are in low economic countries. This renders poor and developing countries at greater risk from the loss of revenue from tourism. In some cases, reef-related revenue represents up to 40% of a countries GDP (e.g. the Maldives and Palau (Spalding et al., 2017)). Caribbean countries are also heavily reliant on reef-related tourism (Burke et al., 2011, 2004). In 2006, the direct economic benefits of reefs provided Tobago and St. Lucia $ 43.5 million (15% of GDP) and US $ 91.6 million (11% GDP), respectively. The indirect benefits (such as the provision of boats, towels and beverages) contributed an additional US$\u00b058-86 million to Tobago, and US$ 68-102 million to St. Lucia (Burke et al., 2008).

Evidence of impacts globally 13 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Coastal defence costs Coral reefs play a critical role in wave attenuation, reducing the force of big waves, and thus protecting the coastline from flood damage and erosion (Ferrario et al., 2014; Spalding et al., 2014). In 2010, the loss of value in coastal protection from reef destruction was between US$\u00b00.011 and US$ 0.453 million per km2 (Barbier et al., 2010). Recently, a global assessment valued the coastal protection provided by reefs at more than US$ 4 billion (Beck et al., 2018). If all reefs were lost (a very real possibility if mass coral bleaching events continue to happen), annual damages are expected to double and terrestrial flooding would increase by 69% (Beck et al., 2018). The economic impact of this bleaching would be particularly felt in small island developing states such as Belize, Granada, Cuba, and Bahamas (Table 1). Table 1. Annual benefit of reefs for flood protection by country. Source: (Beck et al., 2018) Costs to income Evaluating the impacts that coral bleaching will have on income at a national or regional scale requires knowledge of the contribution of each sector to the overall economy. (Direct sectors include, for example: tourism, fisheries, protection, and indirect sectors: cultural, recreational, and research & education value). For this reason, assessments are usually conducted at the national scale. For example, many assessments have been completed in Sri Lanka (Berg et al., 1998), Hawaii (Cesar et al., 2003), the Philippines (White et al., 2000), Thailand (Seenprachawong, 2016), and Australia (Stoeckl et al., 2014). A case study from Bermuda illustrates the principles involved in assessing the costs. Sarkis et al. (2013), found that tourism provided the highest annual contribution to ecosystem service values in Bermuda, contributing US$ 406 million (56% of the total economic value; TEV), coastal protection was worth US$ 266 million (37% of TEV), recreational and cultural value was valued at US$ 37 million (5% of TEV). Amenities, fisheries, and cultural and recreational values, combined, made up the remaining 2% of TEV. 3.

The Caribbean is also expected to suffer high losses in relation to bleaching, which are estimated to range from US$ 95 million to US$ 140 million per year (Burke et al., 2004). Seaweed farming is an industry that is indirectly dependent on reefs. Seaweed farming occurs in the sheltered lagoons and bays created by coral reefs where 21 million tonnes of seaweed are produced worldwide each year (Hehre and Meeuwig, 2016) in an industry worth US$ 7.35 billion (FAO, 2012). China is the world\u2019s largest producer of seaweed, cultivating 60% of the world\u2019s production, while Indonesia (21%) and the Philippines (9%) also produce substantial amounts. The marine ornamental fish trade is another sector that might be severely affected by future coral reef ecosystem degradation. This trade provides a significant source of income for low- income nations, i.e. EUR 135 million between 2000 and 2011 (Leal et al., 2016). 3.3 Harmful algal blooms (HABs) Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are proliferations of certain noxious or toxic microalgae, macroalgae and cyanobacteria with negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems, wildlife, and human health and wellbeing (Berdalet et al., 2017). HABs can be classified as biological hazards (UNDRR, 2019). HABs can cause human fatalities, disability and illness, fish kills, mortalities and stranding of wildlife, contamination of drinking water and seafood, ecological damage through the development of anoxia or other habitat alteration (Berdalet et al., 2017). HABs cause extensive economic damage to four major economic sectors: recreation and tourism, public health, monitoring and management, and commercial fishing (Sanseverino et al., 2016). Detailed global estimates do not exist regarding the economic impact of HABs but conservative national figures suggest that annual costs exceed US$ 95 million in the USA, US$ 850 million in Europe and US$ 1 billion in Asia (Kudela et al., 2015). Due to extensive economic losses in the past caused by HABs, many governments have implemented monitoring and management programmes (Anderson 2017; Sanseverino et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2009). This has had a positive impact in reducing the costs to public health and from disposal of toxic fishery harvests from HABs. However, these costs have largely been transferred to monitoring and mitigation costs borne by the private sector, e.g. in aquaculture (closures) or the public sector, e.g. on water quality monitoring, warning systems and clean- up/disposal (Anderson 2017; Trainer et al, 2014; 3. Evidence of impacts globally 15 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Yang et al., 2018). Other industries affected by HABs include desalination processes for water supply, due to the cost of managing biofouling and the risk of biotoxins in drinking water (Anderson, 2017; Berktay, 2011; Villacorte et al., 2015). Other industries whose operating costs are vulnerable to increase due to HABs include energy and industrial activities that use seawater for cooling. Added costs include those from biofouling and reducing the risk of invasive species introductions caused by maritime transport (Anderson, 2017). European data about spending on annual HAB monitoring plans exceed global estimates on the annual costs of HABs: Denmark and Portugal spent about US$ 500,000, France US$ 800,000 and Spain (Galicia) US$ 1,114,000 4 https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/fish-processing-market-worth-22271-billion-usd-by-2021-582221241.html (Anderson et al., 2001 in Sanseverino et al., 2016). This highlights the importance attributed by European governments to monitoring and managing HABs. Since the 1980s, HABs have expanded in their range and increased in frequency, due to a combination of human introduction (e.g. aquaculture and shipping), ocean warming, marine heatwaves, oxygen loss, eutrophication, and pollution (IPCC 2019).

Costs to income Loss of income and jobs from beach and fisheries closures affects commercial and recreational fisheries, tourism and restaurant industries, property sales and rentals, as well as income and traditional food sources to local communities. Indigenous coastal communities are particularly vulnerable to acute and chronic exposure to HAB toxins due to the high consumption of seafood and ties to traditional and customary practices (Cisneros- Montemayor et al., 2016). Costs to income can be assessed at an individual level by calculating the average cost of sick days taken due to illnesses arising from HAB exposure (Kouakou and Poder, 2019).

By 2021, the market is projected to reach US$ 222.71 billion in value4. The EU estimates that 45% of the gross value of fisheries is added by the processing industry (DG MARE, 2019). The sector is an important employer, particularly for women. In 2015, 130,000 people were employed by the EU processing industry and more than EUR 30 billion was turned over by this industry (DG MARE, 2019). In Australia, AUS$ 330 million of Gross Value Added (GVA) was added by fish processing in 2017-2018, contributing AUS$165 million to total household income (FRDC, 2019). Such activities are vulnerable to disruption by fisheries closures caused by HAB events and the costs associated with monitoring and control (Anderson et al., 2017; Trainer et al., 2014). However, any loss and damage to fisheries processing industries from HAB events have not been isolated from the larger scale costs to fisheries in general. 3. Evidence of impacts globally 16 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Costs to recreation and tourism Global costs to tourism and recreation due to HAB events are not available even though these events frequently occur in most continents. In the Caribbean, West Africa, France and China, massive noxious blooms of macroalgae have displaced tourism and recreation away from affected beaches and water bodies due to huge biomass accumulation and odours released during decomposition. Toxic blooms cause closures of beaches and recreational fisheries, and even make water-based activities unpleasant or dangerous. Visual and odour effects, as well as aerosols affecting respiration, can increase the zone of impact to extend well beyond the initial location of the HAB. HAB outbreaks occur off the coast of Florida, USA on an almost annual basis wreaking havoc on the tourism industry. HABs of the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis, for example, are estimated to cost the Florida tourism industry more than US$ 20 million per year (Anderson et al., 2000), with economic losses of US$ 2.8 million and US$ 3.7 million per month assumed by the hotel and restaurant industries (Larkin and Adams, 2007). A particularly strong HAB, which occurred in the North Pacific on the coast of Washington in 2015, inflicted US$ 40 million worth of lost tourism revenue on coastal communities following the closure of popular razor clam and Dungeness crab tourist attractions (Dyson and Huppert, 2010). Algal blooms have also become an annual summer event in the China\u2019s Yellow Sea. The \u201cgreen tides\u201d of Ulva prolifera are not necessarily toxic for human health, but as the bloom peaks and then declines, the decomposition releases noxious gases. The first major algal bloom of U. prolifera occurred in 2008, during the Beijing Olympic Games, raising international awareness about the problem. The 600 km2 bloom lasted 46 days and required 5,000 people, 200 trucks and 1,185 fishing boats a day to eliminate algae from the sailing event area. This operation cost the organizers more than US$ 100 million (Wang et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2011), substantially higher than profits gained by the local seaweed (Porphyra yezoensis) aquaculture industry, which accounted for US$ 53 million (Hu et al., 2010). Costs of human poisoning from algal biotoxins Algal biotoxins affect 60,000 people per year with 1.5% of cases leading to death (GESAMP, 2001). The financial cost of health care caused by consuming contaminated seafood alone is estimated to be around US$ 4 billion a year (GESAMP, 2001). Globally the incidence rate of paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) arising from HABs increased from 1970 to 2000 (Gilbert et al., 2005; Figure 3). This increase is related to: the increase in seawater temperatures, increased shellfish consumption and higher levels of coastal eutrophication (Berdalet et al., 2015; Gilbert et al., 2005; Morabito et al., 2018).

Evidence of impacts globally 18 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Costs to fisheries and loss of production In 2003, HABs losses to fisheries (including finfish and shellfish wild harvests and aquaculture) in European coastal waters were estimated to be more than \u20ac 800 million (Scatasta et al., 2003). Similar losses in the USA are only available at the state or regional level with annual losses of US$ 20 million reported in South West Florida and US$ 43 million in Maryland (Sanseverino, 2016). In 2006, a HAB event off the coast of Zhejiang Province caused US$ 5.9 million in losses for local fisheries. In 2012, a HAB event off the adjacent Fujian Province coast decimated the farmed abalone industry, resulting in US$ 284 million in losses (Xinhua, 2017). In 2015/2016, a bloom of the diatom Pseudo-nitzschia australis broke records for extent, duration, and toxicity. The bloom, associated with an El Ni\u00f1o event, a marine heatwave (named \u201cThe Blob\u201d) and coastal upwelling, shut down the lucrative Dungeness crab fisheries on the West Coast of the US, causing losses of US$ 97.5 million (Dyson and Huppert, 2010). In 2016, 40,000 tonnes of farmed salmon in Chile (12% of annual production) were lost during a HAB, dominated by the raphidophyte Pseudochattonella, which lasted for two weeks (Cl\u00e9ment et al., 2016; Le\u00f3n-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2018). The HAB was one of the worst in recent history, causing economic losses of more than US$ 800 million; a huge part of the US$ 4.3 billion economy in Chile (Le\u00f3n-Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2018). A different algal bloom also in 2016, dominated by the floating brown macroalgae Sargassum, hit China\u2019s Yellow Sea, and caused US$ 73 million worth of losses to seaweed farmers in the Jiangsu Shoal (Xing et al., 2017).

Global losses in household income are expected to range between US$ 6-14 billion per year depending on the projected climate change scenario that is used (Lam et al., 2017). Households in developing countries are likely to suffer bigger relative losses than developed countries (estimated at US$3.9\u20138.4 billion for the former and US$1.6\u20134.2 billion for the latter). East Asia and the Pacific stand to lose the highest amount (US$6 billion per year) followed by Latin America, the Caribbean and Sub-Saharan Africa (Sumaila and Cheung, 2010). 3.

Conflicts have the potential to become extremely costly. The Council on Foreign Relations has cautioned that territorial disputes such as the on-going conflict in the South China Sea (between China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei) jeopardises the US$5 trillion worth of trade passing through the South China Sea every year5. Co-management policies that cover large marine ecosystems on a regional basis substantially reduce the risk of resource-related conflicts (Pomeroy et al., 2007). Fishing travel costs Both the commercial and recreational fishing industries are affected by the price of fuel. This determines the distance travelled by boats and, therefore, has a direct impact on the amount of fish that are caught. The distribution and/or stock levels of the target species also plays an important role in determining the catch per unit effort. Overfished stocks at low densities and smaller sized individuals require boats to travel greater distances or to deeper grounds, which increases the amount of fuel used per tonne of landings (Kelleher et al., 2009). Fuel subsidies offer a controversial means of controlling these values. Annual fuel subsidies paid to the fishing industry exceed US$ 7.7 billion (Sumaila et al., 2016). A recent study called for the abolishment of such subsidies, arguing that would be beneficial for both consumers and fishers (Lancker et al., 2019). 3. Evidence of impacts globally 20 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Viability of profits and jobs Approximately 260 million people are employed either directly, or indirectly (i.e. in associated industries) within marine fisheries. Of these people, 22 million fall into the small-scale fisher classification (i.e. are subsistence or artisanal fishers) (Teh and Sumaila, 2011). It is possible to estimate the impact that changing fish stocks and/or catch per unit effort will have on the job market, but few studies have done it. One exception was a study conducted in West Africa by Lam et al. (2013) that estimated there would be an overall loss of 50% of jobs in fisheries by 2050, relative to the year 2000. Togo, C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia were shown to be particularly high risk (Lam et al., 2012). Figure 5. Annual average change in fisheries-related jobs in West Africa. Values represent average employment in the 2050s relative to the 2000s for two climate change scenarios (high: SRES A1B and low: constant 2000 level). (Lam et al., 2012). Changes to biological interactions There is currently no information available about the economic costs that changes in marine biodiversity and ecosystem services will have on food security. However, the increasing global demand for lower-value fish used to produce animal feed for aquaculture and/or oil is a major global concern (Garcia and Rosenberg, 2010). Removing large amounts of lower trophic level fish will have a negative impact on the stocks of large predatory fish species (e.g. tuna, cod) that they feed. On the other hand, this removal will reduce predation pressure on species that occupy the lower trophic levels (e.g. krill), which could potentially become a new food source (Garcia and Rosenberg, 2010). Predicting the costs associated with changes in predator-prey interactions is highly complex. It would require complete knowledge of seasonal fluctuations in community dynamics at a regional level (Stevenson et al., 2015); the trophic structure of the ecosystem in terms of both the abundance and spatial distribution of species (Bretagnolle and Gillis, 2010); and the dispersal and severity of threats (including fishing pressure, habitat loss or gain and the introduction of non-native species), data, which are simply not available. 3.

Direct costs can include: death, medical diagnosis, treatment, investigation of outbreaks, and subsequent monitoring. Indirect costs can include: lost wages and productivity, migration costs, chronic pain and suffering, cost of psychological follow- up, mental health costs, and loss of recreational activities. Globally, marine pathogens cause approximately 250 million cases of illness a year, with 5 million annual cases of gastrointestinal illness due to bathing in contaminated water in the USA alone (Ralston et al., 2011). Currently, there are no estimates for the global economic costs associated with this. There are, however, estimates available from the USA, which place figures at approximately US$ 1 billion per year (Ralston et al., 2011). A breakdown of the costs show that US$ 350 million is spent on known marine pathogens and toxins that cause food- borne diseases; US$ 300 million is spent on seafood-borne diseases with known etiology (i.e. cases with unknown pathogenic etiology are excluded from this estimation); US$30 million of damage is caused by the Vibrio bacteria; and US$ 300 million is spent on gastrointestinal illnesses arising from bathing in contaminated water (Ralston et al., 2011). The two primary routes of transmission for marine borne disease are the consumption of contaminated seafood and direct exposure to marine pathogens in the marine environment. However, a third route of impact on human health - which deserves further attention - is the effect of anthropogenic pollution on the spread, transfer and potential exacerbation of marine-borne illnesses. The following outlines a few examples of the frequently reported illnesses associated with these transmission and impact routes, and the economic data currently available regarding the costs of these illnesses. 3. Evidence of impacts globally 22 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Shellfish and other food contamination Contaminated seafood causes more illnesses per weight consumed than any other food category (CSPI, 2015; Elbashir et al., 2018). Caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, parasites and toxins, illnesses can range from mild gastroenteritis to life-threatening symptoms (Iwamoto et al., 2010). Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable to seafood-borne illness, with an average consumption per capita that is 15 times higher than non-indigenous country populations (Cisneros-Montemayor et al., 2016). 6 http://www.fao.org/food/food-safety-quality/scientific-advice/jemra/risk-assessments/vibrio0/en/ While viruses are one of the most common cause of seafood-related infections, bacterial agents have been associated with most hospitalizations and deaths (Butt et al., 2004). Parasitic infections from seafood consumption seem more uncommon (and less costly) than bacterial or viral infections. However, the actual public health impact posed by parasites via shellfish remains unclear, largely due to severe under-reporting and the lack of data and minimal evidence of infection transmission, globally and locally (Robertson, 2007). Better monitoring is urgently required to understand the risks posed by these food-borne parasites (Singh et al., 2014). Costs of seafood-borne illness According to US studies, the acute health care costs resulting from marine-borne pathogens in the USA are estimated at approximately US$1 billion annually (Ralston et al., 2011). This includes US$350 million due to known marine pathogens and toxins that cause food-borne diseases; and US$300 million due to seafood-borne disease with known etiology (cases with unknown pathogenic etiology are excluded from this estimation). Most of the costs of seafood-borne illness are associated with premature deaths (US$300 million), followed by medical care (US$25 million) and lost productivity (US$15 million) (Ralston et al, 20116). Of all the marine-borne pathogens, Vibrio and Norovirus (Norwalk virus) are among the costliest. Vibrio spp. is the main species involved in seafood-and seawater-borne illness worldwide (with Vibrio vulnificus being the costliest). Enteric viruses, such as human noroviruses are among the most infectious, and one of the main causes of gastroenteritis worldwide (Rinc\u00e9 et al., 2018).

Despite causing a lower incidence of illness than other bacteria or pathogens, V. vulnificus is a leading cause of seafood-associated fatality, with approximately 95 cases reported with 85 hospitalizations and 35 deaths per year globally (Heng et al., 2017). Just in the USA, V. vulnificus infections account for 45 hospitalizations and 16 deaths annually (Centre for Disease Control, 2013, cited in Ralston et al, 2011). Accordingly, V.vulnificus is recognized as one of the costliest of all marine-borne pathogens, accounting for 66% of seafood-related illness health costs and 26% of the total health costs, one third of the total seafood-related illness and more than 85% of the costs of direct exposure to the Vibrio pathogen (Heng et al., 2017). Vibrio cholerae is often transmitted by contaminated drinking water, but the consumption of fish or seafood that has been in contacted with contaminated water can also serve as a frequent transmission route. There are an estimated 1.3 to 4.0 million cases of cholera per year, with 21,000 to 143,000 deaths worldwide (Ali et al, 2015 cited in WHO, 2018e). However, the global health burden and costs of cholera remain largely unknown and possibly underestimated given that most cases are not reported and, in many cases, the specific pathway of exposure to Vibrio cholerae in patients remains unknown (Chowdhury et al., 2016). Vibrios are common in marine environmental infections especially in warmer regions, where the bacteria thrive (e.g. US southeast coast, South America, Asia), whereas there are fewer cases reported in Europe7. Anthropogenic warming of ocean water, increased coastal flooding and encroachment of saltwater further inland, could further increase the risk of human interaction with pathogenic Vibrio species, such as V. vulnificus, V. cholerae, and V. parahaemolyticus (Froelich and Daines, 2020). 7 https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/91591/bacteria-thrive-as-ocean-warms 3. Evidence of impacts globally 24 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Costs of norovirus virus (NoV) While rarely causing deaths, some of the milder illnesses from seafood consumption or direct recreational exposure, such as Norovirus(Norwalk virus or NoV), can also be costly. The third most commonly reported pathogen associated with seafood in the USA (mostly from contaminated shellfish, such as molluscs and raw oysters), NoV causes 29% of all seafood- associated illnesses and 10% of hospitalisations (Iwamoto et al, 2010). In the USA alone, costs are estimated at US$18 million annually to manage an estimated 184,000 cases, making it one of the top five most costly pathogens causing marine-borne illness in the USA (Ralston et al, 2011). Most incidence and regional distribution data are available for developed countries (including USA, Europe, Japan), with a lack of incidence data from high mortality settings and low-income countries, including for example, significant data gaps in Africa (Kreidieh et al., 2017). In addition, while considerable global cost and loss data are available regarding NoV associated foodborne diseases, fewer studies quantify the global health and economic burden specifically associated with marine-borne sources (including cases with mild symptoms). Given the significant costs and losses associated with food-borne NoV cases, and the fact that 50% of NoV outbreaks are due to the consumption of contaminated shellfish (Alfano-Sobsey et al., 2012), we conclude that this deserves more detailed monitoring and surveillance. Further studies are recommended to understand the incidence and role exerted by NoV on the burden of diarrheal illnesses resulting from marine-borne sources.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa3dbc9f-94c2-4274-909d-782d22719601": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa3dbc9f-94c2-4274-909d-782d22719601", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "59927785232162ae2258a1acfc67da4a0f732213f2796c5d17f5a2905cf040bb"}, "2": {"node_id": "900e675e-15f6-45b4-9720-0be70390b8fe", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5ea0810f9f1876cdf583f6245e44f227f5a0634fa612f6eb396118eecadf3ad6"}}, "hash": "a9ddc0fd5f2d2aa3bcd14d23388abd9e872d2a93457e5e4693be6004b79b2190", "text": "Illnesses from direct marine exposure With over a million bacteria characterized as being present per mL of seawater, and 10 to 100 times as many viral particles, the risks of developing an infectious disease - from recreational or occupational uses of marine water, or exposure to beach and sand sediment, zooplankton and animals - is very high, but one that remains poorly understood (Young, 2016).

The significant transfer of ballast water (approximately 2 to 3 billion tonnes per year) from one continent to another and between oceans (Werschkun et al., 2014) poses a significant potential bacteriological risk for all international water routes. In addition, human health can be impacted through occupational and non-occupational exposure (oral, dermal and inhalation) to the disinfection-by-products (DBPs) used for ballast water treatment and disinfection, which can include chlorine (Werschkun et al., 2014). Detailed risk assessments are required to identify the incidence of transmission of pathogens and toxins causing human illness via the various exposure pathways described above; and the economic and health burden that this represents. It is unclear from current research whether it is possible to contract the COVID-19 virus from exposure to faeces in recreational waters; there are still many unknowns regarding potential transmission of this virus via sewage and wastewater (Carducci et al., 2020). Anthropogenic pollution - exacerbating human illnesses While there is significant evidence regarding the human health risks caused by bacterial and viral pathogens and marine toxins, there are much fewer studies to-date regarding how the consumption and/or exposure to anthropogenic pollutants in the marine environment affect the incidence and human health costs of marine- borne diseases. There is evidence of human infectious diseases being transferred from anthropogenic sources and spreading infections to new populations and geographic locations (Young, 2016). However, there are no data available regarding the economic and health burden that these illnesses represent. This section outlines a few examples of anthropogenic pollution (e.g. transfer of pathogens via ballast water, synthetic organic chemicals, metals and microplastics), which have the potential to adversely impact human health, cause or exacerbate human illnesses \u2013 and which deserve further study in order to understand their scale and magnitude in light of a changing ocean climate, and the health and economic burden that they represent. Costs of illnesses from direct marine exposure Given that the symptoms of marine infectious diseases from direct marine exposure (e.g. gastrointestinal, respiratory, dermatologic, and ear, nose and throat infections) are mild and often self-reported, it is a challenge to understand the true incidence of infection and associated health burden (Sridhar and Deo, 2017). Some studies estimate that approximately 250 million cases of gastroenteritis occur worldwide each year (5 million in the US) as a result of bathing in contaminated water (Ralston et al, 2011), and 50 million or more cases associated with severe respiratory disease (Shuval, 2003). While rarely causing death, there is evidence that even the milder illnesses caused by direct marine exposure can also be costly. For example, gastrointestinal illness from beach recreation in the USA is estimated to cost US$300 million, with US$30 million from direct marine exposure to the Vibrio species (Ralston et al., 2011). 3. Evidence of impacts globally 26 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Synthetic organic chemicals Derived from industrial activities, synthetic organic chemicals include a wide range of chemicals, including petroleum hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), chlorobiphenyls, chlorinated dioxins, industrial solvents, pesticides and herbicides. Approximately 9% of dietary exposure to synthetic organic chemicals is from fish and shellfish caught in freshwaters, estuaries and in coastal zones (near shore versus in the open ocean) (Hellberg et al., 2012). Classified for their persistence, bioavailability, tendency to bioaccumulate and toxicity, the consumption of synthetic organic chemicals has been linked to cause several health issues, including immune modulation (Hernrotha et al., 2018). For example, human ingestion of herbicides and pesticides has been associated with endocrine-disruption, immunosuppression and developmental problems (Fleming et al., 2006). Consumption of PAH-contaminated bivalves has also been associated with lung cancer, low birth rates, and decreased fecundity (Fleming et al., 2006). Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), such as PCBs and dioxins found in seafood can be particular hazardous when fish is consumed in large amounts by subsistence anglers, pregnant women and young children (Hellberg et al., 2012).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "438bbbc1-42bd-49b4-9a3b-3ba6eefe70e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "438bbbc1-42bd-49b4-9a3b-3ba6eefe70e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acdc9531a94bfbc4d1a0b2816fcfc6c55aa3a5dea52e2b3b41cdc68202a41f0c"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e960a5f-d23d-4eca-984d-833ee674f28e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ab15a928adabb0985f815fad2fbe4b829622732fdad46e834f4dcf8a59289c8"}}, "hash": "c3ba5fb98d73f1e410891662994301d467ab7b64c423a0ddfead70f85c88faed", "text": "While some studies report an association with prenatal exposure to PCBs and dioxins with childhood neurodevelopmental problems, other studies report no adverse effects (Nakajima et al., 2006, Hellberg et al., 2012).

In addition to neurodevelopmental impacts for pregnant women and foetus, the consumption of mercury can also have cardiovascular impacts on human health (Hellberg et al., 2012). The highest human health risks of mercury are found in seafood consuming populations in coastal regions and tropical riverine populations, including south-eastern Asia, western Pacific and the Mediterranean (Fleming et al., 2016, Sheehan et al., 2014). Environmental chronic exposures have been reported in populations that depend on fishing, including in Amazonia, Coastal Peru, Seychelles, Faroe Islands, the Arctic and New Zealand (Fleming et al., 2006, Sheehan et al., 2014). At particular risk are women of reproductive age who live in low to middle-income countries (where access to information on methyl mercury content in seafood is not widely available) - and rely on seafood for at least 20% of their protein intake (estimated at approximately 400 million women worldwide (Budnik and Casteleyn, 2019). Higher risk of mercury exposure is also identified in subjects who consume self-caught fish versus store- bought fish, given their tendency to target predatory species, which contain the highest mercury concentrations (Eagles-Smith et al., 2018, Budnik and Casteleyn, 2019). It is expected that the relative exposure risk in distinctive populations is likely to change in response to globalization, population growth, resource availability (changed fisheries and \u201cfishing down\u201d of marine food webs), and climate change. Other metals found in seafood include cadmium, lead and arsenic. For example, cadmium (a known human carcinogen) can bioaccumulate in the marine environment (found to bioaccumulate in shellfish, and particularly mussels, more than in fish), posing several human health risks, among the most important being proteinuria and renal failure (Fleming et al., 2006). 3. Evidence of impacts globally 27 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Overall, there is a need for more accurate information about heavy metal contaminant exposures (particularly low-level exposure) from human fish consumption, thus informing policy makers regarding the balance between fish consumption benefits and the potential adverse effects resulting from heavy metal exposure. Microplastics Given their high persistence in the environment, and the fact that they are accumulating in different marine ecosystems at increasing rates, microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) are considered an emerging issue of great concern as they may compromise human food security, food safety, and consequently human health (Barboza et al., 2018). In addition to the absorption and transfer of chemicals and hydrophobic pollutants (such as metals and heavy metals) - which are released into the gastro-intestinal tracts of organisms when the MPs are ingested (Godoy et al., 2020) - MPs can also spread exotic invasive species and dangerous pathogens (Barboza et al., 2018). This suggests that exposure to marine plastic debris (either from marine bathing or ingestion) could increase the risk of human disease via new contamination and infection routes. For example, plastic beads (or \u2018nurdles\u2019) can act as rafts for harmful bacteria (including E.coli and Vibrio spp.), raising the potential for \u201cpathogens to be transported over large distances and survive for much longer than normal\u201d (McVeigh, 2019, Rodrigues et la., 2019). There are higher risks of human infection, particularly for children, resulting from marine bathing or exposure (e.g. ingestion) to plastic nurdles on beaches (Rodrigues et al., 2019).

The risks of plastic pollution go beyond microplastics, and these risks to human health, ecosystems, and national economies are grave and interlinked. The degradation and modification of marine and coastal systems causes negative socio-economic effects on tourism, fisheries, shipping, and human health (Raes et al., 2021). The build-up of plastic litter on beaches can have a large impact on a country\u2019s economy, wildlife, and the physical and psychological wellbeing of individuals (Jain et al., 2021). The major economic cost of this plastic debris is the reduced aesthetic appeal of coastal areas. This adversely affects the tourism industry, leading to a loss of output, revenue, and employment (Jain et al., 2021). The risks of plastic pollution on fisheries \u2013 including the broader economic dimensions of export revenue, livelihoods and employment, food security, marine ecosystems, and biodiversity \u2013 are well documented (Raes et al., 2021). 3.

Evidence of impacts in the Western Indian Ocean 8 https://www.preventionweb.net/english/professional/policies/v.php?id=60591 This section takes a closer look at three Western Indian Ocean countries to see what information is available about the economic impacts of ocean risk. Though we know something about what is going on, there is a good deal that we do not know. More complete assessments of impacts, particularly on coastal communities, is needed to inform policy makers and others about what is happening, and where mitigation measures and enhanced adaptive management are needed. Policies in place include the Partner States of East African Community (EAC) Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Strategy, which looks at both natural hazards and human-induced disasters8. This strategy sits within the broader context of Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR), and is integrated into its programmes and planning in line with the Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA), the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and the Africa Regional Strategy for DRR. 4.1 Impacts in Kenya The key national disaster risk policies in Kenya are the National Disaster Risk Management Policy, approved in 2018, and is supported by the Kenya Vision 2030 Sector Plan for Drought Risk Management and Ending Drought Emergencies (UNDRR, 2019). These two documents do not specifically address several ocean risks, including coral bleaching, harmful algal blooms, fisheries and aquaculture or marine-related disease. However, local development plans, particularly at the county level, represent an opportunity for ocean risk management. 4. Evidence of impacts in the Western Indian Ocean 30 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Extreme weather events - Kenya Climate change is a very real threat to Kenya. Mean seasonal temperatures have increased for the past 50 years; while average rainfall has dropped (Field et al., 2012; Funk, 2010). The rising flood and drought risks threaten coastal zones via sea-level rise with Mombasa - the region\u2019s largest seaport - at particular risk. They also increase health costs and place energy, infrastructure, water resources and ecosystem services at risk.9 Several notable extreme weather events have affected Kenya in the last 25 years. Severe floods in 1997-98 impacted 1 million people and caused US$ 0.8-1.2 billion worth of damage (Downing et al., 2009). Droughts hit the region in the years that followed (1998-2000), costing US$ 2.8 billion worth of losses in crops and livestock, forest fires, damage to fisheries, reduced hydro- power generation, reduced industrial production as well as reduced water supply (Downing et al., 2009). Droughts also hit the region in 2004-05, 2009 and 2011. Since 2014, an ongoing drought warning has been in place. The annual burden of extreme weather events is thought to be as high as US$ 0.5 billion per year, or 2 % of Kenya\u2019s GDP (Downing et al., 2009). Tourism is Kenya\u2019s third largest economic sector after tea and coffee exports; generating US$ 6.7 billion in 2016, or 14 % of GDP (World Travel and Tourism Council, 2017).

In total, reefs could be worth US$ 2.5 billion per year or 4% of the Kenya GDP (Gudka et al., 2018). The global mass bleaching events in 1998 and 2016 hit Kenyan reefs hard. 80% of all coral in the region are estimated to have died during the 1998 event (Obura, 2002), costing the diving industry in Mombasa alone an estimated US$ 13-20 million in lost revenue (Westmacot et al., 2000). The bleaching event of 2016 further decimated reefs, reducing hard coral cover by 20% and increasing fleshy algae coverage by almost 35%.

Evidence of impacts in the Western Indian Ocean 31 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Harmful algal blooms - Kenya On the Kenyan coast, HAB data are limited in relation to location rather than impact (Kiteresi et al., 2013; Munga et al., 1992; Mwaluma et al., 2003; Wawiye et al., 1999)10. By contrast, fish kills, livestock deaths and massive wildlife deaths (e.g. flamingos) have been documented for HABs in inland lakes (HAEDAT, 2019). Marine HABS from 39 taxa have been identified in coastal waters, with particularly high densities of species associated with costly HABs such as Pseudo- nitzschia sp. (Kiteresi et al., 2013). HAB risks identified include cyanoHABs in salt production ponds (Ogello et al., 2014), toxic HABs where aquaculture has been proposed (Ochieng, 2015), and HAB species where dredging for port development could trigger a toxic bloom or increase the risks of HABs in ship ballast water (Adala, 2007). In 2001, a bloom of the dinoflagellate Karenia mikimotoi caused mass fish mortalities on the Somali and northern Kenyan Coast (Church and Obura, 2006). Hundreds of kilometres of coastline were affected including in Kiunga National Marine Reserve (Church and Obura, 2006; Samoilys and Kanyange, 2008). Concerns about seafood safety disrupted fishing activity and reduced income as officials closed affected fishing grounds and advised the public not to consume locally caught fish. The ban on filter feeding organisms lasted several weeks. The coastal upwelling of waters, low in dissolved oxygen and high in nutrients, enhanced plankton productivity triggering the bloom, which lasted 10 days (Church and Obura, 2006). To date, no economic or other effects of marine HABs in Kenya have been quantified. Food security via fisheries and aquaculture - Kenya In 2004, Kenya\u2019s fishery sector was estimated to contribute 5% to the GDP, and employ 40,000 people (Fondo, 2004). By 2008, 80,000 people were directly engaged as fishers and fish farmers while the sector provided livelihoods for about 2.3 million Kenyans involved in fish processing and trade. More recent figures from the FAO highlight the continued growth of the fisheries sector, with production reaching 150,000 tonnes in 2010, and 190,000 tonnes in 2014. The market value of the latter exceeded US$ 250 million (FAO, 2016). Approximately 80% of the marine catches in Kenya originate from shallow coastal waters and reefs, with only 20% fished offshore. Around 10,000 artisanal fishers work in Kenya (Ochiewo, 2004), using simple fishing vessels and gears such as gillnets, shark nets, beach seines, spear gun and traditional traps (McClanahan and Mangi, 2004).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d2c0ee1d-bdda-402d-8c01-4d7de84e818d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d2c0ee1d-bdda-402d-8c01-4d7de84e818d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1407ec07131141fd53c34727f9223e1a6ba154e47a5a30325d97d920faa52274"}, "2": {"node_id": "362c830b-2f4d-45fc-990e-c518086031c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1bfcc3049c001e90d07fb0883558252922e63a0695ba3339a98b37c8c1e866c9"}}, "hash": "5707cd84df0d818f0cfb6a89cc5d5203b9cabcd0d8c7cc107b9fa109f24f9f56", "text": "The value of artisanal fishing is not usually reported in official fish landings, but the 7,754 tonnes of reef-associated fin-fish that were recorded in 2006 (captured by 8,682 fishers) are estimated to have a value of US$ 9.69 million per year highlighting the importance of this industry to local economies (Samoilys et al., 2017).

Generally, the impact of ocean and climate change on the health of Kenya\u2019s coastal populations remains poorly documented. Shigella bacteria have been identified in edible fish in Kenya (David et al., 2009), but it is not clear how many confirmed cases of shigellosis (which is particularly prevalent in children aged between 6 months and 5 years) are linked to the consumption of contaminated seafood. Organisms that produce biotoxins and seafood poisoning have been documented in Kenyan waters (Wawiye et al., 1999), but to date, there are no records of associated health problems or diseases. In the case of Ciguatera Fish Poisoning (CFP), there are travel advisories for tourists against this disease (which suggests CFP illnesses are a potential source of concern for human health) but again there are no reported incidences. In general, the biggest threat to human health remains flooding (Okaka and Odhiambo, 2018). Flooding events often result in outbreaks of cholera, nonspecific diarrhoea, cryptosporidiosis, rotavirus, and typhoid and paratyphoid (Stoltzfus et al., 2014). These diseases make it difficult to differentiate marine-borne pathogens from those arising from other sources12.

(UNDRR, 2019). Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) have been mainstreamed into district planning and budgeting systems in the eight key sectors of agriculture, health, water, social protection, roads, the environment, meteorology and energy (UNDRR, 2019). Extreme weather events - Mozambique The coastline of Mozambique spans 2,700 km, and houses over 60% of the population (over 13 million people). Mozambique suffers from multiple extreme weather events including periodic cyclones, droughts and floods13. Droughts occur in the southern region, seven out of every 10 years, while floods occur on average every two to three years. On average the country loses 1.1% of its GDP due to the impacts of droughts and floods on economic resources and activity (Irish Aid, 2018). The costs of one-off extreme events, in terms of lives lost and economic losses can be devastating. One example of this is Cyclone Idai, which hit in 2019. The cyclone triggered a deadly storm surge that killed over 1,000 people, affected 3 million more and caused US$ 2 billion worth of damage14.

Estimates suggest that parts of the coastline could be eroded 500 metres inland, posing a serious threat to the densely populated areas (MER, 2015). Rising sea levels could cause losses of up to 4,850 km2 (0.6% of the national land area) by 2040 (World Bank, 2010). Total annual damage losses in low-lying provinces such as Zambezia, Nampula, Sofala and Maputo are estimated to reach US$ 103 million yr-1 in 2040 with forced migration accounting for a large contribution of this cost (World Bank, 2010). In terms of the cost of adaptation, the World Bank estimates the total investment required is approximately US$ 890 million yr-1 under a high sea-level rise scenario (World Bank, 2010). More economically viable adaptation options vary from US$ 190 million to US$ 470 million yr-1 depending on the climate change scenario used (World Bank, 2010).

In 1999, reefs covered 30-60% of Mozambique\u2019s coastline. In 2017, this figure had dropped to just 20-30% (Obura et al., 2017). Half of Mozambique\u2019s observed reefs exhibited medium to high levels of bleaching (>10%) during the global bleaching event in 2016 but mortality was low (< 10%) (Obura et al., 2017). The threats that climate change poses to reefs (e.g. increased seawater temperatures and terrestrial runoff after cyclones) is deemed to outweigh the impact of local communities (e.g. fishing) in Mozambique (McClanahan and Muthiga, 2017). Coral-reef related tourism is still relatively low in Mozambique, representing 0.47% of the country\u2019s GDP (Spalding et al., 2017). The benefits of coastal protection are also considered to be low in Mozambique (Beck et al., 2018). However, these statements could also reflect the paucity of data available. Substantial investment is needed in monitoring programmes in Mozambique in order to fully appreciate the economic costs and benefits provided by their reefs (Obura et al., 2017). Fringing coral reefs dominate Mozambique\u2019s Quirimbas archipelago. Source: Shutterstock / BlueOrange Studio Harmful algal blooms - Mozambique Nearshore coastal and pelagic marine surveys conducted in Mozambique have identified a variety of microalgal species that have the potential to cause HABs. These include including Pseudo-nitzschia spp. (the cause of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning), Alexandrium spp. and Gymnodinium spp. (the cause of Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning), Protoceratium spp. and Prorocentrum triestinum (that produce red tides), and Ostreopsis spp. (the source of palytoxins associated with clupeotoxism, which causes gastrointestinal symptoms, and in severe cases, death) (S\u00e1 et al., 2013). However, few data exist about HAB occurrence, magnitude and/or frequency15. Mozambique does not currently have a public repository of the number of intoxications from seafood, nor does it identify the costs of illness, misdiagnosis or death (Tamele et al., 2019). Identifying such information will be paramount to managing the risks posed by climate change. In general, increases in coastal flooding events and/or the number of cyclones that hit the region increases nutrients levels, which together with increasing sea temperature are associated with increased HAB outbreaks in tropical areas. 15 Harmful Algae Event Database entry for Mozambique http://haedat.iode.org/eventSearch.php?searchtext[countryID]=105 4. Evidence of impacts in the Western Indian Ocean 35 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Food security via fisheries and aquaculture - Mozambique Mozambique\u2019s fisheries are of critical importance to national food security as about 50% of the population\u2019s protein comes from fish. The fisheries sector in Mozambique contributes an estimated 4% towards GDP, and represents 28% of foreign exports (Irish Aid, 2018). The value of Mozambique fishery exports was estimated to be worth US$ 60 million in 2014 (UNCTAD, 2017). The sector employs 95,000 people, with three to four times this number employed in the processing industry (Irish Aid, 2018). Artisanal fishing typically contributes more to Mozambique\u2019s fishing sector than commercial fishing, with 85% of the country\u2019s fish catch being made up of small-scale fishermen (Irish Aid, 2018). Other segments in the sector include industrial and semi-industrial fishing. The latter, comprises mainly small trawlers involved in the domestic coastal shrimp fisheries. Semi-industrial fishing accounts for 2% of annual marine catches and 6% of the total value (Souto, 2014). Industrial fishing includes large vessels flagged in Mozambique and other countries, mostly targeting crustaceans such as coastal and deep-sea shrimp, which are usually processed at sea for export to Japan and Europe.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bd8eea8-adda-4281-9275-7f3220a79de6": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bd8eea8-adda-4281-9275-7f3220a79de6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e49948f31409a131c36852094608126a1401374e80543c44c3a7bd111183cd1e"}, "2": {"node_id": "9aee280d-3ed9-4f11-9e88-f9da2164f335", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e2a9ce2296797525659b55079da17d1681bfd3c8dfc12291ddb844e0a86fb69d"}}, "hash": "31fce84505591bd3e3f08f81ce767d15bd478972dbecb91b5fb965bd643d7322", "text": "This latter segment accounts for 7% of annual marine capture and 52% of total value (Oceanic D\u00e9veloppement, 2014); 99.68% of the production is by capture.

Human health and diseases - Mozambique Very little research work and surveillance of seafood-borne diseases has been conducted in Mozambique. Like for Kenya, the incidence of seafood diseases is difficult to estimate as most cases are reported and recorded as general diarrhoeal diseases, with little to no information about the specific pathogen responsible for the disease. Several infectious and diarrhoeal diseases are prevalent in Mozambique, including those resulting from Vibrio spp., Campylobacteriosis jejuni, Clostridium spp. (identified in Mozambique tilapia; Nol et al., 2004), Giardiasis, Rotavirus, Adenovirus, Hepatitis A/E, Salmonella and Shigella (Berger, 2018; Nhampossa et al., 2015). Of the marine- and waterborne human infections that have been distinguished in the literature, cholera has received the most attention.

Severe flooding can also exacerbate the risk of cholera by displacing people and damaging infrastructure, including health facilities, which contributes to the spread of outbreaks. The projected increases in temperature and aridity forecast for Mozambique are likely to increase the spread of cholera in the future. 16 https://www.who.int/csr/don/19-february-2018-cholera-mozambique/en/ 4.

The 2018 Disaster Risk Profile for Tanzania focuses on the risks from drought and flooding and does not specifically focus on ocean risk (CIMA, 2018). Extreme weather events - Tanzania Extreme weather events in Tanzania (flooding, droughts, cyclones, and tropical storms) have always imposed major economic costs on the country18. Individual annual events regularly cost Tanzania more than 1% of its GDP, reducing the country\u2019s capacity for long-term growth and placing millions of people and their livelihoods at risk (Worker and Excell, 2018). Climate change is forecast to increase average annual temperatures by 1-2.7\u00b0C by the 2060s and by 1.5-4.5\u00b0C by the 2090s (Irish Aid, 2017). It is also anticipated to increase the intensity, frequency and unpredictably of extreme weather events in Tanzania. According to projections, the economic costs to Tanzania\u2019s main sectors could reach several billion US$ per year by the 2050s, inflicting net economic costs of a further 1-2% decline of GDP per year by 2030 (Global Climate Adaptation Partnership and partners, 2011). The economic costs associated with adapting, building adaptive capacity and enhancing resilience to potential climate-induced threats to coastlines is expected to cost between US$ 100-150 million per year (SEI, 2010). Coral bleaching - Tanzania Two-thirds of Tanzania\u2019s 1,000 km coastline is bordered by reefs. A World Resources Institute report on reefs at risk placed Tanzania among the 9 nations most vulnerable to reef degradation (Burke et al., 2011). According to this report, Tanzania has a low adaptive capacity, high reef dependence and high threat exposure. For example, the 1998 bleaching event led to the loss of 80-95% of corals in Tanzania (Obura, 2002; Westmacot et al., 2000; Wilkinson et al., 1999). Economic losses to the dive industry in Zanzibar alone were estimated to be US$ 2.2 million in (Brown et al., 2011). A small decline in coral cover has been observed over the past 30 years, but has now stabilised at 35-40% (Obura et al., 2017). Some algae has been observed, which should be monitored in the future (Obura et al., 2017). As of 2017, over 14 million Tanzanian\u2019s live in coastal regions and many of them earn their livelihood through direct or indirect connections to the reef. Tourism\u2019s economic contribution in Tanzania is relatively small, providing 0.34% of GDP, about US$ 180 million per year (Spalding et al., 2017). By contrast, one big reef-dependent industry in Tanzania is the seaweed aquaculture industry. Tanzania (Zanzibar specifically) is in the top eight countries for seaweed cultivation contributing 132,000 tonnes (0.7%) to the global production. This industry employs some 25,000 workers, the majority of which are women. Seaweed farming is only possible inside the lagoons created by coral reefs, within a narrow band of the coast, some 380-600m from the shoreline (Hedberg et al., 2018). The loss of coral reefs has the potential to disrupt this profitable industry. 4.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21a35838-1362-4491-b8dc-799aec1387bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "21a35838-1362-4491-b8dc-799aec1387bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0ed9d08514481d0b80f904e671f30fc8b237dd2119623c4bd8444b877999a69"}, "2": {"node_id": "e406d74c-8445-4bf3-87f2-03a71e0c7c06", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0d2e3be4a37384ee0d0eed76222c4e9f8456e02f4049ddcf5f924ab892c51491"}}, "hash": "8552976b07a0f43ef93b097e70a1b95086adddadf04b068255b45775053e2605", "text": "The loss of coral reefs has the potential to disrupt this profitable industry. 4. Evidence of impacts in the Western Indian Ocean 37 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Harmful algal blooms - Tanzania More than 20 potentially harmful algal species have been identified in the coastal waters of Tanzania (Kyewalyanga and Lugomela, 1999; Lugomela, 2006). Dominant species cover three groups associated with costly HAB events in other countries; cyanobacteria (Trichodesmium sp. and Lyngbya sp) diatoms (Pseudo-nitzschia sp.) and dinoflagellates (Prorocentrum sp. and Gambierdiscus toxicus) (Kyewalyanga and Lugomela, 1999; Lugomela, 2006). HABs harm both seaweed production and farmers in Zanzibar. In February and March 2012, a cyanobacterial bloom of algae belonging to the genus Lyngbya stopped work in the seaweed farms in two villages in Zanzibar (IOC-UNESCO, 2016).

Evidence of impacts in the Western Indian Ocean 38 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities Food security via fisheries and aquaculture - Tanzania Tanzania may be one of the poorest countries in the world, but it has one of the richest marine and inland fisheries, mainly because of its 1,424 km long coastline and productive inland lakes (Yusuf et al., 2015). The fishing sector plays an important role in the coastal economy of Tanzania, as well as enhancing the country\u2019s food security and local livelihoods. Small-scale fisheries in Tanzania account for 98% of total fish production and 1.3% of GDP, or US$ 12.4 million19. Although the contribution of small-scale fisheries to the GDP appears somewhat marginal, this sector is a vital source of food, employment and income for coastal communities (ASCLME, 2012b), supporting more than 4,000,000 Tanzanians (Sigalla, 2014). Since 1998, there has been a steady decline in the contribution of the fisheries sector to Tanzania\u2019s national GDP. This could be related to climate change and environmental degradation, decreases in fish catches, over-participation in fishing related activities, changes in species distribution and/or increases in population (Sobo, 2012). Limited information is available on the economic costs and losses of the entire fisheries sector for Tanzania, but some information does exist on the costs and losses endured by discreet sectors such as the country\u2019s seaweed farming industry. Seaweed production for example, has fallen dramatically from 423.9 tonnes worth US$ 82,000 in 2003, to just 28 tonnes worth US$ 4,300 in 2012 due to a combination of factors linked to increasing sea temperature, epiphytic growth, including of HABs, caused by increasing sea temperature and eutrophication and disease (Msuya and Porter, 2014). Human health and diseases - Tanzania Several infectious and diarrheal diseases are prevalent in Tanzania, including those caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, Rotovirus, Escherichia coli, Giardia, Hepatitis A and intoxication biotoxins produced by HABs (ReliefWeb, 2018). Regarding cholera, the WHO (2018) reported that 47% out of 7,000 specimens that were tested for cholera stemmed from the marine-borne Vibrio bacteria. Most cases that occur are reported on the coast, with five coastal regions in Tanzania among the top-eight regions by the number of cases per capita (Taylor et al., 2009 cited in Mboera et al., 2011). In 2018 alone, 66 deaths from cholera were reported (Reliefweb, 2018).

What do we still need to know? It is clear from the global and regional observations in this report that ocean risk is material. For many hazards, impacts are increasing (IPCC, 2019; UNDRR, 2019). However, more in-depth assessment is needed to inform policy makers, investors, insurers, and communities about the substantive and rising costs of these impacts for developing countries and ocean risks to economic and subsistence activities. 5.1 Extreme weather events What we do know is that there is plenty of information about the hazards and consequences of ocean warming for extreme weather (IPCC, 2019; UNDRR, 2019). However, when it comes to the actual figures for costs and losses of these events, information, depending on the spatial scale, sector, region and/or geographic location, is fairly disperse or in some cases not existent. For example, information regarding such costs and losses are more readily available from developed nations than developing nations and even then, the detail can be somewhat lacking. We are also more likely to find information on the economic costs and losses of specific and discreet single extreme weather events (e.g. for a hurricane, cyclone and sea-level rise incidences) than at the global level. Sector breakdowns on economic costs and losses are dispersed and more so for developing nations, possibly due to a lack of systemization of data collection. Indeed, impacts on the informal or undocumented economy, as well as indirect effects, can be very important in some areas and sectors, but are generally not counted in reported estimates of losses. This may be more relevant for information from developing nations. A particularly important cost that is missing is the cost of adaptation. When it comes to loss of human lives, limited information is available as to what makes up the economic costs that are associated with these lives lost, e.g. costs of hospitalization, costs of emergency and disaster responses, and other related costs. Loss of human life as well as loss of cultural heritage and ecosystem services, are also difficult to measure and monetize, and thus are also poorly reflected in estimates of losses. Such \u2018cost items\u2019 are often referred to as intangibles in contrast to tangibles such as tradable assets, structures, and infrastructure; although specific costs to property and infrastructure do not seem to be covered systematically and perhaps at best are covered for single extreme weather events. Information on costs and losses for these tangible assets is likely to inform insurance companies around the costs to insure for extreme weather events. In terms of other costs to society where there is limited information, one can include costs to income that seem to be covered by costs to GDP or national income. Costs to corporate earnings (when disclosed) are also sometimes given for discreet extreme weather events although not in much detail. There is also little quantitative information available on operational costs as a result of the direct impact of extreme weather events caused by ocean warming. As regards costs to sectors, whilst some disparate information is available at the regional and national level for the tourism and agriculture, limited or very little information is 5. What do we still need to know? 42 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities available for other sectors like energy, transport, telecommunications and construction. These would need to be determined so we can fully appreciate the severity of extreme weather events on these sectors resulting from ocean warming. In order to fully appreciate the full range of economic impacts of extreme weather events that are caused by the onset of ocean warming, it is clear that more data collection needs to happen \u2013 not only at the global level, but also at the national level, particularly for developing countries. Specifically, more data on economic impacts and costs need to be collected or indeed determined through economic valuation methods across all affected sectors as well as for more intangible assets including cost to life, costs to ecosystem services, etc. Gaps need to be filled in for the assessment of tangible assets from property to infrastructure which could be further enabled by insurance companies, who could, in turn, also elaborate more on the costs to repair and insure. Costs to income can be specified more than via measurements of GDP, with further research applied to the informal economy. 5.2 Coral bleaching Solid and cutting-edge research on the impact of climate change on coral reefs is essential in order to provide the best advice and solutions for the survival of these 300 million years", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9b7b776-6abd-43d7-8986-d8574e7155e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9b7b776-6abd-43d7-8986-d8574e7155e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00a0c9a324d86e69577d73d464ea736a24051b7f7fee124c70c639d8cddc633d"}}, "hash": "00a0c9a324d86e69577d73d464ea736a24051b7f7fee124c70c639d8cddc633d", "text": "old rainforests of the sea. Global funding of research has been increasing as the number of publications related to coral reef and climate change have increased. In a UN report, however, only US$ 19.3 million were identified as invested in research. No one for now is investing sufficiently in the research needed for reef surveys to provide long-term data and for the development of innovative ideas to maintain reef health. With an increase in intensity of the threats to coral ecosystems, research efforts need to be funded. Unfortunately, the amount of funding for this essential research seems to have diminished in some of the most relevant institutions. For example, the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies (James Cook University in Townsville, Australia), which is a leading authority in terms of coral research and coral health will lose most of its government funding (-37%) after 2021 (Morton, 2018). Reef countries are already adapting and will have to adapt even further to increased reef degradation. Not all reef nations are facing the same challenges, as some nations are more dependent on the reef for livelihoods and their economies than others. Most countries with a very low adaptability to reef degradation are classified as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and/or have a recent history of conflict, such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Somalia, Eritrea, Sudan, Timor-Leste, Bangladesh and Yemen. International help and project funding should consider these vulnerable nations and put priority in helping such countries to assess and understand their economic dependence on the reef economy, as well as to reduce the different local threats to their coral reefs. The frequency of coral bleaching events has increased so that there is insufficient time for recovery between events (IPCC, 2019; UNDRR, 2019). It is therefore essential to understand the cost of increased bleaching frequency and reduced recovery time to ensure that ocean risk management accounts for potential cascading effects of ocean warming and ocean acidification on marine ecosystems, fisheries and food security. 5. What do we still need to know? 43 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities 5.3 Harmful algal blooms The research gaps regarding the impact of HABs on society are significant. Comprehensive and coordinated data collection and storage across affected sectors and communities needs to be facilitated. To do this effectively, data need to be characterised in order to assess the economic, public health, and sociocultural impacts of HAB events on local and regional scales using standardised approaches and units to facilitate aggregation. Both sociocultural and economic impacts of HAB events at local and regional scales need to be more systematically and thoroughly assessed. There is a need to assess the vulnerability of actual and potential HAB-affected communities to sociocultural and economic impacts of HAB events. Due to the specialist knowledge, equipment and training needed to identify and monitor biotoxins, toxicity and attribute HABs to seafood poisoning, there is a need for increased collaboration between HAB specialists and healthcare workers. Modelling of extreme events under a changing climate, including localized definitions of critical climate thresholds that may exacerbate HABs in the future, is required in order to better inform disaster management response. This needs to include nutrients (N, P, Si, Fe), stratification, turbulence, turbidity, pH, dissolved oxygen and specific data related to key potential HAB species as all these factors can influence toxicity of HABs and the risk of seafood poisoning. Coastal zone mapping, and vulnerability baselines are also needed to support future environmental impact assessments and guide new developments. Information is needed on HAB events including red tides, wildlife strandings, fish kills and seafood related illness. Investigations, perhaps on behalf of insurance companies, are needed on risks to health and fisheries, especially for export produce. It may be possible that salt workers, larger aquaculture facilities and commercial fisheries have data and records related to HABs. This needs to be further investigated. Furthermore, the medical community, hospitals and health ministries may have additional information on HAB effects related to seafood poisoning, contaminated drinking water or from other routes of exposure. In addition, the harbours and ports may have initiatives related to ballast water that can be documented or costed. The trend toward increasing desalination for drinking water supply also introduces the risk of desalination plants being exposed to biofouling and potential contamination of drinking water by biotoxins. This will require special consideration in the location and design of such plants. In Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania, the extensive costs from storms, drought, flooding and disease results in harmful algal blooms receiving less attention.

Marine HABs related to seafood poisoning require additional attention particularly given the occurrence of seafood poisoning events in other Western Indian Ocean nations. 5.4 Food security via fisheries and aquaculture What we do know is that there is plenty of information about the hazards and consequences of ocean warming on fisheries as well as the subsequent impacts on food security connected with this sector. Interestingly, and perhaps as to be expected, whilst marine capture fisheries will experience negative effects from ocean warming, the aquaculture subsector is likely to experience a more positive effect owing to increased growth rates, amongst others. In East Africa, freshwater fisheries are currently larger and better documented than marine fisheries, making the quantification of cost difficult. 5. What do we still need to know? 44 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities However, when it comes to the actual figures for costs and losses of these events, information (depending on the spatial scale, sector, region and/or geographic location) is fairly disperse or in some cases not existent. For example, information regarding such costs and losses are more readily available at the national level rather than the global level. At the same time this information typically comes from developed nations more than developing nations and even then, the detail can be somewhat lacking. Some ocean risk areas that have been identified are lacking in information about related economic costs and losses. For example, when it comes to costs to lives and livelihoods, the information found typically only covers the decrease in household income that occurs as a result of the impacts of climate change and ocean warming on the decline of the marine capture fisheries sector. Limited information is available regarding the health costs associated with the decline of food security and loss of life. At the same time, limited information is available on the cost to lives and livelihoods for the aquaculture sectors, perhaps because for now, there are none. There is only benefit to life and livelihoods. For some sectors, limited information exists on economic costs and losses; these include those associated with changes in marine biodiversity and ecosystem services in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. This also encompasses costs associated with predator-prey interactions, changes to biodiversity from altered fishing and impacts on predatory species. Like costs associated with livelihoods and life, these are difficult to measure and monetize \u2013 although some estimates have been made - and thus they are also poorly reflected in estimates of losses. In terms of grounding these costs to society at the national level within the three African countries presented - Kenya, Tanzania and Mozambique \u2013 some information is available on the contribution of fisheries to each of the country\u2019s GDP, annual landed value, export and import value and the number of jobs - most likely formal jobs - the sector provides both directly and indirectly. However, there is limited information for all three countries on the economic costs and losses of climate change and ocean warming on their fisheries sectors. In order to fully appreciate the full picture of the economic impacts of ocean warming on the fishery sector \u2013 both marine capture and aquaculture \u2013 more data collection needs to happen \u2013 not only at the global level but also at the national level, particularly for developing countries. Specifically, more data on economic impacts and costs need to be collected and determined through economic valuation methods. These costs could also be grouped into more general categories, such as costs and losses associated with biodiversity, livelihoods, industry/business, other sectors and adaptation. It will also be essential to enable future data collection on the impacts of ocean warming connected to the informal economy relevant to subsistence fishing. 5.5 Human health and diseases Global data on both the economic and health burden resulting from marine-borne illnesses are incomplete. This makes it difficult to attain a complete and global understanding of 1) the distribution of human pathogens through the marine food chain, 2) the transmission of these pathogens to humans, resulting in human disease, and 3) the impacts of a changed ocean climate on the transmission and incidence of human illness. For example, while several studies exist on human pathogens in seafood (particularly shellfish), they are limited to select geographical areas, (usually developed countries, including the USA, Australia and European countries). They also focus on the most-known/monitored bacteria and viruses \u2013 usually those with the largest human health and market impact", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "172a474a-1599-4055-b809-9ed3c977fe3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "172a474a-1599-4055-b809-9ed3c977fe3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d5a486646d464f32097010c6eb13f80e37aa36252cf777e4d7257c5e4fdd227"}, "3": {"node_id": "ec28a16f-e43a-4f54-9fc8-aed749a228d1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f95ddc7e0863517da10fc20a977a56a1fa171cf0cefe9b2e60a4c015cc8495c"}}, "hash": "7243a77d8c3a38b8fb744128eca660c18f657c292b003b92bcc09d5e688fc655", "text": "those which cause severe illness or mortality and/or those derived from commercial species (e.g. 5.

Further, monitoring and surveillance of illnesses from marine pathogens and toxins that cause mild, non-fatal symptoms \u2013 although common \u2013 continue to be underreported and under- studied, making it difficult to quantify: 1) the true incidence and human health impact, and 2) the costs and losses of these diseases on human health, globally and locally. For example, while evidence suggests that the health burden of illnesses contracted through recreational or occupational marine activities is significant, the challenge of monitoring these cases (most of which go unreported or can result in minor symptoms) confounds global and local incidence and cost analysis. Moreover, calculating the global health burden and losses associated with specific marine-borne pathogens is a challenge due to the fact that the incidence of most marine- borne illnesses with diarrhoeal symptoms are generically reported as such, with little monitoring or misunderstanding of the specific etiology or pathogen that caused the illness or infection to begin with. Importantly, it is also difficult to obtain estimates for indirect healthcare costs. Non- market values (such as health promotion and psychological benefits are underrepresented in local and global economic assessments, likely due to the lack of standard valuation methods for such non-market values (Legat et al., 2016). Specific topics which merit further research include the following: \u2022 Morbidity and non-fatal injuries from climate related events \u2013 Several previous studies quantify the impact on global mortality (using event-based models or average mortality models) from coastal floods and extreme storm events. However, few document the health burden and losses related to global morbidity, disease, non-fatal injuries, mental health impacts or the indirect health impacts resulting from the downstream effects of coastal climate events, such as: forced migration or displacement, reduction in fisheries and food quality (leading to malnutrition), violent conflicts and loss of recreational or occupational activities. Further research on the human health impacts of these downstream impacts, particularly in developing countries, is required. \u2022 Anthropogenic pollution and human health impacts \u2013 There is a significant data gap regarding the costs and losses resulting from human illness associated with anthropogenic contaminants coming from the marine environment \u2013 and how these could change/increase in the face of a changing ocean climate. While anthropogenic contaminants have the potential to impact human health (primarily through the consumption of contaminated seafood), there is little documentation reporting the incidence of human illnesses (short-term and long-term) resulting specifically from the consumption of seafood containing synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, and microplastics. Given the prevalence of pollutants and plastic debris found in seafood, fish and bivalves sold for human consumption (Barboza et al., 2018), the nutritional importance of seafood consumption worldwide, addressing these research gaps is of critical priority. \u2022 Coastal governance and human health and disease \u2013 Although not directly addressed in this Report, further research should be devoted to understanding the impact of coastal governance structures on the incidence of human disease. It would be particularly useful to identify the types of governance structures that have managed to implement effective monitoring, adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce ocean risks to humans, particularly in the context of limiting the incidence and prevalence of marine-borne disease outbreaks. 5.

Opportunities to address negative economic impacts of plastic pollution include Deposit Refund Schemes, incentives to better manage solid waste, investment in the informal sector, and circular economy business models (IUCN-EA-QUANTIS, 2020, Raes, et al, 2021). 6.2 Partners Multilateral and national agencies - funding and implementing disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction, public health and sustainable development - all need to be involved in national or regional-level talks on ocean risk. High-level government officials may be required to provide the mandate for the necessary legislative framework and policies; however, local government, private sector partners, academia and civil society are key to achieving effective implementation. Several partnerships to support disaster risk reduction, ecosystem- based adaptation and nature-based solutions exist and could contribute to improving the consideration of ocean risk including: \u2022 Blue Carbon Initiative (BCI)20 \u2022 Blue Solutions21 \u2022 Friends of Ecosystem-based Adaptation (FEBA)22 \u2022 Global Resilience Partnership \u2022 International Partnership on Blue Carbon (IPBC) \u2022 Ocean Risk Alliance23 6.

Successful DRR and CCA case studies repeatedly show the importance of participatory approaches that engage and empower a wide range of stakeholders (UNDRR, 2019). 6.3 Capacity The capacity to monitor changes in ocean-related economic trends requires strengthening. This is particularly the case in order to attribute economic consequences to specific events. Improved understanding of the interaction between ocean hazards, exposure and vulnerability is required. This is best achieved through comprehensive risk assessment with the specific aim to incorporate ocean risk into the sustainable development agenda, such as through the Blue Economy. Issue-specific international capacity development mechanisms, instruments and supporting agencies include the following: \u2022 Extreme weather: FAO, WMO, UNDRR (Database: EM-DAT) \u2022 Coral bleaching: CORDIO, International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI), Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN), Reefbase27, UNEP, IOC-UNESCO \u2022 Harmful Algal Blooms: IOC-UNESCO, WoRMS, ICES, PICES, IAEA and ISSHA (Database: HAEDAT28) \u2022 Fisheries, aquaculture and food security: FAO, WFP \u2022 Health and disease: FAO, WHO, UNDRR (Database: Global Health Observatory29) 6.4 Integrated approach to implementation For some hazards, particularly extreme weather events, nature-based solutions have begun to be integrated into national strategies and approaches to disaster risk reduction (EcoDRR) and climate change adaptation (EbA). However, many ocean risks have not yet been systematically included in these initiatives. Protected Areas and area-based conservation measures, such as locally managed marine areas, represent opportunities to achieve multiple biodiversity conservation benefits and nature-based solutions to help address development challenges. For example, recognising Blue Carbon in marine spatial planning and integrated coastal zone management is key to gaining multiple benefits from mangrove and seagrass conservation as part of ecosystem-based adaptation, climate change mitigation and disaster risk reduction.

These could include strategic objectives, such as: \u2022 Improved governance and more organized social structures. \u2022 Delivery of basic necessities (e.g. potable water, drainage, sewerage, power, and community facilities). \u2022 Enhancing access to telephony and electronic data services. \u2022 Reducing vulnerability to poverty.

Opportunities 50 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities 6.6 Ocean risk assessments The review of ocean risk cost information available from Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania highlighted the general unavailability of cost data to inform decision making. Carrying out ocean risk assessments could contribute to filling this gap by providing local decision-makers with the tools to help disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Initial discussions - at the national level in Mozambique and county level in Kenya -suggest that there is an appetite to integrate ocean risk, blue carbon and other aspects of risk reduction and climate change adaptation into activities on the Blue Economy. Key steps towards ocean risk assessments include: \u2022 Embedding assessments into government administration. \u2022 Identifying sustainable financing to carry out assessments and subsequent recommended actions. \u2022 Identifying ocean hazards (and predicted change and variations). \u2022 Documenting natural, cultural, and economic assets/capital exposed to ocean hazards including the Blue Economy. \u2022 Triangulation of knowledge using participatory ocean risk mapping, geospatial data and public education to inform exposure maps. \u2022 Analysing vulnerability and resilience. \u2022 Incorporating recommendations into government strategies, plans and procedures. In March 2020, IUCN organised a Western Indian Ocean Dialogues meeting that addressed two key topics \u2013 acting on ocean risk and accounting for blue carbon \u2013 in national and coastal perspectives. Taking the issues down to county level for Kenya, one of the outputs from the meeting was a map of perceived risks for the Kenyan coastal zone (see Figure 9 below). 6.

What can be done? 53 Acting on ocean risk Documenting economic, social and environmental impacts on coastal communities 7. What can be done? Filling the knowledge gaps on the costs from ocean risks is essential and also requires gaining a deeper understanding of the interactions between natural and technological hazards (e.g. industrial pollution, toxic wastes, dam failures, transport accidents, factory explosions, fires, and chemical spills) in the face of climate change. IPCC and UNDRR have identified the complexities and interactions between multi- hazard events and cascading risks but this work has not focused on ocean risks and the Blue Economy. Natural hazards interact with technological (and geo-political) events to produce a complex risk landscape. Most recently, the biological hazard the SARS CoV-2 virus, causing the devastating COVID-19 Pandemic, has highlighted the complex interactions between the initial biohazard and the cascading effects on economies and human well-being. This public health event has escalated into an economic shock triggering various technological hazards such as air transport and trade interruption. Ocean risks also interact with multiple hazards to expose communities and assets with poorly quantified costs to human systems and ecosystem services. Factoring uncertainty into ocean risk assessment is a significant challenge for the Blue Economy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and disaster risk reduction. Ocean risk is material. The livelihoods of coastal communities are at risk. National economies are at risk. Sustainable development globally is at risk. Nevertheless, our understanding of these risks and their implications for humanity is terribly limited. Most worrying is that this lack of understanding results in little, if any, efforts to mitigate these risks in order to reduce or remove the potential damage from ocean change. This Report is intended as a wakeup call. We need to start to take ocean risk seriously and for our governments to lead a multi-stakeholder process to first assess these risks and to then to develop strategies and implement action plans to mitigate these", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e93abd5-941a-46d9-9ebe-211549fdea6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e93abd5-941a-46d9-9ebe-211549fdea6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Acting on ocean risk", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f59c9a893957a0dc1d692809375ab70d40d37cf15063fc73edf084b0b2031605"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0ade84a-8fa0-4e7b-b823-a881e0981a71", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/acting-ocean-risk", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77eb4e985b477c0a0eca062599776f56e3ee397cd6f578aa3d09471e59669b87"}}, "hash": "67ee829d87367515006b7666c9e78a227c05816f172a258e61090d3403e122f6", "text": "risks. We hope that this Report will stimulate national governments \u2013 including the three Western Indian Ocean countries highlighted in the report \u2013 to begin to act now by starting national dialogues on ocean risk leading to assessments, strategies, and action plans to mitigate these risks as part of activities on the Blue Economy.
