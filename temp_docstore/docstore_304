Dear Network Members, A future vision of climate-resilient societies One way of building our understanding of resilience to climate change is to consider how distinct communities (such as mountain herders, lowland farmers, urban dwellers or coastal fisher folk) are already coping with the climate, and work with them in identifying and reducing future risks. One thing is for certain-the poor and vulnerable cannot be left to subsist in the margins of development. They will need to be much more effectively linked in with the formal economy and the support mechanisms provided by the state. Equally they will need to be better informed about climate risks and better able to access and process new information and ideas. With time they will need to be provided with new opportunities and skills to extend livelihood options, based on the principle of \u2018augmenting\u2019 existing capacity and local knowledge. A few attributes of climate resilience Taking the example of mountain herders, in the immediate term (say 5-10 years hence), better access to weather forecast information to help with decisions on livestock movements would certainly increase resilience to climate change. This might require a combination of organizational, technological and training related measures, such as the installation of a denser network of weather stations, provision of improved forecasts through various media, and the provision of outreach programs for herders to help them to interpret new information. Furthermore the planning and implementation of these initiatives would require improvements in the knowledge, coordination and management skills of service providers, such local departments of agriculture, planning and disaster management.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28a93747-a87e-4b4d-91b3-567482e78af1": {"__data__": {"id_": "28a93747-a87e-4b4d-91b3-567482e78af1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14bbb23e76e58b349678a6e61407c02a40373315d4c3fa3d9ba2b2a7cdb66cfa"}, "2": {"node_id": "68dce5b2-05ee-490b-a4c3-be698700b86b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90dd56cba815c69edd01c10bb568465d49ea285c1b85ab39b1f961cb88ac6088"}}, "hash": "36555d40613fee6a0bce342ec7983dca91efd730749bb7af9a4b86f9697a5eec", "text": "In the medium term (10-15 years) as the effects of climate change become more visible, our herders would need more information and understanding of possible climate impacts on the supply of water, grazing and fodder.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 39 Clearly the sequencing above would not (in practice) be as linear as the \u2018suggested\u2019 timeline implies. In some situations vulnerable communities may need to move towards livelihood diversification sooner than later and, in most cases, a combination of adaptation measures would be required at one time. A few key challenges Inevitably there are barriers to building resilience to climate change. For one we lack sufficient evidence of what the future climate will look like to be able to make informed planning decisions today. So the challenge is to learn to shift towards planning in the context of uncertainty and a range of possible futures. This means working out what you can do now and leaving other questions (where there is greater uncertainty) to future planning cycles. The issue of \u2018scaling up\u2019 from a few scattered examples of good practice to broad-scale uptake of measures to improve resilience presents a further challenge. Governments and the international community are beginning to respond at scale but there is much more to be done in translating new global financing and political support into the sorts of coordinated approaches described above. Then there is the whole issue of ensuring that the poor and most vulnerable are not simply viewed as victims but can become genuine beneficiaries in some of the opportunities that are emerging. It is relatively easy to see how the urban middle classes and elites could benefit from the innovation and rapid transfer of ideas and technology that is helping to build green economies throughout the world. But if the poor are to benefit in equal measure, we need to put in place quite specific policies now to help them achieve this. The coming Asia-Pacific Human Development Report on Climate Change seeks to build awareness and advocate for change by placing poor people and their livelihoods at the centre of the issue. More importantly than anything we (development practitioners) must ensure that we \u2018stick at it\u2019. Once the big international decisions have been made there is always a tendency for the less glamorous but equally important follow up activities to be buried as new issues emerge and grab attention.

It seems that in both cases, for various reasons, the communities were ill-prepared for the extreme events, although early warning information was given (of course the level of early warning system in the USA is much more advanced than that in Myanmar). In the case of Hurricane Katrina, certain government policies at the federal and local levels (i.e., the \u201cstorm preparedness paradoxes\u201d) have made the local communities more vulnerable to the extreme event. In the case of Cyclone Nargis, questions have been raised on what information had \u201creally reached individuals in the country\u201d.

As one potential impact of climate change is the increased frequency and intensity in precipitation events in some regions in Asia (IPCC 2007), there is a need to consider the idea of storm preparedness in adapting to such imminent impacts. There are many examples of communities adversely affected by extreme precipitation events, even when these storms occur on a regular basis. Much can be learned from such lessons. Hurricane Katrina is one such example. Despite the high accuracy of monitoring and forecast and the existence of evacuation and relief efforts protocols, Katrina was ranked one of the deadliest hurricanes as it killed thousands of people, and displaced many more (Travis 2005). The sad reality is that while impacts of storms like Katrina have been simulated prior to the event, almost 1 in 4 persons ignored evacuation orders and were unable to flee the path of destruction. Despite the apparent preparedness for the storm, the storm topped the charts with over US$200 billion worth of damage. The reason for this tragedy can be traced to two storm preparedness paradoxes, at the federal and local government levels in the USA, respectively. The federal level paradox is the safe development paradox, in that by making hazardous areas safer, it has increased the potential for property damages and economic loss (Burby 2006). The concept of safe development is that the federal government considers that if steps are taken to make it safe for human occupancy then land exposed to natural hazards can be used profitably. These steps usually include measures to mitigate the likelihood of damage by offering federal financial support for flood and hurricane protection works, beach nourishment, and federal requirements through the \u201cNational Flood Insurance Program for safe building practices such as elevation of construction in flood hazard areas\u201d (Burby 2006: 173). \u201cSupposedly safe development in New Orleans (and elsewhere) has proven to be unsafe for several reasons including limitations of flood and hurricane protection works and limitations of the National Flood Insurance Program\u2019s efforts to control losses through floodplain mapping and regulation of construction practices\u201d (Burby 2006: 176). However, it is the illusion of such \u201csafety\u201d that contributed to the unprecedented life and economic losses. On the other hand, the local government paradox is that while their citizens bear the burden of deaths, displacement and economic loss in disasters, policies to limit vulnerability are given inadequate attention (Burby 2006). Of the US$500 billion in losses from natural disasters in the United States between 1975 and 1994 (Burby 2006: 178), only a relatively small proportion of this was covered by federal disaster relief. In fact, most losses were not insured and were borne by victims. \u201cGiven that the incidence of disaster losses is primarily borne by local residents and businesses, one would expect that avoidance of losses would be a high priority for local officials. The paradox is that this is typically not the case\u201d (Burby 2006: 178). Apparently the political apathy stems in part from the lack of citizen concern about hazards, resulting in a \u201cpolicies without publics\u201d dilemma that smothers local policy initiatives. The federal level safe development concept results in a kind of \u201cmoral hazard\u201d in which \u201cthe availability of insurance protection lowers an insured party\u2019s incentive to avoid risk\u201d (Burby 2006: 179). This discourages both the local governments and individuals from taking actions to decrease the risk of loss. In addition to preparing ahead of storms through insurances, there is a need to consider monitoring, warning and information dissemination as adaptation strategies. While international institutions are able to provide a network of information for monitoring and warning, information dissemination is usually poor. This is evidently the case in Cyclone Nargis. According to WMO Director for Weather and Disaster Risk Reduction Activities Department Dieter Schiessl, a cyclone hits Myanmar once every 40 years, and being an infrequent disaster, \u201cgovernments have no incentives to prepare themselves thoroughly\u201d. Although the information about the cyclone was \u201camply available and timely provided, and distributed in the ways and means for reaching the general public\u201d, the WMO was unsure \u201cwhat really reached individuals in the country\u201d (Channel NewsAsia 2008). Information dissemination is a crucial step to consider in crafting storm preparedness programs.

The main thesis of the paper is that although climate change is a major threat to sustainable human development, international and national policies and actions also offer opportunities for improving resilience and for creating a low-carbon development path with many benefits. Climate change is a wake-up call and an imperative for doing more, better and faster, and Viet Nam\u2019s human development ambitions should remain high, despite climate change. The paper is about international and national climate policies, adaptation and resilience, greenhouse gas mitigation and co-benefits, financing and technology transfer, and capacity development. Here I want to highlight aspects of adaptation and resilience. Viet Nam is \u2018particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\u2019, as per the UNFCCC.

The Mekong Delta, which is shared with Cambodia, is characterised by IPCC as one of three global hotspots regarding potential population displacement. And without climate change action there will be risks to global food prices, as most of Viet Nam\u2019s rice export comes from the Mekong Delta. Strengthening resilience is the overall objective of climate change adaptation. This includes the resilience of women, men, children, communities, regions and sectors, and the ability of businesses and governments to deliver goods and services in the face of climate change effects. For example, access to services such as hospitals during and after disasters is critical, as was demonstrated during the river floods in the Mekong Delta in 2000 and 2001. Enhancing resilience will require e.g., behavioural change to improve preparation for natural disasters; better information sharing for livelihood diversification, learning and (business) innovation; (agricultural) R&D; as well as major infrastructure development. Women are not well represented in planning and decision-making related to climate change responses, including disaster risk mitigation. Barriers to women\u2019s participation need to be addressed as climate change creates new stresses on resources and livelihoods. \u201cResilience\u201d is primarily about just one side of the climate coin. However, many actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions can help improve the resilience of livelihoods and of communities. One example is the production and use of biogas from animal waste, with financial benefits, improved indoor air quality and labour saving that is especially felt by women-there are tens of thousands of micro-biogas installations around the country already. Trees and soils capture and store carbon, but mangroves also protect from storm surges and provide ecological services, upland forests protect water supplies, and forest plantations provide income. Therefore, multiple aims can be achieved with \u2018new and additional\u2019 international finance for reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). Viet Nam is becoming \u201cREDD-ready\u201d with a UN-REDD project and other international support. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 43 Viet Nam should consider the risk that sea level rise and the effects of climate change on typhoons, rainfall, drought and temperature could be worse than even the worst case (IPCC) predictions. It should therefore use the precautionary principle in long-term visioning and in planning of e.g., urbanisation and industrialisation. Long-term visioning and investment plans also need to recognise that although climate change effects cannot be predicted with absolute certainty, up-front investments in adaptation will pay off in all IPCC climate change scenarios. And despite climate change effects, it is important that Viet Nam provides even better protection from e.g. flooding in the future. To raise safety standards befits the ambition of Viet Nam to become a developed nation by say 2050. This then means that international capital and technology & knowledge transfer is critical for achieving resilience for the adverse effects of climate change and for turning actions into opportunities for social-economic development. Viet Nam should also prepare for raising very large amounts of domestic capital, especially for adaptation actions combined with raised safety standards for climatic stresses and shocks. Finally, the paper suggests that the UN must help Viet Nam to implement treaty obligations; \u2018convene\u2019 stakeholders in policy dialogues; support national capacity development; provide policy and technical advice; and help international resource mobilization, for and with Vietnamese and international partners.

These issues will be discussed in sub-theme 7. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 44 Dear Network Members, International legal instruments: Tackling climate change and fostering climate-adaptive societies Climate change is a threat that may have lasting consequences for mankind. Article 1(2) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) defines it as \u201cA change of climate that alters the composition of the global atmosphere\u201d (UN 1992). UNFCCC holds \u2018human-induced\u2019 activities responsible for the global problem (UN 1992: Article 3(4)). There is a growing recognition that climate change is no longer an environmental or technical issue but is a social and human development problem. It is mainly triggered by release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) (*) into the atmosphere. These emissions cause global warming. The impacts of a steadily warming world, with rising global average temperatures, may affect many sectors of society: agricultural production; water availability; livelihood opportunities; health and the mere subsistence of low-lying islands and coastal zones. How to tackle this issue and to promote climate-adaptive societies? International legal instruments are critical to foster climate-resilient or to put it differently climate-adaptive societies. UNFCCC (1992) and the Kyoto Protocol (1997) are two major international agreements on climate change. The foundation of these legally-binding agreements is based on five core principles of: \u2022 Common but differentiated responsibilities: The developed Parties (Annexes I and II) (**) should take the lead in combating climate change. \u2022 Protection of vulnerable societies: The special needs of developing country Parties, particularly vulnerable, should be given \u201cfull consideration\u201d. \u2022 Prevention and mitigation: Parties to take precautionary measures to \u201canticipate, prevent or minimize the causes of climate change\u201d. \u2022 Sustainable development: Parties to promote \u201csustainable development\u201d. \u2022 Sustainable economic growth: Parties\u2019 cooperation to promote open international economic system that would lead to sustainable economic growth and development (UN 1992: Article 3 (1-5)). If followed in practice, these principles can lay the foundation of climate justice and promote international efforts to reduce global emissions. What is the importance of UNFCCC in reducing global emissions? The Convention (UN 1992) recognizes that climate change is a global challenge and must be tackled. As per Article 2, its ultimate objective is to \u201cStabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (human-induced) interference with the climate system\u201d. The Convention sets up a process through which governments meet regularly-Conference of the Parties (COP). It commits Annexes I and II Parties to provide \u2018new and additional financial resources\u2019 to support mitigation and adaptation in non-Annex I Parties, particularly those vulnerable to \u2018the adverse effects of climate change\u2019. It also obligates them to facilitate and finance \u2018transfer and access to environmentally sound technologies and know-how\u2019 to Parties to the Convention (Articles 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5). Parties to the Convention are also required to develop a greenhouse gas \u201cnational inventory\u201d of \u2018sources\u2019 (such as industries and transport) and \u2018sinks\u2019 (such as forests and ecosystems that absorb GHG from the atmosphere) (Article 12 (1a)). The Convention encourages Parties to share technology and to cooperate in ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially from energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry, and waste management, which together produce nearly all greenhouse gas emissions attributable to human activity. The major limitation of the Convention had been absence of legally binding targets for Annex I and II parties to return to 1990 emissions levels by 2000 (UNFCCC 2005). In order to impose legally-binding commitments on developed Parties, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997 and enforced in 2005.

Apart from the legally binding commitments, the Protocol proposes a climate insurance scheme through its three innovative implementation mechanisms. The mechanisms are designed to boost the cost-effectiveness of climate change mitigation by opening ways for Parties to cut emissions, or enhance \u2018sinks\u2019, more cheaply abroad than at home (***).The Compliance Committee established under 2001 Marrakash Accords and the Marrakash Declaration, monitors compliance levels with Protocol\u2019s legally binding commitment (UNFCCC 2001). The countries of Asia-Pacific are committed to abide by international legal standards on climate change. As a testimony of their compliance, the two economic giants of Asia have set voluntary emissions targets. India and China have pledged to reduce emissions (20-25 per cent and 40-45 per cent respectively) by 2020 (Alingod 2009). The developed countries in the region are also making concerted efforts to adhere to their legally binding commitments. Fostering climate-adaptive societies through international legal agreements The effective implementation of UNFCCC and Protocol can go a long way in fostering climate adaptive societies in Asia-Pacific and across the world. The international solution to the global threat of climate change lies in strict adherence to UNFCCC\u2019s sublime goals of: Effective implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies by all Parties; developed countries\u2019 compliance with legally binding emissions targets (as set by Protocol) and pursuing sustainable development model by all Parties to the Convention.

(**) Annex I Parties are industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy which took on obligations to reduce their GHGs emissions under the Kyoto Protocol. Annex II Parties are those countries that have a special obligation under the Kyoto Protocol to provide financial resources and transfer technology to developing countries. (***) Joint implementation allows Annex I Parties to implement projects that reduce emissions, or increase removals using sinks, in other Annex I countries. A Clean Development Mechanism provides credit for financing emissions- reducing or emissions-avoiding projects in developing countries. An emissions trading regime will allow industrialized countries to buy and sell emissions credits amongst themselves (see Articles 4; 12 (2); 17 of the Kyoto Protocol).

It also implies the ability to bounce back in a relatively short time frame after a devastating experience. A \u201cclimate resilient\u201d society, therefore, is one which will not only be able to adapt itself to the environmental changes and uncertainties brought on by a changing climate but one which is able to continue pursuing sustainable development despite seemingly insurmountable difficulties. This resilience is characterized by many dimensions which can be dissected at the operational, indicator level. At the heart of this notion is peoples\u2019 inherent desire to use knowledge and other tools at their disposal, not only to survive in the face of adversity, but also to strive towards a better quality of life. It points to the fact that people have the capacities to learn, innovate and evolve into higher societal forms that continually develop over time. A society\u2019s level of resilience is, in itself, an indication of the degree to which it has achieved human development. A more \u201cevolved\u201d and developed society has enlarged choices, including the most appropriate development responses to a changing climate. Climate resilience and human development are, therefore, two sides of the same coin. In both paradigms, people take center stage, both as an end and a means of generating the most responsive solution. Given this framework, the status of a country\u2019s human development indicators and targets, namely income, lifespan and education, can be starting points for analyzing its potential or existing capacity for climate resilience. Barriers to human development can then also potentially become barriers to climate resiliency. However, a deeper, more nuanced CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 47 analysis of the derivatives of these indicators should be undertaken, informed by experience on the ground, to generate practical, feasible response interventions. For example, economic status and educational levels cannot be absolute indicators for climate resilience as many rich, educated people caught in climate disasters are just as devastated, vulnerable and have difficulty recovering as their poor counterparts. In fact, in many cases, the poor seem to develop coping mechanisms faster, especially when they have nowhere else to go. This seems to indicate that a factor which is more influential than money and social status is at work, influencing the way affected communities think, plan and act when faced with the same danger or risk the next time around. And this factor seems to be knowledge, which is really processed information. Knowledge doesn\u2019t only come from formal education; more importantly, it comes from experience. History is rife with stories of communities who have coped over significant periods of time to climate variability and extremes such as indigenous peoples in fragile ecosystems or traditionally vulnerable communities in typhoon prone areas. In recent times, however, their capacity to cope is being outpaced by meteorological events, the timing and frequency of which are confounding us all. This seems to indicate that \u201cexperiential\u201d information is not being processed fast enough into adaptation or coping measures. The obvious response, therefore, is to invest in generating knowledge on climate risks and coping mechanisms which is grounded on solid empirical climate related information, alongside strategies to improve the socio-economic status of the poor and vulnerable and systems that are critical for sustainable human development. Knowledge must be coupled with wherewithal in order to translate intent into action. As the climate change imperative demands that countries pursue adaptation and mitigation in a balanced manner, other requirements like environmentally sound and climate friendly technologies should be made available in countries which do not have them, especially the developing ones. Technology transfer and technology development which also address the sustainable human development needs of the poor in developing countries should be facilitated. All of these imply that financial resources which are free of conditionalities, in order to respond flexibly to the specific needs of developing countries, should be made available as already agreed under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 48 Dear Network Members, Questioning the idea of a climate-resilient society I would like to add a dissenting voice to the notion of a climate-resilient society (CRS) for two reasons: a substantive one and a provocative one. On the substantive point (more below), the discussion to date seems to imply that there is no limit to a CRS, and, therefore, climate change is not a threat at all. Beyond this, I would like to provoke my fellow networkers to think out-of-the box and to ask deep questions about the technical and economic viability of a CRS beyond a certain threshold (which is yet to be established, as far as I know). In the opening message, our Facilitator, Pak Sum Low, offered broad and insightful parameters for interpreting and discussing a CRS, but I think that the discussion is yet to address the issues he raised. For example, from a strictly semantic standpoint, \u201cresilience\u201d by definition means recovery after a perturbation. Two elements are central to this definition: factors that endow a society with its \u201crecovery ability,\u201d and the temporary nature of the disturbance. The former is an internal feature of the society, while the latter is external in that it derives from the \u201cenvironment\u201d that cradles the society in an ecological sense. Therefore, the meaning of resilience is akin to that of unique: it cannot be more or less, since it suggests a return to the pre-perturbation status quo. That is, the response to the perturbation in all its rich dynamics, non-linearity and syntheses-restores the pre-perturbation equilibrium. If resilience and recovery are taken to mean the establishment of a new and more secure equilibrium after the perturbation, that\u2019s an even more sticker definition. If the above interpretation correct, a CRS would imply that such a society has the ability to completely recover from a climatic perturbation that is temporary in nature-to bounce back to its equilibrium situation prior to the one-off external shock. This is perhaps true or perhaps it is debatable. But what if the climatic perturbation is not temporary but is instead permanent as the scientific literature suggests? As I understand it, climate change does not happen abruptly, but builds up over a long period of time. Its effects accumulates, albeit gradually initially, but the changes it brings is irreversible at least within the next several thousand years or so. If this perspective is correct, the question arises: if the perturbation is permanent in nature and will probably become more pronounced over time, can we really speak of a CRS? If the answer if in the affirmative, one has to conclude that, if humans can engineer a CRS, then CC is not an issue. In other words, humans have the ability to cope with climate change whether that change is temporary or permanent. Climate change, then, is not the issue; the real issue is the willing to address climate change. While I am not entirely against the notion of a CRS, I am against the implicit assumptions that the \u201cbounce back\u201d ability is limitless and that the perturbation is temporary. There must a threshold beyond which a society-indeed, planet earth-will be unable to cope, let alone bounce back from climate change. Our sun, for example, has only enough fuel (hydrogen) to last for another 5 billion years. But scientists believe that long before that life on earth will come to an end, which brings me to another issue.

Ramesh Deputy Programme Coordinator Human Development Report Unit UNDP Regional Centre for Asia-Pacific, Colombo Office CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 49 About the contributor Ramesh Gampat, an economist, is the Deputy Coordinator of the Human Development Report Unit. He believes that too much has been written already on climate change; it is time to act. But there will be more hot air, as climate change illustrates a classic human dilemma: a greedy struggle to hog the benefits and dodge the costs. Privileged positions, entrenched interests and habitual modes of thinking are leading us into a dangerous cul-de-sac. Ernesto Bautista wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Pak Sum Low): Ernesto Bautista provides some equally thought-provoking comments on Ramesh Gampat\u2019s contribution posted yesterday. He points out that \u201cthe ability of society to completely recover from climate change disturbance\u201d \u201cwill depend on a number of factors-state of knowledge, technology, resources, and institutions, among others\u201d. These factors will be \u201cevolving over time\u201d and they will shape the societies in reaching \u201cdifferent levels of \u2018equilibrium\u2019\u201d. Indeed, the \u201cstate of knowledge, technology, resources, and institutions\u201d are all part of the factors that affect the \u201cvulnerability\u201d, and hence the ability of a society \u201cto withstand or recover quickly from difficult conditions\u201d caused by the adverse effects of climate change over short or longer term, as discussed in my Opening Statement for this sub-theme. Dear Colleagues, Many paths to developing resilient societies Ramesh and the previous contribution provide us with a thought provoking discussion in raising some important issues. In his dissenting view Ramesh questions the ability of society to completely recover from climate change disturbance which he views to be more long lasting if not altogether permanent. He also suggests that perhaps we should think in terms of the planet rather than society or societies when discussing about climate change resilience since the effects of climate change affect not just some societies but the planet more generally. I think that given the profound potential impact of climate change the ability of societies to be able to recover will vary substantially and may take a much longer time. Societies\u2019 ability will depend on a number of factors-state of knowledge, technology, resources, and institutions, among others. Indeed because knowledge and institutions usually take time to evolve so does the ability of society to bounce back. For those with more advance state of knowledge, technology and more developed institutions their adjustment maybe faster. In fact it is likely that a society will not achieve the \u2018equilibrium\u2019. Or if that equilibrium is achieved it is not likely to be the equilibrium in a comparative static sense. This is because if climate change affects the initial conditions and given that the planet and societies evolve continually what we will have are societies reaching different equilibrium-in other words-multiple equilibrium points. In other words, societies will be located in different equilibrium points; some better than others. And the path to these equilibrium points will be shaped by each society\u2019s state of knowledge, institutions, etc. all of which will also be evolving over time. All these suggest that societies\u2019 ability to bounce is not limitless but is constrained by many factors; that societies\u2019 adjustment or ability to bounce will follow different paths, and in the process may end up in the long run at different levels of \u2018equilibrium\u2019. I look forward to your comments. Regards, Ernesto Bautista Governance Team Leader UNDP Pacific Centre, Fiji About the contributor Ernesto Bautista is an economist by academic training.

Dear Colleagues, Gender-differentiated impacts I would like to share some ideas regarding gender and climate change (*). In order to explore the gender dimensions of climate change and environmental degradation, we must first identify a few of the key sectors and locations where climate change is likely to radically alter existing patterns of production and consumption. It is clear that people living in conditions of poverty worldwide and the majority of the populations of developing countries, will be disproportionately affected by climate change for three reasons: their location in parts of the globe that will register the greatest rise in surface temperatures and sea-level; their dependence on agriculture and environmental resources; and because they have fewer institutional and productive resources with which to mitigate the costs of climate change. Some of the key gender-differentiated impacts of climate change are: The loss of between 15 and 40 percent of species due to extinction associated with global temperature \u2022 increases of only 1-2oC (Stern 2007). Strong drying effects from changes in the hydrological cycle and wind patterns could result in the die-back of extensive areas of the ecosystems with the highest biodiversity on the planet. Increased time required for women\u2019s work on managing environmental resources (e.g. collecting water and firewood), makes it difficult for poor women to engage in other tasks and negatively impacts on their health due to the increased work burden. Rising temperatures, falling water tables, interrupted water cycles and drought will drastically reduce crop \u2022 yields, especially in Africa, and are likely to deprive hundreds of millions of people of the ability to produce or purchase sufficient food. Decreased production and productivity in agriculture (a highly \u2018feminized\u2019 sector), fisheries and forestry, is likely to result in food insecurity and hunger. Melting glaciers will increase the risk of flooding during the wet season and significantly reduce dry-season \u2022 water supplies to one-sixth of the world\u2019s population-most of those affected will be in the Indian sub- continent, parts of China, the Andes and South America (Stern 2007). Rising sea levels will contribute to land loss, coastal erosion and population displacement. The Stern Review (2007) projects that by the middle of the century close to 200 million people may become permanently displaced as a result of flooding, drought and rising sea levels. Loss of shelters, assets, family members, community networks, social capital and jobs may result in relocation \u2022 and transition to new livelihoods, and increased conflicts driven by climate change and disasters can increase women\u2019s vulnerability to violence. Impaired health because of diseases such as malaria and cholera, and psychosocial problems not only impact \u2022 women\u2019s health but also increase burdens on their care responsibility. A gender and human-centred approach to development that includes environmental sustainability will be essential if the global community is to confront the costs and coordinate the response to the urgency of climate change. Moving beyond narrow measures of economic progress to include multidimensional measures and maximize human well-being and environmental quality is going to be critical in the next phase of human development in the twenty-first century. Such an approach must consider women\u2019s rights and the gender dimensions of human CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 51 progress both in the analysis of the distribution of costs and benefits and in the exploration of how vulnerable populations respond and adapt to climate change. A gendered and rights-based analysis is likely to provide a richer understanding of the potential policy options in different countries and cultural contexts. What is more, without a gendered lens we are unlikely to harness the unique contributions that men and women can make to mitigating environmental degradation, adapting to or compensating for climate change, and ultimately conserving ecosystems and ensuring human and animal survival and well-being.

He describes how climate change \u201caffects men and women differently\u201d (e.g., women suffer from more mental and physical health problems; \u201climited access to livelihood assets\u201d; and high female illiteracy rate, \u201cespecially in ethnic minority communities\u201d). In order to make \u201cdevelopment and climate change responses\u201d equitable, \u201cwomen\u2019s empowerment\u201d must be placed at the \u201ccentre-stage\u201d.

Dear Network Members, Responding to climate change in Viet Nam: Opportunities for improving gender equality Through 2009 the UN and Oxfam in Viet Nam facilitated a policy dialogue on gender-climate change links. We did desk and field research on this topic, and concluded the work with a discussion paper presented in a high profile event. We analyzed rural gender dimensions of climate change impacts and of greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. National CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 52 and international experts participated in the policy dialogues. The paper recommends policy actions to address both climate change and promote gender equality. Following are some highlights. We used a vulnerability and sustainable livelihoods framework in which vulnerability is defined as inability to cope with, resist or recover from shocks and stresses including climate change effects. Power relations between the sexes and gender roles in livelihoods are stressed, as they influence vulnerability and adaptive capacity of individuals, households and communities, and women have less influence in decision-making, less secure resource rights and are more likely to experience poverty. We agreed that climate change adaptation and mitigation must achieve climate change objectives such as reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience to climate change shocks and stresses, as well as contribute to achieving gender equality. However, development and climate change responses can only be equitable if they place women\u2019s empowerment centre-stage. Actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions must also be gender sensitive. Trends that influence how climate change affects women and men include the rising social inequality between rural and urban areas in Viet Nam, and between ethnic minorities and the majority. Resilience is improving with better living standards, but it is distributed unequally. Awareness of gender equality has increased, but this does not always translate into increased gender equality in practice, especially for ethnic minority women. Women\u2019s participation in household and community decision-making has increased, but men continue to make the final decisions in relation to large expenses, and women\u2019s participation in local political and management structures remains low. Climate change affects men and women differently. For example, there are disproportionate effects on women\u2019s mental health related to natural disasters and women often eat less in times of food shortage and suffer more health problems for example due to lack of clean water. Both men and women experience increased workloads during disasters, but women are primarily responsible for household food supply and water collection, which is arduous during natural disasters such as floods and droughts. Many women in rural areas are taking on more agricultural tasks as a result of male out-migration and local non-farm employment. At the same time, women have limited access to livelihood assets which would enable them to cope with major shocks and stresses.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70652d83-cb53-402b-aae3-8631b703d115": {"__data__": {"id_": "70652d83-cb53-402b-aae3-8631b703d115", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2147769abebd4c27325c88b4c902cfc0a272ec19252f5b18770ea8183e9498eb"}, "2": {"node_id": "818ff07c-3268-4fae-b7d5-8a642bb44b9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "736fed640c7cd9893b5542e3c4aa5d55ceef0a5caf19250c5db15ce8acd81698"}}, "hash": "3014b5bb6d3e0337438aeecfd6e0241f595c7bad125524efa4be139dded93e14", "text": "Men and women identify different measures in response to climate change, yet women\u2019s voices are not being heard in decision-making on natural resources management and disaster management, despite their central roles and responsibilities.

While education is seen as an escape route from poverty, girls leave school earlier than boys, and female illiteracy rates remain high, especially in ethnic minority communities. Young people who do gain an education tend not to return to their remote homes. Teenage boys and girls identified many ways to increase climate resilience, such as learning and investment in new technologies, investment in education, and awareness raising. Girls focused on small-scale technologies and social investment in our dialogues on responses to climate change, while boys focused more on technological and industrial shifts.

Elements of good governance such as transparency, openness, responsibility, accountability, adherence to the rule of law and community participation in decision making processes are imperative for creating a climate-resilient society.

At least at this juncture only very little was achieved when global nations gather at the climate change summit in December 2009 at Copenhagen. The achievement was that the summit organizers were able to bring together policy makers, development practitioners, academia, media and industry players from all over the world; however the real global emission reduction targets could not be achieved for various known and unknown reasons. But, one reason is clear that some countries drive their own development agenda, that is monetary driven, rather than promulgating agendas that can ensure sustainable development and survival of human race. Nevertheless, with the advent of new age technologies like Internet and borderless mobile communications and networking the governance elements and processes at national and international levels are taking new shapes and forms. In particular, net citizen groups are formed on various topics and such groups constitute of global members irrespective race, colour, religion, creed, culture, language and traditions. Such groups are already exist in the world and whenever need arises they make the requisite policy and advocacy interventions. Indeed, such groups are emerging as powerful forces in the world addressing various issues, problems and challenges that are concerning welfare of global population. Thus, towards creating a climate-resilient society formation of such net-citizenry or e-governance groups warrant due attention. It is envisaged that in the near future size of any net-citizenry group can be even grow bigger than the most populated nations in the world. When they are truly united for a common cause they can withstand any detrimental or negative agendas that affect quality and dignity of living of global population, including the poor and marginalized. When such global forces continue to emerge in big number in various forms, I believe, automatically national governance will be compelled to evolve to adopt good practices in order to avert their own destruction socially, economically and politically. Realizing the growing new age socio-economic and political imperatives, governments are also compelled to take proactive actions of educating the masses about corruption-free society and integrity.

Dimensions of a climate-resilient society Under these premises, descending from the needed progression of human development to accomplish the objective of an increase of the human choices, the measure of a resilient community would seem to be the capacity of self- endowment with tailored instruments and tools to respond to climate change. According to new sustainable development paradigms, tools and instruments are provided through three major channels: a) the economic growth and the possibility to find ways to be endowed with tools and instruments; b) social protection policies provisions; c) balanced (especially from the local and national point of view) systems of governance. An analysis of the resilience to the impact of climate change in the Asia-Pacific region must always take into account the enormous (local and national) heterogeneity in the delivery of growth, social protection and governance. These drivers must then cope with the self-capacity of the communities in being prepared to respond to the threats they are exposed to. In principle, the capacity of a community to become self-sufficient in the availability tools and instruments of response to climate change - and therefore being more resilient-is encouraged, increased and enhanced by the three dimensions. But sometimes, as it is the case of the villages affected by the Yangtze river floods (*), resilience is also an issue of dealing with old, existing and well-known threats (**) to society, which must find long-term and stable solutions. Paradoxically, if we strictly focus on the theme of preparedness, there are some poor rural communities, (self- provided) with capacities of response, more resilient than some affluent urban communities to face an unexpected emergency situation. This point was stressed in this forum by Dr. Chew-Hung Chang on the case of the Katrina Hurricane floods, as well. Resilience and adaptation Regarding much part of adaptation issues, such as floods, droughts and desertification or health issues, it seems an easier task to control the risks descending from the threats than manage the threat in order to eliminate it. Therefore, resilience becomes synonym of capacity of adaptation (or preparedness) on behalf of social communities rather than meaning the full recovery of the environmental and socio-economic conditions preceding the impacts. Resilience, climate change and poverty For many communities increasing their own capacity of adaptation is an integral part of human development. Climate change has been identified as an increasing threat to and major challenge of achieving development goals and poverty CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 56 eradication. In China for instance, poverty alleviation achieved in some areas in the last decades may be reverted as is portrayed in a report by Greenpeace and Oxfam (Xu Yinling and Ju Hui 2009). Thus, there is a need to focus on the link between poverty and climate change in order to make robust the capacity development at community-level (***). On the relationship between climate change, disaster and vulnerability, integrating mitigation and adaptation under the need to address poverty alleviation will be a necessary step to increase the performances of governance and social response. According to the Chinese Government\u2019s White Paper on Climate Change (2008), adaptation has become a real priority. In China, the National Assessment Report on Climate Change illustrated the country\u2019s vulnerability to climate change. The impacts of climate change may make it harder for China to continue with its poverty reduction efforts in the ecologically most vulnerable areas. A 2nd National Assessment Report is being prepared to be published in 2010. The social dimension of resilience and UNDP Human Development Reports Based on the pre-conditions above we conclude that the reduction of risk in China can be realized and managed taking into due account the delivery of social protection tools, as the National Chinese Human Development 2007-2008 (UNDP China 2008) has already shown, focusing on the public services. The mere economic growth and good governance measures and policies cannot be automatically translated into punctual tools and instruments of defense or protection from the impact of climate change, if they are not followed by the growth of social self-awareness, social action and supported by solid social protection measures. Resilience, in the sense of social response, seems to be a concept that is more substantial than any other when we are dealing with the adaptation of people to changing climatic conditions (****).

With best regards, Andrea De Angelis, Senior Advisor on Climate Change G\u00f8rild Heggelund (PhD), Senior Climate Change Advisor Policy Support Team, UNDP China Notes (*) There were 178 extreme floods event recorded in the Yangtze River catchment between 2nd and 20th century (Becker et al. 2004: 343). Six regional or basin wide heavy floods occurred in the 90s with the greatest losses in the history. According to WWF (2009), the main threats are declines in crop production, and rising sea levels, which will make coastal cities such as Shanghai vulnerable. Some of the problems could be averted by strengthening river reinforcements, and switching to hardier crops. (**) With regard to the threats posed, it may be noted that Yangtze River Basin is a region struggling to contend with the environmental problems arising from population pressure and rapid economic development. The growth of China\u2019s population is heavily concentrated along the major river valleys. With an unprecedented economic boom, the pressure on natural resources is also increasing. There are also threats to biodiversity. Yangtze and particularly the Minshan have been threatened for many years by state-owned timber production and agricultural encroachment. In only 15 years (between 1974 and 1989), half of all the forest once occupied by giant pandas in Sichuan Province was wiped out by commercial logging. Almost all the natural habitats, including nature reserves, face pressure from people in surrounding communities. Ill-planned hydrological engineering projects and infrastructure projects in the flood plain have destroyed ecosystems and driven species out of their natural homes. (***) The strengthening of resilience must be related with the hard-core poor that are located in fragile eco-systems and face pressure from changes in the climate. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 57 (****) Furthermore, the capacity to create social models of cohesion and response becomes for the poorest and the most vulnerable (where economic growth and good governance are out of sight) the sole tool of survival, and the only possible response to the incumbent threats. (*****) This capacity of response will be not only limited to the adaptation but will be carried out also in response of the need of mitigate the climate from un-necessary emissions. The linear relationship existing in China between human developed and carbon productive provinces is a surprising and convincing argument that must be taken solidly into account, when we are dealing with the vision of societies that we should assist to become more resilient to climate change. Human development enhances the capacity of response to both mitigation and adaptation. About the contributors Andrea De Angelis has more than 12 years of experience in bilateral and multilateral institutional relationships with governments and international organizations (in China and Eastern Europe), and as advisor on climate change projects and policies, particularly on CDM. Before joining UNDP, between 2001 and 2006, as envoy from Italian Ministry of the Environment to China, he started up and directed a bilateral cooperation program, the Sino-Italian Cooperation Program for Environmental Protection in Beijing, leading the initiatives related to address, bilaterally, Climate Change. De Angelis completed a Master degree in Political Science on International Law, University of Rome. Before joining UNDP China in May 2009, G\u00f8rild Heggelund has worked as Senior Research Fellow and acted as Director of Global Programme at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute, Norway for a number of years. She completed a PhD in 2002 at the University of Oslo on the environmental and resettlement policies for the Three Gorges Dam, published as a book in 2004 (Environment and Resettlement Politics in China: The Three Gorges Project). Heggelund has studied and worked in China for a number of years, including in the UNDP China office with responsibility for energy and environmental projects.

However, some sustainable development-related literature suggests that even seemingly natural renewable resources can be degraded or degenerated to such an extent that their renewable usefulness for future generations is lost. This can include resources such as soil, groundwater, and biomass among others. With mono-cultural production practices, we have already lost valuable species of flora and fauna and this loss in biodiversity cannot be compensated (a point we should take special note of as this is the International Year of Biodiversity). With continued increases in the emission of greenhouse gases, climate change impacts on biodiversity will not be welcome. I think these realities call for a drastic change in lifestyle especially for those of us who live and/work in urban areas of the world. In that context, I think there is merit in livelihoods that are dependent on local resources (e.g., consuming locally grown/made food, biking/walking to work and using public transportation, etc.) instead of continuing with the business-as-usual approach of expanding our carbon footprint by importing consumer goods from overseas or even different parts of the same country (and using cars for commuting/traveling etc.).

New techniques that promote positive behavior should be explored (such as those being popularized through behavioral economics, which seek to promote socially valuable behavior through a person\u2019s self perceptions vis-\u00e0-vis their peers). CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 59 The example highlighted here, I think, is an example of anticipatory adaptation in a so called \u2018climate-resilient society\u2019 though I would prefer to use a term like \u2018climate-conscious society\u2019 because I think in practical sense, policy makers would be aiming for the latter. I think it is very important that in such a society (whatever term we choose to address it as) a main policy concern would be to reduce the rich-poor divide within that society. To go back to the idea of \u2018resilience\u2019, we can cite examples of success stories, e.g., in terms of less damage and loss of life due to improved disaster management practices in countries like Bangladesh. A popular example is comparing the death tolls in the cyclone of 1991 with cyclone Sidr in 2007 of comparable magnitude in Bangladesh. In the former, the loss of lives was about 140,000 (World Bank 2000); and in the latter it was about 3,400 (Government of Bangladesh 2008). There is also the practice of floating gardens to grow vegetables as food for the villagers in times of prolonged floods; which is sometimes cited. However, as I understand it, these societies are not really resilient. They are merely coping below a threshold that would be unacceptable for people in say, a western European country. This sub-subsistence \u2018resilience\u2019 is exposed if one goes back to the villages a few years after the natural disasters have taken place. People may seem to be thriving again but when one becomes familiar with their personal stories, things are not necessarily back to where they were prior to the disaster. They have adjusted to a new normal, and because there has been neither a social nor political revolution in the meantime, we draw the wrong conclusions. In this sense, the society might be adjusting to new levels of sub-subsistence; and people might be forced into becoming more compliant and conservative because of their vulnerability, but it can hardly be described as a society that has built back better. This is why I think it is important to unpack this concept further and consider how people cope, and how they respond the way they do, before we ascribe unanalyzed labels to them. My view of a \u2018climate-resilient\u2019 or \u2018climate-conscious\u2019 society is therefore one that lives within its means and houses a population that does not exhaust its natural resources with continued impacts of overarching carbon footprints on other societies as well. More generally, the concept of resilience seems to have taken hold in other conversations as well. UNDP\u2019s major capacity development event in March is occurring under the banner \u201cCapacity is Development: Smart Strategies and Capable Institutions for Resilient Societies\u201d. I expect questions about the meaning of resilience will be discussed there also.

I would like to add that the current international debate on the \u201cdangerous\u201d level of global temperature increase is focusing on 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C. The 2\u00b0C limit is provided in the Copenhagen Accord, while the 1.5\u00b0C limit has been strongly advocated by many developing countries, especially the small island developing states and the least developed countries. Dear Network Members, From a vulnerable society to a climate-resilient society Climate change is a very important issue, especially considering its effect on people-the heart of this e-discussion. Adaptation to climate change is already taking place, but on a limited scale. Adaptive strategies are needed to build climate-resilient societies and to secure livelihood options. The effectiveness of these strategies could be increased if adaptive capacity is strengthened across and within societies. Different and significant changes in physical and biological systems are occurring on all continents and in most oceans (see Rosenzwei et al. 2008). Most of these changes are in the expected direction, with an increase in the global surface temperatures and in sea level. Anthropogenic climate change, and climate change in general, is having a very significant impact on physical and biological systems globally. Clearly, the issue of global warming needs to be addressed seriously without any delay. As highlighted in the Stern Review (2006), developing regions are \u201cat a geographic disadvantage: they are already warmer, on average, than developed regions, and they also suffer from high rainfall variability. As a result, further warming will bring poor countries high costs and few benefits. Second, developing countries-in particular the poorest-are heavily dependent on agriculture, the most climate-sensitive of all economic sectors, and suffer from inadequate health provision and low-quality public services. Third, their low incomes and vulnerabilities make adaptation to climate change particularly difficult\u201d. This issue is particularly important for costal environments. According to a review of the population and urban settlement patterns in the Low Elevation Coastal Zone (LECZ) (*), many countries with a large share of their population in this zone are small island countries (**). But most of the countries with large populations in the zone are large countries with heavily populated delta regions. On average, the Least Developed Countries have a higher share of their population living in the zone (14 per cent). In some countries (most notably China), urbanization is driving a movement in population towards the coast (McGranahan and Anderson 2007). Continued greenhouse gas emissions at or above current rates would cause further warming. This will induce changes in the global climate system during the 21st century, which would very likely be larger than those observed during the 20th century. In Asia, warming greater than the global mean is projected for South Asia (3.3\u00b0C) and East Asia (3.3\u00b0C), and much more than the global mean in the continental interior of Asia (e.g., 3.7\u00b0C in central Asia, and 4.3\u00b0C in northern Asia) (Christensen et al. 2007). Studies have considered an increase of 4 degrees Celsius: the impact on people\u2019s lives across the globe would be catastrophic (see UK Government 2010). The effects across the planet would include a reduction in water availability and agricultural productivity, extreme temperatures/droughts, the risk of forest fire, etc. As the snow and the glaciers represent an essential source of water on the planet, this will impact people\u2019s life.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5942cfdf-86ca-46f3-9a7a-6e10fb327b8e": {"__data__": {"id_": "5942cfdf-86ca-46f3-9a7a-6e10fb327b8e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7552d68d0b62eb89f9df67e57b2e58c53f1da4bbdf72c5b80fbd8c1827f9da52"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9ee7e8b-638e-4c2b-9b64-84240986abeb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "529052d35f4e5aebb9e41dcf7e199983e9936a29eaeac4b993fd34cf2d13cd1a"}}, "hash": "c7188fd49e2cd2ad3182bdf57ff024b54dd5d95d1f069f5ca710316dd0ff030c", "text": "To understand the magnitude of this CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 61 impact (***), it may be useful to highlight that the Himalayan region provides freshwater to one third of the world\u2019s population.

Thanks to everyone. I was wondering how developing countries can contribute to building a resilient society in the face of climate change. An important point that needs serious consideration and immediate action is \u201cpoverty reduction as the best medicine for combating climate change\u201d. Unless poverty is tackled, pollution will grow, green house gas emissions will continue unabated and measure to deal with climate change (both mitigation and adaptation) will yield sub-optimal results. Take the case of poverty and population growth. One of the measures for alleviating poverty is reduction in fertility rates in the developing world; if fertility rates decline rapidly in the developing countries, the impact on climate change will be singularly spectacular through lower demand on natural resources. It is true that \u201ca large collection of people, especially in densely populated (but low emission) slums is more visible than the embodied emissions in a kilo of meat or a designer handbag\u201d but there are sound reasons for causing fertility decline, particularly local environmental ones (Doll 2010). It is important to listen to various projections on urbanisation. Population in ESCAP Region (which is roughly the Asia-Pacific Region) is projected to grow from 4.7 billion in 2005 to 5.1 billion by 2050. The entire population growth will take place in developing countries and it will occur wholly in urban areas, which will swell to 3.41 billion people (up from 1.68 billion in 2007) as rural population contract (from 2.39 billion in 2007) to 1.75 billion by 2050 in the ESCAP Region (*). By 2050 if most of the poor move to cities in the developing countries in our region, the impact CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 63 on waste management, water supply, sanitation and other key basic services, including a much higher elevated demand for energy and water, in urban areas will be devastating. The urban areas are already bursting at their seams with the present population load; fresh influx of people without fresh injections of massive doses of capital (which is very unlikely) will only worsen the situation. The new urban people from the rural areas will also face a very new kind of serious food insecurity as a vital source of food supply for them from the commons will no longer be available. Though they may have economic access to food (in terms of wages etc.), food availability will be a critical problem, not only because they will rely increasingly only on food produced by the use of technology but because the nature of food demand itself will change, making greater demand on environmental resources. Furthermore, food security will be compromised, through poorer food utilization and food absorption, due to poorer quality of water, lower sanitation and lack of access to primary health care and education.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 64 Dear Network Members, Climate change in a multi-polar world When thinking about the vision of a climate resilience society, two key concepts are critical-complexity and adaptive governance. Our ability to develop systems of resilience, towards the goal of achieving and sustaining human development, will be shaped by our ability to analyze and act on a complex array of social, economic, and ecological drivers of change. Beyond the technical and scientific aspects of climate resilience, a key concern will be the ways in which we adapt socio-political processes to address new levels of complexity arising from climate change. The concept of a climate resilience society will be defined not only by the nature of risk and resilience, but also by the changing nature of society. As we look to the future, climate governance will no longer be driven solely by the historical fault lines between developed and developing societies. It will also need to address the complexity of changes taking place as a result of the rapid shift of geopolitical power from West to East and the emergence of a more multi-polar world society. While attention has been given to the economic implications of this transformation, the social and ecological implication of this transition will be equally profound. Three main challenges and opportunities can be identified. First, Asia\u2019s own perspectives on climate resilience and social equity will increasingly shape the global discourse on climate change and our ability to craft meaningful adaptive governance measures. The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in 2009 (COP15) served as an example of how the shifting balance of power to Asia will determine the ways we define and act on climate risks. Countries like China, India and Indonesia share a common concern that their inclusion in hard emission targets would slow growth-a situation perceived to be unfair given the history of carbon-intensive growth in the West, and contrary to their right to development. In the past, issues of equity and fairness were often deemed secondary concerns taking a back seat to the scientific basis of climate change and the technical design of technology transfer and finance mechanisms. The assumption had been that global frameworks and norms had already reached maturity, and the remaining issues were ones of compliance, market incentives, and technology. There had been little recognition that the normative base for climate policy required reforming. Copenhagen showed not only the continued resonance of issues of fairness and equity, but also the increasing influence of Asia in placing such concerns at the center of the debate. Second, apart from the reorientation of global discourse between developed and developing societies, our vision of climate resilience in Asia will also be shaped by the rapid changes taking place within Asian society and the consequences for crafting effective adaptive governance measures. As globalization and middle-class consumerism continues to expand, Asia will itself become an important source of emissions and proximate cause for climate impacts in the region, from the shifting of the monsoon and the melting of the Himalayan glaciers, to the devastating toll from increasingly-frequent Pacific storms. While past and current debates rightly focus on the historic climate debt of the West for climate impacts, our ability to craft adaptive governance measures in the 21st century will also need to address sub-national disparities in human development and climate vulnerability, and the need for regional governance measures to prevent the risk of conflicts. Last, but not least, Asia will need to find its own pathways to addressing these issues, potentially leapfrogging the policies and cultural mindsets that have prevailed in the West. While the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the science of climate change continue to drive the global process, there is a need to go beyond science and engage new social narratives on the risks that ecological change bring for sustaining Asia\u2019s hard won development gains. The vision of a more climate-resilient and low-carbon society needs to include the potentially transformative role of civil society in Asia as both global consumers and local agents of change. This can generate a forward-looking vision of multilateralism and galvanize a new generation of environmental citizens across Asia to address what is quickly emerging as a common concern of humanity.

He highlights the research gaps on vulnerability assessment and response preparedness in Viet Nam, not only in cities, but especially in rural communities where nearly 72 per cent of the population live. Dear Network Members, Vision to climate-resilient and some experiences from Viet Nam I understand that climate-resilience is linked to sustainable development. In the context of global warming and climate change where extreme weather events and natural disasters have become increasingly common, climate preparedness determines the resilience of sustainable livelihood. Climate resilience should not be confined to climate preparedness but to embrace sustainable use of natural resources and energy, and greenhouse gases emission reduction. Therefore, \u201cclimate resilience\u201d needs to include these elements or to be guided by international regulations. Otherwise, it would not be feasible to address the evolving challenges of climate change, as well as the interactions with critical development issues, such as food security, especially in poor countries. Climate change will affect human development by changing livelihood patterns, production activities and people\u2019s vision of the future. Planning for climate change adaptation and mitigation would make significant positive contributions to building a climate-resilient society. Role in building a climate-resilient society For the poor countries, poverty reduction in parallel with industrialization, urbanization and effective use of natural resources may not be adequate to facilitate climate resilience. This has to involve all sectors and communities who have a role in changing people\u2019s attitude to climate change mitigation. Strengthening or building human and institution capacity for a climate-resilient society requires stepping up involvement of people from different sectors, policy makers, professional and administrators alike, as well as knowledge of different demonstration and site specific sustainable management practices. Strong government regulations and policies, and active media are some of the most effective elements for improving society. Science and technology play also an important role in building a climate-resilient society by disseminating data information based on modelling and climate predictions to provide optimal options for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Traditional knowledge has a very important role in building a more climate-resilient society. For example, in Viet Nam, CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 66 many adaptation measures have been applied and practiced at the community-level. Since a long time ago, farmers know how to read the signs of the sun and the moon, and other early warning indicators of potential catastrophies to avoid damages by making advance adjustments to production/management. They also have the experience of adapting to climate change impact by: i) choosing high resistant crop varieties that thrive in saline/acid sulphate soils; ii) adjusting crop calendar to coincide with periods of favourable weather conditions; iii) diverting water flow from the main river to prevent sea (or saline) water intrusion into fresh water or irrigation system; and iv) switching from three rice crop rotation to double rice crop and fish as an adaptation measure to threats of sea-level rise and flash floods from upstream.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4304cde1-0208-43ea-bd48-c214cc8820cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "4304cde1-0208-43ea-bd48-c214cc8820cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "be1bbc00c84d3f6bc85e684a07b6a01888fd9312857c45adb4cef817227b97b4"}, "2": {"node_id": "a012f8be-851f-46aa-9cec-dde050aa2880", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e6df573cf8aef386315b1df5e6d44fef99e2b870baeec75f0685c13dbf364f19"}}, "hash": "187b6090be4a00fedfc033ec09a60046e079b888cc8f62f17bbd0ed5c8eb0b97", "text": "Research gap I have studied the World Bank website and learned a lot about the vulnerability assessment, preparedness and response evaluation to the climate-related events/disasters.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 67 Dear Network Members, Climate-resilient community under emerging climate change scenario: Bangladesh context Bangladesh, which is home to about 162 million people (United Nations 2009: 31), is one of the most populous countries in the world. The population density (of about 1,099 persons per square kilometre) is also high (Wikipedia 2010). Bangladesh is also one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change. Therefore the issue of building a climate-resilient society needs special attention. The country\u2019s geographical location, its low and flat topography and dense population, means that natural hazard events often result in disasters with a high loss of life and economic damage. Two-thirds of the country is only five metres above sea level and it is identified to be the most vulnerable country in the world to tropical cyclones and the sixth most vulnerable country to floods (Ministry of Environment and Forests 2008: 5-6). It has been estimated that six to eight million people could be displaced by 2050 and would have to be resettled if the sea level is higher than currently expected and costal polders are not strengthened and/or new ones are built (Ministry of Environment and Forests 2008: 13). Displacement may be also the result of extreme weather events, as in the summer of 2007 when the monsoon floods displaced more than 20 million people in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal (World Bank 2009: 31). People displaced internally or across borders are vulnerable to disease (St. Louis and Hess 2008, cited in World Bank 2009) and suffer poverty impacts which can be irreversible.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4bc1493-9eca-41d6-9324-ea3ba694e94b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4bc1493-9eca-41d6-9324-ea3ba694e94b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "709eeb8275e5f224d807bc3f4a63f406bb86653ea266546157420813b2c356fd"}, "2": {"node_id": "31724711-1284-4e23-b03f-817d8802c59c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02e9624e9eae059cbd2446d1160ef9e7eee477dde1d8508a4f45b08ec7ea2ca1"}}, "hash": "f59a49f17b92312ea9e2bec103ddca620897edd54e36cef45171f04357fe9e03", "text": "Efforts to build a climate-resilient society In September 2009, the Government of Bangladesh, approved Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) and created Climate Trust Fund to meet the challenges due to the causes and effects of climate change to ensure continued human development.

Climate change affects disaster risks in two ways, firstly through the likely increase in weather and climate hazards, and secondly through higher vulnerability of communities to natural hazards, particularly through ecosystem degradation, reductions in water and food availability, and changes to livelihoods; (iii) Innovative approach for pro-poor growth improving the quality of life of urban poor; (iv) Practicing sustainable land management; and (v) Sustainable development with proper attention on (a) poverty environment and climate mainstreaming into the planning and budgeting process, (b) access to disaster and climatic information/early warning, and (c) localization of MDGs and adaptation to climate change at the local level and all of these are closely linked toward achievement of MDGs. Way forward: Beyond cyclone shelter - climate-resilient habitat Traditional settlement patterns in the coastal areas are no more climate-resilient. People\u2019s life and livelihood are not secured and fully at the mercy of nature. The number of cyclone shelters is not adequate for the large population. It is therefore important to develop an integrated disaster/climate-resilient habitat, which incorporates a disaster risk reduction approach and livelihood protection issues. UNDP initiated a pilot demonstration on integrated disaster/ climate-resilient habitat with provision of structural safety (owner\u2019s driven cyclone resilient home building and landscape planning and designing, tidal surge safety measures, saline proof structure, etc.), adaptation interventions CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 68 (i.e., renewable energy, rain water harvesting, bio-gas digester, etc.), social/human development interventions (i.e., women and children\u2019s program, health and nutrition care, etc.), community based livelihood supportive interventions (common horticulture, floating agriculture, grazing land and mini-dairy farm, pond for aquaculture, common production centre etc.), user-friendly early warning systems (not only hydro-meteorological but sectoral preparedness such adaptive crops, fisheries and health related preparations, soil condition trend, early warning for sustainable land and water management as well). The communities in habitat may explore the possibilities of tapping local tourism opportunities. These initiatives show how Bangladesh is responding to the consequences of climate change and is pushing for sustainable solutions in different fields, all aiming to improve the security of human beings.

However, Ramesh Gampat provided \u201ca dissenting voice to the notion of a climate-resilient society (CRS)\u201d. He questioned if \u201ca society has the ability to completely recover\u201d or \u201cbounce back\u201d from a temporary or even permanent \u201cclimatic perturbation\u201d. He also questioned \u201cthe technical and economic viability of a CRS\u201d beyond a certain yet-to- be established threshold, and suggested that the cost may be \u201cprohibitive\u201d. He believed that \u201cit is more useful to talk about the planet\u201d rather than \u201ca society or some societies, affected by and coping with climate change\u201d, though he found \u201cit difficult to conceive of a climate-resilient planet, given that earth is a closed ecosystem\u201d. Sarwat Chowdhury echoed a similar view that it is not possible \u201cfor societies facing the manifold impacts of climate change to rebound back to their original state\u201d since the situation cannot be \u2018elastic\u2019. She highlighted the \u201csub- subsistence \u2018resilience\u2019\u201d that simply indicates that the people have \u201cadjusted to a new normal\u201d. Further to Ramesh Gampat\u2019s observation, Ernesto Bautista provided some equally thought-provoking comments by highlighting the time-dependent nature of the factors (e.g., state of knowledge, technology, resources, and institutions, among others) that affect \u201cthe ability of society to completely recover from climate change disturbance\u201d. These factors will be \u201cevolving over time\u201d and they will shape the societies in reaching \u201cdifferent levels of \u2018equilibrium\u2019\u201d. On a similar point, Kishan Khoday and Usha Natarajan highlighted how the \u201cchanging nature of society\u201d in Asia will be central for understanding the nature of \u201ca climate resilience society\u201d and for design of effective responses. They emphasized the \u201cpotentially transformative role of civil society\u201d as \u201cboth global consumers and local agents of change\u201d, who can \u201cgenerate a forward-looking vision of multilateralism and galvanize a new generation of global environmental citizens across Asia\u201d to address the emerging \u201ccommon concern of humanity\u201d. Two contributions discussed the sub-theme within the context of the UNFCCC. Bernarditas Muller emphasized that the UNFCCC, \u201cwhen providing for responses to the adverse effects of climate change\u201d, focuses on adaptation, as the adverse effects of climate change \u201care wide-ranging, covering all aspects of human development and not only the physical environment\u201d as suggested by the word \u201cresilience\u201d in Article 1.1 of the UNFCCC on \u201cdefinitions\u201d. She pointed out that adaptation \u201cis also the obligation for which financing and technology should be provided to developing countries\u201d, and that \u201cpolicy-making is solely under the competence of States\u201d, and \u201cit should not be imposed as a conditionality for enabling means to be provided to developing countries to meet their sustainable development objectives\u201d. Hasna Cheema highlighted that the major principles of the UNFCCC (1992) and its Kyoto Protocol (1997), such as \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d; \u201cprotection of vulnerable societies\u201d; \u201cprevention and mitigation\u201d; \u201csustainable development\u201d and \u201csustainable economic growth\u201d, are \u201ccritical to foster climate-resilient\u201d or \u201cclimate-adaptive\u201d societies. If fully implemented, including the commitments of Annexes I and II Parties for non-Annex I Parties (e.g., Articles 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5), they \u201ccan lay the foundation of climate justice and promote international efforts to reduce global emissions\u201d.

Opening Message Dear Network Members, Following the successful conclusion of the discussion of sub-theme 1 on the Vision of a Climate-Resilient Society, we now move to sub-theme 2: Mapping and Measuring, which will be discussed in the next two weeks. Climate change is not only an environmental issue, but also a sustainable development issue. Thus, this sub-theme will cover the quantitative aspects of the environmental, social, economic and even political issues that are related to climate change and that are also crucial for achieving sustainable development. Any national policy, strategy and action plan in response to climate change in key socio-economic sectors should be an integral part of the national sustainable development policy, strategy and action plan. The development of both of these policies, strategies and action plans must be based on science. Otherwise, unscientific policies, strategies and action plans will certainly lead to failure. We hope that by offering this sub-theme on Mapping and Measuring in climate change, we are providing a forum for national scientists", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e312f27-4381-4c6c-b4d6-1b3178c012ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e312f27-4381-4c6c-b4d6-1b3178c012ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe224e927760c6e2a36dfb2ec0247758f7e59319abc5692f5e146faba5f3fb6d"}, "3": {"node_id": "e1260ff1-ca6a-4b5d-afed-55f450db30be", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fcf610bf7991c7ed2251d776c297559942b48429c2f00a70c4c229a59c41bf3f"}}, "hash": "fd5602d0b5dcf39f9123db6a4a8146c7a29d0f2e228ef1172d867edf6bfbdd17", "text": "in the Asia-Pacific region, who may inform us of their latest scientific research activities relating to climate change, whether it is on physical science, or on impact, vulnerability and adaptation; or on mitigation of climate change, as well as relevant tools and technologies (e.g., space technologies and remote sensing), that they are using for mapping and measuring in their scientific research. In particular, we would like to link the above scientific research to human development. Thus, the following topics will be relevant to the discussion of this sub-theme: a) Scientific assessments in climate change, especially those at national and regional (Asia-Pacific) levels, including changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols; observed changes in air, land and ocean temperatures, precipitation, glaciers and ice sheets, oceans and sea level; historical and paleoclimatic perspective on climate change; biogeochemistry, carbon cycle, gases and aerosols; satellite data and other data; national and/ or regional climate models and projections-these are also the areas largely covered by IPCC Working Group I; b) Climate change impacts, vulnerability and adaptation assessment, including the vulnerability of socio - economic and natural systems to climate change; impacts of climate change in various sectors (water resources; ecosystems; food and forests; coastal systems; industry; and human health), and options for adaptation; inter-relationship between vulnerability, adaptation and sustainable development; relevant tools and technologies (e.g., space technologies and remote sensing) and indicators (e.g., vulnerability maps and indices); linkage to human development (e.g., Human Development Index (HDI), green index)-some of these areas are covered by IPCC Working Group II; c) Mitigation of climate change, including greenhouse gases inventory; cost-effective mitigation options and measures through limiting or preventing greenhouse gas emissions in key socio-economic sectors (e.g., energy, transport, buildings, industry, agriculture, forestry, waste management), and enhancing activities that remove them from the atmosphere (e.g., reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation or REDD); green growth (environmentally sustainable economic growth); Environmental Performance Index (EPI); sustainability index; policy instruments for reducing emissions (e.g., green tax)-some of these areas are also covered by IPCC Working Group III; d) The economic cost of addressing climate change and reducing disaster risk, including social and environmental cost, with the development of relevant indicators (e.g., green Gross Domestic Product (GDP); Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW); and Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)); e) Research (both systematic observation and human development), including data coverage, acquisition, analysis and dissemination, especially at national and regional levels. In addition, as raised by my UNDP colleague, Ramesh Gampat, does it make sense to develop a \u2018green\u2019 index of development? If so, should the HDI be modified or should a new index be developed? Since the APHDR is a report on climate change and human development, mapping and measuring the two, including feedback and synergistic CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 73 effects, are crucial issues.

Dear Network Members, Some comments on the \u201cmapping and measuring\u201d of environmental questions The state of the environment A focus on the environment - the natural environment - draws attention, most distinctively, to our physical environment and debates about the environment hinge, first of all, on physical measures of the environment. Indeed, a discussion of environmental issues necessarily involves references to things such as trends in global temperature, the level of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, the amount of non-renewable natural resources (especially fossil fuels such as coal, petroleum and natural gas) that are extracted from the earth, and the reduction of the stock of renewable natural resources to dangerous levels (such as in overfishing, deforestation and the overuse of fresh water aquifers). In turn, physical measures of the environment have played a key role in the debate about the environment. For example, the Keeling curve, the first continuous measure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, helped to establish that global atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide were rising. And, more generally, the development of such physical measures, the result of much scientific work, has been key to drawing attention to the widespread degradation of the environment. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 74 The social dimension of environmental questions Assessments of the state of the environment, particularly when they point to problematic patterns and trends, immediately raise social questions. Specifically, an awareness of environmental degradation has focused attention on three complex and much debated questions: 1) Is environmental degradation anthropogenic, that is, the result of human activities? 2) What are the social consequences of environmental degradation? and 3) What policy responses should be given to the problem of environmental degradation? The debate, fortunately, has moved forward. The view that environmental degradation is not a social problem and that no change of course is needed has been discredited by scientific research and the work of groups such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). That is, the lack of environmental sustainability of current policies has been widely recognized. Nonetheless, among those who share the view that current practices are not sustainable and hence call for policy responses, there are some important differences concerning a basic issue, namely, how should environmental issues shape our thinking about what constitutes social progress? The conventional economic growth-centered perspective The currently conventional perspective is well represented by The Stern Review (Stern 2007) and the debate it has generated. This report essentially provides a cost-benefit analysis, which estimates the future costs of current policies regarding the environment and compares these costs to those associated with policies that aim at redressing environmental problems. Thus, understandably, much of the debate surrounding this report\u2019s conclusions revolve around the adequacy of the report\u2019s use of a low discount rate, meaning that the value of consumption in the future is not seen as differing much from consumption in the present, an assumption that increases the assessed benefit of current actions designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Yale Center for the Study of Globalization 2007). But, it is noteworthy that this debate takes as a given that costs and benefits are adequately assessed in terms of GDP growth, that is, an income and market-based measure. The shortcomings of GDP as a measure from an environmental perspective are well known. Not only does GDP not directly take into account the implications of environmental degradation and the depletion of natural resources. In addition the GDP ignores any non-monetary losses associated with environmental degradation and, furthermore, perversely considers \u201cdefensive expenditures\u201d aimed at rectifying or preventing environmental degradation - e.g., the annually US$10 billion worth of trading on global carbon markets reported by Stern (2007: 304) - as gains in GDP. Thus, it is important to stress that the merits of discussions such as those provoked by the Stern Report notwithstanding, such discussions still never quite bring the question, growth \u201cfor what?\u201d into clear focus, and are framed in terms of the challenge of attaining sustainable economic growth as opposed some broader notion of sustainable development or sustainable human development. Alternative perspectives Efforts to fashion an alternative to the conventional, economic growth-centered, perspective have focused, among other things, on the development of measures of social progress that overcome the limitations of the GDP. And, in this regard, three different approaches to the development of measures can be distinguished. 1. Green GDPs.

Examples of such measures are the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the similar Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) (strictly speaking, these measures are not green GDP measures since they take private consumption expenditures as their starting point). But these measures lack official backing and data on these indices are available only for a handful of countries. Indeed, discussions concerning the development of a Green GDP have largely stumbled due to a lack of consensus regarding the valuation method, that is, how to assign a monetary value to things that are not exchanged on a market. 2. Physical measures. A second set of measures focus on non-monetary indicators and get around the hurdle concerning the valuation method by relying solely on physical measures. A well-known example is the Ecological Footprint (EF) measure, available for 240 countries, territories, and regions, and calculated by comparing human demands of nature to how much nature can supply by way of regenerative biological capacity. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 75 3. Hybrid socio-physical measures. Finally, a third set of measures also focuses on non-monetary indicators, though not solely on physical measures, and get around the hurdle concerning the valuation method by using methods similar to those used in the human development index (HDI). Examples of such an approach are the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which includes physical as well as social (health-related) indicators and is available for 163 countries; and the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI), which includes physical, social (health-related), demographic and other indicators and is available for 235 countries and territories. These and other attempts to develop measures that overcome the weaknesses of the GDP have been the subject of much discussion (Lawn 2006, 2007: Part III; Gadrey and Jany-Catrice 2006; Bartelmus 2008; Fleurbaey 2009). And this discussion has certainly done much to clarify how we might go about bringing the environment into discussions of public policy. Nonetheless, it is also clear that the development of a suitable aggregate measure that incorporates GDP along with measures of the environment - much as the HDI aggregates a measure of income along with other key social indicators - is a project that still awaits official backing. This situation is an obvious indication of the continued dominance of GDP as the overriding goal of public policy and the treatment of environmental problems as matters of secondary importance, to be tackled only within the parameters of decisions aimed at attaining economic growth. Hence efforts to place sustainable human development at the centre of policy discussions continue to be needed. With best regards, Gerardo L.

Dear Network Members, Human development and climate change: Let\u2019s think small and incremental Human development and climate change are the two big challenges facing our generation, and they both seem to be going in the wrong direction. The worsening state of human development is the first force of nature. Left to their own, liberal markets create a lot of wealth, but they usually create it for those who innovate, and those people tend to be the ones who are well off to begin with. Left behind, the poor have less and less to offer, aside from a few handicrafts and artisanal crops, and have become worse off not just in relative, but often in absolute, terms. The second force of nature seems to be climate change. One of the major enablers of the wealthy\u2019s wealth is cheap and convenient energy, and the cheapest and most convenient of this is in the form of fossil fuels, just waiting to be dug up and burned. This raises temperatures and messes up rainfall, and the poor - least able to innovate and adapt - suffer most. The temptation has been to think big and bold. To counteract the worsening condition of human development, we need to undertake projects that make life better for the poor, somehow satisfying their wants and needs by providing the things measured by the Human Development Index (HDI): to keep them alive, to educate them, and to give them the power to buy things. To counteract climate change, we need of course to reduce our burning of fossil fuels, but we also need to \u201cclimate proof \u201d the development of the poor: building dikes and seawalls and irrigation systems, and helping them to grow drought resistant crops. The problems with this approach only begin to become apparent when we try to support it with mapping and measuring. In a recent study, we looked at how the poor are affected-killed or displaced-by climate-related extreme events (Patt et al. 2010). We found two interesting things. First, the effects of human development, as captured by HDI, are non-linear. Below an HDI of about 0.6 - roughly that of India or the Solomon Islands - higher levels of HDI actually correlate with higher levels of risk, while the least developed countries are safer. This is so even after controlling for other important effects, like countries\u2019 exposure to extreme events. This means that for many countries in the Asia-Pacific region with the lowest HDI levels - Cambodia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea-improvements in measurable development could actually be making people\u2019s sensitivity to climate change worse. Nobody knows why. Second, the effects of climate change that we can anticipate for the coming few decades are highly ambiguous. In the country that we studied in great depth, Mozambique, climate models did not project much of an increase in exposure to extreme events, even while the trend of observed events over the last four decades suggests a rapid rise. To prepare for the future, do we trust our eyes, or our computers? If we try to plan far in advance, there is a 50 per cent chance of getting it wrong, and either protecting people too little, or too much. In the face of this uncertainty, I want to suggest more attention to the underlying driver of the poor\u2019s worsening relative and absolute poverty and their high climate sensitivity, which is an inability to innovate. What the poor need is the freedom and the capacity to make continual minor adjustments to where and how they live, and how they earn their livelihoods. There is evidence that education may be the biggest driver of this (Lutz et al. 2008), as literate, critical thinkers with access to information are able to copy the innovations of others. Institutions that provide security - not just social safety nets but also effective property rights and access to safe bank accounts, as well as risk spreading arrangements like insurance - are also important, as they leave people with greater freedom to take chances.

Dear Network Members, How (not) to measure countries\u2019 vulnerability to climate change There is substantial interest in measuring, and mapping, the vulnerability of nations, regions, population groups, and/ or economic sectors to climate change. For instance, several member countries to the UNFCCC have suggested that the IPCC develop a national-level index of vulnerability to climate change to guide the allocation of resources from the Kyoto Protocol Adaptation Fund. Quantitative vulnerability indices are being applied at many scales (from local to global) and with different policy objectives (e.g., raising awareness of climate change risks, guiding the allocation of resources for adaptation, identifying suitable entry points for interventions, and monitoring the progress in reducing vulnerability over time). However, quantitative vulnerability assessments face a number of challenges, and many past assessments do not withstand scientific scrutiny. This contribution highlights key challenges faced by quantitative assessments of vulnerability to climate change, suggests criteria for the development and application of \u201cgood\u201d vulnerability indices, and briefly reviews some existing vulnerability indices. What is vulnerability to climate change? It is important to recognize that vulnerability means different things to different people because the term is used differently in a variety of scholarly communities that are contributing to climate change and global change research. Some conceptualizations of vulnerability only consider the internal side of vulnerability (e.g., socio-economic and environmental conditions in a region) whereas others also include external aspects (e.g., the frequency of hazardous weather events). Some conceptualizations (e.g., in the literature on secure livelihoods and famine, following a political economy approach) focus on the social and economic dimensions of vulnerability, others (e.g., in the natural hazards literature, following a risk-hazard approach) focus on the physical and environmental dimensions, and still others (e.g., in the climate change and global environmental change literature) include both dimensions.

Finally, index developers need to carefully consider seemingly technical choices regarding reference level and normalization that will often dominate the results. The following questions serve to illustrate some of these challenges. If a currently water-scarce region will experience a substantial decrease in future water availability with a probability of one third but a substantial increase with a probability of two thirds, should it be regarded as vulnerable to climate change or not? Is it possible to assess and compare flood risks in different communities by combining quantitative information about changes in extreme precipitation events at the river basin level with qualitative information on the quality of national governance? Is China more vulnerable to sea-level rise because of the large number of people at risk or Kiribati because of the large fraction of its population at risk? Should a vulnerability (or risk) index reflect the total level of flood risks including climate change or only the change in flood risks due to climate change? Criteria for \u201cgood\u201d vulnerability indices Vulnerability indices should be developed with a view the following criteria of scientific quality and policy relevance. Note that there is a trade-off between some of these goals, and the balance should reflect the purpose of the vulnerability index. 1. Clear purpose: The purpose of the index should be clearly stated because its policy relevance can only be assessed with reference to a specific decision context. 2. Specificity and validity of data selection: The underlying data should reflect the purpose of the index. As far as possible, the data selection should be based on a theoretical model of vulnerability (theory-driven index) or on its statistical relationship with a suitable vulnerability outcome (data-driven index). 3. Methodological soundness of index construction: The index construction should follow established mathematical and scientific standards. Common flaws include inappropriate combination of variables at different measurement scales, of normalized and non-normalized variables, and the (unintended) scaling of vulnerability with population size or area. Vulnerability indices should be normalized by population or area so that a region is not considered more vulnerable than another just because it is more populous or larger. 4. Simplicity and comprehensibility: An index is more easily accepted by policymakers if it is simple and comprehensible than if it is very complex. 5. Data availability and reliability: An index is more easily accepted by policy makers if the underlying data are freely accessible and reliable than if it contains proprietary data and/or highly controversial data. 6. Transparency and reproducibility: The documentation of the index construction should be detailed enough so that the index can be reproduced by anyone with access to the underlying data. 7. Results consistent with expert knowledge: An index is more easily accepted by policy makers if the results are largely consistent with expert assessments of the relative ranking of regions or population groups. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 79 Existing indices of vulnerability to climate change Some national-level indices of vulnerability to climate change have been developed with a focus on social vulnerability (e.g., National Adaptive Capacity Index and the Predictive Indicators of Vulnerability). These indices largely resemble established development indices (e.g., the human development index, human poverty index, or the human assets index). Other indices focus on environmental vulnerability (e.g., the climate change subindex of the SOPAC Environmental Vulnerability Index) and on integrated vulnerability (e.g., vulnerability-resilience indicators and the indicator of 21st century socioclimatic exposure). Some of these indices attempt to quantify the generic vulnerability of countries or regions whereas others are targeted at specific risks (e.g., mortality from meteorological hazards). Scientific reviews conclude that all of the existing national-level indices of generic vulnerability to climate change have severe conceptual, empirical, and/or methodological flaws that preclude their application to guide major policy decisions, such as the allocation of adaptation resources. Policy decisions should instead be informed by combining disaggregated indices for different climate risks or climate-sensitive sectors with expert judgement. A particular convincing example has been the selection of countries and regional groups for participation in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) of the World Bank. Based on reasonably detailed guidance by the World Bank, a multidisciplinary group of experts combined quantitative indicators of socio-economic vulnerability, biophysical vulnerability to different climatic hazards, and aid effectiveness with their subjective judgements in a transparent manner to recommend a limited number of countries and regional groups for inclusion in the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ddd2702-686e-4c89-93da-bace8bb586d2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ddd2702-686e-4c89-93da-bace8bb586d2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7975709b689ad5fde3bfb258c63af4ae48905f2726326995d4510873eccef1b"}, "3": {"node_id": "a3cbadc7-05ab-4a2d-8307-c385c373f50d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2b9eb3a28ff31cd0119e2e509c2103bc4bd4c3768aaa4656fa01036aa718f392"}}, "hash": "d124003e87bb3ceb6819e375e5242e213ca0dc7d74c872d37b35159bb3fcc1a9", "text": "PPCR. Conclusions Good vulnerability indices are characterized by a clear purpose to guide the index development; by reliable data that is available at the appropriate spatial resolution; by sound methods for combining the heterogeneous information into an aggregated index, or a set of indices; and by their transparency and understandability. Aggregate indices of vulnerability to climate change tend to hide controversial subjective judgements that should be discussed and resolved explicitly through a political process rather than implicitly by scientific experts. Policy decisions, such as the allocation of resources for adaptation at the national or international level, should thus be based on a set of vulnerability indices for different climatic risks or climate-sensitive sectors combined with qualitative information from relevant experts and detailed guidance about political priorities rather than by a single aggregate vulnerability index that falsely suggests scientific objectivity.

Dear Network Members, Data concerns: Evolving socio-economic markers for climate change Sustainability and vulnerability Climate change has raised many concerns for South Asian economies which are striving to attain balanced and inclusive development. Given the likely adverse impacts and the unpredictability of these impacts to a certain extent, adds several dimensions to the analysis of social and economic implications of the consequences of climate change. Climatic change has major implications for livelihoods, particularly for the vulnerable sections of society. Data for impact analysis and data for designing effective adaptive strategy can be integrated into a development framework. It is the concern with sustainability which makes it politically and economically acceptable to measure and map climate change impacts and adaptation, across scales - global, regional, national and local. The sustainable development framework also allows for a wide range of experiences and perceptions to be accommodated, admitting interdisciplinarity in sample design, data collection and interpretation. Of paramount importance is the bringing together of various stakeholders at the local or community level to inform understanding of both ecosystem stresses and the close relationship between stress and adaptation. However, data and information flows regarding ecosystem/ climatic stress get influenced by the efficiency and inclusiveness of the operational institutional structure and governance framework.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3cbadc7-05ab-4a2d-8307-c385c373f50d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3cbadc7-05ab-4a2d-8307-c385c373f50d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7975709b689ad5fde3bfb258c63af4ae48905f2726326995d4510873eccef1b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ddd2702-686e-4c89-93da-bace8bb586d2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d124003e87bb3ceb6819e375e5242e213ca0dc7d74c872d37b35159bb3fcc1a9"}}, "hash": "2b9eb3a28ff31cd0119e2e509c2103bc4bd4c3768aaa4656fa01036aa718f392", "text": "Vulnerability of socio-economic development to climate change in developing countries is associated with criteria such as income differentials, land-holding patterns and inter-state variations in productivity.

It is as much a concern for food production as of calorific consumption norms, expenditure elasticities and access to food. The effectiveness of using economic instruments for providing incentives for changes in cropping patterns, crop diversification, promotion of water use efficiency and energy use efficiency also depend on the reliability of baseline data on the basis of which these are designed. Challenges in working with existing data An important input into the development of adaptive strategies is the study of past behaviour by economic agents such as producers and consumers in response to changes in ecosystem services. Typically, these take time to manifest themselves and longitudinal datasets are a valuable input in understanding how human society adapts to such changes. Unfortunately, this aspect has not been adequately covered in most existing datasets in South Asia. Differences in sampling units, large gaps in time periods for repeat surveys make comparisons across time difficult. In the absence of data sets that mesh into each other, researchers draw on data from multiple sources, with varying sampling frames. The data and statistical challenges that emerge are a serious concern. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 81 A primary requirement seems to be to make available data by coordinates, which map datasets easily from one on to another. Alternatively given the data collection systems already in place in several South Asian economies, attempts should be made to identify common variables across datasets, particularly in terms of socio-economic categorization. Apart from this, in the case of climate change there is a pressing need to generate specific datasets such as those for areas threatened by sea-level rise. There is also a need to bridge fragmentation that arises across datasets. Ideally, one should have specific data collection where the sourcing or selection criteria are derived from both climate science and socio-economic considerations. I illustrate this point with some specific examples for India, where existing datasets could be strengthened to become very useful in climate change analysis. Some illustrations The Compendium on Environment Statistics in India as of now reports data on a number of ecosystems. For instance it provides data on the coverage, area and density of mangroves in the country. However, to utilize it in an effective manner for adaptation strategy one needs to know more about demographic variables and livelihood patterns in the ecosystem, given that mangroves have important ecological functions, such as restricting damage to lives and livestock through their storm protection function. A dataset which combines the biophysical indicators with the social, economic and demographic parameters will enhance both an understanding of the pressures on the ecosystem, and the likely relocation costs due to climatic impacts such as increased cyclonic activity or sea-level rise. Similarly, in the Power sector there are dual imperatives of providing a minimum threshold level of clean energy for the poor in South Asian economies along with energy conservation. In high growth situations, this calls for as much importance being attached to data based on detailed sampling (classes) on consumption of the upper income groups as for the poor. This would help to address cross-cutting influences in the strategy on increasing power consumption and enhancing energy efficiency/conservation. Another area which has increasingly gained importance is that of health statistics. In the context of climate change, data on mortality and morbidity on specific diseases becomes very important. These include vector borne disease (malaria), waterborne diseases, and those related to heat stress. This calls for universal birth and death registration in the country, which provides reliable data and markers on the type and extent of illness. There is here an urgent need for better reporting to forecast with greater confidence the additionality of disease burden imposed by climate change. Preliminary findings on malaria transmission in India show that by the 2050s, changes in climatic conditions could lead to newer states becoming prone to malaria, such as Himachal Pradesh in the north and coastal states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala (Bhattacharya et al. 2006). Here again, however, the extent of vulnerability, in terms of increased morbidity, mortality and health costs would depend on the socio-economic and demographic situation in the affected regions. There is probably a greater deal of uncertainty regarding future socio-economic conditions than climatic conditions, and the time scales for these tend to be different in a typical projection and planning exercise. Therefore to begin with one seeks to build a few plausible reference points for the future, which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "942d4d1b-2a75-4ef1-9f76-438f126de577": {"__data__": {"id_": "942d4d1b-2a75-4ef1-9f76-438f126de577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8521612e0e7ada74ce8003826e1a5e71493794a0cecc1ebe67322eb3f61e29bf"}, "3": {"node_id": "73640ed7-28b5-47f3-8c5f-40af701ab5f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "936bd7c73fe5259dc0b5f8729a9f2a019829d3d3d0ca644918e6867b997ff010"}}, "hash": "e0b32f713a60fc56640727cd166e8e889f4fe89864e9b5394c4300da98c6ef8d", "text": "integrate climate science inputs about the future with current developmental data.

The UNFCCC only refers to countries \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d to climate change. The Global Climate Risk Index (CRI), as presented here by Sven Harmeling, builds on the direct economic losses (in terms of percentage GDP) and the number of deaths. However, the CRI, while \u201cbringing more transparency into the debate about extreme event impact\u201d, has its limitations. For example, of the six Asian countries that are in the top 10 countries \u201cmost affected in 1990 to 2008\u201d, Myanmar ranks second after Bangladesh, due to only \u201cone remarkable event-Cyclone Nargis in 2008\u201d, even though \u201cother Asian countries were hit much more frequently by extreme events\u201d. In addition, data availability \u201cis a certain disadvantage for very small countries such as some small island states\u201d. Furthermore, the CRI does not include \u201cindirect impacts\u201d and \u201cthe total number of affected people (in contrast to the deaths)\u201d, which could be most significant in extreme events such as droughts, which are slow onset with non-structural impacts, as \u201cis often the case in African countries\u201d.

Thus, before we use or cite the CRI to assess which countries are \u201cmost affected\u201d by, or \u201cmost vulnerable\u201d to climate change, we must recognize its limitations. However, the CRI complements other analyses of extreme weather impacts. Dear Network Members, The Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index: Extreme events in Asia in the last 20 years What is the Global Climate Risk Index? The Germanwatch publication Global Climate Risk Index 2010 - Who is most vulnerable? Weather-related loss events since 1990 and how Copenhagen needs to respond was published during the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. The Climate Risk Index, which has been published annually since 2006, provides a quantitative analysis of the impacts of extreme weather events such as storms, floodings or heat waves. It is based on one of the most reliable databases analysing the impacts of such events, provided by the MunichRe NatCatService, and further takes into account socio- economic data, such as the population and Gross Domestic Product. This index builds on two key criteria: the direct economic losses occurring from such extreme events, and the number of deaths. Both the absolute figures and the relative impacts-deaths per 100,000 inhabitants and losses per unit of GDP in percentage-are taken into account to balance the very different underlying implications of taking absolute or relative figures. For example, if only the absolute number of deaths would be taken into account countries with a bigger population would be \u201cfavoured\u201d, while in the relative case one victim in a small country may lead to a much higher ranking than thousands of deaths in a bigger country. Each edition contains an annual and long-term ranking as well as additional analyses. There would be additional options for analyses with the figures available.

The limitations to the data availability, including the socio-economic data, is a certain disadvantage for very small countries such as some small island states, since particularly in a longer-term comparison, sufficiently sound data are not always available. Furthermore, the data only show direct impacts of extreme weather events, while, for example, heat waves often lead to much stronger indirect impacts (e.g., through droughts and food scarcity), which is often the case in African countries. Also, it does not include the total number of affected people (in contrast to the deaths), since the comparability of such data is very limited. This is another reason for the relatively low visibility of African countries amongst those countries ranked highest. However, the experience that Germanwatch has gathered with this tool shows that it is effective with regard to bringing more transparency into the debate about extreme event impact. Furthermore, since generally media is quite perceptive of indexing and ranking, it has received a lot of media coverage, in particular in those countries and regions particularly affected. This can help to promote national debates about the urgency and adequacy of responding.

Dear Colleagues, A livelihood vulnerability-based alternative I would like to share some ideas regarding approaches for climate change impact assessments. Climate change is manifested in the form of increased frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters such as floods and cyclones; climatic variability in terms of changes in temperature, predictability of rainfall and the onset of seasons. It is already established that climate change is having a huge impact on the agricultural sector in developing and least developed countries across Africa, Asia and Latin America, and the relationship between climate change and food insecurity is becoming apparent. The crop loss to disasters and crop failure due to erratic weather pose a great threat to the food security of poor and marginalized communities.

Climate models (UNEP recommended models) are then used to map changed climates (including temperature, pressure patterns, rainfall patterns soil moisture, sea-ice extents and other parameters of the climate system), comparing today\u2019s climates generally using a 1990 baseline with conditions of some undefined time in the future when CO2 levels are approximately twice the pre-industrial levels (possibly by 2050 or soon after). There is uncertainty inherent in this process, the outcomes of which are various \u201cgeneric scenarios\u201d or \u201cclimate futures\u201d (Huttner et al. 2003). The next steps are to consider what effects these changes to climate around the world might have on physical and biological systems. Then it adds further levels of uncertainty and dramatically increasing the complexity of the systems and interactions that certainly need to be thoroughly studied. Then consideration is made of the impacts of preferred scenarios on human activities. Apart from the complexity of branching pathways, this approach is problematic for another reason-the original global warming estimates are given in ranges. For example, currently a range of 1.4 to 5.8oC increase is projected by 2100 (IPCC 2007). Therefore all derived scenarios are similarly broad. Thus the road map to assessment in the conventional approach is complex and problematic. As climate conditions change, it is neither clear how to draw thresholds of effect on either biophysical systems or on any human activities, nor indeed properly consider responses. For example, it may never be possible to state that a sea temperature increase of say 2oC will allow a certain coral reef system to be sustained whilst one of 2.5oC will cause it decline. And it is likely we will never be confident in a given situation that a rise of 2oC in 50 years will be sustainable but in 40 years will not. It is practically almost impossible to draw lines around the sustainability in the conventional approach (Huttner et al. 2003). CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 86 A livelihood vulnerability-based alternative Seeking a way to minimize the complexity of the conventional decision-risk tree approach, an alternative approach is possible which can better integrate climate science into local concerns and real livelihood choices, and provide improved policy support. In this approach one can start at a local level by considering today\u2019s livelihoods and how they can be sustained in the light of today\u2019s risks and vulnerabilities. The fact that the increased number of climate and weather-related hazards in today\u2019s risks makes the conventional approach to become more complex and problematic. The new approach consider, however, how improved knowledge of possible changes in the climate risk mix because of projected global warming might affect communities and impact on their options and livelihood choices in the context of sustainable development. This approach would enable responses to climate change to be fully integrated into development. Then, improving our understanding of the likelihood of change and knowledge of impacts can help to overcome ignorance and can provide development opportunities in all societies (Huttner et al. 2003). To provide the linkage from vulnerable livelihoods to biophysical drivers and climate scenarios, a methodology can be envisaged which would cluster typical or archetypal communities, livelihoods, stakeholder groups, and multi-sector interactions according to the opportunities and threats they face in today\u2019s world, in the face of variable climate. Analysing the vulnerabilities of these livelihoods provides a powerful knowledge base from which to consider climate change impacts, avoiding the extreme complexities of the decision-tree generated by starting at the top with global temperature projections. Many communities in developing countries may be ignorant about climate change science and the likely direction of change and yet they are especially well-adapted to sustaining livelihoods, having traditional adaptive capacity in an uncertain present, and have relevant knowledge of extremes that can inform their decision-making now and as future climate change occurs. The innovative approach known as \u201cA Livelihood Vulnerability-Based Alternative Approach\u201d will allow assessing indigenous approaches which have been used by communities for years and therefore they were time and space tested tools for adaptation. Another important issue in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and coastal community resilience (CCR) is that not only the risks of the community are important themselves, but also the risks themselves are changing by the following causes, namely (i) climatic causes; (ii) non-climatic causes; and (iii) environmental governance.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 88 Dear Network Members, \u201cMapping and measuring\u201d climate change for Asia and the Pacific It is timely to assess the potential effects of climate change on human development in Asia and the Pacific. These are pressing issues, which have implications for national, community, and individual policy and responses. Governments are still trying to understand what to do internally and cooperatively with each other on the world stage with respect to climate change. A better-measured mapping of the situation would be valuable. Policies/programmes/forecasts/responses regarding flooding, drought/desertification, heat waves, sea-level change, and implications for biodiversity, surface and groundwater, agriculture, food security, fisheries and other climate- dependent resources, industry, health, as well as other impacts on human development and security, are more effective when grounded by credible data and illustrations, and the knowledge derived therefrom. Each of these sub-issues may be helped by good data, visualizations, and assessments of ways forward. IPCC reports are an excellent starting point for digested data and mapping. But there is some new information which (1) did not reach the IPCC reports; (2) have been compiled since the reports were edited; or (3) could be compiled now if priorities could be adjusted to make such compilations-and specialists attracted to adjust priorities to release such knowledge. Other sources result from international cooperative mechanisms under WMO, UNEP and the International Council on Science (ICSU). All regional economies\u2019 meteorological services (even if several are not WMO members) may individually or jointly be good sources of such information. Some sample issues on mapping and monitoring for which data/mapping may be valuable are highlighted below: It appears possible to compile new graphics indicating El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a some associations in global and \u2022 regional context, including precipitation, temperature, floods and drought. Such information could help prioritize developmental policies and activities. Studies note that coasts far from the Last Glacial Maximum have characteristically experienced sea-level \u2022 drop during the past 6,000 years (see Figure 11.5 in IPCC 2001). Detailed studies for southeastern Australia indicate that sea-level rise after the Last Glacial Maximum caused sea level to reach its current level ~7700 years ago, plateau at about 1 - 1.5 metres above current sea level during ~7400 - ~2000 years ago, after which it gradually dropped again to present mean sea level (Sloss and Murray-Wallace 2008). Local sea- level change between 1950 and 2000 could be viewed at (see Figure 5). The Asia-Pacific region generally ranges between -2 to +2 mm/year. The general global pattern of sea-level change is not observed universally. Some areas may experience uplift or subsidence, which affects local sea-level change. Data/ model results for many parts of the region may be available to help illustrate regional patterns in more detail. What other data/graphics could be produced on a regional basis to improve climate-change related \u2022 understanding and decision making? Who might be able to provide such materials-using what sources? Can the sourcing and provision of such materials-in themselves help to strengthen regional institutions? Is it feasible to craft an environmental indicator for countries in Asia and the Pacific - (1) that includes \u2022 as many states as possible, even small island states; (2) that is based on data that can pass a regional or global test of relevance; and (3) that is not merely an exercise in ranking countries-but can be as useful as possible for decision makers to pursue progress in countries? I have some thoughts on this, as I have been working to draft a prototype index-which is hardly perfect at this point, but may be useful particularly after vetting and likely improvements in formulation or presentation by the Network. Although not necessarily in the context of mapping and monitoring-it may be worthwhile to compile summaries \u2022 of sources of information for stakeholders to use-particularly those active in the region.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 90 Dear Network Members, Sharing data and information: Challenges on re-developing the web-based ASEAN biodiversity information sharing service (*) The ASEAN BISS (**) - Rationale The increasing availability of distributed mapping and the need for more robust analysis of biodiversity information from diverse sources of data have continuously challenged bioinformatics research and development. And as biodiversity issues straddle countries and ecosystems, information sharing has to scale up from national to regional and global levels. In 2004, the Vientiane Action Programme proposed the establishment of a functional regional database or network of national databases containing inventory of the biological resource of the ASEAN Region. Following the 2008 CBD COP9 (see UNEP 2008), Parties encouraged regional partners holding biodiversity information to establish regional, sub-regional or thematic clearing-house mechanisms to provide support to national clearing-house mechanisms, to share knowledge, and to facilitate scientific and technical cooperation relating to biodiversity. These scenarios and regional and global decisions provided the rationale for the re-development of the Biodiversity Information Sharing Service (BISS) under the Biodiversity Information Management of the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity (ACB).

The data and process component included the biodiversity data generation, analysis, exchange and reporting processes, as well as the multilateral environmental agreements\u2019 guidelines and data standards and sharing protocols. The information technology component involved the use of Internet, databases, tools for collaboration, websites and portals and applications to enable the AMS to access, share, and exchange biodiversity information within and outside the region. For information sharing to work in the AMS, ACB through its Biodiversity Information Management program addressed the needs, gaps and opportunities in all three areas. The broad re-design process for the ASEAN BISS version 2.0 involved rapid assessment for ICT assessment and information needs; enhancing the data sharing capacities of member states (people component); moving the species and protected area database to an open source platform, re-establishing links with relevant national, regional and global data holders, and preparing a framework for data sharing (data and processes); designing a Map-Room and lodging the ASEAN BISS within the ACB and ASEAN Clearinghouse Mechanism Website or CHM (information technology). The major challenges and lessons learned are discussed below. i) To enhance capacities for data sharing and information harmonization, a rapid assessment on ICT and biodiversity information needs was conducted (ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity Conservation 2009c), and a series of Biodiversity Data Sharing and Information Harmonization were designed and implemented for the AMS from 2007 to 2009 CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 91 (***). The rapid assessment initially involved using a questionnaire but there was hardly any response; hence more focused face to face interviews using the survey questionnaire were undertaken. For the capacity building activities, the challenge lie on the ensuring that the almost the same set of trainees attended the training to ensure continuity of understanding the training concepts, support the set of data validation exercises as well as provide updates on post- training in-country activities. At least two representatives were always invited for each training workshop. ii) Prior to the actual re-development of the original BISS, the data holdings and links to external databases were reviewed. As there was no formal handover nor technical documentation then, the old species and protected area contents had to be manually reviewed and moved to MySQL platform. Old partnerships with relevant data holders including GBIF, WorldFish and UNEP WCMC had to be re-established since the redesign of the ASEAN BISS involved linking the basic species and protected areas data fields to details in updated global data sets held by these data holders. To support information harmonization, the core data fields used in the ASEAN BISS were matched with the data fields of relevant data partners. However, until partnerships were officially established through an MOU or MOA, caution had to be practised in downloading new datasets from global data sources to update the ASEAN BISS. Research on existing data sharing guidelines of data holders as well as those of ASEAN member states pointed to differing guidelines and procedures. As part of the data harmonization activities and to facilitate information sharing, a framework for sharing biodiversity information was drafted (ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity Conservation 2009a) and presented to ACB\u2019s National Contact Points in 2008. iii) The centerpiece of the ASEAN BISS re-development was the designing of the Map-Room. In the past, using commercial mapping software was the norm for publishing content and maps on the web. However, the cost of maintaining up-to-date versions of commercial softwares is huge. For the re-development of the ASEAN BISS, an open source mapping platform-Google Map API was used. After the initial re-development activities were completed, the ASEAN BISS including the Map - Room can already be directly posted on the web. Highlighting its web presence and promoting its use, however, were seen to be another set of challenges. To ensure greater exposure, the ASEAN BISS was linked to two websites: the ACB website and the ASEAN CHM website. User acceptance testing, presentations in workshops, and soft - launching also helped in re - introducing the ASEAN BISS.

Developing and promoting the use of map-based information sharing platforms like the ASEAN BISS can support the communication of scientific studies on the links of biodiversity and climate change.

This will serve as the start of Map-Room\u2019s expanded visualization function not only for biodiversity but also for other observable parameters on the MDG and possibly climate change. Conclusion Summing up, the re-development of the ASEAN BISS took a long iterative and consultative process with ASEAN Member States and data partners via workshops and face to face focused discussions. The process also took into consideration existing national, regional and global data holders and their sharing requirements and guidelines. Early engagement with the stakeholders ensured that needs and gaps were considered during the re-development phase. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 92 The next phase of the ASEAN BISS will have to focus more on updating its data holdings, consider the incorporation of MDG and climate change parameters in the Map-Room, expand its regional analysis and mapping capability, and develop more automated uploading and downloading tools.

Dear Network Members, The price of progress Mapping and measuring It is difficult to conceive of sustained economic progress and human development without the use of natural resources-what the classical economists called land, what was called until the 1990s natural resources, but what is today properly called the ecosystem. In fact, the ecosystem is both the supplier of natural resources and the sink for the absorption of waste that is an inevitable byproduct of human progress. This inevitable byproduct of progress degrades the ecosystem, which could be serious enough to pose a threat to our very existence, as well as that of other species, in the long run. Two crucial factors are thus the engine of the equation: human progress and our closed ecosystem. The purpose of the mapping and measuring exercise, as we see it, is to gauge the link and feedback loops between the two: do they move in opposite directions, bi-directionally or not? Two widely acceptable measures of economic progress are per capita GDP and the Human Development Index (HDI) (*). How does one gauge the status of the ecosystem? The preferred approach is an indirect one: ascertaining factors that cause the ecosystem to degrade. Some of these factors include CO2 emission, share of urban population, the structure of an economy, electric power consumption, energy use per capita, fossil fuel consumption and forest area. So, in essence, the mapping and measuring exercise is one that attempts to chart factors that connect economic progress and HD to ecosystem and vice versa. Our purpose here is not to propose a rigorous framework for a new index to measure the impact of progress on the ecosystem or to suggest ways of greening the HDI - we believe that the HDI is good as it presently is and should be left alone. Instead, we propose to explore superficially the relationship between the HDI (per capita GDP explains more than 75 per cent of the HDI) as the measure of progress and CO2 emissions (total metric tons and per capita). Beyond this, we shall look at the \u201cprice of progress\u201d: the cost of human development in terms of CO2 emission. We have data on these variables for 113 countries, 20 of which are from the Asia-Pacific. The data The initial year for all indicators is 1995, while the end year varies between 2005 and 2008, depending upon data availability. Almost all countries grew their HDI between 1995 and 2007, while the volume of CO2 they pumped into the atmosphere (total and per capita) either increased or declined. More than one-fifth of the countries in the sample pumped less CO2 per capita into the atmosphere even as their GDP and HDI have risen. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 94 The countries that experienced changes in the HDI of more than 20 per cent during 1995-2007 are developing countries. In all cases, their emission of CO2 per capita has either increased more than 30 per cent or actually declined (seen in case of African countries). Another group comprises countries, including some of the so-called emerging economies, registered HDI growth of less than 20 per cent but recorded CO2 growth of more than 30 per cent. A third group of countries grew their HDI while pumping less CO2 into the atmosphere. Such diverse patterns between CO2 and the HDI certainly require further research, which is beyond the scope of this short piece. CO2 and the HDI It is by now an indisputable fact that human progress spews an increasing amount of CO2 into the environment. At the risk of oversimplifying the issue, we propose to take CO2 as a proxy for the price of progress and the HDI as the gauge of progress itself. Then the price of progress could be written as CO2/HDI (**), which simply shows the amount of CO2 associated with a unit of the HDI. This is, of course, at the national level, but it might be possible to calculate sub-national CO2 and HDI, if necessary. The results show that some of the least CO2-intensive countries are in Africa, as might be expected. Interestingly, some of the high CO2-intensive countries are both developed and developing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c1d1fa6-82c4-4eed-9aa5-704f5fc35333": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c1d1fa6-82c4-4eed-9aa5-704f5fc35333", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d125f7b3b50f60f440346023b9b3644e2079e0c6aafd2235aa2d5f06bd51b15c"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ccf0db1-b469-4f93-9886-56f945e3953c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d4156883427092aeba0b1a58c4d479a0f7d47e635c60f7b8aa9ae40e53053491"}}, "hash": "576a7ae61b2eea432bce46a0a07a90eb2d6c3849214f93fe5e72d7a2251d0a17", "text": "economies.

One immediate global policy implication of this formulation is that of a global carbon tax: the idea that there is a threshold to the \u201ccapacity\u201d volume of CO2 per unit of HDI. We do not profess to know how to set this threshold (which would probably require a paper in itself), but one simple approach is to take a weighted average: sum of country per capita average CO2 and divide it by the sum country-weighted per capita GDP. CO2 emission above this threshold becomes taxable. How much should the tax be? The tax could be levied on each increment of CO2 above the threshold. This increment is yet to be defined, as is the tax itself. Incidentally, it might be noted that there are proposals for a global financial transaction tax set at 0.05 per cent per transaction (Rodrik 2010). The \u201cgreen\u201d tax could potentially raise hundred of millions of dollars, which could be used to promote the development and deployments of green technology, particularly in poor countries. \ufffd R\u00b2 = 0.323 - 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600 650 700 750 800 850 900 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Millions tons of CO2 HDI Figure 1.

As GDP has a positive time trend (excepting a few countries), it can positively influence HDI values, even if countries do not show progress on the education and health indicators. (**) There have been debates in recent years about measuring carbon intensity, such as total carbon emission, per capita carbon emission or per unit of GDP carbon emission. These proposed measures have influenced the climate change negations at the international forums in one way or the other. As far as we know, we are the first to propose the CO2/HDI method to look at the carbon-intensity of progress. One important limitation of this method is that it does not discount for the population or GDP of a country. The results are preliminary observations and we appreciate your feedback.

With the creativity and innovativeness of humankind, I certainly believe that the answers are \u201cyes\u201d for both questions. Indeed, Anuradha has presented some recent data from CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 96 India and China to answer the second question. This brings to the concept of \u201cGreen Growth\u201d or environmentally sustainable economic growth, which has been actively promoted by UNESCAP since 2005 (http://www.greengrowth. org/). \u201cGreen Growth\u201d will address many of the issues raised here. However, for \u201cGreen Growth\u201d to be sustainable, not only it needs to be \u201cenvironmentally sustainable\u201d, but also \u201csocially sustainable\u201d, and even \u201cpolitically sustainable\u201d in terms of sustainable government policy for its promotion and implementation. Dear Network Members, Transforming and transcending growth in measuring climate change The measurement dilemma: GDP dominance The big question before the word is: can we transcend or at least transform economic growth as the aim of policies and people\u2019s lives? And if we are to do so, how do we map and measure change? At a macro level while GDP continues to be the overall explicit goal of public policy, governments have realized that they can become vulnerable on other grounds, like food shortages, health disasters or natural calamities, and more recently climate change. While the media does raise issues other than money, it has been easier to prioritise economic growth in public discourse, largely because it is easier understood and better backed by regularly available and officially accepted data. Increasingly, other indicators of well-being like the HDI family of indices, and disaggregated data on school performance, health, demography, emissions, etc., along the line of the MDGs, have gained growing legitimacy as yardsticks by which societies are assessed. And even as income-based assessments continue to concern people as aspirational goals, people themselves are coming to expect public policy to deliver a better quality of life for the current and future generations. Official statistics are attempting to respond to this pressure. Climate variability and change is one such area. However the dilemma is that while most non-income indicators, like better schooling or health outcomes, correlate positively with income, cleaner air or lower greenhouse gases do not correlate except in limited cases (*). There is little need to resist growth if the aim is a better quality of life for all, except when it comes to human-behaviour- induced climate change. While people do benefit from clean air, water and less variability in the climate, tradeoffs can be uncomfortable. The short-run implications for behaviour change in production and consumption are not easy to operationalise, even if accepted. Concomitantly, consensus in mapping and measuring climate change from a people\u2019s perspective is still to be established. No official backing yet As succinctly argued by contributors like Gerardo Munck and other contributors, a suitable aggregate measure that incorporates GDP along with the environment - much as the HDI aggregates a measure of income along with other key social indicators - is a task still to receive official backing. Environmental issues are no longer denied, but are still seen as needing to be addressed within the framework of decisions aimed at economic growth. Efforts to bring sustainability considerations at the heart of policy debates continue. Greening money or going physical? \u2018Greening money\u2019 and \u2018going physical\u2019 are two directions that are seen. Greening money includes attempts at adjusting GDP for environmental damage to develop a Green GDP in dollars-transforming how growth is assessed. Examples are the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) and the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI). But these continue to use private consumption expenditures as a starting point and are dogged by a lack of consensus in how to assign a money value to things that are not exchanged on the market. And, not being backed by official statistics, data are only available for a few countries. Going physical includes attempts to bypass growth to capture the ecological footprint by assessing human demands of nature against how much nature can supply through regenerative biological capacity.

The tragedy of the commons is very much in our face-while many in the developed world grapple with transforming and even possibly transcending growth, powerful interest groups continue to benefit from the conventional green- house-gas-intensive growth paths. These issues are also extremely relevant for large and highly growth-oriented societies of Asia like China and India. Can countries of Asia demonstrate that there could be other ways to organize production consumption and exchange without necessarily compromising living standards-essential if poverty and inequality are to be tackled? A quick look at the trends in per capita emissions and GDP growth data for India (Figure 1) and China (Figure 2) between 1980-2007 shows that while emissions and growth have been closely correlated for decades, China may have started to decouple GDP growth rate from per capita emissions from 2004 (***). While a search for consensus on other indicators and indices continues, the extent of decoupling is one way for countries to map and measure. Figure 1.

Closing Message Dear Network Members, The discussion of sub-theme 2 on Mapping and Measuring continues many of the issues raised in Sub-theme 1: Vision of a climate-resilient society. It has attracted 10 contributions from 12 contributors over a two-week period. We would like to thank the following contributors for their important contributions: Gerardo Munck, Anthony Patt, Hans- Martin F\u00fcssel, Purnamita Dasgupta, Sven Harmeling, Tun Lwin, David Hastings, Ma. Consuelo Garcia, Ramesh Gampat, Niranjan Sarangi and Manoja Wickramarathne (joint contribution) and Anuradha Rajivan. This sub-theme aimed to map and measure climate change and its adverse effects on human development, including the inter-relationships between climate change and ecosystems, as well as other environmental, ecological, social and economic changes and their inter-relations that affect human development and vice versa. The discussion was lively and informative, and the topics that have been covered were diverse and wide-ranging. These include: data and mapping improvement for better policy and decision-making (David Hastings) and for \u201cdesigning effective adaptive strategy\u201d that \u201ccan be integrated into a development framework\u201d (Purnamita Dasgupta); physical measures (e.g., Keeling curve for monitoring the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration) (Gerardo Munck); hybrid socio-physical measures (e.g., Environmental Performance Index; Environmental Vulnerability Index) (Gerardo Munck; Anuradha Rajivan); GDP and its shortcomings, and Green GDP (Gerardo Munck; Ramesh Gampat, Niranjan Sarangi and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6bbe2eb6-ed71-4231-949f-c6d97aaf56e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "6bbe2eb6-ed71-4231-949f-c6d97aaf56e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4b4f6efa021b3d62d322472925e2154d988eb3f23ca269baf83283775e3443b"}, "3": {"node_id": "55d74c69-fe95-4dfe-82c2-9fcaf45bd1ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca88f1adad147a24a0ceaa1270160a3b16f362bc2bf4bcf429be91f5fa44d319"}}, "hash": "a1c3d469327a98f1158011bb58d5c8cd188a45b78f0f4e194945b5848798d24d", "text": "Manoja Wickramarathne; Anuradha Rajivan); Human Development Index (Anthony Patt; Ramesh Gampat, Niranjan Sarangi and Manoja Wickramarathne; Anuradha Rajivan); criteria for social and environmental vulnerability CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 99 indices (Hans-Martin F\u00fcssel); Global Climate Risk Index and its limitations (Sven Harmeling); uncertainties in climate models (Anthony Patt; Purnamita Dasgupta; Tun Lwin); community-based vulnerability assessment (Tun Lwin); ASEAN Biodiversity Information Sharing Service (BISS) that may incorporate social, ecological and climate change data (Ma.

The following issues, in particular, stand out from the discussions, and indeed, further discussions on these issues are still needed: How do we make use of \u201cimperfect\u201d data as useful as possible and to help decision makers to mitigate possible \u2022 risks? (David Hastings); The importance of incorporating the social dimension in environmental assessment ( \u2022 Gerardo Munck). A similar point was made to explore the possibilities of incorporating social, ecological and environmental parameters, such as the Millennium Development Goals, as well as climate change data, into the web-based ASEAN (BISS), particularly the Map-Room, which is a visualization tool to show the links between biodiversity data and other social, ecological and environmental parameters for regional analysis (Ma. Consuelo Garcia); The \u201ccontinued dominance of GDP as the overriding goal of public policy\u201d calls for the continuing need \u201cto \u2022 place sustainable human development at the center of policy discussions\u201d (Gerardo Munck). This point was strongly reiterated by Anuradha Rajivan; The effects of human development, as captured by HDI, are non-linear-higher levels of HDI actually \u2022 correlate with higher levels of risk (Anthony Patt); There are diverse patterns between CO \u2022 2 emission per capita and the HDI. For example, more than \u201cone-fifth\u201d of the 113 countries sampled \u201cpumped less CO2 per capita into the atmosphere even as their GDP and HDI have risen\u201d. In general, it seems that \u201cmost countries pump out increasing volumes of CO2 to achieve rising human development\u201d. Thus, a global policy on a global carbon tax may be necessary to curb CO2 emission above \u201ca threshold to the \u2018capacity\u2019 volume of CO2 per unit of HDI\u201d, and the \u201cgreen\u201d tax raised \u201ccould be used to promote the development and deployments of green technology in poor countries\u201d.

In many ways, the discussion of sub-theme 2 has clarified many of the issues raised in sub-theme 1, especially on some of the tools that can be used to map and measure the vulnerabilities of our physical and human environment, including ecosystems, social, economic and human development, to climate change, as well as their inter-relationships and associated changes. This would only help to further our understanding of one of the most complex issues facing humankind. It is likely that many of the issues raised above will be further discussed in sub-theme 3: Adaptation (including technology and financing) and Climate-Related Disaster Risk Reduction, which starts on 22 March. For example, the issue of using scenarios and results projected by climate models for future adaptation planning is central to the discussion of sub-theme 3. How do we prepare or plan for longer-term adaptation while we can only predict short- term climate variability? What are the linkages between climate variability, disaster risk reduction and adaptation to climate change, as well as their synergies for climate risk reduction? All these issues will be explored, among many others, in the discussion of the next three weeks.

Opening Message Dear Network Members, In this opening message, I would like to share with you information on adaptation technology and financing within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the current process. This includes a summary of the positions taken by developing countries on adaptation in general, and in particular on the role of technology and financing in adaptation. The developing country Parties\u2019 positions are those that they apply at national level, and could therefore be useful in evaluating and understanding programmes taken at that level. Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is covered in these positions, as it is one of the sub-elements on enhancing action on adaptation under the Bali Action Plan. Again here, DRR in terms of adaptation is considered in terms of \u201crisk sharing and transfer mechanisms such as insurance.\u201d (UNFCCC 2008) (*). It is also considered in relation to \u201cmeans to address loss and damage associated with climate change impacts in developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.\u201d (UNFCCC 2008) (**). In both cases, DRR is seen in the context of financing loss and damage due to climate change. Adaptation is one of the four main building blocks of the Bali Action Plan, which looks at enhanced action on these elements for \u201cthe full, effective and sustained implementation of the Convention\u2026\u201d (UNFCCC 2008) (***). Under the Convention, adaptation is seen in the light of the commitments of developed country Parties related to financing and technology development and transfer to support action on adaptation. Of four articles of the Convention that deal with adaptation, one deals with the precautionary principle, and the three others stipulate commitments of Parties to the Convention. The first provides for obligations of all Parties to prepare mitigation and adaptation programmes. The two others deal with financing and technology commitments of developed country Parties to developing country Parties on adaptation. Ecosystem adaptation is one of the three important parameters in the achievement of the \u201cultimate objective\u201d of the Convention, together with ensuring that food production is not threatened, and enabling development to proceed in a sustainable manner. The UNFCCC, it may be recalled is one of the three Rio Conventions on sustainable development, the other two being the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Convention to Combat Drought and Desertification. However, in implementation, financing for adaptation under the Convention has been relegated to a far second priority. For almost the entire fifteen years since its entry into force, the bulk of climate change financing has instead been focused on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0546772e-0260-4bd5-9d59-0b43cbb75383": {"__data__": {"id_": "0546772e-0260-4bd5-9d59-0b43cbb75383", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9eb673e56782f414e33feb3dc06abac591af3e019fdfa3bd39925a5b3d44a1f4"}}, "hash": "9eb673e56782f414e33feb3dc06abac591af3e019fdfa3bd39925a5b3d44a1f4", "text": "mitigation. Almost 90 per cent of the financing that has gone through the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the only operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention so far, has been for mitigation activities. It was only in 2004 that the GEF put up a Strategic Programme for Adaptation (SPA), which undertook pilot projects, currently on hold since 2009, awaiting a further decision of the GEF Council for its continuation. A Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), to which was added a Least-developed Countries Fund (LDCF) was established in 2001. The SCCF decision to render the fund operational was adopted only in 2007. Both are woefully underfunded, and their operations are entrusted, again, to the GEF. Both were likewise subjected to conditionalities such as co-financing, which punishes the poorest of the poor developing countries that cannot raise counterpart financing in order to access GEF funds. The LDCF mainly funds the preparations of National Adaptation Plans of Action (NAPAs) by least developed countries, which, as stipulated in Article 4.3 of the Convention are to be financed at \u201cagreed full incremental costs\u201d basis. Very few of these NAPAs have so far been approved for financing by the GEF. Financing for adaptation is mainly undertaken by those financing institutions that are outside the framework of the financial mechanism of the Convention. These are the multilateral financing institutions, regional development banks and bilateral aid agencies. These institutions are considered external to the Convention as they are voluntary and not subject to the governance and authority of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention. Studies have also shown that little, if any, technology transfer has taken place for adaptation. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 103 The Group of 77 developing country Parties (made up of 132 developing countries) and China have taken positions that would remedy this implementation gap in the Convention. Its objective is to establish a framework/mechanism under the Convention to enable, support, facilitate and implement adaptation actions, including through vulnerability assessments, establishment of institutions at all levels, and capacity-building. On technology, enhanced action is also focused on endogenous technologies, joint development of technology through research, deployment, and diffusion. These technologies should be adapted to local conditions, as it is recognized that adaptation technologies are sector-and ecosystem-specific. Technology access and transfer must also cover the full cycle of technology and should be accessible for stand-alone projects as well as for long-term adaptation activities. Financing should be adequate and predictable in order to enable long - term planning. It should likewise be non-debt- creating, and therefore mainly grants-based, as well as new and additional to financing efforts on poverty eradication. It should not therefore divert funds from sustainable development activities to enable adaptation. Financing and identification of technology needs should be fully country-driven, determined by the countries themselves, including through the design and implementation of projects, and should facilitate a shift from vulnerability and assessments alone to concrete adaptation actions. The adaptation proposal by the Group of 77 and China is based on the past experience of developing countries with adaptation financing under the Convention, through activities funded by the GEF, as well as financing received through external institutions. It seeks to remedy the serious concerns raised by developing countries on financing and technology activities related to adaptation, in order to pursue enhanced long-term cooperative action on adaptation. While, as expressed above, adaptation financing under the Convention falls under the legal obligations of developed countries to developing countries, this is not the case for disaster risk reduction. There are however clear linkages that would render this financing co-beneficial both for urgent, short-term, medium- term, and long-term adaptation actions. More perhaps than DRR alone, the whole continuum of disaster management is related to adaptation. For long-term adaptation, the most relevant phase would be rehabilitation from disasters caused by natural phenomena. The previous discussions, in particular on sub-theme 1 have been very rich in terms of identifying the linkages, and perhaps this opening statement would develop these further in terms of how development can best be served through effective and efficient financing and technology development, access and transfer. I hope to have offered some considerations for reflection on adaptation financing and climate-related disaster risk reduction by this statement and look forward to a rich exchange of ideas on these subjects. In addition, other topics that may be discussed in this sub-theme may include any new ideas and concepts, as well as any good practices in adaptation to climate variability/change and disaster risk reduction.

Online Discussion Lisa Schipper wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Pak Sum Low): Lisa Schipper raises a number of thought provoking issues that link adaptation (including social adaptation), disaster risk reduction, development paradigms, poverty reduction, vulnerability, and even culture and politics, all of which are inter-related and each is an important part of the risk management equation. She argues that adaptation and disaster risk reduction planning approaches are misaligned with development trajectories, and points out that \u201cdevelopment projects focused only on poverty reduction would not necessarily make people less vulnerable to climate change\u201d. Thus, there is a need to focus on \u201cenabling a process of rethinking development pathways\u201d, so that adaptation planning \u201cactually aligned with other approaches to poverty reduction\u201d. She suggests that \u201cinsufficient financing for adaptation is not a limit to getting societies to adapt\u201d, but \u201cthe funding structures for development assistance may be seen as a barrier to getting adaptation to work\u201d. While donors \u201chave urged \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 of adaptation into development\u201d, \u201cother priorities for developing countries also need to be mainstreamed into adaptation\u201d. She stresses that \u201cour risk reduction activities\u201d should not be only focused \u201con the impacts and causes of the hazards\u201d, and ignoring \u201cthe deep roots of vulnerability that are embedded in culture and politics\u201d, otherwise they will lead to failure. I hope that this contribution will generate further discussion on the issues raised.

In reality, however, the changes necessary to actually reduce vulnerability would require an overhauling of most countries\u2019 development priorities, prejudices and perceptions of well-being.

Soussan and Burton argued in 2002 that adaptation could be a \u2018new opening to revisit some long-standing problems of environment and development in an innovative way\u2019, but somehow this important message has become sidelined. For the last decade, the number of people who are voicing opinions on how to respond to climate change is growing. Everyone seems to have some idea, tool, method, framework and guidelines to help societies adapt to experienced and anticipated changes, whether they are creeping and barely detectable or sudden and extreme. Organisations, including my own, are developing approaches to provide support for adaptation planning on all levels of governance. But much of this work continues to be focused on addressing the impacts of climate change only, without enabling a process of rethinking development pathways. With so many other changes taking place in society, this therefore begs the question: To what extent are our ideas about how to plan adaptation to climate change actually aligned with other approaches to poverty reduction? I am not suggesting that vulnerability reduction should be equated with poverty reduction-they are not the same, as Chambers and Swift clearly pointed out in 1989. \u2018Vulnerable\u2019 is not just a synonym of \u2018poor\u2019-it is far more nuanced, and it is always relative. People are not just \u2018vulnerable\u2019, but they are \u2018vulnerable to\u2019 something. This means that they are not vulnerable to everything-not floods and droughts, for example. So development projects focused only on poverty reduction would not necessarily make people less vulnerable to climate change. Therefore we should not simply drop our risk-related activities and focus only on poverty reduction projects. But there must be stronger synergy between the development agendas-those of countries and those of the donor community (let us be honest that they are not always the same)-and the activities necessary to sustainably reduce disaster and climate change risk. Insufficient financing for adaptation is not a limit to getting societies to adapt, although it is sometimes portrayed this way in the context of the UNFCCC. Limits to social adaptation are primarily socio-cultural, political and ecological, as Adger et al. (2009) and others have eloquently argued. Rather, the funding structures for development assistance may be seen as a barrier to getting adaptation to work. Much of that can be blamed on the major actors providing assistance in the form of funds, loans and projects for adaptation, who have urged \u2018mainstreaming\u2019 of adaptation into development, but forgotten that other priorities for developing countries also need to be mainstreamed into adaptation. If we focus our risk reduction activities only on the impacts and causes of the hazards, without acknowledging the deep roots of vulnerability that are embedded in culture and politics, we will surely fail in our efforts. For this reason we should no longer speak of the importance of creating synergies between adaptation and disaster risk reduction without remembering the third part of the triangle-namely sustainable development (Schipper and Pelling 2006).

Dear Network Members, Climate change impacts on water resources and agriculture in Sri Lanka: A review and preliminary vulnerability mapping (*) There is ample evidence to suggest that Sri Lanka\u2019s climate has already changed. During 1961-1990, its mean air temperature has increased by 0.0160C per year (Chandrapala 1996a), and mean annual precipitation decreased by 144 mm (7 per cent) compared to the period 1931-1960 (Chandrapala 1996b; Jayatillake et al. 2005). However, the bigger question of national importance is what Sri Lanka\u2019s climate will look like in 50 or 100 years and how prepared is the country to face it. Few studies attempted to project future climate scenarios for Sri Lanka and to identify climate change impacts on agriculture, water resources, the sea level, the plantation sector, the economy and health. Even the ones that exist appear to have contradictory projections, especially with respect to future rainfall. A recent review by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) on the status of climate change research/ activities in Sri Lanka suggests that Sri Lanka\u2019s mean temperature may increase by about 0.9-40C, over the baseline (1961-1990), by the year 2100 with accompanying changes in the quantity and spatial distribution of rainfall. These changes may lead to an increase in the wet (Maha) season irrigation water requirement for paddy by 13-23 per cent by 2050 compared to that of 1961-1990 (De Silva et al. 2007). Future projections on coconut yield suggest that production after 2040 may not be sufficient to cater to local consumption (Peiris et al. 2004), and reduction of monthly rainfall by 100 mm could reduce productivity by 30-80 kg of \u2018made\u2019 tea/ha (Wijeratne et al. 2007), thus impacting the country\u2019s exports. Agricultural vulnerability hotspots This study also attempts to identify the country\u2019s agricultural vulnerability hotspots, as well as ascertain existing knowledge gaps. It developed a pilot level Climate Change Vulnerability Index consisting of three sub indices (Exposure; Sensitivity; and Adaptive Capacity) which was subsequently mapped at district scale. Typically, a complete measure of exposure to future climate change would require consideration of projected changes in climate in each analysis unit. However, given the existing ambiguity in climate change projections for Sri Lanka, this assessment relies on data on exposure to historical climate extremes, since it is likely that this vulnerability will only increase under future climate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7dd38bba-901f-4bf8-b724-d198d1c5869e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7dd38bba-901f-4bf8-b724-d198d1c5869e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ab04b7987a399d87d4e07c347690f4a25d6ce16c30260a21c25025d29c1c99c"}, "2": {"node_id": "c95030aa-cd9e-43bd-8d15-f2af8c0f4108", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a25636d5c1d80bbe567f4668d72aea319305913429544dbcdbff34f4b6b1cc45"}}, "hash": "3e7c6fe7729ec02c745703958803b0fffbc952de72bdc08ed3743f8362ab525d", "text": "The maps indicate that typical farming districts such as Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Moneragala, Ratnapura and Anuradhapura are more sensitive to climate change than the rest of the country due to their heavy reliance on primary agriculture.

Dear Network Members, Climate risk management Across a large part of the developing world, exposure and vulnerability to climate-related hazards lead to frequent disasters. During the period of 2000-2007 there has been an average of 400 disasters in 120 countries affecting 230 million people annually. These have caused an average economic loss of US$80 billion per year (CRED 2009). It is widely acknowledged that the threat of disaster resulting from climate variability and change is twofold. First, extreme events have a direct and devastating impact on vulnerable communities. Second, climate change compounds existing problems of poor countries and endangers development gains. Identifying and reducing risks associated with climate -related hazards help to protect people and livelihoods, and contribute towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation, a common goal Although disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) have developed as independent practice areas and within separate institutional frameworks, they share the common goal of managing uncertainty, reducing vulnerability and building resilience for communities at risk. The link between disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation is increasingly acknowledged by practitioners at local, national and international levels. In the context of the changing environment, there is an emerging need for greater coordination between DRR and CCA policy and strategy frameworks practices and epistemic communities. DRR has been conceptualized as the first line of defense against climate change, as it deals with methods to anticipate, resist, cope, response and recover from hazard impacts. At the same time, CCA policies can benefit from the proved risk reduction frameworks and methodologies. In the face of climate change and variability, DRR programmes need to take a long term perspective to prepare communities not just against current, but also projected climate related risk. Climate risk management as an integrating concept The assessment and understanding of potential losses is the basis for risk management. It allows for the determination of the acceptable level of risk-defined as the level of losses that is acceptable without destroying lives, national economy or personal finances. Once the acceptable level of risk is determined, the capacity (legal, financial, institutional, and political) to reduce the risk above the acceptable level can be assessed. Climate risk management (CRM) can be understood as integrating concept for DRR and CCA approaches and activities. The CRM approach looks at the whole spectrum of disaster-related activities, from preparedness and disaster mitigation to broader adaptive activities related to livelihoods, natural resources management, food security, etc. UNDP-BCPR believes that preventing disasters and protecting development through CRM requires a programmatic approach that includes institutional capacity development and appropriate policies. Putting these in place can be broken down into a series of analytical steps that support the formulation of a set of institutional, policy and programmatic responses: 1. Climate analysis brings together what is known about current climate in a particular location, including climate variability and trends, the degree of climate predictability over various time scales, how the climate might change, and the level of certainty associated with specific changes that could affect development. 2. Identification of climate-related risks and impacts establishes the actual and potential impacts of climate variability and change currently (based on historical information), in the medium term (based on the current situation and observed trends) and over the longer term (based on projections and predictions). It provides a basis for reducing and transferring the specific risks that most threaten priority aspects of development. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 110 3. Decision analysis and support provides decision makers with relevant scientific information about climate variability and change for informed decision-making. This tailored information allows specific risks to be managed and specific goals to be achieved. Projects and programs to manage risks in pursuit of the achievement of these goals can then be strengthened or put in place. 4. Institutions and policy research. With growing awareness of disaster risks and climate change, many countries have to consider what policies and institutional responsibilities are adequate to confront risks of multiple hazards across multiple sectors. Many countries are only recently beginning to reconfigure government institutions and policies to pursue preventive, as opposed to reactive, disaster reduction strategies. Responsibilities for managing disaster or climate-related risks may be distributed across multiple agencies and departments with inadequate clarity on mandates and unclear division of labour. 5. Capacity development. Climate change and disasters pose difficult and new challenges that no country is fully capable of handling.

UNDP\u2019s Capacity Development Group has developed a capacity assessment tool that can be used for this purpose. Investing in disaster/climate risk management Cost-effective risk management builds on the idea that investments in resilience constitute good value. It is important that risk management activities build on solid hazard analysis, take into account exposure, and reduce vulnerability and increase resilience. Funding mechanisms should particularly prioritize strengthening, up-scaling and replication of effective \u2018no regrets\u2019 risk reduction measures such as climate risk information and early warning systems. In addition to channeling and leveraging the existing development funds to make them more disaster/climate change sensitive, the existing Multi Donor Trust Funds and GEF grant mechanisms may provide good financing options for DRR and CCA. In UNDP\u2019s experience, the enabling factors that have helped the integration of DRR concerns into development financing include DRM-focused agencies working at different levels, capacity for weather and climate modelling at national level, cross-sectoral collaboration between coordination bodies for DRR and CCA and the incorporation of poverty reduction and environmental sustainability issues into DRR policies and strategies. Integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation: Examples of success In the Maldives, the government and the UN Country Team jointly developed the Maldives Strategic National Action Plan for Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation (SNAP) in 2009 with a view to promoting good governance, foster democracy and capacitate decentralization. It is also the first time DRR, CCA and development are integrated clearly in a national strategy. The SNAP is aimed to provide short and long-term strategic direction and action to reduce the risk of disasters and adaptation to climate change in the country. Building on existing capacities in the Maldives, the SNAP is intended to identify and present priority programmes and projects which the Government, together with partner stakeholders, may undertake to attain the country\u2019s objectives in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation (*). Also in the Maldives, an LDCF-funded climate change adaptation project is building on disaster risk assessments that were conducted in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami. The information generated by these assessments was integrated into the design of coastal protection initiatives on 4 different islands in 4 distinctive atoll settings. The project makes an active effort to bridge institutional coordination gaps and ensure access by government planners in different departments to relevant climate risk information. The South Mexico community-based climate risk management programme implemented by UNDP through the GEF Small Grant Programme has worked in about 300 municipalities in the South of Mexico and has convinced authorities that ecosystems are instrumental in reducing damages from hurricanes. A quantitative analysis of the damage has shown that damage to crops was 15 per cent in areas protected by forest ecosystems and 29 per cent in areas where local ecosystems had been destroyed. Serious damage to houses was 6 per cent in areas protected by mangroves while it was 16.5 per cent in areas where mangroves had been destroyed. Furthermore, mangroves were used to protect fishing boats. Special shelters were built to warehouse small boat engines while the small boats CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 111 themselves are sank in tunnel dig into the mangroves. By doing so, boat destructions were reduced by 98 per cent from one year to the other, securing incomes for hundreds of families after the disaster. After the project demonstration, the authorities of two provinces (Yucatan and Quintana Roo) are considering major shifts in the local economic model based on cattle breeding (requiring large destruction of ecosystems) to a more sustainable model based on ecosystem protection. About 40 per cent of the cattle died during the last hurricane. Apart from a serious economic loss, it also created a serious health hazard. The authorities are now very well aware that not only do ecosystems help save lives and infrastructure but also speed up recovery after a disaster. Fisherman all recognize that fishing, after a hurricane, is much better in areas where mangroves are well conserved. The project has been able to demonstrate that disaster is not a fatality and that sound development and planning practices can reduce the risks dramatically (Disaster Risk Reduction and Recovery Team 2010).

Dear Network Members, Adaptation and mitigation: Need for a more coherent link to climate change (*) From Bernarditas Muller\u2019s opening message, it seems that financing for adaptation and mitigation is inadequate. One gets that impression that the appropriate provisions in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change lack teeth even though they are legally binding. This gap is apparently evident from the fact that \u201cthe bulk of climate change financing has instead been focused on mitigation\u201d (Muller 2010). Why is this so? Of the two, adaptation and mitigation, the latter is easier to justify politically to national constituents; it calls for a smaller amount of financing that does not have to be sustained over a relatively long period; and mitigation does not carry any implication for reciprocal action in developed countries. In short, adaptation is more costly and more politically unpalatable than mitigation and thus not acceptable to shortsighted politicians and vested interest groups. Framework But neither adaptation nor mitigation will work, let alone be effective, if these two strategies to combat climate change are not grounded within a realistic framework. At the moment, they are unanchored, free-floating, loose and ad hoc. What is needed is a coherent framework to prevent the earth from warming up by about 20C by the end of the present century (Weitzman 2007). The next block of the framework calls for a global price per ton of carbon and the establishment of a Green Fund. Both will contribute to reducing the risks and damages of climate change: the former through the price mechanism and the latter by providing funding for adaptation and mitigation.

Current concentration of greenhouse gases is \u2248 455 ppm CO2e, which is significantly higher than the pre- Industrial Revolution level (IPCC 2007; Weitzman 2007). But the Stern Review calls for immediate, strong and decisive action to reduce CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Immediate steps must be taken to cut greenhouses gas emission by about 3 per cent per year. Other analysts of climate change do not see the need for immediate, decisive action (Weitzman 2007) and have advocated a more gradualist approach, which would shift CO2e concentration by the end of the century to > 600 ppm and E[\u2206T] = 2.5\u00b0C (Weitzman 2007). With this approach, however, temperatures are expected to rise above E[\u2206T] = 3\u00b0C after 2105 (ibid: 704). The Stern Review proposal to curb CO2 is at the lower end of the IPCC predicted range and it is better to adopt this as the starting point for action on climate change than none at all. Besides strategies to pursue adaptation and mitigation, one other critical issue needs to be addressed: financing. The requirement here, unlike that climate change science, is that of predictability, regularity, adequacy and transparency. These requirements rule out funding on a voluntary, ad hoc and crisis basis. Most of the discussion about financing has adopted an MDG-like framework: setting an international target to cap emission, which has not been productive thus far and is likely to remain so. The problem with emission caps is that they \u201cmay appear transparent, their consequences are opaque, and they impose financial risk rather than provide CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 113 financing\u201d (Cramton and Stoft 2010). Moreover, because caps are likely to squeeze developing countries harder, these countries have rejected them. By itself, this makes the idea of a carbon cap unworkable and is a recipe for inaction. Global price target and the Green Fund So what to do? A recent article (Crampton and Stoft 2010) makes an interesting proposal: a binding global carbon- price target and a green fund financed by a form of carbon pricing. This proposal thus moves away from a cap to a price. A global price target for carbon removes the objections developing countries have with caps and improves the chances of a binding international agreement. Each county collects revenues equal to the price target times its total emission or pay other countries to make up any carbon-revenue shortfall. But whatever carbon revenue a country collects it keep. The manner in which this revenue is collected is left entirely to the county-it could be a fossil tax or auctioning of allowances, for example. The Green Fund provides \u201cequity transfers, improved pricing compliance, and motivation for non-price climate policies\u201d (Crampton and Stoft 2010: 3). It is reasonable to expect that developing countries with low per-capita emission to commit to a global price target for carbon. This is why the Green Fund will reward low-emission countries once they have complied with the global pricing target. \u201cFully-compliant countries with emissions per-capita that are below the global average by D tons per person receive a per-capita payment of G x D\u201d (ibid: 3), where G is the incentive strength. Countries that exceed the global emission average will pay to the Green Fund according to the same formula. The result is a balanced Green Fund budget. One final point: Technology, whether it is about adaptation or mitigation or both, should not only be \u201cgreen\u201d in the sense of protecting, land, air, water, marine life and forestry.

They define \u201cquality education\u201d as one \u201cthat is relevant and empowers children with the skills, knowledge and values necessary for innovative solutions to climate change adaptation.\u201d Citing various studies that demonstrate the positive correlation between education and improved capacity to cope with natural disasters, the contributors then link this to the development of long-term capabilities to address the adverse effects of climate change through adaptation. Women and children, two of the most vulnerable groups to natural disasters, are particularly concerned. The contributors also refer to a UNICEF presentation to the 15th Session of the Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC that recognized the close linkages between climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. UNICEF then incorporates this concept in its strategic programmes such as the \u201cChild-Friendly School Initiative\u201d. Dear Network Members, Quality education: One of the most sustainable and cost-effective solutions for climate change adaptation More investment in girls and quality education can provide a systemic, sustainable and cost-effective solution for climate change adaptation while concurrently yielding a multitude of development benefits. Quality education calls for education that is relevant and empowers children with the skills, knowledge and values necessary for innovative solutions to climate change adaptation. Education for sustainable development and disaster risk education are inherent in quality education. Toya and Skidmore (2007) found a significant correlation between higher educational attainment and fewer human and economic losses from natural disasters. They concluded that education can have an important role in reducing vulnerability, through better choices in areas ranging from safe construction practices to assessment of potential risks. Investing in quality education also includes investment in disaster-resilient school construction, consistent with advocating the government to take responsibility for the safety of public infrastructure, including hospitals and schools. It also powerfully and effectively integrates development outcomes for health, nutrition, water supply, sanitation, and governance. UNICEF focuses on results for children and also women.

For women, vulnerabilities include a lack of opportunities and resources combined with or resulting in a disproportionate reliance on natural resources for livelihoods.

They calculate the cost of the investment in education that will be needed by various countries and regions to neutralize increased vulnerability to extreme weather events from climate change. Through a literature review the authors find that most of the work in this field has focused on the effect of rising income per capita. As communities get richer, they have greater willingness and ability to pay for preventive measures. Toya and Skidmore (2007) however find a significant role for education in reducing vulnerability, as mentioned above. They also point to the work of Oxfam International (2008) which drew on extensive evidence from South Asia to highlight the particular vulnerability of women, who often suffer far greater losses than men in natural disasters. The UNICEF paper entitled Education in emergencies in South Asia-Reducing the risks facing vulnerable children (UNICEF 2009) highlights, documents and analyses vulnerability and education in emergencies in several South-East Asian countries. In essence this paper puts forth, that impinging on a child\u2019s/person\u2019s right to quality education increases vulnerability. It postulates that \u201cthe phrase \u2018building back better\u2019 does not just refer to physical infrastructure. The \u2018tyranny of the urgent\u2019 should become replaced with medium and long-term strategies which protect children as children and in future as adults. In terms of conflict or extremism, it could be argued that this might be protective of society generally. This study has emphasized capabilities as well as protection, and these capabilities are not just personal in terms of survival, but are capabilities in participating in civil society and building secure societies (UNICEF 2009).\u201d The Education Section in UNICEF does not view disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation as independent but intertwined. Risk reduction measures are necessary to have climate change adaptation and as a result have been incorporated in strategic frameworks such as the Child Friendly School initiative (*). Disaster Risk Reduction is the developmental aspect and long-term solution for governments, communities, and schools to adapt to their changing climate. The importance of this approach is evident in the ongoing work of many agencies and organizations which have been reflected in the compilation of best practices titled Disaster risk reduction begins at school (UN/ISDR 2007).

Three reasons are put forward to support this contention: first, that \u201cclimate change is one driver of disasters amongst many\u201d; second, that \u201cclimate change is one \u2018creeping environmental change\u2019 amongst many\u201d; and third, that the heightened political importance of climate change which has raised public consciousness worldwide could provide an opportunity to advance the conclusion made in the article for \u201cembedding climate change within disaster risk reduction.\u201d CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 117 Dear Network Members, Climate change adaptation as part of disaster risk reduction Climate change in context Climate change has been receiving plenty of publicity as not only a global crisis, but also as perhaps the greatest global crisis which humanity has ever faced. Viewing climate change as the greatest crisis is incorrect due to the many other long-term global crises facing humanity, such as poverty, inequality, injustice, and oppression. Nonetheless, little scientific doubt exists that climate change resulting from human activity is an immense, long-term, global disaster. Even if human greenhouse gas emissions were to stop entirely today, we would still be facing climate change\u2019s legacy for many generations into the future, which would include detrimental impacts on the other long-term global crises. Yet we would still be facing these other immense, long-term, global disasters. Irrespective of climate change, coastal floods continue to kill thousands of people due to social pressures, such as age and gender inequities; manipulation of living conditions and livelihoods by more powerful people; governments, and corporations; and failure to address poverty and sustainable access to available resources. Current rates of overfishing are more damaging to marine resources than climate change is predicted to be. Many deltas are threatened by sea-level rise, but groundwater extraction, gas mining, and upstream dams have all damaged deltas as much as climate change might (Overeem and Syvitski 2009). Those with interests in overfishing and other resource extraction, such as large-scale logging, have even argued that climate change will ruin these resources, so humanity might as well exploit them now while they exist (Elliott 2009). These interests would continue to be involved in such destructive activities and would still be ignoring the consequences, but climate change provides a welcome distraction for them to attempt to shift the focus of their actions and the consequences. Climate change as a scapegoat and distracter Putting climate change in the spotlight means that it becomes a scapegoat for many global ills that existed long before climate change. The most prominent examples being blamed on climate change are high-profile disasters, including non-climate disasters such as tsunamis. Making climate change the scapegoat for even climate-related disasters means that the responsibility for comprehensive disaster risk reduction is absolved. The prior decades of inappropriate development in disaster-prone locations-the societal processes that create and perpetuate the vulnerability that causes the disaster-are diminished in importance in favour of climate change as the villain. To continue focusing on root causes and long-term vulnerability generation, research, policy, and practice should accept contemporary climate change adaptation as a subset of disaster risk reduction activities. That is, dealing with climate change should be encompassed within dealing with disasters, since climate change is one disaster amongst many. Consequently, adaptation becomes one process amongst many of dealing with disasters-including the long- term disaster of climate change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e0d8e123-2012-46f5-93cf-fa50be6f09cd": {"__data__": {"id_": "e0d8e123-2012-46f5-93cf-fa50be6f09cd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0424a6e804204aabc20c681dae21144f157327c96c0472e698573e99a8f7872f"}, "2": {"node_id": "0e0350cc-b18a-4005-9d37-d0a29be9c80f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "32f31517731b10266ac9e3d461c9cea2fa99dfe5bf8fd089d4f55e5b91570d5d"}}, "hash": "d4c8caa9e3d7521ceef59a3cdd88f64e31f7d4e188db2608505aafeb1d68d3e7", "text": "A legitimate question is: why not the other way around?

But the definitions of the two processes mean that climate change adaptation is a subset of disaster risk reduction.

Conversely, climate change adaptation by definition excludes earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, and many more. Presumably no one involved in development and sustainability would wish to ignore non-climate-related disasters. If that were the case, then the hundreds of thousands killed in each of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2010 Haiti earthquake would reveal the consequences. Thus, disaster risk reduction by definition must embrace climate change adaptation, not the other way around. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 118 Climate change adaptation as part of disaster risk reduction Three points support climate change adaptation being embedded within disaster risk reduction. First, climate change is one driver of disasters amongst many. It should not be ignored, but nor does it dominate other drivers. Those drivers include inequities, injustices, social oppression, discrimination, poor wealth distribution, bad governance, and a value system permitting exploitation of environmental resources irrespective of the consequences. Second, climate change is one \u201ccreeping environmental change\u201d amongst many. Creeping environmental changes are incremental changes in conditions which cumulate to create a major catastrophe or crisis, apparent only after a threshold has been crossed (Glantz 1999). Climate change fulfils that definition and is not unique. Some argue that the catastrophic threshold for climate change is nearing (e.g., Hansen et al. 2007), but other creeping environmental changes have already surpassed the threshold (e.g., Glantz 1999). Other creeping environmental changes not linked to climate change include soil erosion due to intensive farming or due to regular climate variability and extremes; salinization of freshwater supplies due to excessive drawdown; and slow subsidence of land due to water or gas pumping. In all these cases, as with climate change, human action exacerbates natural trends. As such, climate change is one long-term human-exacerbated disaster amongst many. Third, the reality is that climate change has become politically important and has reached the public consciousness around the world. That should provide an opportunity, not to focus on climate change, but to raise the points made in this article to engage interest in more comprehensive disaster risk reduction, environmental management, development, and sustainability processes. All these are linked to climate change, but by definition include climate change and go beyond it (e.g., Gaillard 2010; Gaillard et al. 2010). Conclusions By embedding climate change within disaster risk reduction while using the prominence of climate change to promote and achieve wider sustainability, a long-term perspective is ensured. That avoids being distracted by climate change and also directs attention to root causes and fundamental ideas, ensuring that a single issue is not highlighted and permitted to become a target or a scapegoat. Instead, the threats from climate change to disaster risk reduction, development, and sustainability are recognised along with how to use well-known disaster risk reduction, development, and sustainability actions for tackling climate change and much more (e.g., Gaillard 2010; Mercer 2010). We can move forward with disaster risk reduction, development, and sustainability by incorporating, but not making exclusive, the narrow focus on climate change.

For example, with the destruction of paddy fields and vegetable crops due to heavy floods, the farming community becomes not only homeless but without the means to survive. Most of the countries in South Asia are regularly affected by severe and often multi-year droughts. Between 1990 and 2008, more than 750 million people-50 per cent of the population in South Asia-were affected by at least one natural disaster, leaving almost 230,000 deaths and about US$45 billion in damages (World Bank 2009). The situation in India In India 33.516 million hectares of land have been identified as flood-prone (Government of India 2005; Ministry of Water Resources n.d.). India is one of six major cyclone-prone countries in the world. According to the Vulnerability Atlas of India (Building Materials and Technology Promotion Council 2006) approximately 5,700 km of the 7,500 km long coastline are prone to cyclones arising from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. Cyclonic storms and storm surges have been responsible for some severe fatalities along the coasts, the worst of which was caused during the Orissa Super (*) cyclone (1999) killing at least 10,000 people (Government of India 2004). The hilly regions of India are susceptible to landslide and avalanche hazards. The most vulnerable are the Himalayan Mountains followed by the North-Eastern hill ranges. Between 1990 and 2008 natural disasters affected more than 885 million people in India (World Bank 2009:111). The World Bank (2009) has provided the following figures relating to natural disasters in India (**): Population: 1,071,608,000 Population affected: 885,244,000 Number of deaths: 53,400 Damage", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "031a040e-16a8-489c-825d-cf7c257facec": {"__data__": {"id_": "031a040e-16a8-489c-825d-cf7c257facec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4f21c4fa7dd0fbed9834fb56e35c8a8c6faec477c043b15353a7eb2d37aa8f93"}}, "hash": "4f21c4fa7dd0fbed9834fb56e35c8a8c6faec477c043b15353a7eb2d37aa8f93", "text": "(US$): 25.74 billion (see Figure 8.3) In the period 1990-2008 floods accounted for the majority of damages in terms of costs in South Asia (***). India\u2019s reported cost of damage by floods has been the highest in the region (World Bank 2009: 114). While the country is familiar with annual floods in Assam, Bihar ad Uttar Pradesh, new areas have been witnessing major floods (for example, Mumbai floods in 2005, Kosi (Bihar) floods in 2008, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka floods in 2009). All this entails huge economic losses and causes developmental setbacks. In India, for instance, the direct losses from natural disasters have been estimated to amount to up to 2 per cent of India\u2019s GDP and up to 12 per cent of central government revenues (World Bank 2003, as cited in World Bank 2009: 115). At times state governments have spent more on relief and damages than on their rural development programmes. In the state of Maharashtra, for example, a single drought in 2003 and a flood in 2005 consumed more of the budget (Rs 175 billion) than the entire planned expenditure (Rs 152 billion) on irrigation, agriculture, and rural development for the 2002-2007 period (World Bank 2007, as cited in World Bank 2009: 115). Putting people at the centre: Enhancing communities\u2019 preparedness Considering the impact that climate-related disasters have on people\u2019s lives, it is important to enhance communities\u2019 preparedness. In order to do so, it is required to identify, assess and monitor disaster risk. It is also important to take into account that in any community, the level of vulnerability to climate change and climate-related disasters would differ among people (e.g., the elderly and the children would be more vulnerable). It is accepted that that climate change will alter the number, severity, frequency and complexity of climate-related hazards. However, there is great uncertainty about the local level manifestations, even natural variability impacts are varied from event to event. The traditionally understood hazard, risk and vulnerability profiles in the region are changing and newer hazards are getting introduced while the existing ones are getting accentuated. In August 2006, the usually drought-prone Barmer district was hit by flash floods. Even as late as 27 August 2006, some of the villages in this district were under the effect of flood (Rawat et al. 2007). CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 121 Given the new challenges it is important to enhance the ability of communities and empower them to deal with disaster risk management so that they are able to \u201chelp themselves\u201d before external support reaches them. This can be achieved only if awareness among people at risk is enhanced. In most Asian countries, the official early warning network, especially at the last mile, is extremely inadequate. Therefore, in order to alert the communities at risk about impending events that are likely to inflict loss and damages, early warning systems will have to be strengthened. This would entail focused investment in physical infrastructure as well as on soft areas such as human skills on dissemination of warning information, evacuating people, etc. The next step will have to develop capacities at the communities with plans and skills to undertake evacuation, first aid, shelter management, search and rescue tasks, through establishment of task forces and skills enhanced to undertake specific tasks. In order to make sure that the people remember their roles and responsibilities and act as per an agreed plan, mock drills will have to be conducted. This would also help in testing the efficacy of the preparedness plans. Examples of interventions to enhance communities\u2019 disaster preparedness in India The GOI-UNDP Disaster Risk Management Programme (2002-2009) was launched in 2002 with the goal of sustainable reduction in disaster risk in some of the most hazard-prone states in India. Over the past seven years, the DRM Programme supported under a multi-donor framework of US$41 million focused on strengthening disaster preparedness, response, management and mitigation capacities of institutions as well as local communities in 176 districts in 17 states across India. Through the programme, efforts were taken to build the capacities of the community. Keeping in mind that communities are the first responders to any natural disaster, and have developed coping mechanisms and systems over centuries, the DRM Programme worked with communities to translate their familiarity and coping mechanisms into Community Based Disaster Preparedness (CBDP) plans. The CBDP process involved the formation of disaster management committees (DMC) and task force teams of volunteers, the formulation of a plan mapping vulnerabilities, available resources and routes for evacuation, and the formulation and implementation of mock drills so as to strengthen the disaster response", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "67767803-9553-47e8-8d5d-3d90ad981e26": {"__data__": {"id_": "67767803-9553-47e8-8d5d-3d90ad981e26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9ba611405fa4acef19c5ff89eb33c0287ac6ff5bbdb3fffe764b66c07e598c2c"}, "3": {"node_id": "4dd3cc5a-29bf-404f-8c11-15dda43a7aec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bfa42ede9dc8b4c68f63d0f2cdb63df0abd31e130f22e9d76c21215d80cb594"}}, "hash": "47d118a95300ccfe4d19b28904cf64c53f82509bd753b0607df18458438b1949", "text": "in case of extreme events due to climate change.

The contributor sees the opportunity offered for redefining development in sustainable and meaningful terms for the CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 123 people. Rather than waiting for international financing, poor developing countries could adopt innovative means for increasing their capacities to deal with climate and disaster impacts. However, there remains the need for both financial and technological resources for full implementation of this approach. The Facilitator believes that these could identify the incremental needs that should be met by the obligations to provide financing and technological resources under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, as an integral part of the global effort to address climate change and its adverse effects. Dear Network Members, The role of technology and financing in effecting integrated climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction for sustainable development Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction were often thought to be two distinct, disparate concepts which have nothing in common. However, this notion is changing because these two issues actually involve common elements (hazards and management measures) which intersect and are, therefore, interlinked. In as much as both deal with risks from meteorological hazards, which also often interact with geological ones, an analytical approach which can transform this diverse information into common, intelligible units of measure would be crucial for a feasible, cost effective risk management regime. Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) employs standard quantification processes which generate objective and consistent basis for a systematic choice of the most appropriate cost effective risk management measures. Owing to the probabilistic nature of risks for both climate change and natural hazards and the level of uncertainties involved, Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) would be more appropriate as opposed to the conventional deterministic approach in assessing either disaster or climate change risks. As can be gleaned from the definition of the proposed approach, empirical data and the concomitant technology to generate and transform them into usable form would be necessary. It goes without saying, therefore, that process changes, especially those involving technological means, will necessarily require new and additional financing, especially if such action will be incremental on the part of the implementer. Developing countries like the Philippines, which are still grappling with their sustainable human development concerns, also have to increasingly deal with the looming realities of climate change and disaster impacts. They must institute measures which, in the absence of additional outside financing, need to be least cost but effective. In the wake of these urgent challenges, they cannot afford to take separate, sequential strategies, nor small incremental steps, to forestall disasters from whatever source. The Philippines, therefore, is implementing an integrated approach to systematically factor disaster and climate change risks into all national and local development planning, programming and relevant regulatory processes. The level of ambition in paradigm shifting must equate the high stakes in terms of lives saved and economic costs forestalled. As in any threat, climate change offers an opportunity for redefining development such that it becomes sustainable and meaningful for a country\u2019s citizenry. This opportunity has to be seized now, otherwise, delayed actions will not only be more costly but meaningless. With new and additional financing, not immediately forthcoming because of the slow global climate change negotiations, many poor developing countries are resorting to imaginative means to increase their capacities to survive climate change and disaster impacts. But there are limits to the imagination, no matter how prolific. Although it fuels innovation which is key to making meaningful changes in the development paradigm, imagination must actually be supported by actual resources, including technology, to translate dream into reality.

However, \u201cmodern science\u201d is still needed to complement the \u201climitations\u201d of this valued traditional \u201cknowledge base in the process of adapting to climate change\u201d. It is interesting to note Patrina\u2019s experience that the process of \u201ccarrying out capacity development in adaptation in local communities does not necessarily require a lot of money, at least initially\u201d. However, capacity development is a continuous and long-term process. Dear Network Members, Enhancing the capacity of local communities to adapt to climate change Adaptive capacity is a system\u2019s ability to take action to reduce vulnerability to climate change (Barnett 2008; Adger et al. 2007; Burton 2002; Smit et al. 2000) and is dependent on: economic resources (to pay for adaptation); awareness and information (identification of problems and knowledge of solutions); technology (the tools needed to adapt); skilled labour (the ability to use available technologies); infrastructure (the means by which the services, information, and resources needed to adapt reach communities) (Adger et al. 2007; Barnett 2008). The renaissance of traditional methods of marine resource management (e.g., taboos, sacred sites, and fisheries closures due for example to the death of a prominent community member) in many Pacific Island countries since the 1980s has been seen to have enhanced the adaptive capacity of local or indigenous communities (Govan et al. 2009). In fact, the effect of these traditional practices helped to reduce/limit the pressure on resources. However, a key factor distinguishing such initiatives from projects designed specifically for climate change adaptation would be that the later would have climate change factored into the community awareness component as well as in development decision-making processes (Huq and Reid 2007). Traditional knowledge and community-based adaptation: A climate change adaptation process in Fiji The recognition of traditional and local knowledge is a fundamental component of community-based adaptation (CBA) projects that are beginning to mushroom globally. One such initiative is the Fiji Climate Change Adaptation (Barnett and Campbell 2010) Project designed to pilot an integrated approach to climate change adaptation in six rural communities in Fiji, focusing on coastal ecosystems and water supply issues (two of the four most vulnerable sectors identified in Fiji\u2019s Climate Change Policy Framework (Government of Fiji 2009). The project objectives were to enhance community awareness to climate change, incorporate climate change and adaptation in community governance processes, and to identify and implement appropriate adaptation measures. Funded by AusAID, via the Fiji Department of Environment, the project was implemented from August 2006 to December 2009 by the Pacific Centre for Sustainable Development (PACE-SD) and the Institute of Applied Science (IAS) of the University of the South Pacific. Other stakeholders involved in the project as members of the advisory committee included various government departments, academics, conservation agencies, NGOs, regional development agencies, other donors and private water and coastal engineering consultants. The overall outcome of the Fiji CCA Project was the general improvement in water and coastal management in the six pilot villages. For example, the three sites where water was the issue of focus, communities worked with the project CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 125 partners in examining historical factors that contributed to the water shortage, developed a community adaptation plan that focused on water, established or enhanced the functions of the village water committee and actively participated in the upgrading of the old water system that significantly improved access to water by households. Traditional knowledge relating to land use and water management patterns, environmental changes as well as population trends were gathered via culturally appropriate community consultations upon which the village project activity outcomes were based. Another key outcome of the project was the level of knowledge achieved by community members on the causes and possible future impacts of climate change to their local environment and the importance of mainstreaming adaptation at the community level. While community members had already observed changes in the local environment, scientific interpretations on climate change was disseminated by the project implementers to compliment this already existing knowledge. This additional climate change awareness was particularly appreciated by traditional leaders and decision-makers who encouraged and supported the community members\u2019 involvement in the project and accepted and recognized the new water management plan and committee as part of the community governance regime. While these outcomes are a direct improvement in community-based water management, they are also indicative to the enhanced local capacity to respond to climate change. Another positive outcome of the project was the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3ed2b53c-a40b-4fd6-a377-193f291c1d52": {"__data__": {"id_": "3ed2b53c-a40b-4fd6-a377-193f291c1d52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e4239cd05f2c8bf6110701abe3fd0fa907ddab1d57c7a3a98a8afbfbd4d5e4be"}, "3": {"node_id": "86c64e7a-bd4c-4804-b223-4e17b2a50b6a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "84804824ae307e7e400d5f11bbca1ff1fa46c7ee3e72009d99a2152ba19e3dd2"}}, "hash": "71dfaa3fbdb49545202557cac36f5d2826e5dac6ddaee7c791f26aaffe4f64f4", "text": "involvement of indigenous people as project implementers. Their ability to speak the local language and familiarity with the dynamics of village governance structure and the social rules and protocols that operate within this system saved much time and effort in learning about the local history and processes, and enabled more sensitive understanding of, and responses to, local concerns. For example, it is important for researchers to know how and where to sit, and the manner of addressing people, particularly when conversing publicly with the chief, and failure to do this correctly can jeopardize communication, while the ability do it correctly can greatly enhance the success of the project. Traditional ties based on kinship, totems and significant historical events (e.g., warring alliances, migration, marriage) connect clans, villages and provinces from various parts of Fiji and an understanding of, and interest in, these relationships can help with the bonding process between the \u2018outsider\u2019 and the village. So, hiring local project staff enables a trusting relationship between the village and the project which greatly helps improve the project\u2019s outcome for all parties. The Fiji CCA project implementation process also showed that carrying out capacity development in adaptation in local communities does not necessarily require a lot of money, at least initially (*). Following the awareness raising of communities on climate change including discussions on observations and knowledge of local climate trends and impacts the next key procedural step was to gather local knowledge of water sources or coastal changes, historical community water or coastal management practices, rainfall and land-use patterns, demographic changes and community views on how the water/coastal problem was to be addressed. Alongside this process water and coastal engineers from government departments and technical agencies visited each site to assess the water or coastal problems and recommend possible adaptation measures from a scientific perspective. The technical assessment outcomes, summarized and translated in the local vernacular, were an important information source to the community as they developed their adaptation plan which focused on water. Adaptation options that involved less environmental and financial risks, and which were deemed manageable and sustainable by the community were favoured, while more expensive, engineering-based options were held-off until the softer options were trialed. The outcomes of this process illustrated both the value and limitations of traditional knowledge and the of role modern science in complementing this knowledge base in the process of adapting to climate change. The combined adaptive management process of implementing, ongoing review and adjustment of the community adaptation plan was the final step of the project. A third workshop on community-based monitoring was conducted in each site and frequent field visits were made throughout the project with the aim of checking on the implementation of adaptation activities and to review and update the adaptation plan so as to keep it relevant to the existing needs and concerns of the community. This stage was essentially the beginning of the adaptive management process to be continued by the community.

Schipper (2010) also notes that, \u201cwithout acknowledging the deep roots of vulnerability that are embedded in culture and politics, we will surely fail in our efforts\u201d to reduce risk and adapt to a changing climate. Sustainable development and the institutional structures which frame and organize its execution must be considered as well. Sustainable development depends on reducing and managing disaster risk in both the near term and the long term. But DRR is not the only component of sustainable development. Similarly, as Kelman and Gaillard (2010) intimate, climate hazards and climate change are not the only components of near-term and long-term disaster risk. Disaster risk is a function of the characteristics of likely hazards, the vulnerability of exposed elements to those hazards, and the capacity of human-environment systems to handle impacts. Future risk is a function of both the existing relationship between hazard, vulnerability and capacity, as well as the relationship between any changes in these components over a given period of time. Climate change will contribute to shifts in environmental conditions and hazard patterns, affecting all components of risk and altering the relationships between them.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e314fc2-e86f-46ce-9425-c099f5f813bb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e314fc2-e86f-46ce-9425-c099f5f813bb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b4d7c69897646437aaa06c4b32e2c336e75b57ebe2f240870733144e9f11165"}, "2": {"node_id": "2410a021-2bda-455b-a520-3c860cb40a6c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a83af7662699b767f7b9ddb87b2ee60d9cda35b75e5fe75277f55bd8d187b84"}}, "hash": "986866d70d99361ff4d052e9646f2f1517f85d416123af3f35045f61a1d2fb94", "text": "However, as Kelman and Gaillard (2010) point out, climate change is not the only mechanism of change, and thus CCA is not the only avenue for reducing future risk.

Exposure, and some vulnerabilities and capacities, are certainly hazard specific (if not hazard determined). However, as has been argued elsewhere in this forum and in the literature, many of the factors that increase vulnerability and decrease capacity (access to resources and services, institutional mechanisms, social and environmental protections, etc.) are independent of specific hazards and rooted in historical and emergent social, economic, cultural, and political systems. Cross hazard and hazard independent drivers of risk provide a practical link between development, DRR and CCA.

As an applied science and technology center, we are interested in how discussions and research surrounding DRR, CCA and sustainable development mesh in practice and can be used by practitioners. Lambert and Creitaru (2010) identify \u2018no regrets\u2019 measures as funding priorities. We, like them, see scalable risk information and early warning systems as solutions that span DRR, CCA and development concerns and reduce future risk regardless of the time frame. We are actively working in this area. As part of our DRR activities, we have also created assessments at various scales that identify, map and index various hazard independent contributors to vulnerability and capacity. While this approach has limitations, it is one way to make hazard independent drivers visible to decision makers. We have combined these with hazard specific information to produce multi-hazard indices of risk. The framework for these indices is rooted in sustainable development concepts. While the results of these studies are (naturally) influenced by data availability and quality, we have received positive feedback from practitioners who see their value as DRR and disaster management decision-making tools. We are CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 128 working to increase the utility of this information and better adapt indices to priorities by including practitioners in their further development and application. We have also included an idea introduced by UNOCHA (a \u201cfocus factor\u201d), which can help to overcome some data limitations and better incorporate political priorities into results, a concern cited by F\u00fcssel (2010) in a previous posting. As timeframes become longer, uncertainties regarding how exactly human systems and environmental systems will interact and change, and how the relationships between the various components of risk will shift, increase. We can work to minimize potential changes in climate related hazards as well as potential exposure. However, we will also need to encourage flexibility in our systems in order to maximize our ability to access, synthesize, and enact creative solutions. This will help support development and reduce disaster risk regardless of the hazard or timeframe. Approaches focused on building long-term adaptive capacity will contribute to near term reductions in vulnerability and increases in coping capacity. Near-term actions will set the stage for future conditions and options. Situating CCA within DRR and development could improve integration and increase the effectiveness of measurement, representation and decision-making related to policy and planning.

Development would most likely mean rising emissions. The contributor therefore concludes that focusing on \u201cgreen growth\u201d is essential rather than following conventional development approaches. The Facilitator believes that adaptation and mitigation are mutually supportive, and that these are two sides of sustainable development, or following a low-emission growth, that is part of the objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Dear Network Members, Enhancing the adaptive capacity of developing countries to climate change Though the global temperature level has not yet risen by two degrees Celsius above the 1990 levels - a rise in temperature of this magnitude is predicted to cause irreversible changes to the climate (IPCC 2007) - nations across the world are experiencing the adverse impacts of climate change to varying degrees. This has underscored the importance of devising adaptation strategies along with mitigation measures. This contribution will focus on adaptation, which implies \u201cadjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities\u201d (Levina and Tirpak 2006). Adaptation could be autonomous or planned. Autonomous adaptation involves changes that systems will undergo in response to changing climate irrespective of any policy plan or decision (TERI 2007). These are the changes that occur in unmanaged natural systems; they are self-generated changes. As it is difficult to predict the extent to which autonomous adaptation can offset the impacts associated with severe climate change (Smit et al. 2001), planned interventions are needed. This especially holds true for some developing countries as they are highly vulnerable to climate change (Gagnon-Lebrun and Agrawala 2006), owing to their heavy dependency on climate-sensitive sectors and their location at lower latitudes (Burton et al. 2006). Some planned adaptation strategies that could be beneficial to developing countries include: Integrating adaptation into development projects through systematic application of climate risk \u2022 assessment. For example, the World Bank has begun to develop a \u201cscreening tool\u201d to help project developers assess whether proposed investments pose significant climate risk (Burton et al. 2006). Strengthening and widening existing disaster risk reduction strategies, such as use of micro irrigation techniques, \u2022 rain-water harvesting system, constructing dams and coastal defences, etc. There are numerous barriers that affect the design and implementation of adaptation strategies: lack of knowledge about the nature and the size of future climate change impacts, questions as to who will bear the cost of adaptation and how to allocate resources to adaptation and mitigation-equally or not equally (Muller 2010). In order to overcome these barriers, it is essential to design and implement adaptation strategies and options effectively. This will also help societies to gain maximum benefits from these strategies. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 130 Prerequisites to the success Success of adaptation strategies requires: Availability of information on the nature, severity of the problems and the cost and efficiency of proposed \u2022 adaptation options; Adaptive capacity: capability in technical and planning disciplines to undertake adaptation options; \u2022 Financial resources: Financial resources has to be mobilized to developing countries to develop adaptive \u2022 capacity, undertake adaptive measures and to cope with the adverse climate impacts; Institutions: necessary intuitional framework to develop and coordinate comprehensive strategies; and \u2022 Access to technology and the ability to develop technologies that are best suited to the country under concern \u2022 (Burton et al. 2006). Of these essential prerequisites, I will dwell briefly on the adaptive capacity. Adaptive capacity The potential or ability of the system, region, or community to adapt to the effects or impacts of climate change is known as adaptive capacity (Smit et al. 2001). It is determined by the availability of economic resources, information and skills, infrastructure, institutional strength, access to technology and equity of the society (Burton et al. 2006; Smit et al. 2001). Thus, it is clear that the level of development is a key factor that determines the adaptive capacity of a country. One way to enhance the adaptive capacity of developing countries is to invest in human development. Human development and climate change Though rising level of human development is favourable for successful adaptation, this itself has the capacity to aggravate the adverse impacts associated with climate change (*). Indeed, the data show that progress in human development and change in per capita CO2 emission move together in the same direction-that is, it seems likely that rising human development will be associated with rising emission of CO2, at least in the medium-term. In other words, rising levels of human development is good for adaptation, while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "14e8cc72-5ada-4434-a0c2-3257f081d928": {"__data__": {"id_": "14e8cc72-5ada-4434-a0c2-3257f081d928", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eac04c1c89f962ca61c7e849e6026f8fb7bdc5606c84ac431131d872b2893e23"}, "3": {"node_id": "4619f1a3-2e67-4258-b6bb-c64b7569035d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3bcdebc42cfbf7ed55c52fbe405947f3f851fd3cd0e7a305022554ea01b2cbd"}}, "hash": "2344e59f631adac1a27319eb31e8d8857c5d6049fcc631f3fa216888dc5eaf6a", "text": "it is bad for mitigation. It is obvious that the positive correlation between the Human Development Index and per capita CO2 emission originates from unsustainable economic growth that has targeted the efficient use of natural resources at the cost of the environment.

That is the dilemma we must confront, though I would like to think that we do not have to choose either.

Dear Network Members, Climate change adaptation: A great challenge for developing countries Climate change is a global issue with social and economic impacts for many countries. According to IPCC (2007), in Asia, freshwater availability is projected to decrease in Central, South, East and South-East Asia, particularly in large river basins. Coastal areas in South, East and South-East Asia will be at greatest risk of increased flooding from the sea, and from some large deltas. Endemic morbidity and mortality associated with floods and droughts due to projected changes in the hydrological cycle are expected to rise in East, South and South-East Asia. Crop productivity is projected to increase slightly at mid-to high-latitudes for local mean temperature increases of up to 1\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C, depending on the crop, but decrease in some coastal regions. Crops in coastal areas are exposed to increasing climate risks such as coastal erosion due to storm surges and sea-level rise. The effect will be exacerbated by increasing human- induced pressures on coastal areas. In Viet Nam The total economic loss due to extreme events in the recent years (1996-2008) accounted for 1.5 per cent of annual GDP (Hoc 2009). With a shoreline of 3,200 km, the main impacts of climate change in Viet Nam are sea-level rise, seawater intrusion and salinization, and floodings caused by typhoons and storm surges; crop yield loss caused by temperature increase in some regions; and extended drought areas in South Central region. Red River Delta (RRD) and Mekong River Delta (MRD) are the largest deltas in the country with a total area of 2.09 and 4.06 million hectares (ha) respectively. Of these, 0.80 and 2.56 million ha respectively are agricultural land (GSO 2009). Although relatively small by country average, these two deltas are home for the country\u2019s 43 per cent population, and together they comprise 67.6 per cent of rice cultivation areas and constitute 71 per cent of total rice production for the country. The MRD contributes up to 95 per cent of exported rice (more than 5 million tonnes/year). According to national climate change scenario (MONRE 2009), with an A2 scenario (*), 0.65 million ha in RRD will be flooded because of higher water level in the drainage river over the field; 1.51 million ha of MRD will be flooded with strong salinization, and this excludes the other three smaller regions of North Central Coast, South Central Coast and South East (Trinh et al. 2009). Climate change adaptation measures Climate change mitigation can be seen as the long-term strategy towards sustainable development with the introduction of new technologies and by saving energy. However, adaptation has been ongoing in Viet Nam for quite a long time, and this was clearly evident in the cases of extreme floodings in 2003, 2005 and 2008, and the broken dike incident in 2004 when some villages had to be removed and many hectares of rice lands were salinized. Many infrastructure activities took place immediately, for instance, reconstructing/maintaining/raising the sea and river dikes. Many river mouths had to be closed to prevent sea-water intrusion, and a huge number of water inlets along the rivers that led river water to the fields had to be concrete constructed. Many irrigation systems have to be changed or reconstructed to suit the salty condition. All such adaptation measures need a huge budget to carry out, and these may be seen as unrealistic and exceeding a developing country\u2019s capacity. Unfortunately there are no other better options. \u201cLiving with floods\u201d in Mekong river delta is the easiest option, but it is not a cheap and acceptable option from the perspectives of the communities. In addition, it does not satisfy human, social and economic development. Searching for optimal adaptation measures We can have many adaptation measures, for example, engineering crop varieties with higher tolerance to salt, acid, flood and drought conditions; collecting and implementing autonomous adaptation from other local people; and CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 133 optimal use of natural resources, energy, etc. But these would be mostly suitable for low emission scenarios. What happens in high emission scenarios? Also, even though the new and more resistant varieties are a good option, studies into these are not getting high enough priority or attention.

The contribution concludes with a listing of remaining specific issues to be addressed, including how countries would use the modelled outputs for longer-term adaptation planning, and better information on the changes in the countries\u2019 ecosystems to climate impacts to enable adaptation. Dear Network Members, Climate change adaptation initiative of the Mekong River Commission Mekong, one of world\u2019s longest rivers that stretches 4,800 km, is shared by six countries: China, Myanmar, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. The headwaters of Lanchang River, as it is known in China, and Mekong River, is originated from Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Its water resources have been used for hydropower and agricultural irrigation. The Lower Mekong Basin (LMB), which covers an area of approximately 606,000 km2 within the countries of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam (MRC 2009a), is home to approximately 60 million people (http:// www.mrcmekong.org/about_mekong/people.htm). Climate change is having profound impacts around the globe, and the Mekong River Basin is no exception. How has climate change affected, and will continue to affect, the people and their livelihoods of the LMB in terms of changing water resources, ecosystems and related socio-economic sectors? As an intergovernmental organization, the Mekong River Commission (MRC) (*) is fully aware of the importance of the above issues to its member countries.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 138 Dear Network Members, Reducing disaster risks under changing climate: A major challenge Climate change may exacerbate hazards caused by natural climate variability. Climate change and natural disasters should be dealt with mutually and not exclusively. Almost five-fold rise in disaster events has been observed from 1960 to 1990 and most of those are of hydro-meteorological origins (Chung 2006). Disaster mitigation and preparedness are necessary for a sustainable growth of any society. It has also been observed that the number of people killed due to disasters is higher in places where human development is low. Data also show that the hydro-meteorological disasters cause more damages than the disasters which are of geophysical nature. Not all impacts caused by climate-related hazards could be attributed to climate change. But, changing trends and irreversible processes poses new challenges to us. For these impacts, it is generally less clear whether suitable technologies for adaptation exist. Here, climate change presents a new challenge, which requires further analysis to identify technology needs.

Dear Network Members, Climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction: Innovations required The IPCC 2007 report does not consider the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in the climate change adaptation as the tsunami is not a climate change event. However, it is clear that coastal communities, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, require measures against coastal hazards and climate change (World Vision 2008). Today coastal communities cannot consider climate change adaptation without considering other coastal hazards which are not climate-related. We know that a wide range of measures is available and various methodologies of implementation are possible. The main problems include available funding and mainstreaming the measures in national planning.

Closing Message Dear Network Members, Fourteen contributions were received to enrich the discussions under this sub-theme, which in many ways continued the exchange started in the first sub-theme on climate resilience as well as the second sub-theme on mapping and measuring tools. I would like to thank the following contributors, all experts on the ground: Lisa Schipper; Nishadi Eriyagama; Alain Lambert and Ioana Creitaru; Ramesh Gampat; Stephanie Hodge, Suchita Sugar and Sonia Sukdeo; Ilan Kelman and J.C. Gaillard; G. Padmanabhan; Amelia Supetran; Patrina Dumaru; Heather Bell and Ray Shirkhodai; Pradeepa Malkanthi; Mai Van Trinh; Bonheur Neou, Kien Tran Mai, Pornsook Chongprasith, and Pak Sum Low; and Sudip Mitra. It seems however that there remains the need to clarify the understanding of the nature of the linkages among the concepts of climate resilience, climate change adaptation and disaster risk management. Is there a hierarchy of relationships among them, or do they represent various stages of one comprehensive strategy to address the adverse effects of climate change? How could management of both lead to sustainable development? Some answers can be gleaned from the discussions and the concrete examples provided by the contributors. The contribution of Ilan Kelman and J.C. Gaillard constituted one end of the spectrum of views, and held that climate change adaptation (CCA) can be encompassed within disaster risk reduction (DRR) strategies. Other contributors, such as Heather Bell and Ray Shirkhodai as well as Pradeepa Malkanthi, view the linkages between CCA and DRR clearly within the context of sustainable development. Lisa Schipper called for a \u201creal shift in development paradigms\u201d in order to address both DRR and CCA effectively. Still others clearly recognized the opportunities offered and challenges faced in redefining development in sustainable terms, including Amelia Supetran on the Philippine experience in implementing programmes on DRR that advance CCA.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86d0f4cf-d966-4f36-8ac8-0dccd9847dea": {"__data__": {"id_": "86d0f4cf-d966-4f36-8ac8-0dccd9847dea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "35ac250ec8002b04d30bc3ae9f3c75459fcddb948b99b510ebcb2022c41fc661"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffc60908-e4cc-4418-b14c-200db344a3cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28e97afd8ecd3d17e1108ab0b592c8fcd69743bf07131bde352f4992ffe19e01"}}, "hash": "c35bbbfb69695ac88b66e8e09650a434a7617e2fa6157e2fbb86bad1811e6866", "text": "Concrete experiences were provided in the contributions of Alain Lambert and Ioana Creitaru on the Maldives and South Mexico; Nishadi Eriyagama on adaptation options in the water sector in Sri Lanka; Mai Van Trinh on adaptation strategies in the two main river deltas in Viet Nam; and Sudip Mitra in citing the recognition of this perspective shown for the first time in the 10th five-year plan of India.

Patrina Dumaru\u2019s contribution on a pilot project in Fiji underlined the importance of an integrated approach to climate change adaptation, making use of traditional and local knowledge and the involvement of indigenous communities for successful implementation of adaptation strategies. For this reason, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) provides for support for the development and enhancement of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing countries.

Almost all contributions touched on the financing and technology aspects of climate change adaptation. Amelia Supetran pointed to innovative means of financing that would be needed for adaptation strategies, one free from conditionalities that inhibit innovation and that would instill a sense of ownership essential for long-term responses to a decidedly long-term challenge of adaptation. I would add that adequacy and predictability of financing are necessary in order to allow for long-term planning for adaptation. Lisa Schipper is correct in her observation that \u201cfunding structure for development assistance may be seen as a barrier to getting adaptation to work.\u201d It is for this reason precisely that developing countries in the UNFCCC have tabled a proposal that would clearly demonstrate that financing climate change is distinct and separate from development assistance. Not only is financing a commitment of developed countries under the UNFCCC because of their responsibilities for historical emissions that resulted in the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, but also because of the failure of current delivery systems of financing to respond effectively to the objective of the UNFCCC. The same applies to the discussion in Ramesh Gampat\u2019s contribution of a proposal for a \u201cglobal carbon-price target\u201d and the establishment of a \u201cGreen Fund\u201d to reward compliance with this target. These proposals would be feasible and acceptable within the current climate change process if differentiated responsibilities for historical emissions are factored in the determination of a price target, and if the Green Fund would be under the authority of the Parties to the UNFCCC which would provide policy guidance, determine programme priorities and set eligibility criteria for the use of the Fund. It is a misperception to state that insufficient funding is portrayed within the context of the UNFCCC as a limit to getting societies to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. Financing to address climate change and its adverse effects has specific provisions under the Convention, and is clearly not limited to adequacy alone. Moreover, what is \u201cadequate\u201d can only be determined by the countries themselves, and for this, the UNFCCC has programmes for financial and technology needs assessments. Adaptation in particular is considered to be country-specific, even site- specific, and its financing, including for technology, cannot be fully assessed in terms of global estimates. As I have stated in my opening message, adaptation and mitigation are mutually supportive, and the \u201cglue\u201d that holds them together is sustainable development. One must also keep in mind the first of the Rio Principles: \u201cHuman beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development. They are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature.\u201d (United Nations 1992).

Sub-theme 4 Human Security (including food and nutrition, and energy security) and Human Rights CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 143 1. Opening Message Dear Network Members, In recent years, the adverse effects of climate change on various aspects of human security have been increasingly explored and extensively discussed, with increasing volumes of literature on these topics being written by the United Nations, academic and research institutions, non-governmental organizations, and even the intelligence agencies and the military, among others. Sir David King, former Chief Scientific Adviser of the UK Government, has even commented in January 2004 that \u201cclimate change is the most severe problem that we are facing today - more serious even than the threat of terrorism.\u201d (King 2004). In particular, attention has been paid to the following issues: \u2022 \u201cClimate refugees\u201d : People who are or will be displaced from their homes and countries because of climate- related extreme events, such as tropical cyclones, storm surges, floods and droughts. The expected large number of transboundary \u201cclimate refugees\u201d could potentially become a serious \u201csecurity\u201d issue for many countries. This issue will be linked to future increases in global air temperature, which, in turn, will link to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Higher GHG emissions will lead to higher atmospheric GHG concentrations, which will lead to higher global air temperature.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6547cecd-62cf-4edb-8156-894f9b7c39ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "6547cecd-62cf-4edb-8156-894f9b7c39ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18bd14657f16dd14df392d649bd7a722b91c61066b52f0cca4f64c7853559a88"}, "2": {"node_id": "f69a3560-2ab9-4a41-a2f5-54510fd82f9d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1025a1ffe7e6859059f23e9db6a879b48a938492a90c1a23ae77a90832f450c"}}, "hash": "b99d49fabac268f9fbccd7bb55e6273a19d72e21317fb80eb9d9cc9af5010af1", "text": "For example, the small island developing states have expressed the view that the 2oC limitation of global air temperature as provided for in the Copenhagen Accord will make them more vulnerable to inundation compared to the 1.5oC limitation, which they propose themselves.

These will affect crop yields, and hence will have profound implications on food and nutrition security in many parts of the world, especially in poor countries. \u2022 Energy security: The ever increasing demand for limited fossil fuel resources and their depletion in the foreseeable future has raised the concern of energy security in the future, especially in the Asian and the Pacific countries, which depend heavily on imported oil. What are the new policies, strategies and paradigms for moving away from fossil fuels that contribute to the emission of greenhouse gases, which induce global warming and climate change? \u2022 Conflicts over scarce resources: Conflicts have arisen and continue to arise as a result of scarce natural resources because of climate change, such as the increasing lack of water resources in some parts of the world. Other conflicts could also be caused by loss of livelihoods; food shortage; health impacts due to epidemics and insect outbreaks; mitigation and adaptation inequality; among others (Wisner et al. 2007). \u2022 Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services: Climate change will have profound implications for the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem goods and services (e.g., supporting services, provisioning services, regulating services and cultural services), which are \u201cof vital importance for the functioning of the biosphere, and provide the basis for the delivery of tangible benefits to human society\u201d (Fischlin et al. 2007), and hence they are indispensible for human well-being and security. Up to 50 per cent of the Asia\u2019s total biodiversity is at risk due to climate change (Cruz et al. 2007). \u2022 Loss of indigenous knowledge: Ecosystem degradation is likely to lead to the loss of indigenous knowledge as the indigenous communities impacted are often repositories for natural resource knowledge, and hence the susceptible loss of knowledge when their ways of life are irreversibly damaged. This issue is linked to the human rights of indigenous peoples. \u2022 Human rights: Climate change will exacerbate issues relating to human rights, such as decent living standards (e.g., clean air and water as part of their environmental rights); access to education, adequate food, water, housing and health care; and loss of indigenous culture. It will have an especially large impact on the particularly CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 144 vulnerable groups, including women, children, disabled and disadvantaged persons, and indigenous peoples (e.g., Inuit in the Arctic regions). However, apart from climate change impacts, human rights also extend to justice issues relating to other aspects of climate change, including mitigation and adaptation strategies and measures (e.g., \u201cassigning accountability for extraterritorial harms; allocating burdens and benefits, rights and duties among perpetrators and victims, both public and private; constructing reliable enforcement mechanisms\u201d (International Council on Human Rights Policy 2008)). \u2022 Rights to development: This issue has been repeatedly raised and debated in the international negotiations. While every country has its rights to development, it is important to emphasize that countries should aim for sustainable development, i.e., the \u201cgood\u201d development that integrates environmental, social and economic development as an entity rather than the \u201cbad\u201d development that pursues economic development at all costs (including environmental and social costs) without taking environmental and social parameters into consideration. The above are but a few of the key issues falling within the scope of sub-theme 4, which aims to explore the implications of climate change on Human Security (including food and nutrition, and energy security) and Human Rights. Contributors may further expand the scope of the discussion as long as they are related to the sub-theme. A focus on analysis, solutions and policies will be helpful. I hope that we will receive many insightful and analytical contributions, including case studies and good practices, on this sub-theme, of which I have the great honour to be the facilitator.

In 2009, the General Assembly adopted by consensus resolution 63/281 entitled \u201cClimate Change and its possible security implications\u201d and in implementation of that resolution the Secretary-General subsequently issued a report with the same title (A/64/350). The security-climate change nexus is often considered narrowly in terms of how climate change may fuel violent conflict. However, it is useful to consider \u201csecurity\u201d in a broader sense, as captured by the concept of \u201chuman security\u201d, to get a more full understanding of the security implications of climate change and to capture the interrelationship between security and human rights. Instructive in this regard is the Nobel Committee\u2019s presentation speech in 2007 when the Nobel Peace Prize was jointly awarded to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Al Gore for raising awareness of human-made climate change: \u201cThose who attach importance to \u201chuman security\u201d argue that the main thing is to protect individuals. The chief threats may be direct violence, but deaths may also have less direct sources in starvation, disease, or natural disasters.

Thus understood, \u201chuman security\u201d and the human security implications of climate change are also at the fore of the 2009 report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on the relationship between human rights and climate change (A/HRC/10/61) which was considered by the Human Rights Council in March 2009. The OHCHR report (2009) makes a number of key observations similar to those presented in the Secretary-General\u2019s report on climate change and its possible security implications. In particular, both reports underline (1) that climate change-related effects exacerbate a range of existing threats which are already causing human insecurity and placing human rights under strain, and (2) that these adverse effects/threats can be addressed and minimized through appropriate policy measures. One of the key threat multipliers identified in both reports relate to the threats climate change pose to the well-being of the most vulnerable communities. Looking at the increasingly well-documented observed and projected effects on climate change on human health and well-being, one observation stands out clearly: climate change affects people differently and certain groups tend to be particularly vulnerable to climate change-related risks. For example, women often rely more than men on natural resources for their subsistence; indigenous peoples often depend on natural resources for their livelihood and live in fragile ecosystems; and women, older persons and persons with disabilities tend to be particularly vulnerable in natural disasters caused by extreme weather events. Another observation which stands out is that the adverse effects and threats associated with climate change are not only related to environmental/ climatic factors but also-and to a large extent-to policies and measures to protect vulnerable individuals and groups. The Fourth Assessment Report of the IPCC (2007), the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005), and a range of other recent reports (e.g., Stern Review 2007; UNDP Human Development Report 2007/2008; Commission on Climate Change and Development 2009) detail adverse effects of rising global temperatures on human health and well-being. Whether one looks at these data from a human rights or a human security perspective, it is clear that climate change threatens the basic living conditions required for a life in security and the effectively enjoyment of human rights. The OHCHR report illustrates this point by describing the implications of climate change-related threats for the effective enjoyment of a number of specific human rights: the rights to life, to health, to food, to safe and adequate drinking water, and to adequate housing (*). The human rights and human security perspectives both provide important insights which should guide effective and sustainable climate change policy. First, they bring into focus the \u201chuman\u201d aspect, underlining that the adverse effects of climate change are felt not only by States and economies, but also-and more fundamentally-by individuals and communities. Second, both perspectives underline the need for a comprehensive approach to climate change adaptation that takes into account and directs attention to the underlying causes of vulnerability and insecurity. In the face of climate change-related threats, the human rights perspective adds one important dimension. National and international human rights law provide important safeguards and guidelines for the protection of affected individuals and communities. Giving priority to protecting the most vulnerable and ensuring access to adequate health services, information and education, are not only indispensable to strengthening climate change resilience and reducing risks; such measures are dictated by the legal obligations of States under human rights law.

Dear Network Members, Gender, diversity, human security and human rights in the context of climate change The fact that human security and human rights of women are more affected by climate change than men is well recognised, and has been pointed to by several contributors to other sub-themes. This contribution seeks to draw attention to how different groups of women and men are affected differently based on caste, class, pregnancy status, marital status and other aspects of identity and diversity. The effects of these power relations and diversity could be sex or/and gender specific ways, and need to be recognised in policy and practice. Sex, gender and climate change: Climate change is often associated with an increase in temperature and increase in droughts and floods. In drought situation, an increase in women\u2019s work load has been observed in parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan, India, as women have to go longer distances to fetch water, fuel, etc. (Ariyabandu and Wickramasinghe 2003). Even pregnant women have to put in long hours of work, increasing their chance of miscarriage (especially first and third trimester). Male migration is high. In the absence of men, decisions on dealing with complications during pregnancy are delayed posing risks to women\u2019s maternal health (Murthy 2009). Floods, as in Dhaka slums, pose their own set of problems, like heightened vulnerability of females to urinary tract infections when compared to males due to biological factors, as well as lesser access to toilets (Rashid and Michaud 2000). Pre-existing gender and social relations: Pre-existing gender and social relations and outcomes are likely to have a bearing on the impact of climate change on human security and human rights. To give an example, an exemplarity study from Orissa, India found that dalit women tended to live near the rivers and also live in (single storied) huts.

While male migration was common in the village, the upper caste women could protect themselves against floods better by moving up to the roof, as well as recover fast by moving their belongings to a safe place. The lives and resilience of dalits living in high risk areas and in huts were much higher. The ability of dalit women to access safety of the upper caste roof in floods was less than the middle caste women (Ray-Benett 2009). It is dalit and tribal women who are extremely vulnerable to sexual exploitation in times of economic crisis following floods (Murthy 2009). Pre-existing gender and development outcomes: Female adult literacy rates, female labour force participation rates and norms on mobility vary widely across and within countries. Female literacy levels have a bearing on access to early warning on floods and cyclones (especially through newspapers) and labour force participation influences ability to earn a livelihood for the family in the event of household livelihood crisis arising out of droughts and floods. To give an example, in coastal Andaman and Nicobar islands the female labour force participation is lower than that in coastal Tamil Nadu, and the ability of households to diversify livelihoods post tsunami was less than that in Tamil Nadu where women in coastal areas were actively involved in fisheries. In the event of husband\u2019s death, single women in Andaman and Nicobar could cope and recover much less effectively than women in Tamil Nadu (Murthy and Sagayam 2006). Pre-existing levels of women\u2019s organizations: The extent of women\u2019s organization seems to have a positive bearing on human security and human rights of women in the context of climate change. To give an example, in Kariakal Puducherry, India Sneha (a women\u2019s organisation) had formed a district federation of women. Some of the women deserted by their husbands found that their husbands came back to claim compensation post cyclone and then left with it again. The federation took up the matter with government authorities and traditional village councils and ensured that the compensation got into the hands of single women. Further, while the government only provided compensation for loss of boats (which men managed), they fought successfully and demanded compensation for loss of fish stock, selling vessels, shells etc. (which women managed). In neighbouring states such compensation was not given (*). While compensation does not contribute to resilience, the same women\u2019s organization fought against removal of bio-shields on the coast in the name of putting cement walls! The bio-shields protected them, acted as open toilets, as well as allowed easy access to the coast. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 149 Government and donor policies have to hence be sensitive to sex/gender differentiated human security needs and human rights interests of women and men in the context of climate change, as well as diversity in needs and interests across marital status, economic status, caste, and pregnancy/lactation status etc. of women. The challenges are more where pre-existing gender inequities are high and women\u2019s organizations are weak.

Based on the above definition, the Asia-Pacific region, which has about 1.68 billion people still depending on biomass fuels for meeting cooking/heating needs, and about 1 billion people lacking access to electricity, is far from being energy secure at present (ADB 2008). The most serious threat to energy security of the world arises from the fact that oil, the reserves of which are declining and production of which may peak soon, is the largest source of energy at present; in 2008, oil accounted for 34.8 per cent of global primary conventional energy consumption (BP 2009). Also, global energy demand has been growing ever since the beginning of the industrial revolution and, is likely to continue growing for a number of decades to come as a result of industrialisation of developing countries. Meeting the growing demand in the face of declining reserves of oil presents a formidable challenge, particularly for the Asia-Pacific region, which is poorly endowed with fossil resources. The share of the region in global proved reserve of oil and natural gas at the end of 2008 was only 3.3 per cent and 8.3 per cent respectively (BP 2009). The region is therefore very vulnerable to oil shocks and has to depend heavily on imports for meeting its energy requirements. Imports accounted for about 57.5 per cent of oil requirement of the region in 2005; it is projected that the oil dependence will grow to 66.4 per cent in the year 2030 (APEC and ADB 2009). The growing oil import and soaring import bill pose a serious threat to the energy security of the region. Satisfying the growing global demand is made even more challenging by the need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels in order to keep emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) low for avoiding catastrophic consequences of climate change. Addressing the twin challenges of meeting growing energy demand and reducing GHG emissions at the same time would require unprecedented coordinated efforts by the global community to: i) develop clean and energy efficient technologies in order to keep growth of energy consumption/emissions low; and ii) develop alternative energy sources in order to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, particularly oil. An analysis of the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that for long-term stabilisation of greenhouse-gas concentration at 450 parts per million of CO2 equivalent, energy-related emission of these gases would be 25.7 Gt in 2030 compared with a reference scenario in which world energy demand is assumed to grow by 1.6 per cent per year during 2006-2030, and energy related GHG emissions would rise from 28 to 41 Gt (IEA 2008). The estimated shares of different options in emission reduction compared with the reference scenario are: energy efficiency-54 per cent; renewable energy-23 per cent; carbon capture and storage-14 per cent; and nuclear energy-9 per cent (Tanaka 2008). Huge investments will be needed in all regions of the world, including the Asia-Pacific region, to ensure their energy security by meeting their growing energy demands, while keeping their GHG emissions low through deployment of advanced energy technologies.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "73b4f447-3de5-4e92-8a9b-ccbaeff79913": {"__data__": {"id_": "73b4f447-3de5-4e92-8a9b-ccbaeff79913", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "75c94d186b0b5a8d9acb91591e6bdd2258c9763366975b87f5cb607c311142cd"}, "2": {"node_id": "d38f4799-7e0d-4f92-811f-dd6673f95079", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6fe47d622bf65d005d84f794cb49e2e2b27bb362a1c6df40743772a0dd2adea1"}}, "hash": "70c165cfc147ed68b4e936f202b9597309183646daf4c9b40a71e77376f30d85", "text": "In the Asia-Pacific region, cooperation among different countries for development of energy resources (e.g., natural gas reserves, hydropower resources, offshore wind, methane hydrate, etc.) would be important in enhancing energy security.

Up to 3 billion people depend on water supply from groundwater which is often recharged through wetlands. Other benefits with strong linkages to human well-being include water purification, climate regulation, climate change mitigation and cultural services (MEA 2005). The Ramsar Changwon Declaration on Human Well-being and Wetlands 2008 (Ramsar n.d.-a) emphasizes the importance of wise use (**), management and restoration of wetlands as means to help \u201cbuild opportunities for improving people\u2019s livelihoods, particularly for wetland-dependent, marginalized and vulnerable people\u201d. In a similar vein, \u201cwetland degradation affects livelihoods and exacerbates poverty, particularly in marginalized and vulnerable sections of society\u201d. The Declaration also highlights the vital role of wetlands as the planet\u2019s natural infrastructure for addressing climate change. Degradation and loss of wetlands would worsen the impact of climate change. Consequently, human\u2019s vulnerability to floods, droughts and famine would increase. This contribution seeks to draw attention to the adverse effects of climate change on wetland ecosystems and explain how that may jeopardize human well-being and security. When the structure and function of wetlands are severely threatened or lost, human livelihoods may be irreversibly damaged. What constitutes wetland livelihood? Wetland livelihood characteristics may be identified in terms of: diversity in activity to allow people to minimize risks to their livelihoods and maximize the benefits the environment offers; dynamism in people\u2019s mobility and ability to alter their activities in response to seasonal and annual variations, in particular the changing patterns of flooding and water recession; and adaptive capacity to innovate, using knowledge and skills acquired over generations to adapt their environments to their needs (Friend 2007). Impact of climate change on wetland ecosystem and human livelihood and well-being WI (2002) indicates climate change as one of the proximate drivers or \u201cthe forces which have direct influence on the ecosystem services\u201d of shoreline erosion, rise in sea surface temperature, and saline intrusion. Communities are at risk of climate-induced floods to residential areas, roads and infrastructure and exposure to water-borne diseases; erosion and siltation threatening food and income security; and salinization of water supplies. Floods can be a positive and invigorating role for wetland ecology but in greater intensity or duration than expected, they often severely affect communities. Accordingly, climate change is likely to enhance the severity of floods in the future. Further, a shorter, more intense rainy season will result in increase floods during the wet season and drought during the dry season. Although impacts sustained from floods may not necessarily be dramatic, but yet, families affected may be \u201ckept in the grind of poverty - or fall into poverty - directly due to these losses\u201d. In this respect, the \u201cpotential of climate change to increase floods, and to pull a greater proportion of a community into poverty, would be a great burden\u201d. It may start from a \u201clow-grade stress on the community to a real threat to its survival\u201d (MWBP 2005). CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 153 Traditional and indigenous communities may have the \u201csmallest carbon footprints in the world\u201d but they are \u201cextremely hard hit by climate change\u201d. Degradation to ecosystems would impact their \u201cfood security and sovereignty; health issues; cultural and spiritual impacts; demographic changes (including displacement from their traditional lands and territories); economic impacts and loss of livelihoods; and water shortages\u201d (Galloway McLean 2009).

Dear Network Members, Climate change proofing: Food security, water, livelihoods and social dynamics Climate change has worldwide effects, from which the Asia-Pacific region will not be spared. Millions of people have been living under the threat of extreme climate-related events (Henson 2006). Recent climate scenario analysis undertaken by the Myanmar Government confirms that most parts of Myanmar are expected to subject to one degree Celsius temperature increase within the next two decades (Climate Information Center, Personal Communication, 18 February 2010). Climate change at local level and the dry zone of Myanmar Climate change is affecting rainfall patterns, as well as the total annual precipitation variability, duration and intensity. Longer periods of severe drought are expected to alternate with shorter periods of excessive rainfall. This would result in an increase of livelihood insecurity, especially in semi-arid areas. The dry zone receives an annual precipitation of no more than about 700 mm. As of September 2009, monsoon rains were scarce, with an average decrease of about 45-65 per cent of rainfall in the last 5 years. The crops most severely affected were those planted in the pre-monsoon and monsoon phases, mainly rice (50 per cent-70 per cent drop in transplanted areas), sesame and sunflower (80 per cent-90 per cent drop in crop yield-practically a crop collapse). This negatively affected the farm labour opportunities and thus livelihood. Cereal prices increased by 10-20 per cent, but this was normal for this time of the year (WFP 2009). Moreover, an abundance of agricultural crop pest (leaf roller) was recorded. The grazing areas for livestock were also affected. Farmers had extraordinary expenses for buying fodder. This has reduced their incomes, as their livestock were sold at a loss.

The trade for cattle also decreased (by 30 per cent) (International Development Enterprise 2009). This was an indication of difficulties for animal breeding, although it was still not critical. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 155 With regard to drinking water, water sources and reservoirs were apparently sufficient for household consumption, but not for livestock and agriculture. Families often needed to dig deeper or to travel longer distances for accessing water. In some places, however, there was extreme water scarcity. Thus, there is a need to build/maintain water harvesting infrastructure, fodder distribution, and evaluate existing measures for emergency water response. The effects also included the decrease in farm labour opportunities associated with the failure in rice and oilseeds crops; failure in agricultural loan repayment in the worst affected areas, as interest rates rose as high as 30 per cent. Further, out-migration, including that of women, increased. Thus, it is clear that special assistance to support the upcoming summer cropping season may be needed. Crops with still some chances to be successful are: chick peas (planting), pigeon peas (harvest), onion, chilly, summer paddy. Summer cropping season may start earlier (late October) to take advantage of the soil humidity. The preliminary findings from the dry zone assessment in December 2009 have highlighted the following situations: Because of the lack of water, food insecurity was worse in 2009 compared to previous years. In the second \u2022 half of the year 2009, the level of food insecurity increased further. Poor transportation and poor land access can make the situation more vulnerable; The negative impact on crop production increased. For example, sesame, mostly a monsoon crop, suffered \u2022 heavy loss. The production of pulses, and chilly recorded a 50 per cent loss for the monsoon crop; Migration (west towards Shan state) increased since the previous year; \u2022 Ponds need to be re-dredged to remove sand and silt and to prepare for forthcoming rain; \u2022 As repair of ponds takes time, for an immediate water delivery, tinkered trucks could be used. Further, \u2022 household-level rain catchments, such as tube wells, could be built in alluvial soil by private contractors, and the well water could then be pumped by treadle pumps. Loans could be made available for tube wells, and Cash For Work could be implemented to renovate ponds. Possible measures for climate-proofing The livelihoods of people in dry zone should be climate-proofed to the extent possible. Both adaptation and mitigation measures are required. Some examples are: Improving storage of rainwater and limiting runoff (adaptation/mitigation) Land use planning (adaptation/mitigation) \u2022 Increasing the scale of catchment areas and/or changing the location and/or larger areas permanently under agroforest/grassland. Major emissions of greenhouse gases from land-use sector are associated with changes in land use (Adger and Brown 1994). The Location Approach aims to plan various land uses and activities within each catchment area so that they affect each other as little as possible. Land uses that place greater demands on water quality are located upstream of more polluting ones, while locating more vulnerable uses in areas of groundwater seepage implies placing certain requirements on activities in the infiltration areas. Clean land-use activities should be practised in the infiltration areas. Land utilization (adaptation/mitigation) \u2022 Conservation tillage, agroforestry, i.e. fruit trees and grassland management. Ridge planting (conservation tillage) benefits poorly\u2013drained soils such as vertisols, because ridges are usually drier and aerated than furrow bottoms or land that is managed in flat condition. Mulching is a multi-pronged approach to conserve soil and water and manage weeds. This can prevent evaporation and mitigate drought. Water storage and irrigation (adaptation) \u2022 Increasing water storage capacity, improving drinking water management, more efficient/alternative irrigation techniques and improved irrigation practices (Goedhart 2010). Rainwater storage systems may reduce water abstractions for irrigation during dry periods. In some cases, groundwater abstraction should be stopped in favour of riverbank filtration. Water from the river can be pumped into the ground under the banks and later abstracted when it has been sufficiently filtered by passing through the sand and clay in the sub-soil.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0fbc240-72c7-460a-b244-ae1e3d3573cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0fbc240-72c7-460a-b244-ae1e3d3573cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "449ed8d4ea893af39c9163bbfa784393de931d620b19f72e7b0254e4e59cb097"}, "2": {"node_id": "725b075c-ecbe-4dd2-8b02-4e505b128ce8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0a61df8c937af1a324648fc92fcf62ce4909f1176c508031c0aa355afd367917"}}, "hash": "9c9c3718057133a48501639b86f5d3defc5edbb5fde27aea350b21b74ab36858", "text": "CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 156 Improving agricultural practices (adaptation) Research on drought resistant varieties, changing cropping systems, intercropping (the practice of growing two or more crops simultaneously in the same field), choice of crops, growing seasons, soil fertility management (i.e., organic manure) and animal husbandry could help to improve agricultural practices.

Article 1 states that the right to development is \u2018an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural, and political development in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully realized\u2019. Thus, individuals and communities have the right to achieve the MDGs and other national social and economic development goals. A stable environment is critical to achieving social and economic rights. The process of integrating environmental concerns into the human rights paradigm started in 1972 when the Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment stated that people have \u2018the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life, in an environment of a quality that permits a life of dignity and well-being\u2019. This was taken forward in Principle 1 of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development that stated \u2018human beings are at the center of concern for sustainable development\u2019 and that they are \u2018entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature\u2019. The UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment further elaborated a link between the right to development and CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 158 global environmental change, calling for a \u2018right to prevention of ecological harm\u2019 as part of the right to development (Dias 2000). A stable climate is an essential underlying element of the right to development. It is part of the enabling environment for achieving human development results, allowing present and future generations to lead secure and productive lives. In Asia, human security and the right to development are threatened by many factors. One of the most prominent and serious challenges is glacial melting in the Himalayas (Mool et al. 2001). These glaciers provide food and water security for hundreds of millions of people in the region, but according to some estimates two-thirds of them are now retreating at an alarming rate (WWF 2005). At the center of this challenge lies the Tibetan Plateau, sometimes called the \u2018third pole\u2019 due to the magnitude of its frozen water content (Xu et al. 2005). Many of Asia\u2019s great rivers originate here, including China\u2019s Yangtze and Yellow rivers, and the Mekong and Brahmaputra rivers flowing south into India and Bangladesh. Most of Nepal\u2019s waterways and part of the water flows of India\u2019s Ganges and Pakistan\u2019s Indus rivers also begin here (Singh and Bengtsson 2005). In coming decades, melting will result in decreased water flows, alteration of river systems, and threats to water and food security for local communities living on the plateau and for the hundreds of millions of people in downstream communities directly reliant on these rivers (Yan-Zhi et al. 2006). Low per capita water availability and rising resource scarcity in the region will combine with rising temperatures and melting trends, placing at risk the ability of communities to sustain their hard-won development gains beyond 2015. Adapting our paradigm of progress In the Tibetan plateau region, as well as across Asia, concerns over ecological change are aligning with cultural norms and traditions regarding, not just rights, but also the duty to sustain the environment and express a respect for nature (Khoday 2007). A respect for nature is also a key element of the Millennium Declaration. In the Buddhist sacred text, Sutta Nipata, the Buddha argued that since humanity is far more powerful than other species, we have special duties to the environment linked with this asymmetry of influence. The growing sense of urgency in the region, with regard to environmental problems, brings an opportunity to engage this responsibility, and support local capacities based on both communities\u2019 right to development and a growing sense of duty to address risks from climate change as an issue of human rights and a common concern of humanity. In his classic text, Development as Freedom, Professor Amartya Sen argued that development is \u2018not the mere accumulation of goods but the enhanced freedom to choose, to lead the kind of life one values\u2019 (Sen 1999). Since then, climate change has become central to the concept of human development and as such a new paradigm is needed, moving from Sen\u2019s original \u2018Development as Freedom\u2019 model towards a \u2018Sustainable Development as Freedom\u2019 model. In addition to the five freedoms outlined in the original framework, one may argue that ecological security has become a sixth freedom. As noted by Professor Sen himself: \u2018The question can thus be asked whether environmental priorities should also be seen in terms of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03956a7c-424b-4c8f-ada8-9bddcda3c10d": {"__data__": {"id_": "03956a7c-424b-4c8f-ada8-9bddcda3c10d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1a396554ab4e4bc6e307e833b962fd41649bde4d98918cf493fba6eebe67ecf3"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fdcdf00-7dd8-4351-a0bb-b80688acc99e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b96a1b968a8b1369621884bbea47e56a51538c87dc4488bb0b968a5caaaaff9"}}, "hash": "486c3c7a93ae874ccc939f21bf27c4b228964b28ac50e63444611f920c307c92", "text": "sustaining our freedoms.

The primary food sources (e.g., agriculture, fisheries and forests) and water have been already negatively impacted by climate change in PICTs. Natural disasters are badly pressing food supplies, commercial crops, livestock, and the water supply in the region. Climate variations and extremes have disrupted food production, water supply and economies of PICTs. As a result, food availability and people\u2019s accessibility to food have also been adversely affected (FAO 2008). At the World Food Summit of 1996 it was indicated that food security exists \u201cwhen all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary and food preferences for an active and healthy life\u201d (FAO 2006). Thus, food security is built on three pillars: the availability of food, the ability to access it, and to use it. The availability of food highly depends on local food production. In most Pacific Island Countries, there has been poor performance both in food and agricultural production compared with the performance in Asia, in the period of 1997 to 2002 (Sharma 2005). Food insecurity may rise in the future in the Pacific Island countries, given that climate change is likely to have many negative impacts on the factors that determine food security (Sharma 2005). Climate change: Impacts on agriculture, fisheries, forest and water resources Ocean warming, frequent tropical cyclones, flash floods and droughts are likely to have dramatic impact on food production system in the Pacific Islands. Local food production is vital to the Pacific Islands where the majority of rural people still live and depend on subsistence agriculture. Agricultural production in the Pacific is heavily dependent on the seasonal rainfall. Climate change predictions for the region suggest prolonged variations from the normal rainfall which could be devastating to agriculture. In particular, key future impacts are related to extended periods of drought and, on the other hand, loss of soil fertility and degradation as a result of increased precipitation, both of which will negatively impact agriculture and food security (IFAD 2009). The combination of increasing temperatures and sea-level rise will result in changes to coastal circulation patterns, thereby affecting nutrient supply, lagoon flushing, coastal erosion, and possibly ocean acidity and coral bleaching (ESCAP and PIFs 2008). These will affect both the reef-building capacity of corals as well as the spawning cycles of reef fishes and invertebrates. Given that coastal fisheries represent a significant source of food and livelihood (most Pacific Islanders are coastal dwellers), climate change poses a serious threat to people\u2019s food and economic security. Beside the ecological functions of the forests, they are sources for food, income, medicine, fuel and building materials and, therefore, are linked to the overall food security of communities near these \u201cbiological warehouses\u201d. Wild harvests of edible nuts, fruits, plants and meat from the forests form a significant source of food for Pacific island people. In a region where the delivery of medical services is often limited by physical isolation and affordability, traditional medicines from the forest are often the only difference between life and death (FAO 2008). Safe drinking water is also a means for food security and also has close linkages to food and nutrition. Water resources in Pacific Island are extremely vulnerable to changes and variations in climate because of their limited size, availability and geology and topography, especially in rainfall (IFAD 2009). CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 161 Way forward The information about climatic threats to food security in developing countries is still extremely limited. The exact magnitude and nature of climate change impacts on food sources are relatively unknown in PICTs. Long - term policy responses require accurate information about the economic impacts of future climatic conditions. Nevertheless, addressing the challenges of food security by taking into account current and future changes in climate is significant. However, the strengthening of the adaptation enabling environment and implementation of adaptation measures are also important. Refining ability to project climate change at local scales, expanding capacity to provide decision makers and the public with relevant information on climate change and its impacts, and enhance understanding of how society can adapt to climate change in the context of multiple stresses can be considered as high prioritized areas that have to be addressed.

This has led to the \u201cNew Silk Road\u201d and provided \u201cboth the opportunities and the risks\u201d. He identifies three key areas where such opportunities exist: (1) Asian multinational energy corporations should take corporate social responsibility by adopting a \u201cmore preventive and proactive approach\u201d \u201cto integrate concepts of environmental sustainability and human development into their outward investments\u201d, so as \u201cto set Asia as a leader in socially and environmentally responsible investment\u201d; (2) As oil reserves in the Arab region are declining, \u201cnew South-South cooperation\u201d \u201ccan bring to bear the successful experiences of Asia in shifting from natural resource-export oriented economies to what is today a major force in global manufacturing and service sectors\u201d, as in the case of China and India; (3) South-South cooperation \u201ccan bring to bear the successful experiences of Asia in establishing enabling policy environments for local development of clean energy technologies and establishing public-private partnerships for their rapid commercialization in the domestic market\u201d. Indeed, this is an important regional cooperation mechanism for addressing climate change, not only in the development and transfer of mitigation technologies, but also adaptation technologies. Dear Network Members, Asia\u2019s quest for energy security: The external implications As countries like China and India seek to secure energy resources towards the goal of sustained economic growth and human development, they are increasingly looking outwards, and to the Arab region in particular. As noted in the 2009 Arab Human Development Report on the theme of human security, the Arab region hosts the majority of the world\u2019s oil reserves, the exports of which play a central role in national economies.

Ali Ibrahim Al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Minister for Petroleum and Mineral Resources at a 2009 International Energy Conference in New Delhi, the \u2018New Silk Road\u2019 is a \u201cpotent metaphor for Asia\u2019s stunning growth and growth potential, and the far- reaching implications as developing nations take their places at the global table.\u201d (Al-Naimi 2009). Issues of energy security are now at the centre of the revival of Arab-Asia trade. China and India are expected to contribute over 50 per cent of the world\u2019s new energy demand over the coming decades, catalysing geopolitical and economic reconfigurations, with twenty-first century energy security issues increasingly focused along this New Silk Road (IEA 2009). As we think about issues of energy security in Asia, it will be critical to understand the emerging external implications of Asia\u2019s growth in terms of both the opportunities and the risks. Three key issues can be identified. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) in Asian multinational energy corporations: Asia now hosts some of the world\u2019s largest energy firms, increasingly focused outward in oil-rich countries in various regions across the world. With a large increase in outward Asian foreign direct investment (FDI) into the Arab region comes the risk of exacerbating pre- existing social and environmental issues.

This seeks to build on the rapid emergence over the past several years of vibrant CSR platforms and dialogues within Asia, and expand such approaches to companies\u2019 activities abroad, to set Asia as a leader in socially and environmentally responsible investment. Priorities include support to ensure local employment generation for the large youth population in Arab countries, actions to assess and prevent environmental impacts and support new research into carbon capture and clean energy, and actions to address issues of human rights and labour rights. South-South Cooperation to support the goal of diversifying local economies beyond oil exports: A major priority in Arab states is to support a diversification of national economies beyond oil exports. This is in response to the eventual decline of oil reserves during the twenty-first century and the need to further develop manufacturing and service sectors for future employment opportunities for the region\u2019s large and growing youth population. While national strategies and policies are in place, new South-South cooperation among Governments from Asia and Arab regions, alongside growing energy cooperation, can bring to bear the successful experiences of Asia in shifting from natural resource-export oriented economies to what is today a major force in global manufacturing and service sectors. China and India stand as cases on point; having shifted from natural resource dependent economies to what are today two of the most vibrant manufacturing and knowledge-driven economies in the world. A major opportunity now exists to CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 163 build on this reservoir of knowledge to bridge experiences in setting economic diversification policies and achieving results for the future. South-South Cooperation for development and transfer of clean energy technologies: Alongside increased levels of Arab- Asia cooperation around the issue of energy security, an opportunity also exists to develop stronger ties around issues of clean energy development. Countries in Asia have made major progress over recent years in developing local capacities for the production and application of renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, with steady reductions in the energy intensity of gross domestic product (GDP) growth witnessed across the region over the past decade. Meanwhile, countries in the Arab region are now placing heavy emphasis and large investments into research and development of such technologies. This is in response to the need to conserve declining oil resources for future export earnings, rather than its use for local power generation, while also bringing the benefits of reduced energy intensity of GDP growth and reduced per capita greenhouse gas emission levels. While national strategies and policies are in place in various Arab countries for expansion of clean energy use, new South-South cooperation can bring to bear the successful experiences of Asia in establishing enabling policy environments for local development of clean energy technologies and establishing public-private partnerships for their rapid commercialization in the domestic market.

CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 164 It is hoped that the above important findings will further strengthen women\u2019s role in climate-related disaster risk reduction and adaptation, not only in Bangladesh, but also elsewhere, so as to enhance human security. Dear Network Members, Gender, climate change and human security in Bangladesh: Key policy lessons These are the key conclusions of a bigger case study on Bangladesh conducted in 2008 for Women\u2019s Environment Development Organization (WEDO) based in USA. The paper was appeared first in WEDO publication Gender, climate change and human security: Lessons from Bangladesh, Senegal and Ghana. Key policy lessons 1. Poor women in Bangladesh are already experiencing some of the impacts of climate change: They experience increasing frequency, intensity and impact of floods, cyclones, droughts and salinity intrusion. This changing nature of disasters has an impact on their current ability to cope. This is most likely to have far reaching consequences on their security, i.e., lives, livelihood, food and nutrition, physical and physiological protection against violence. Women from different backgrounds (i.e., economic, social, physical ability and marital status) face climate change impacts differently. 2. Opportunities and barriers for women to cope with disasters today will play similar role in adapting to climate change: These factors include: protection of their economic livelihoods, property ownership, access to services and justice, fair wage for women engaged in the informal sector, political participation in the decision making, access to information and protection against disasters with enhanced leadership. But these factors may not work in a similar way in the climate change context; thus the current policy approach to tackle these problems should be reviewed. 3. Women\u2019s changing role in the society is overlooked in the climate change discussion: Sectoral approach dominates this discussion. Being the single major source of livelihood, most studies on the climate change impact focus on agriculture. Emerging non-farm activities in rural economy (*) and growing urban informal sector are the areas largely under-researched. \u2018For example, during 1987-2000, women have increased their involvement in poultry, homestead gardening (significant contribution to household income) and non-farm services, but reduced their labour in crop cultivation. Women involvement in livestock, homestead gardening and cottage industry are significantly higher than that of men\u2019 (CPD 2001). Attention has not been paid to how the market led economy exacerbates the impact of climate change on women. 4. Discussion on food security includes intra-household food distribution: There has been a scientific consensus that food security at the household level will severely be affected by climate change. While food security has always been receiving highest political importance, the current way of addressing the problem may not work in the climate change context. For example, the decrease in national rice production due to disasters has been managed by the government through import of food from the rice exporting countries such as India, Thailand and Viet Nam who are equally facing the impact of climate change on their rice production. Existing social capital in which poor households borrow money to purchase food will not be available when everyone is affected and affected more frequently and massively. This raises an important policy challenge. Such a problem will most likely exacerbate pre-existing inequalities in the society, in which women\u2019s share of household food will most likely go down. 5. When migration is an adaptation: Most types of migration are an important form of coping with disaster impact. Seasonal and permanent loss of employment and income is often addressed by migration by the rural poor households in Bangladesh. Almost two-fifth of the rural households send adult members to the nearest towns due to lack of year round employment (Afsar and Baker 1999). While disaster and unemployment play a \u2018push role\u2019, the job opportunities (e.g., ready-made garment, transport and construction sector) pull city-ward migration. Yet, more men than women migrate to the cities (Afsar 2003). But migration, both national and international, has not been discussed as an adaptation measure in Bangladesh. The issue is complicated because of the fine boundary between migration and displacement. Women face more hurdles than men during the process of migration. Often, they do not have the right information. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 165 The city-ward migration will continue to grow in the context of climate change.

The key question that is overlooked is whether cities are prepared to host such an influx of people impacted by climate change. Migrants in Dhaka generally reside in the slums and squatters, without having any basic facilities. For example, a female slum resident must travel on average 69 meters daily, adding to her workload (Afsar 2003). Most migrants, especially women, are engaged in the informal sector. Their informal employment is not regulated like formal employment. The urban poor people are also not part of the social safety net programme. 6. Women are viewed as a vulnerable group rather than active agents in risk reduction and adaptation: Women play a key role in protecting, managing and recovering their household during and after a disaster. They have knowledge and capacity to contribute towards adapting to the changing nature of disasters. Over the years there has been a shift into the community\u2019s perception of the role of women. Evidence suggests that communities are now more ready to accept women leading their disaster risk reduction. Women are now involved in local disaster management committees formed within local government system. They also play a lead role in the NGO led disaster committees at local level. However, the unaddressed specific vulnerabilities of women (mentioned above) that form a barrier must be addressed before women can play a meaningful leadership role at the community level. As the role of these committees are limited in pre-and post-disaster decision-making, women\u2019s economic contribution continues to be an overlooked area in economic planning as well as disaster assessment. As a result they do not get a fair share from the post-disaster assistance. 7. Good disaster risk reduction is the better adaptation that suffers limited scale up: But most disaster risk reduction programmes are designed on previous disaster trend, not on the likely characteristic of disaster in the climate change context. A number of factors, i.e. lack of resources, knowledge to design concrete activities for adaptation, perception about uncertainty in climate change impact and capacity to focus long term issues (executive and legislative are busy with immediate priorities), limit the country\u2019s ability to facilitate such a policy shift. There are micro-level good practices that promote women leadership in various activities, such as economic empowerment, disaster risk reduction and political empowerment. But there has been a lack of effort to learn from these activities and scale them up.

Mukherjee (2010) highlighted how population pressure is affecting climate change and human development. The population forecasts for Asia and Oceania and the world for 2010, 2030 and 2050 are presented in Table 1. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 167 Table 1.

Source: UN Population Division 2010. Asia has the highest percentage of the world\u2019s population and China and India dominate the population of Asia. While it is forecast that the world\u2019s population will grow by 2.241 billion between now and 2050, that of Asia/Oceania (A/O) will grow by 1.079 of which China/India forecasted contribution is 0.463 billion, less than half of the A/O total. The largest cause of deforestation and land degradation is caused by clearing land for agriculture to meet the needs of the increased population and to grow cash crops to improve the standard of living. Therefore, tempering population increase must be given priority. Most, if not all, governments promote economic growth as the principal way to increase the living standards of their population and to temper population increase. However, there are limits to growth based on natural resources, especially fixed resources. Several studies have been undertaken to estimate the carrying capacity for the population. It is estimated that between 4 and 5 billion people can be supported with a lifestyle of \u2018developed countries\u2019 (Cohen 1995). Median estimates of 14 assessments give a low estimate of 2.1 billion people and a high estimate of 5 billion (Richard 2002). However, two researchers estimated that based on Net Primary Production of Biomass (NPP) the range could be from 2 billion up to 14 billion (Richard 2002). This is shown in Table 2. Table 2.

However, only coal will be available in adequate quantities after 2050. But the present and increased use of fossil fuels could lead to serious climate changes that will adversely affect the world\u2019s population, especially in developing countries. Increased sea levels will affect low lying areas and small island countries and this, in turn, will affect low lying agriculture. Increased temperature will negatively affect grain production, especially of rice, although increased CO2 may increase plant growth. Water supply may increase in some areas and decrease in others. All these facts could lead to massive migration and human conflict. Perhaps the emphasis should be shifted from promoting economic growth per se to the division of the existing wealth within and between countries and promoting the \u2018Gross National Happiness\u2019 (GNH) as it is happening in Bhutan! CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 168 Thus, in order to try and reduce the rate of atmospheric CO2 increase, there has to be a shift away from the use of fossil fuels to an increased use of renewable energy. At present, most renewable energy development is based on electricity generation through the use of solar, wind and water power. Recently, there has been an upsurge of interest in the production of biofuels, particularly ethanol and biodiesel. However, there are some concerns about diverting maize to ethanol production and the cutting down of tropical forests to grow palm oil for biodiesel. Little attention has been paid to the expanded use of \u2018traditional\u2019 biomass, even though about half the world\u2019s population cook with it (Openshaw 2010a). It is thought that cooking with fuelwood and charcoal is unsustainable, thus leading to deforestation. However, for developing countries as a whole, the annual growth of wood on all land formations including Asia and Oceania, is about 3-5 times the total annual use. It is clearing land for agriculture that is the principal cause of deforestation. Therefore, it is possible to use more wood provided that the resource is properly managed. For \u2018low income\u2019 countries of Asia and Oceania, including China and India, biomass accounts for about 30 per cent of primary energy demand for 85 per cent of the population (Openshaw 2010c). As about 80 per cent to 85 per cent of biomass energy is used in the house, principally for cooking, the number of households cooking with biomass may be more than 50 per cent. Of course, the aim should be to provide energy at the turn of a knob or the flick of a switch. Eventually this could be achieved with the products of biomass or using biomass to generate electricity. In the meantime one aim should be to improve and expand biomass supply and improve its end-use and intermediate efficiency and use. Therefore, to try to ensure energy security, I would propose the following: 1. Emphasize that biomass is a legitimate and renewable fuel, especially \u2018traditional biomass\u2019. Apart from household use, fuelwood, crop residues and, to a lesser extent, charcoal, are important (rural) industrial and service sector fuels. Biomass is a feedstock for electricity generation or heat/power co-generation. It is a feedstock for gaseous, liquid and solid fuels, which usually have a higher energy value. Also, plants are grown that produce plant oils or exudates, which can be used as fuels after processing. Many of these plants can be grown on marginal lands. The sale of biomass for energy purposes is an important source of revenue especially for rural people. An estimate of 30 million people can be employed in the production, transport and trade of biomass fuels (Openshaw 2010b). Therefore, it can be an important solution for poverty alleviation. 2. Determine areas where biomass use can be expanded and promote measures to do so. 3. Locate areas of biomass shortage and propose measures on the supply and demand side to make these areas sustainable. These include better management of existing biomass resources; increased tree planting on all land use types; and improved intermediate and end use efficiencies. 4. Reduce and eventually reverse deforestation, increase agricultural productivity at least in line with population increase. Trees can assist in this endeavour with shelterbelts, agro-forestry trees on arable and pastoral land etc. Wood ash, leaves, manure and biogas slurry can be used as fertilizers and soil enhancers. 5. Promote family planning as part of a rural initiative to improve drinking water supply, medical services, and biomass production (crops and trees etc.) and use. All too often, there is little coordination and cooperation from and between government ministries, donors, NGOs etc. regarding family planning. Women are usually the mainstay of village communities, yet their needs", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4faec984-7526-40f9-b629-b284b7fe0e28": {"__data__": {"id_": "4faec984-7526-40f9-b629-b284b7fe0e28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b5c74d7f1bbd1bae85b302a4eb6d80ffc6653b997681b2a9564af30f157d4210"}, "3": {"node_id": "fe900641-1b0f-4628-bc1b-4c8b24497348", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15d3fe6144e506bb60631eff89e6647b55c77bb75ed1b5b6aef80a098bdc04dc"}}, "hash": "76921033a552c9d6b8e98d026089816268afca59eb7f2db53fd9ef5ded786448", "text": "are often neglected. Thus, the provision of such a package of services should lead to improved health and productivity and the spacing of children. As a consequence, fewer, but healthier children will be born: this should eventually reduce the pressure on resources. 6. Promote irrigation systems that limit the supply of water to the plants requirements. 7. Promote improved efficiency in the intermediate and end-use of biomass. Countries should have biomass efficiency units. Formal industry usually has funds for innovation. Informal industry has little funds, yet the largest efficiency gains can be made in this sector. This is where help should be directed. 8. Biomass is a feedstock for other biofuels. Where required, help should be given to promote these fuels if economically CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 169 but not necessarily financially viable: Gaseous fuels: \u2022 producer/water gas; biogas; syngas. This latter fuel is the feedstock for liquid fuels such as kerosene and petroleum. Liquid fuels: \u2022 methanol (wood alcohol); ethanol; gelfuel; biodiesel; black liquor. Methanol can be the feedstock for organic chemical and octane, etc. Solid fuels: \u2022 apart from charcoal, densified wood, briquetted biomass etc. can be produced. 9. Promote biomass for heat and power production. In many countries there has been an upsurge in power and co- generation power/heat plants using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels or using biomass that otherwise would be wasted. 10. Promote biomass as a carbon sink and an energy source. Biomass is a convenient store of the sun\u2019s energy that can be used when required. Tree crops sequestrate atmospheric carbon and can help mitigate carbon dioxide accumulation from fossil fuels. In addition, using the annual growth for energy and other purposes as a substitute for fossil fuels and construction etc. will reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The optimum solution is use and sequestration, not just sequestration. 11. Involve local people in managing their surrounding natural resources, particularly forests and woodlands. They should help draw up management plans and benefit when forest products are used. They can be encouraged to establish private tree nurseries or given contracts to grow tree seedlings. They could be paid to protect watersheds and areas of wild habitat importance. They can be trained in improved tree management and shown various agro-forestry practices. Governments should see them as the solution rather than as a problem of deforestation and degradation. Without continual and concerted investment in people and products from renewable resources, especially biomass, the world will not be able to have sustainable development. Developing countries already use considerable quantities of renewable energy. They could expand its use and show many highly industrialized nations a path to energy and ecological sustainability.

The case study used two scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide the bases of projections on the climate change context and yield trends for this particular food crop. The option is examined to adapt to favourable impacts of changing temperature conditions in order to increase cereal crop production in the region. The contributor concludes that \u201cthe results show that the multiple cropping of winter wheat and vegetable had the best economic benefits\u201d, although it entailed maximum costs. Under these conditions, therefore \u201cwinter wheat could not totally substitute the spring wheat\u201d. More work has to be undertaken, such as improvement in the quality of wheat seeds, adjustment in irrigation systems, as well as enhancing mechanization to sow the wheat on time. Dear Network Members, Cost-benefit analysis of northward winter wheat in Ningxia, China: Adaptation options and implications for food security (*) Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is the only Hui (Chinese Muslim) autonomous region in China. Ningxia is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River in northwest China, and lies between north latitude 34\u00b014-39\u00b023 and east longitude 104\u00b017-107\u00b039, with the total area of 66 400 sq. km and with a population of 5.95 million in which the Hui nationality takes up over one-third of the population (Bureau of Statistics of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region 2009). Climate change has significant impacts on agriculture in Ningxia. As a mature agricultural technology, the northward winter wheat growing could utilize the favourable conditions of increased temperature and increase in total cereal crop production, which would enhance food security in the region. A case study was carried out to investigate and evaluate the cost-benefit effectiveness of northward winter wheat as an adaptation option to climate change both in the field and in farmers\u2019 households in Ningxia. The investigations were made in three counties (namely Wuzhong, Yongning and Helan) in Ningxia and covered 50 small farmers\u2019 households. The inputs and outputs of the northward winter wheat growing were recorded in 2007- 2008. As a baseline, the characteristics of the temperature changes during the growing period of winter wheat were analysed. The climate change context and the yield trends of wheat during 2022-2050 under climate change scenarios were estimated. Based on the above analysis, adaptation strategies for the further development of the northward winter wheat were recommended. According to the observed temperature data of 1961-2004 at eleven stations in North Ningxia, the temperature conditions were ready for the northward winter wheat growing. The mean temperatures both in winter and in spring have gradually increased. The mean temperature in winter significantly increased after 1978. The gradual rise of CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 171 the average minimum temperature both in winter (December, January and February) and in January provided the prerequisite for the safe overwintering of the winter wheat in North Ningxia. The temperature trends during growing period of wheat from 2022 to 2050 under A2 and B2 scenarios were also analysed (**). The winter mean temperature is projected to gradually increase, and the trend is projected to be more significant after 2035. The fluctuation of the mean temperature in spring is projected to rise, and then fall after 2043- 2045 according to the scenario results. The results of moving t-test are in accordance with the above projections. The sudden change in temperature to minus value under B2 scenario was more significant than that under A2 scenario. The number of days of average maximum temperature above 32 oC with 3 days in succession was compared. The frequency of occurrence of high temperature under B2 scenario is projected to be higher than that under A2 scenario. The wheat yields during 2022-2050 were simulated by using CERES-Wheat model, which has been specially developed for wheat yield simulation. The yields of both winter and spring wheats are projected to decrease under A2 and B2 scenarios, while the yield of winter wheat is projected to increase slightly in the 2040s under B2 scenario, possibly related to the temperature trends of winter and spring. The results show that the multiple cropping of winter wheat and vegetable had the best economic benefits, but with maximum cost.

Dear Network Members, Ensuring human security of vulnerable communities through local coping strategies Human beings have traditionally adapted to changes in environment, including climate change and climate variability, and therefore to realigning means for living and livelihoods, often referred to as coping strategies. However, such changes to a large extent were evolutionary and required gradual adaptation. Consequently social systems were able to draw upon their intrinsic resilience and allow for changes in environmental conditions. Climate change as we understand it today is different; changes are proving to be rapid, more intense and randomly frequent. Thus, poor people face higher and more complex risks which negatively impact their lives. The adverse impacts of climate change are most striking in the developing nations, including Pakistan. This is because of their geographical and climatic conditions, high dependence on natural resources, and lack of capacities to adapt to a changing climate.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96617d76-7828-4c4b-8487-32fe2633d5c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "96617d76-7828-4c4b-8487-32fe2633d5c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b82f685628171c405e120848d737fea7264d9d1068a8403e7c4a22977797a829"}, "2": {"node_id": "982cb7d7-1c44-4085-b204-c46d9175a582", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "350ac1a4f38fb990de2f4603b7ba61d7945d7d48b16b30709478e4358fae08f3"}}, "hash": "706e9a5b4f0be3e568bfde3bd617f06d35c690fd658445716d81ed3f1052c684", "text": "The most important climate change related threats to Pakistan are: Increased variability of monsoon; \u2022 Rapid recession of Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan glaciers with reduction in water inflows to the Indus \u2022 river system; Increased incidence of droughts and floods (including Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods-GLOFs); \u2022 Water stress and heat waves in arid regions of the country; \u2022 Sea water intrusion and increased cyclonic activity. \u2022 These threats are increasing the vulnerability of the poorest segments of the Pakistan\u2019s society and imperil human security with reduction in food", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ed5090a-0898-42e9-a196-b1bf3ab2b5d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ed5090a-0898-42e9-a196-b1bf3ab2b5d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c369ae68060659ec870c48c5aa9e0d8e0dc9e4bd5ca18d3598e6a2d316cad2bf"}}, "hash": "c369ae68060659ec870c48c5aa9e0d8e0dc9e4bd5ca18d3598e6a2d316cad2bf", "text": "supplies, water stresses, unreliable access to the sources of energy and diminishing livelihoods at the local level. Recent climatic events in different parts of the country have shown that population living in extremely fragile areas have the least capacity to cope with the climate change incidences and are most vulnerable to the associated risks. These areas cover the coastal region, arid region and the mountain region. Incidentally, the communities living in these areas are also most disadvantaged and vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The major short to medium climate change driven factors ultimately undermining human security of these vulnerable community groups are: Communities of the Coastal Region: The livelihoods of coastal communities of Sindh and Balochistan (the two southern provinces of the country) are dependent on marine resources. These communities are already under stress because of lack of availability of fresh water that has been contaminated by sea water intrusion. Increased frequency of cyclonic activity is giving rise to loss of livelihoods leading to population displacement towards urban centres. The damage to infrastructure due to the extreme events also limits the timely access to the health facilities, damages the local education facilities and further limits the availability of safe water. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 173 Communities of the Arid Region: The arid region of Pakistan is home to the communities of sedentary as well as migratory herders. These communities maintain livestock that feed on the rangelands and are traded as their main source of livelihood. During the drought years livestock of the herders die in large numbers because of water stress and depletion of grazing lands. It takes years for these communities to come back from such losses. Local conflicts also arise between the farmers (in irrigated agricultural areas) and the herders who move to the farm lands in search of food and water. The revival of the arid ecosystem after prolonged drought is slow and sometimes irreversible that puts extra stress on the dependent communities. Communities of the Mountain Region: Climate change is having major impacts on the communities living in the mountain regions of the country. The mountain ecosystems are most fragile. Heavy rainfalls, snow storms and Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (GLOFs) result in land/mud slides, erosion of the productive top soil and loss of lives. Mountain communities also have peculiar population dynamics in Pakistan. Most of the earning men working in urban areas of down country leave behind women, elderly and children. In such situations women act as the head of the family and undertake all the chores from house keeping to agriculture and domestic animals rearing. Therefore, in the event of any climatic disaster, women of these areas are the one who are hit most. The rising GLOF factor has shown that the loss of land due to floods and mud slides will take years to recover. Women who were dependent on these lands cannot resettle over a short time. Many of the community members who get physically hit by floods do not get medical help and can end up in agony for life. It is important and urgent to come up with \u201clocal\u201d short and medium term coping strategies that address the human security issues. While doing so the unequal impact on men and women must be fully recognized. For example, rural women are the principal contributors of basic foods, and the agricultural sector is highly susceptible to risks of drought and uncertain precipitation. This means that climate change endangers food security as well as women\u2019s well- being and their capacity to survive.

The contributions covered the implications of the adverse effects of climate change on human security, and the issues covered range from human rights, energy security, food security, livelihoods, gender, population, disaster risk reduction, mitigation, adaptation, to wetland ecosystems. While some contributions focused on a single and unique issue, others touched upon multiple issues. Case studies, examples or experiences from Bangladesh, China, India, CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 174 Myanmar, Pakistan and the Pacific Islands, have been shared. A number of specific response measures, at both policy and operational levels, on all the issues discussed have been proposed. Ulrik Halsteen set the scene by highlighting that the concept of \u201chuman security\u201d \u201cencompasses not only the absence of conflict but also the effective protection and enjoyment of human rights, including access to education and adequate food, housing and health care\u201d. In particular, he stressed that \u201cpolicies and measures\u201d are required to protect the \u201cwell-being of the most vulnerable communities\u201d, such as \u201cindigenous peoples\u201d, \u201cwomen, older persons and persons with disabilities\u201d. Both national and international human rights laws have provided \u201cimportant safeguards and guidelines for the protection of affected individuals and communities\u201d. On the same issue on human rights, Usha Natarajan and Kishan Khoday highlighted that a \u201cstable climate is an essential underlying element of the right to development\u201d. They regarded melting of glaciers in the Himalayas, which \u201cprovide food and water security for hundreds of millions of people in the region\u201d as one of the \u201cmost prominent and serious challenges\u201d, especially the glaciers in the Tibetan Plateau, where many of Asia\u2019s great rivers originate (e.g., Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong and Brahmaputra rivers). They have expanded Amartya Sen\u2019s \u201cDevelopment as a Freedom\u201d model to a \u201cSustainable Development as a Freedom\u201d model, and added \u201cecological security\u201d as the sixth freedom in addition to the \u201cfive freedoms outlined in the original framework\u201d. Three contributions focused on energy security. Sribas Chandra Bhattacharya highlighted that huge investments and \u201cunprecedented coordinated efforts by the global community\u201d to \u201cdevelop clean and energy efficient technologies\u201d and \u201calternative energy sources\u201d will be needed. He concluded that by mid-2100, \u201crapid changes and developments are expected to take place in energy supply as well as end-use technologies in all the sectors of the economy\u201d, and coping pace with these changes, \u201cattracting necessary investments, involving the private sector, facilitating technology transfer etc. will present great challenges and opportunities\u201d for the countries in the Asia-Pacific region to ensure their energy security \u201cin the years to come\u201d. Keith Openshaw emphasized the importance of utilizing \u201ctraditional\u201d biomass energy, which is renewable and low cost. He proposed a number of measures to ensure energy security and sustainable development, including the expanded use of biomass energy efficiently and effectively, and family planning that is supported by improved drinking water and medical services and biomass production; among others. He concluded that \u201cWithout continual and concerted investment in people and products from renewable resources, especially biomass, the world will not be able to have sustainable development.\u201d Kishan Khoday discussed the external implications of Asia\u2019s quest for energy security as a result of economic growth, particularly in the Arab region. He identified three key areas where opportunities exist for Asia-Arab (South-South) cooperation: (1) promotion of socially and environmentally responsible investments; (2) diversification of oil-dependent economies by shifting to global manufacturing and service sectors; and (3) establishment of enabling policy environments for local development of clean energy technologies, including public-private partnerships for their rapid commercialization in the domestic market. Three contributions discussed food security. Ohnmar Khaing described how the reduced rainfall and the lack of water in the dry zone of Myanmar in recent years has led to the significant decline in crop yields and livestock production, and hence the food insecurity. These have also affected the farmers\u2019 incomes, livelihoods and social dynamics (e.g., migration and out-migration), especially the vulnerability of women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ed4aa2a-e7bb-44be-8ea2-bde1fa445269": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ed4aa2a-e7bb-44be-8ea2-bde1fa445269", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d9052626ce9431ae22af755aa16298aa2256ed804d24e85cd7a53fff67c5458"}, "2": {"node_id": "1a77a8eb-d166-47f1-9ed2-da820ae83f96", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2967543377a76207156810ea808138fec74b118976d74e7412477060411d18d6"}}, "hash": "580e9a418cfef9dd2341bfd6174afef09984df40a619a3f75a609a8e53a9bd45", "text": "She suggested a few possible \u201cclimate-proofing\u201d measures, and stressed the important role of non-governmental organizations in sharing experiences and knowledge on adaptation and mitigation measures.

Shiming Ma informed on an interesting case study conducted in Ningxia, northwest China, \u201cto investigate and evaluate the cost-benefit effectiveness of northward winter wheat as an adaptation option to climate change both in the field and in farmers\u2019 households\u201d. The case study, which has implications for food security, used two IPCC scenarios to project yield trends for this particular food crop.

Thus, \u201cwinter wheat could not totally substitute for spring wheat\u201d. However, further research is needed. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 175 Two contributions specifically focused on women issues. Ranjani K. Murthy drew our attention in India to \u201chow different groups of women and men are affected differently\u201d by climate change \u201cbased on caste, class, pregnancy status, marital status and other aspects of identity and diversity\u201d. She cited a few examples of \u201cpre-existing gender inequities\u201d in social relations and development, including the extreme vulnerability of \u201cdalit and tribal women\u201d to \u201csexual exploitation in times of economic crisis following floods\u201d; high \u201cfemale illiteracy levels\u201d means that they are unaware of any \u201cearly warning on floods and cyclones (especially through newspapers)\u201d; among others. Thus, both government and donor policies have to be \u201csensitive to sex/gender differentiated human security needs and human rights interests of women and men in the context of climate change\u201d, and that the \u201cdiversity in needs and interests across marital status, economic status, caste, and pregnancy/lactation status etc. of women\u201d must be recognized in policy and practice. On the other hand, Khurshid Alam highlighted that in Bangladesh, women are more vulnerable to climate-related impacts due to their limited ability to cope, and they are facing more social, economic, political, informational and migration barriers. He added that food security, including intra-household food distribution, affected by climate change will \u201cexacerbate pre-existing inequalities in the society, in which women\u2019s share of household food will most likely go down\u201d. In addition, women\u2019s key role in disaster risk reduction and adaptation has not been fully recognized and appreciated, and their participation in pre-and post-disaster planning and decision-making process has often been limited or denied. There is a need to learn from, and scale up, \u201cmicro-level good practices that promote women leadership in various activities, such as economic empowerment, disaster risk reduction and political empowerment\u201d. The contributions from Ulrik Halsteen, Ohnmar Khaing and Abdul Qadir Rafiq also touched upon women issues, though not as the main focus. One contribution (Susan Wong) stressed the importance of wetland ecosystems for human well-being and future security.

Opening Message Dear Network Members, Mitigation, technology transfer and financing, together with the main subject of our previous discussions, adaptation, make up the four main building blocks of the Bali Action Plan (BAP), the process currently being negotiated under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Convention), to which all countries in the Asia-Pacific region are Parties. All of these areas are subject to contentious negotiations. These four elements also make up the obligations of all Parties to the Convention, in accordance with its principles and provisions. A brief overview of the main points of these elements would provide the scope of the discussions under this sub-theme, and clarify the context under which almost all countries in the region are considering their mitigation actions. The overarching principle governing the Convention is that of common but differentiated responsibilities that permeates each and every provision of the Convention, and determines in which context the main elements of mitigation, technology transfer and financing are discussed. The provision is found in Article 3.1 of the Convention, and is taken from Principle 7 of the Rio Principles of 1992 (UN 1992a) that explicitly lays it out as follows: States shall cooperate in a spirit of global partnership to conserve, protect and restore the health and integrity of the Earth\u2019s ecosystem. In view of the different contributions to global environmental degradation, States have common but differentiated responsibilities. The developed countries acknowledge the responsibility that they bear in the international pursuit to sustainable development in view of the pressure their societies place on the global environment and of the technologies and financial resources they command. On mitigation It is essential to keep in mind that in the light of the scientific assessment of the origins of climate change, \u2022 there are differentiated responsibilities under the Convention. Developed countries \u201ccommit themselves specifically\u201d to \u201cadopt national policies and take corresponding measures on the mitigation of climate change\u201d (Article 4.2 a). These commitments were subsequently turned into targets for developed countries in the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention, in the form of quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments. All Parties, including all developing countries, have the obligation to \u201cformulate, implement, publish and \u2022 regularly update national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change\u201d, as well as to facilitate adequate adaptation (Article 4.1 b). There are specific provisions related to the reporting, the content of the reporting, and the consideration of the national communications of Parties covering this obligation. While both have obligations to undertake mitigation and adaptation measures, only developed countries have \u2022 commitments to mitigate. Developing countries have no such commitments but must take measures to allow them to mitigate and to adapt. Financing for mitigation includes all the enabling means that would allow developing countries to reduce, control \u2022 or prevent emissions. These are: scientific, technological, technical, socio-economic and legal cooperation; research, systematic observation and development of data archives; as well as education, training and public awareness-raising, among others. On financing The developed country Parties have the obligation to \u201cprovide new and additional financial resources\u201d to \u2022 developing country Parties \u201cincluding for the transfer of technology\u201d (Article 4.3) through the financial mechanism of the Convention. They also have the obligation to \u201cassist the developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the \u2022 adverse effects of climate change in meeting costs of adaptation to those adverse effects.\u201d (Article 4.4). A definition of particularly vulnerable circumstances of countries is contained in paragraph 19 of the Preamble to the Convention, and covers all of the vulnerable situations of developing countries.

It is not development assistance, not voluntary contributions, nor aid. A financial mechanism is defined in the Convention, to \u201cfunction under the guidance of and be accountable to \u2022 the Conference of the Parties\u201d, and which \u201cshall have an equitable and balanced representation of all Parties within a transparent system of governance.\u201d (Article 11). One or more operating entities can be entrusted with the operation of the financial mechanism. The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is currently an operating entity of the financial mechanism. The GEF operates through 3 main implementing agencies, namely, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Financing can also voluntarily be channeled through \u201cbilateral, regional and other multilateral channels.\u201d (Article \u2022 11.5). These channels have been the main channels of financing for climate change activities. However, since they are not under the governance of the Parties, they are not obliged to follow the guidance on policies, programme priorities and eligibility criteria for funding that are given in the decisions of the Parties. This has resulted in problems arising from conditions placed by these institutions that are not necessarily compatible with the objective of the Convention, and the difficulty of determining whether this financing is taken away from development assistance that does not address climate change in particular, such as budgetary support. The same problems arise with the GEF that is equally under another governance, that of the GEF Council, although it does report regularly to the Parties. Financing for the preparation of national communications is at agreed full costs basis. National communications \u2022 are fundamental to taking measures leading to mitigation and adaptation actions. They consist of inventories of sources and sinks of emissions, vulnerability assessments, technical and financial barriers to implementation, and other circumstances that would allow all countries to meet their obligations under the Convention. All other financing is at the agreed full incremental costs basis. What this means at national level and in the light \u2022 of concrete experience would be an interesting part of the discussions under this sub-theme. On transfer of technology Developed country Parties have the obligation to \u201cpromote, facilitate and finance, as appropriate, the transfer \u2022 of, or access to, environmentally sound technologies and know-how\u201d particularly to developing country Parties \u201cto enable them to implement the provisions of the Convention.\u201d (Article 4.5) Therefore, transfer of technology, like financing, covers both adaptation and mitigation. It is important to note that under this provision, support should be given to \u201cthe development and enhancement \u2022 of endogenous capacities and technologies of developing country Parties.\u201d In the light of the lack of any effective transfer of technology that has taken place under the Convention, despite the annual decisions taken by the Parties on the subject and the numerous workshops and seminars that have been held, many developing countries have reported that they have undertaken mitigation measures of their own using their own resources and technologies. Contributions might wish to explore these endogenous practices on mitigation. The Convention, and Conference of the Parties (COP) decisions, provide for cooperation in the whole \u2022 spectrum of the \u201cdevelopment, application and diffusion, including transfer of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases \u2026 in all relevant sectors, including the energy, transport, industry, agriculture, forestry, and waste management sectors.\u201d (Article 4.1 c). The key to the balance of common but differentiated responsibilities, which clearly lays out the linkages of these three elements of this sub-theme, is found in Article 4.7 of the Convention which states that:\u201cThe extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and will take fully into account that economic and social development and poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the development country Parties.\u201d CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 179 Contributions on specific country experiences on mitigation, technology transfer and financing, lessons learned that can be shared, and reflections on further areas of concrete action that can be taken given the difficulties in implementation, would greatly enhance our discussions. Innovative ideas that could allow equitable sharing of the remaining environmental and developmental space to address climate change are very much welcome. I am looking forward to a very interesting exchange under this sub-theme.

Online Discussion Massimo Tavoni wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Bernarditas Muller): Massimo Tavoni focuses on the crucial role of technological progress, in particular research and development (R&D) for innovation, in achieving the stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere to address climate change. Such progress would require \u201cincrease in, and reallocation of, the financial resources channeled into energy-related R&D\u201d, extending to demonstration, deployment and diffusion of technology. This would reduce costs of available technologies, expand the pool of existing ones, and enhance their mitigation potential. However, in the light of the decline in energy-related expenditures, other measures could be explored that may include carbon pricing and R&D-specific policies, although these alone would not be sufficient. The contributor concludes that \u201cR&D focusing on major technological breakthroughs could significantly reduce future mitigation costs and would give a far greater role to induced technological change in containing such costs\u201d. Moreover, external costs of GHG emissions should be internalized into traditional technologies to stimulate \u201csustained increase in R&D investment needed to develop advanced technologies\u201d, to overcome market penetration time lags, and to obtain more cost-effective responses to fossil fuel-based energy production. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 180 Dear Network Members, The role of technology innovation in achieving climate stabilization (*) Any policy framework to address climate change would not be effective unless it manages to foster substantial research and development (R&D), innovation and diffusion of low carbon technologies. Technological progress will be needed both to reduce the cost of available technologies which in many key emitting areas remains significantly more expensive than the fossil fuel-based technologies they could potentially displace, and to expand the pool of available technologies and their mitigation potential (Anderson 2006; IEA 2008). Given the many constraints that separate us from a low carbon energy system, a broad portfolio of technological options will probably have to be involved in mitigating climate change (see for example Pacala and Socolow 2004). Speeding up the emergence and deployment of low carbon technologies will ultimately require increase in, and reallocation of, the financial resources channeled into energy-related R&D, at all stages of the development process, from R&D upstream to demonstration, deployment, and ultimately diffusion. This is important because empirical evidence suggests that most emerging low carbon energy technologies are subject to sizeable \u201clearning effects\u201d. Thus, significant technology deployment costs may have to be incurred before low carbon technologies can become competitive at market prices. However, energy-related R&D expenditure across the developed countries has declined dramatically since its peak in the early 1980s, and its share in overall private R&D spending is low compared with other sectors.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "af46a1f1-e28e-4749-915d-7a6711d0176a": {"__data__": {"id_": "af46a1f1-e28e-4749-915d-7a6711d0176a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3abef7d3aefbf10d75cfbe9eb03c7f817c0d56b8ff328369fd43e2f3315505a3"}, "2": {"node_id": "b262a749-c79a-4b30-9b0f-0979b161ed32", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cabd5133602a2526dc7838a26495c32fd6ca7705435502c6d9a087bae93962c"}}, "hash": "215ea44567505286b197f41fd88dc4f039b06ff535ab70a0e1ba165a102cdb0b", "text": "Various types of public policies may correct this and influence the rate and direction of technological change, including carbon pricing, R&D policies and subsidies to the deployment of existing technologies.

K.M. Sarma points out, however, that in practice \u201cfewer problems were encountered\u201d \u201cthan were put forth in theory\u201d. He also correctly observes that technology transfer in the climate change context might be more complex, due to the need for government regulation to encourage the development of technology. The protection given to the technology producer \u201cthat has benefited from public funding at the development stage\u201d has resulted in a bias against transfer of technology to developing countries. The contributor ends by citing the need for a technology transfer mechanism and listing areas where the Montreal Protocol model could provide positive lessons for transfer of technology in climate change.

These include lack of resources; poor infrastructure and utilities; inadequate/poorly implemented laws and regulations; shortage of trained technical and managerial personnel; cumbersome government and banking agencies; weak local supporting industry; high cost of certain technology agreements and inappropriateness of technology transferred; overall political and macroeconomic instability in some countries; problems at the international implementing and financing agency level due to unnecessary procedures and problems created by suppliers of equipment.

Intellectual property protection rules kept some countries from using specific process technologies to manufacture particular alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. In two cases where intellectual property considerations constituted significant barriers to technology transfer, developing country enterprises developed their own processes to avoid paying licensing fees or accepting conditions they considered to be unacceptable. This issue may be more complicated for climate change. The economics of renewable energy often requires government regulation if the technology is to be developed (e.g., a feed-in law requiring that a portion of the electricity on a grid be supplied from renewable sources). Developed country governments are likely to seek to ensure that national manufacturers are favoured in the process of licensing technology that has benefited from public funding at the development stage. This builds a bias against developing nations. It is possible to eliminate this bias if developed countries will agree to forego their national favouritism in licensing publicly funded inventions, at least with respect to technologies of global environmental importance. This would be similar to the \u201chumanitarian clauses\u201d being considered in the medical and nutritional areas. It would be far better to go even further-for developed countries to commit themselves to devote a portion of their technology development to the special needs of developing countries, and to ensure that developing country firms have the opportunity to participate in the efforts. Need for an active Technology Transfer Mechanism (TTM) The present mechanisms are diffused, without coordination and directionless without goals (GEF, World Bank, Regional Multilateral Banks, many UN organizations, many bilateral aid organizations, non-governmental organizations etc.). The Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have not been successful over the past fifteen years in agreeing on the basic parameters of the TTM or in coordinating these many sources of finance for technology transfer. There is an urgent need to have a working TTM for the climate treaties. What are its elements? (a) A prior agreement on costs that will be met by the TTM: An \u2018indicative list of incremental costs\u2019 in line with that approved by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol when they approved their financial mechanism in 1990 is needed for the climate agreements. Will they be grants or loans? What terms? On the \u201cMontreal Protocol Pattern\u201d these could be for: \u2022 Institutional strengthening: A country focal point for climate change is essential to develop and implement country programmes in developing countries. \u2022 Networks for knowledge sharing: Networks of such focal points would promote exchange of knowledge and experience, mutual assistance, and competitive spirit to achieve the goals. \u2022 Preparation of country programmes: Country programmes prepared by the countries themselves, setting short-and long-term specific voluntary goals tailored to individual countries, is an essential ingredient for success. The periodical replenishment of funds to the TTM can be calculated only if such goals are set. Awareness and training of decision makers \u2022 \u2022 Establishment of appropriate regulations and policies: Countries could formulate regulations and policies for regulation of energy markets, environmental regulations, energy efficiency standards, and energy and emission taxes etc. \u2022 Licensing fees of alternative technologies: The technologies in public domain or in an oligopoly situation will cost only reasonable resources. Technologies owned by only a few companies, protected by intellectual CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 183 property rights (IPR) and owners either unwilling to transfer their technologies at any cost or put a large cost and unreasonable conditions for transfer, will pose greater problems. Some relaxation of the current IPR rules will be necessary, on a case-by-case basis in the interest of climate protection and achievement of goals. Sometimes, if we wait for a few years, more companies would develop the same technologies and the prices would quickly come down. Also, the developing countries can develop such technologies themselves. \u2022 Incremental capital and operating costs: These costs have been included as grants in the Montreal Protocol since it is known they will be small and for a limited time. Will they be included under climate change? This is a matter for negotiation. (b) Clarity is needed on which countries will receive assistance for what activities on what terms: The Non- Annex 1 list in climate agreements also includes some rich countries. The Montreal Protocol list of developing countries also contains some rich countries but these have been treated as ineligible for receipt of the Protocol\u2019s Multilateral Fund (MLF) grants by specifying that only developing countries consuming ozone-depleting substances per capita less than the limits set in Article 5 of the Montreal", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbb008ac-8116-4bb0-b40e-416eb1daf02a": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbb008ac-8116-4bb0-b40e-416eb1daf02a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "304879b1c2f369df62c86e437e58863fc998f9b2fed00ca5631ef48c1111fa86"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c6fc79e-b015-4e48-8599-3661cf699ca8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4029b1d73ef04c84b54e708340fb642d422d325b7d139ab832b82a2c4f9ee907"}}, "hash": "ea426f5bcec3654aad1b2cbf4fecd172f6dd10f7cd8a8cdd94ea13f9fbd66204", "text": "Protocol (UNEP Ozone Secretariat 2009) can receive the assistance. Some such rule is needed in the climate agreements. (c) A single-window facility: At present the donor money for climate change flows through many agencies like GEF, Bilateral Aid Agencies, UN organizations etc. The activities are dispersed, uncoordinated and with no long term goals. The TTM has to be the focal organization through which all the programmes of all the agencies pass through. (d) Assured periodical replenishment of the TTM: The final costs of TTM to achieve country goals as agreed to by the TTM Board will not be known and can only be refined as the activities go along. So there is no use to fix the size of the fund now. The donors have to agree to fund the TTM periodically to meet its requirements till the agreed country goals are achieved. The contributions by the donors can be in an agreed ratio (such as the UN scales of contribution). (e) Independent technical advice: The Subsidiary Body of Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) of UNFCCC consists of government delegates and cannot give high-level detailed technical advice. The advice from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is only once in 5 years. What UNFCCC needs is an independent body, modelled after the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) of the Montreal Protocol to help countries set their goals through frequent reporting on climate-safe technologies. Their reports will be tabled before the Parties as they are without any change. The Parties and TTM can make use of these reports for finalizing the projects and activities. (f) Administration of the TTM: The TTM has to be administered in such away as to inspire the confidence of all the Parties in its functioning. The MLF is a good example. It is administered through an Executive Committee consisting of equal number of representatives of donors as well as recipients. The decisions are through a consensus or through a double majority of both the groups. With best regards, K.

Here I would like to share with you the efforts of China in mitigating desertification and its implications for improving local livelihoods and promoting economic development and poverty reduction, and for mitigating global climate change. China is one of the countries most severely impacted by desertification, as 37.2 per cent of the country\u2019s territory- some 3.57 million km2 - is classified as drylands (which include hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid and semi-humid arid areas). Of the drylands, 2.64 million km2 falls under the category of desertified land in accordance with the definition of the UNCCD, and these desertified lands are distributed in 18 provinces and account for 27.5 per cent of the country\u2019s landmass. China\u2019s desertified lands can be largely attributed to wind erosion, water erosion, salinization, and freezing- thawing processes. Over 400 million residents are affected by desertification, and the annual direct economic losses exceed 64 billion yuan (*) (Ci and Wu 1997; Zhu 2006; Lu and Wu 2002). China\u2019s desertification mitigation efforts began in the late 1950s. Through a number of high - profile programmes, such as the Three - North Shelterbelt Development Programme initiated in 1978, the National Programme on Combating Desertification initiated in 1990, the Sandification Control Programme for Areas in the Vicinity of Beijing and Tianjin launched in 2000, and the Conversion of Croplands to Forests and Grasslands Programme (Grain for Green) initiated in 2000, the Government of China has poured, on average, 0.024 per cent of the country\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP) into desertification mitigation efforts. As a result, some 20 per cent of the desertified lands have been brought under control. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 185 Approximately 50\u00d7104 km2 of the existing desertified lands are considered restorable given the current technology. When the potential desertification increments induced by climate change are taken into account, the overall area of desertification that is subject to restoration and mitigation in the future planning horizon is projected to range from 55\u00d7104 to 100\u00d7104 km2. With the approximate restoration rate of 1.5\u00d7104 to 2.2\u00d7104 km2 per annum, China\u2019s anti- desertification battle is expected to last between 45 - 70 years. The current strategic plans set restoration targets at 22\u00d7104 km2 by 2015, with an additional 33\u00d7104 km2 by 2030, and the final 45\u00d7104 km2 of the 100\u00d7104 km2 restored by 2050. The plans also specify a number of cross-cutting strategies to integrate rehabilitation of vegetation and planting for the improvement of local livelihoods and promotion of economic development and poverty reduction. The mitigation approaches are required to reflect local conditions and to combine prevention, restoration and utilization. On the basis of an examination of state investment in mitigation and current rehabilitation strategies, the following suggestions are made on required institutional arrangements and policymaking for future anti-desertification efforts: (1) expanding the previous sectoral perspective to embrace a multi-stakeholder approach; (2) setting priority zones within the restorable area, and establishing National Special Eco-Zones (e.g., forest farms, protected areas, and headwater areas); (3) restructuring the state anti-desertification investment portfolio by changing the government direct investment in tree plantations to government acquisition of planted/greened areas; and (4) introducing preferential policies in favour of combating sandy-desertification, such as permitting land tenures for up to 70 years and compensating for ecological services (Lu et al. 2004). All the above mitigating desertification efforts would undoubtedly have significant implications for mitigating global climate change. Our current research is also focusing on the quantification of the carbon sink as a result of the above efforts.

There are existing technologies that are being used and investments to be made in future technologies, but there is a need to overcome technological constraints through improvements in energy infrastructure, development innovation and technological capacity. It must also be ensured that a low-carbon development pathway would support human development. While significant investments are needed for the \u201cacquisition of new technologies, their dissemination, and research and development components\u201d, a holistic approach integrating these four elements would likely result in long-term co-benefits such as \u201ca healthier population, green jobs creation, more sustainable cities, and economic stimulus.\u201d Dear Network Members, The role of technology in China\u2019s low-carbon future (*) The China National Human Development Report (NHDR) 2009-10 China and a Sustainable Future: Towards a Low Carbon Economy and Society concludes that China has made great achievements in human development in the last three decades, but is now at a crossroads where there is a need to decouple human development from high growth rates, and to make growth more oriented around quality and efficiency. Our commentary is based on the point of view that from a long-term perspective, and given the negative impacts of China\u2019s unsustainable growth model at present, a low-carbon economy and society is the only choice for promoting human development. Technology is one important determinant in this transition and the China NHDR 2009-10 emphasizes that technology options and their emissions reductions potential will influence the extent to which development pathway China will take. The development of a low-carbon economy and society will also likely bring about considerable co-benefits for the Chinese people. Development towards a low-carbon economy will require progress on four interrelated fronts: people, cities, technologies and markets. People are central as consumers, producers and agents of change. Sustainable cities development and urbanization will determine the degree to which an increasingly large share of the Chinese population leads sustainable, low-carbon lives. Cities could even be observed as possible \u201csolutions to greenhouse gas emissions\u201d as \u201cwell-planned, well-managed cities can play a central role in helping to mitigate climate change\u201d (Dodman 2009). Technologies are drivers necessary to achieve emission reductions and to shift the development to a low-carbon path. Finally, markets are critical to the dissemination and commercialization of low-carbon technologies. Here, we focus on how technology will play a major role in the transition to a low-carbon economy and society. Substantial innovation is direly needed. However, some technologies already exist that can make a substantial impact on emissions reduction, and create incentives for the next wave of necessary technological advances. Investing in advanced technologies now could avoid lock-in effects in the energy sector and in physical infrastructure in general (CCICED 2009). China has become a leader in renewable energy technologies, but still faces technological constraints in other areas. It will need to eliminate outdated production capacities, adopt efficient energy-saving technologies, improve the energy infrastructure, make major efforts to develop renewable energies, strengthen innovation and technological capacities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d6fd50d-ebe7-4843-a812-80e166e3f70f": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d6fd50d-ebe7-4843-a812-80e166e3f70f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76aac9c261dd535b31c353364804170b531328667b9c4ba0cfaef57ecad24c63"}, "2": {"node_id": "c939b440-bdad-4bd0-b58c-b26de9165ac6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7fac746d46d390de07735dc392c10bda6f38dd9b4cf00b237da38c314ea61265"}}, "hash": "1f45f7158cad9acbc5683d6c50151bc059065b9cdefc58a896d652592cebd99d", "text": "At the same time, China needs to ensure that the shift to a low-carbon development path is carried out not at the expense of human development, but in support of it.

China will be able to build a harmonious, energy-saving, and environmentally friendly society that also advances human development, helping to increase equitable growth as well as reducing the vulnerability of different groups, including women, as residents of low-income regions. The extent to which China is able to achieve low-carbon development will depend on how its people, cities, technologies and markets will be integrated into one process. China needs to strengthen its capacity for innovation, which remains limited for a variety of reasons. Acquisition of new technologies, their dissemination, and research and development (R&D) components involve significant upfront investments and high operating costs for the Chinese Government, but in the long run, co-benefits will likely include a healthier population, green jobs creation, more sustainable cities, and economic stimulus.

Turning to carbon tariffs, such as those envisaged in the United States\u2019 proposed legislation, the American Power Act, the contributor believes that its provisions would have significant implications on Asia exports, especially those of China, and in fact could constitute a means of \u201carbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination\u201d or a \u201cdisguised restriction on international trade\u201d, and could be challenged under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. The third area would be \u201crare earth\u201d export restrictions, referring to minerals that are used in renewable and alternative energy production. China holds the world\u2019s largest reserves of these minerals and controls \u201c97 per cent of the world market\u201d in them. China plans to restrict exports of these minerals as finite sources, raising concerns over the future of clean energy development. Such a move would likewise give rise to conflicts under WTO rules, if these measures are not accompanied by restrictions on domestic production and consumption of these minerals. Dear Network Members, Trade and climate change The 2007 UN Climate Change Conference in Bali saw the first ever high-level meeting of global Trade Ministers on the topic of climate change, convened to discuss synergies and potential conflicts between trade and climate change regimes. Since then many important issues have emerged, with particular relevance to Asia, given its centrality to world trade, heavy reliance of Asia on export-oriented growth, and the carbon intensity of its export-industries. Fossil Fuel Subsidies: Domestic subsidies to the fossil fuel sector serve as a major barrier in Asia and globally to expanding the commercialization and trade in low-carbon technologies. While Governments forge ahead with new investments into clean energy with one hand, they continue to provide large subsidies to the fossil fuel sector with the other, thereby limiting the cost competitiveness and global market penetration of clean technologies. Current fossil fuel subsidies may be as much as US$500 billion/year globally, or about 1 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP) (IISD 2009). This also happens to be the amount of climate change financing called for by the Stern Report to keep temperatures from increasing beyond 2oC. The G20 Pittsburg Summit in September 2009 brought this to the forefront of global decision-making for the first time. Heads of State recognized that \u201cinefficient fossil fuel subsidies encourage wasteful consumption, distort markets, impede investment in clean energy sources and undermine efforts to deal with climate change\u201d and pledged to \u201crationalize and phase out over the medium term inefficient fossil fuel subsidies that encourage wasteful consumption\u201d (The Pittsburgh Summit 2009). Alongside targets for emission reductions and clean technology expansion under the Bali Action Plan, the G20 process will be critical for achieving climate mitigation goals. A key step in this process will be the detailed policy proposals to be tabled at the G20 Summit in Canada, 26-27 June 2010, including those by developing country members of the G20 such as China, India, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 189 Carbon Tariffs: On 12 May 2010, the draft American Power Act (known as the Lieberman-Warner bill) was released in the US Senate for deliberation. In addition to its focus on reducing US emissions through a cap-and-trade scheme, it also has important implications for Asia through measures that seek to prevent \u201ceconomic competitors from exploiting the American market if they shirk their responsibility to minimize carbon pollution\u201d (Kerry et al. 2009). Under the draft law, US importers would be required to purchase emission allowances for carbon-intensive imports, unless they come from a country that (i) has a comparable emission reduction policy in place, (ii) is a least developed country, or (iii) emits a minimal share of global emissions (Lo 2009). The American Power Act could have significant consequences for exports from Asia. In China, for example, upwards of 33 per cent of carbon emissions are from export industries, 27 percent of whose products are destined for the US (Ibon Foundation 2009). If the bill passes into law with its import restrictions retained, it could well be challenged through the World Trade Organization (WTO) as \u201carbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination\u201d, a \u201cdisguised restriction on international trade\u201d or failing to be the \u201cleast trade-restrictive measure\u201d to achieve legislative goals.

As recognized in 1992 by the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, \u201cthe Middle East has oil, but China has rare earth\u201d (Baotou National Rare Earth Hi-Tech Industrial Development Zone n.d.). However, with a global surge in demand for clean energy technology, and rare earth materials in turn, China\u2019s reserves could be exhausted in 20 to 30 years (Korinek and Kim 2010). According to the current draft of China\u2019s Rare Earth Development Plan (2009-2015) China intends to restrict export of rare earths, which has in turn caused concerns around the world for the sustainability of trends in clean energy development (MIIT 2009). As expressed on 17 March 2010 in the US Senate\u2019s first-ever session on \u201cRare Earth Minerals and the 21st Century\u201d, export restrictions could create an unfair advantage for China\u2019s clean energy industry (Correy 2010). China has held firm that the goal of its policy is to conserve \u2018exhaustible natural resources\u2019, which under WTO rules is valid only if done \u201cin conjunction with restrictions on domestic production or consumption\u201d (Korinek and Kim 2010). In 2009, the US, EU and Mexico initiated a WTO case against China over similar export restraints for other types of raw materials. The outcome of that process and growing global concern over rare earth scarcity will shape not only the future of China\u2019s export policy but possibly also global strategies for climate change mitigation and technology.

The Summit was hosted by the Ministry of the Environment of the Lagos State Government, Nigeria, under the leadership of the Hon. Commissioner for the Environment, Dr Muiz Adeyemi Banire, and the Governor of Lagos State, His Excellency Mr Babatunde Raji Fashola. The first day of the Summit was devoted to the Governors\u2019 Session, in which the Governors of seven states (Lagos, Kaduna, Borno, Niger, Ondo, Abia and Edo) were invited to a panel discussion. They spoke on the efforts and the progress made in their respective states relating to environmental protection and addressing climate change. The panel session was moderated by Brent Sadler, international correspondent of CNN and broadcasted live on Lagos television. We heard from the governors of various environmental problems in their respective states, such as deforestation; desertification; gas flaring from oil extraction platforms; pollution; coastal erosion; etc. These are the same environmental problems that have been encountered by many developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and thus there is much to learn from African experiences, and vice versa. The Governors panel discussion must be the first of its kind in Africa. All governors commented that they could do more to enhance the environmental sustainability of their states, including the need to raise public awareness. The next three days were technical sessions that covered topics ranging from adaptation to climate change, including financing and sharing of good practice; United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)/Lagos State study on vulnerability assessment and adaptation strategy; mitigation strategy for a low-carbon economy; financing for climate change mitigation activities; partnerships and collaboration for addressing climate change shipwreck and coastal erosion; Lagos State and World Health Organization (WHO) Partnership; to climate change negotiations: post-Copenhagen and Mexico 2010. The sessions were lively from the beginning to the end. Each expert presentation was followed by many questions and comments from the participants. The estimated number of participants was about 1,200, including a large number of young people. A number of expert presentations have proposed ways to mitigate climate change, including the changes in lifestyles so as to prevent over-consumption, which has profound implications for greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, sustainable consumption is one of the most cost-effective ways to mitigate climate change. On the final day of the Summit, the hosts kindly organized a group tour for the participants in the afternoon. During the shuttle between the three sites that we visited, including a solid waste collection site and an organic waste disposal site, we passed by quite a few poor areas, including very crowded local markets, where poor people are striving to make a living and running their small businesses. \u201cThese are low-class areas\u201d, commented one official who accompanied us in the field trip. All of a sudden, the comments on \u201cchanges in lifestyles\u201d made by the experts at the Summit echoed loudly in my ears.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "53a0b911-2bea-4487-ae3b-e8d95400b76c": {"__data__": {"id_": "53a0b911-2bea-4487-ae3b-e8d95400b76c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b8205b6b820920251c74e6e394c7ee85f2b4aa1ea10f9733be91867b6568083"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c79800e-39ca-4dd4-83c8-314ae4f762c3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/e-discussion-climate-change-and-human-development", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c2102f17c1f84e364e928126495712761b3ff99f06a136b76e56416568a076a"}}, "hash": "b8c5f2a04f837fc778670cbc75ad7f4ec79c4166c23b57b1909ac40aa6d06749", "text": "Looking at the poor living conditions of the people in these \u201clow-class areas\u201d, I wondered whether it would be fair for us to request or demand that these poor people change their consumption lifestyles, given that they are trying to make ends meet, and they really do not have much money to spend and consume.

The data also reflect the inequality in consumption between developed and developing/least developed countries: 25.2 per cent (1.374 billion people) of the population of developing countries were living in extreme poverty in \u2022 2005 (i.e., less than 2005 Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) US$1.25 a day, which is the new international poverty line based on new measurements). In sub-Sahara Africa, 50.9 per cent (388 million) of the population in 2005 were living below this poverty line, while it was 40.3 per cent (596 million) in South Asia, and 16.8 per cent CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 192 (316 million) in East Asia and the Pacific. China had notably and significantly reduced its extreme poverty from 84.0 per cent (835 million) in 1981 to 15.9 per cent (208 million) in 2005. While the proportion of extreme poverty in sub-Sahara slightly reduced from 53.4 per cent in 1981 to 50.9 per cent in 2005, its actual number almost doubled from 212 million in 1981 to 388 million in 2005. In South Asia, the actual number of extreme poverty increased from 548 million in 1981 to 596 million in 2005, though its proportion decreased from 59.4 per cent to 40.3 per cent. The same is the case in India, the actual number of extreme poverty increased from 420 million in 1981 to 456 million in 2005, though its proportion decreased from 59.8 per cent to 41.6 per cent (World Bank 2008, Table 3: Regional poverty estimates; also see World Bank 2010); If we use the median poverty line of 2005 PPP US$2.00 a day as a reference, then the poverty figures almost \u2022 doubled (47.0 per cent or 2.564 billion of the population of developing countries were living below this poverty line). In sub-Sahara Africa, 72.9 per cent (556 million) of the population in 2005 were living below 2005 PPP US$2.00 a day, while it was 73.9 per cent (1,092 million) in South Asia, and 38.7 per cent (729 million) in East Asia and the Pacific, largely due to the significant decrease in China from 97.8 per cent (972 million) in 1981 to 36.3 per cent (474 million) in 2005. While sub-Sahara slightly reduced the proportion of its poverty from 73.8 per cent in 1981 to 72.9 per cent in 2005, its actual number almost doubled from 294 million in 1981 to 556 million in 2005. In South Asia, the actual number of people living on less than 2005 PPP US$2.00 a day increased from 799 million in 1981 to 1,092 million in 2005, though its proportion decreased from 86.5 per cent to 73.9 per cent. In India, there was a similar trend. The actual number of people living on less than 2005 PPP US$2.00 a day increased from 609 million in 1981 to 828 million in 2005, though its proportion decreased from 86.6 per cent to 75.6 per cent (World Bank 2008, Table 3: Regional poverty estimates; also see World Bank 2010). The \u201cglobal inequalities\u201d in private consumption can be highlighted by the following figures. In 2000, 11.6 per cent of the world\u2019s population in North America and Western Europe accounted for 60.2 per cent of private consumption expenditures, while 22.4 per cent of the world\u2019s population in South Asia and 10.9 per cent of the world population in sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 2.0 per cent and 1.2 per cent of private consumption expenditures, respectively (Gardner et al. 2004, Table 1-1, page 6). The above disparities seem to have widened since 2000. Based on the Development Indicators 2005 data, Shah (2010) found that \u201cIn 2005, the wealthiest 20% of the world accounted for 76.6% of total private consumption.

Keith Openshaw wrote: Facilitator\u2019s note (Bernarditas Muller): In identifying four dominant factors that impact negatively on the habitat and on climate, Keith Openshaw argues that the fourth, rising population growth, exacerbates the other three factors of increased use for resources to meet basic needs, the push for better living standards, and the use of non-renewable sources of energy, in particular fossil fuels. Citing studies showing population growth increase, he states that it is this growth in population, coupled with the increase in wealth that it needs that is putting more pressures on the world\u2019s resource base and at the same time, places more people at heightened risk of disasters from natural and man-made causes. In absolute terms, he claims that the largest population increase is in Asia and the Pacific region. Comparing projected population growth as a result of population policies among various countries in Asia, those of China and India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, and in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia in South-East Asia, the contributor demonstrates that more development takes place in countries where population growth is controlled. He also adds that more resources could then be freed for use in mitigation and education. Dear Network Members, Population growth, resource use and climate change mitigation Four dominant factors that have a negative impact on the habitat and climate are: the (over)use of resources to satisfy the need for basic necessities; the push to increase living standards; the use of non-renewable resources, especially fossil fuels; and the expanding population that is exacerbating the above three factors and increasing the human population on existing areas and expanding their presence into areas that are fragile and/or critical to maintain biodiversity. The recently concluded third UN Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-3) says that some ecosystems may soon reach \u201ctipping points\u201d where they rapidly become less useful to humanity (Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity 2010). The Earth\u2019s ongoing nature losses may soon begin to hit national economies, the report has warned.

There are technical solutions available to mitigate disasters, but in many instances the finances are not adequate and the increase in population exacerbates the problems. Thus, natural disasters like the earthquake in Haiti, which devastated a population that was living on the country\u2019s margins, had made it dependent on external aid. The high population density in that country and the havoc the earthquake wreaked is an example what could occur when man- made interventions and climate change consequences have adverse effects. More and more people are occupying fragile land areas such as steep slopes, areas prone to drought or flooding and low-lying areas in danger of being inundated by brackish water. Already, this year, there had been mud slides in the Philippines, inundations in Bangladesh and an earthquake in Sumatra: these had resulted in loss of life and the displacement of people. Perhaps billions of dollars are needed each year to tackle the risks of climate-related disasters, but governments priorities may be focused on providing essential services such as schools, hospitals/clinics, roads etc. for the existing and ever increasing population. Many of these services may be inadequate to meet the dangers from disasters! It is interesting to compare the actual and forecasted increase in population of various countries that have different population policies. First, Table 2 examines the population projections of India and China from 1990 to 2050. At present, China has an aggressive population policy with a target of one child per family in urban areas and two in rural areas, whereas India does not have such a policy. In India, it is hoped that through education and increase in wealth the increase will tail off. Table 2.

If India had an aggressive population policy as in China, then between 2010 and 2050, the population could be an estimated 1.4 billion by 2030, assuming the average annual population growth rate is 0.7 per cent and 1.5 billion in 2050, assuming a growth rate of 0.35 per cent. With such an estimated decrease in population of over 100 million, the CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 195 Indian government would have more money to spend on education and climate mitigation. In addition, any decrease in India\u2019s population would mean a decrease in resources consumption and production, and hence a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, there are concerns about the present policies both in China and India. According to the Leader in the Economist (2010), the number of males surviving to the age of one is much more than it should be (120 boys per 100 girls). In both societies, boys are favoured and some girls are aborted or neglected at birth. This is or will create problems for the present under-25 population. Education, especially valuing girls as much as boys, has to be fostered at the highest level. Table 3 looks at the past, present and forecasted population in three countries with different social backgrounds, namely Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia.

Source: UN Population Division 2010 and author\u2019s estimates. In 1990, the population of Pakistan and Bangladesh were very similar, at about 116 million in each country. However, by 2050, according to the UN Population Division, the population of Pakistan may increase to 335 million, whereas that of Bangladesh is estimated to be 222 million, some 113 million less! It seems that Bangladesh has a much more active population programme than Pakistan. Population density is also a driving factor in Bangladesh. Thus, it can be seen that the population policy of governments can help or hinder climate mitigation. Again, increasing temperature may adversely affect food production and considerable effort and funds may have to be spent on breeding and cultivating, for example, rice to overcome the consequences of higher night-time temperatures, and crops that are brackish and drought-prone tolerant. Will funds and expertise be available to counter these climate change effects? Without such efforts, disaster relief efforts may always be too little and too late. The demand for food security will be further compounded by an increase in population.

The Facilitator notes that the UNCCD, as one of the three Rio Conventions on sustainable development, is closely interlinked with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), all of which have been negotiated in accordance with the Rio Principles of the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) of 1992. Dear Network Members, Climate change and desertification: The significance of mitigation policies Climate change will exacerbate desertification, which, in turn, will compound the effects of climate change. Thus, prevention and rehabilitation of land degradation and combating desertification will have profound implications for mitigating climate change. After more than 20 years of studies on the different approaches to combat desertification, rehabilitate land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought in many developing countries, both in the Asia-Pacific region and in Africa, I would like to share some information, including some good practices, on the issues. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 197 There are many useful techniques or technologies to combat desertification, rehabilitate land degradation, and mitigate the effects of drought. These include revegetation of degraded rangeland/steppe/desert steppe, reforestation of deforested lands, and transformation of deteriorated soils. These approaches include biological and botanical plantations; engineering means, such as mechanical solutions; and chemical mulching (The Secretariat of China National Committee for the Implementation of United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification 1999). Many countries have allocated special funds (e.g., national desertification funds) and aligned their national action plans (NAPs), so that they are integrated into national development strategy or five-year plan. China, India and Viet Nam have provided good examples. In terms of policy, some countries have also revised, reinforced and reorientated their national and local policies and laws/regulations relating to mitigating desertification, land degradation and drought (DLDD). Techniques and technologies: Examples from Asia-Pacific In China, desertification covers 2.64 million km2 or 27.5 per cent of China\u2019s territory (Lu et al. 2010). Desertification causes the degradation of ecological environment, induces natural disasters (e.g., dust and sandstorms), and takes a heavy toll on human livelihoods by sharply reducing the availability of arable land, lowering soil fertility, and aggravating poverty in the affected areas. In particular, it causes serious damages and drastic economic losses to communication and transportation systems, water facilities and the mining industries in the affected regions and beyond. Direct annual economic losses were estimated at more than 64 billion yuan, equivalent to about US$8 billion in 2002 (Lu and Wu 2002; see also Lu 2010). Statistics shows that approximately 400 million people, or 30.7 per cent of China\u2019s population, are directly and indirectly affected by desertification, resulting in a considerable number of \u201cenvironmental refugees\u201d and \u201cdisaster migrants\u201d in severely affected provinces (Lu et al. 2010). In India, a series of useful techniques have been developed to control land degradation in Rajasthan by both academic and technical development institutions. For instance, the research and experiments on soil fertility, rehabilitation and management of degraded lands, water and watershed management, crop management practices, agro-horticulture system, pasture and silvo-pasture system and microclimate have harvested great successes in mitigating the DLDD issues in the affected areas of the country. In Viet Nam, a priority area is the rehabilitation of degraded lands through establishment of major forestry programmes, including forest protection and conservation, afforestation projects, sustainable forest management, and poverty alleviation and forest resources management. Since the late 1980s, the Vietnamese government has promulgated the establishment of 11 national parks, 49 national conservation zones, 29 historic, cultural and environmental vestige zones with a total area of 1.169 million hectares (ha) (about 3.3 per cent of total land area of the country) (Nguyen 2001).

These include: financial, technical, administrative and organizational policy frameworks; institutional capacity-building in various sectors, including planning, performance and governance; awareness raising; legislation and law reinforcement. Sustainable policy in tenure system would enable villagers, officials and local community to implement projects, or carry out activities to combat desertification, rehabilitate land degradation and mitigate the effects of drought. CONTENTS E-Discussion on Climate Change and Human Development 198 The following special policies may be developed to benefit both people\u2019s livelihoods and the environment: Free taxation for (i) agricultural products, especially in the affected regions; and (ii) preservation and development \u2022 of wastelands. Policies on (i) free loans to grass-root stakeholders for revegetating degraded land from both central and local \u2022 governments; (ii) land ownership and land use right in rural areas; (iii) land care contract between users and governors; (iv) farmland protection and ecological service payment; (v) provision of incentives for encouraging advanced land users at rural community level; (vi) volunteer plantation in desertification-prone regions; (vii) land contract for enterprises to manage and develop the affected lands; (viii) wasteland auction for tourism and industry development; (ix) rewarding champions of land managers and land governors. Preferential policy to enable women and youth to enjoy land tenure in rural and affected regions. \u2022 Administrative decisions on internal coordination and collaboration among policymakers, planners and \u2022 governmental agencies. The following are two good examples in mitigating DLDD in developing countries in Asia-Pacific: China: \u201cGrain for Green\u201d is a state-run national project that has been financed by China\u2019s central government since 1999. It is estimated that 9.0498 million ha of rejected farmland have been replanted and/or revegetated, 12.6213 million ha of barren mountain or hilly lands have been revegetated, and 1.2565 million ha of mountain slope lands were reserved for new plantations. Totally, 120.242 billion yuan (1 US$=7.28 yuan in 2007. 1 US$=6.82 yuan in May 2010) have been allocated to the beneficiary households and 13.928 billion yuan (US$1.913 billion, at exchange rate 1 US$=7.28 yuan in 2007) have been provided to grass-root level stakeholders as the livelihood subsidiary payment at the project sites (State Forestry Administration 2007). A State Law on Combating Desertification was endorsed by the National Congress and came into force in 2001. Viet Nam: On 2 May 2007, the Prime Minister of Viet Nam issued the Viet Nam Forestry Development Strategy 2006- 2020. It is reported that due to unsustainable management and a very high need for conversion of forest land and for forest products for socio-economic development, the forest area and forest quality in Viet Nam have continuously decreased over the years (Government of Viet Nam 2007). From 1995 to 2005, a series of approaches have been adopted to reforest the deforested lands and the forest area had increased from 9.3 million ha in 1995 to 11.31 million ha in 2000, and to 12.61 million ha in 2005. It is certain that more achievements will be accomplished with the effective implementation of this 15-year Strategy, including through the rapid regeneration of natural forests zoned for protection (Government of Viet Nam 2007). In conclusion, any suitable techniques, sound technologies, good practices and optimum approaches to mitigate DLDD cannot be successful if they are based on weak or impractical policies. Thus, sustainable policies are critical to the success in implementing projects, programmes or initiatives to mitigate DLDD, in both the affected developing and developed countries.
