Structural training is fully funded by the national or regional routine/recurrent budgets, while technical or managerial training is funded from the development budget, which depends largely on external funds.21 The national administration system does not yet support the assessment of skills required for organizations, nor for the classification of professional competencies for different staff positions. Many local governments lack personnel with technical skills for participatory planning. Civil service reforms remain important and are considered urgent in order to improve service delivery, enable more positive economic growth, and promote good governance.22 Presidential Decree (INPRES) No. 9/2000 on \u2018Gender Mainstreaming in the National Development Planning and Programming and its Technical Guidelines\u2019 \u2013 supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) \u2013 was passed to integrate gender equality concerns into planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of national development policies and programmes, including CD.

While it was considered a good pilot, such training is not adequate.26 No further information is available about whether such training has been continued or whether accredited training agencies such as the Badan DIKLATs (Education and Training Boards) also have gender-related CD activities.27 The enactment of Laws 22 and 25 on decentralization offered both opportunities and challenges for gender-responsive CD. Decentralization is expected to lead to transformations in local governance, including a new perspective on gender relations, deep-seated values, and relationships that are held in place by power and privilege.28 Unfortunately, however, many reports indicate that skill upgrading \u2013 including in gender-related training \u2013 has stalled in most areas,29 in part due to difficulties in tracing local CD activities within the General Allocation Budget (DAU) at district level. In part, this is because CD expenditure is considered an easily corruptible budget item. Some notable initiatives, however, are considered instructive (see boxed text below). The National Plan of Action on Anti Violence Against Women (VAW) 1999\u20132004 (Kelompok Kerja RAN PKTP) is a multi-stakeholder mechanism for eliminating violence against women in various government ministries and agencies. The RAN PKTP was developed through a series of regional and national consultations and was supported via focal points from each relevant organization as part of the accountability mechanism. The State Ministry for Women\u2019s Empowerment (MWE) \u2013 funded by CIDA\u2019s Women\u2019s Support Project and the government \u2013 co-facilitated the operational set-up of a multi-stakeholder working group to: 1) create awareness of the importance of the RAN PKTP; 2) help facilitate resource mobilization for implementing the RAN PKTP\u2019s priorities; and 3) monitor the RAN PKTP\u2019s progress.

Women Empowerment Bureaus or Units at the provincial and district level face similar issues.32 While the AusAID-funded Indonesia Australia Special Training Programme (IASTP) III is considered a successful CD programme, a former official of the project has indicated that there were some challenges in realizing gender-responsive CD.

The RPJM includes the eight of the MDGs as an overarching framework, placing human development and poverty reduction at the centre of development. The government\u2019s Work Plan (RKP) sets out annual development priorities, including quantitative targets and policy directions, which in turn provide a guide to aggregate budgetary allocations. The 2008 RKP lists eight priority areas including corruption eradication and accelerated bureaucratic reform through local CD. The Nota Keuangan, or Budget Statement 2009, pronounced that all government agencies in Indonesia must implement a performance budgeting system and a gender-responsive budget. The Budget Statement included a breakdown of the national budget, showing local CD components such as those that are allocated for various boards for training and education, or Badan DIKLAT. The Budget Statement did not provide indications on how much investment is allocated specifically to gender- responsive local CD. This summary shows that approximately $1.34 billion, or about 9 percent of the total development budget for 2009 (from both on-budget domestic funds and foreign donors), has been allocated to programmes to improve and develop the capacity of individuals and organizations through training for policy development, internships, extension work, and for improving public service delivery at the local level (see Annex 3).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "731a043f-d24e-465a-a0df-9797f3474411": {"__data__": {"id_": "731a043f-d24e-465a-a0df-9797f3474411", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "61760ad2e6a430ce0d292d2b9c8afc77329a369e47d20bd8c1dbed21555f3bb3"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cb4e417-c946-4c92-9004-f2f5a92e80a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "960933d42a99bd6e0e8efa454f882793e7dd2d4193989f37ec9e5245bbc69bb8"}}, "hash": "9d0f8054bccce25a9459cf284b9e1dd15de9c4954d16c42dd86d76ce8cbda79c", "text": "Other CD initiatives for local government staff that are being organized by the national government and supported by donors, but were not included in the Budget Statement, are as follows: \u2022\ufffd a road map and strategy for civil service reform, including clarification of organizational management; a move towards performance orientation; the introduction of merit-based practices; control of the civil service wage bill; strengthening of regional and local government administrative capacity and accountability; and the introduction of strong competency and skills-based training;33 \u2022\ufffd financial management system improvement, including fiscal transfer;34 \u2022\ufffd linking planning and budgeting; 33 Asian Development Bank, Proposed Loan to Republic of Indonesia, Development Policy Support Program, 2008. 34 About 200", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24aa9337-faa1-471c-80df-b3b1a5fc1fd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "24aa9337-faa1-471c-80df-b3b1a5fc1fd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4a322b1af0ff1f9e4e60b99df2fa713b9dfa02de8d7196d6c9e9b4826d001e4"}, "3": {"node_id": "021f541c-15af-4e7d-99ec-9f8609b42f3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5b194548c472773130623a8ac731b394c7513d2fd27a206d6a4fae7710960fcf"}}, "hash": "8ea17ce5c393905615f7749fda16700f3bcd3ec318dc47cda608b51d6347fa3b", "text": "national government officials and 400 local government officials were trained in performance and financial management by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and in 2007, 1,528 local officials were trained by the Ministry of Finance.

A Joint Official Letter of the State Minister for National Development and Minister of Home Affairs, 0259/M. OON/I/2005 \u2013 050/166/SJ, requires increased women\u2019s participation in the Musrenbang\u2019s processes (Development plan meetings). 44 So far, gender-responsive budgeting has been carried out with the support of donor organizations at the local level. 45 UNDP and the State Ministry for Women\u2019s Empowerment under UNDP SIGMA Programme, \u2018Gender Mainstreaming Assessment, Leya Cattleya (consultant), 2006. 46 UNIFEM, \u20182001 Annual Report 17\u2019, 2001. 47 The six ministries are BAPPENAS, State Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Health and Ministry of National Education. 10 experiences in applying GBS, participants recognized that GBS is an implicit gender analysis. This leads to simpler and quicker procedures than using Gender Action Plan (GAP) analysis and methods, which require the availability of sex disaggregated data that are produced by the Central Bureau of Statistics through its survey and census, and an application of rigid steps for analyzing gender equality concerns. 3.1.2. Local government investment The national government allocates, inter alia, special funds (DAK) to provincial, district and local governments, which can be spent on CD initiatives. In 2008, DAK funding made up 62 percent of the national budget, an eightfold increase over the 2003\u20132008 period. Local governments must spend a predetermined amount of the DAK on health and education, with the remaining DAK funding to be used at the local government\u2019s discretion. Some of the national funding for health and education is spent on CD, such as teacher training or facilitating the services provided at the integrated health post at the village level (posyandu). There is strong competition for the remaining funds, which are usually spent on administration, activities, research, travel and training. No data is available on the percentage of DAK grants spent on CD and/or training activities. Data from LAN indicates that there are 427 training units at the provincial and district level across Indonesia.48 These units include those that provide CD activities, mostly training, for staff from cross- sectoral institutions and technical institutions such as education, health, industry, labour, finance, police, transportation, religious affairs, agriculture and fisheries. Budget allocations come from the national and/or local government fund, which have been included in the state budget figures.49 No data is available regarding allocated budgets for these training units.

Some strategies have been identified, by donor organizations, for achieving common development objectives with Indonesia via CD activities52 \u2013 for example, through supporting Indonesia in carrying out CD assessments, facilitating partnerships to support capacity building and development strategies, providing systematic costing of capacity building, and providing monitoring and evaluation.53 There are some good models, such as the Australia Community Development and Civil Society Strengthening (ACCESS) programme.54 Since decentralization, some donors, under the coordination of GTZ, have supported the Government of Indonesia in delivering local CD. There have been four major categories of donor-supported programmes for local CD: The ADB, GTZ and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have worked on the design, refinement and consolidation of the CD regulatory framework for decentralization, the dissemination of information on regional autonomy to stakeholders, and facilitation of the cooperation between the national and regional economies, as well as on information technology. i. A group of bilateral agencies including the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Australian Government Overseas Aid Program (AusAID), GTZ and CIDA has introduced new decentralization mechanisms on performance, budgeting, minimum service standards and fiscal decentralization. ii. The World Bank, ADB and AusAID have worked on improving knowledge and skills in specific areas of local governance including participatory planning approaches, decentralized forums for improved service delivery, local accountability and CD for local facilitators. iii. UNDP, ADB and CIDA have worked on monitoring and accelerating progress toward the MDGs. No specific data is available for mapping how much investment has been made by each of these groups. Some donors such as the GTZ, ADB, CIDA, UNDP, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) and some units within the World Bank have designed and implemented gender-responsive CD for local governments. Furthermore, some bilateral donor organizations consistently promote gender equality, including CIDA, the Netherlands Embassy, AusAID, USAID and the UK Department for International Development (DFID). 52 Including the World Bank, the UN system, and bilateral agencies. 53 Government of Indonesia, UNDP, op. cit. p21. 54 ACCESS, \u2018Capacity Building Impact Evaluation Report\u2019, 2008. The ACCESS programme aims to increase the understanding of NGOs and CSOs and enhance their relationships with other development stakeholders at the district level. It currently operates in eight of the poorest target districts within four target provinces in eastern Indonesia. The programme focuses on community development, poverty alleviation, gender equality and capacity building for NGOs and CSOs. 12 For the years 2006\u20132009, donor organizations proposed a significant amount of investment with CD components for the local level. The official development assistance (ODA) figure in the \u2018Blue Book\u201955 2006\u20132009 shows $48 billion for over 100 proposed projects and programmes containing CD components, themselves valued at about $5.9 billion. Included in this $5.9 billion is about $1.3 billion for projects and programmes that include CD components with some level of gender sensitivity, gender responsiveness and women\u2019s empowerment.56 Figure 1: Percentage of CD components in proposed ODA (2006\u20132009)57 CIDA and AusAID have integrated gender equality measures into their country programmes, and have mandated that gender equality is integrated into all programme design, implementation, monitoring, review and evaluation. 55 A book published by BAPPENAS that contains a list of all proposed ODA for a certain period of time, including a list of CD activities at the local level.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e277493-33d5-4f22-9e9a-3f226a0a2123": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e277493-33d5-4f22-9e9a-3f226a0a2123", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b155f46216e3fb07edcf6e6c1157b485819faee44d8a6072572c641d04a18373"}, "2": {"node_id": "1093f109-7a99-461f-9c8a-1d5da5888aa3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b42481b06c66cb19f1df36014338167af4bf428d5480a27917bd55fd658d4a2a"}}, "hash": "f55394ecb5d8e649951d63e21e1c90e038495cb7775745c41ff9423bd2fd9446", "text": "56 These are capacity-building projects for local government on eliminating violence against women and children (State Ministry for Women\u2019s Empowerment, MWE); the establishment of a centre for the protection and empowerment of women workers in Batam (Ministry of Labour and MWE); the Capacity Building to Support Family Planning /Reproductive Health Programme in Indonesia (National Agency for Family Planning/ BKKBN); the Indonesia Water and Sanitation Policy and Action Planning Facility Phase III (Ministry of Public Works); and promoting democratic governance and strengthening human development to achieve the MDGs (both administered by BAPPENAS).

Between 1980 and 2000, there was a significant increase in ODA funding and private-sector contributions to areas related to the democratization process. Many NGOs grew at the local level to respond to the needs of more community facilitators.59 Partnerships among governments, CSOs and donors have supported this demand-driven approach to development. As in other countries, CSOs have assumed the role of champion for mainstreaming gender initiatives. With some exceptions, most efforts have been in the form of creating and implementing gender training and women\u2019s empowerment programmes. Most women\u2019s CSOs have integrated gender only in specific CD or training programmes such as on reproductive health, preventing violence against women, gender in education, and other sectors identified in the 12 critical areas of the Beijing Platform for Action. Examples of women\u2019s CSOs that can be regarded as implementers of gender responsive CD include Koalisi Perempuan that works on women\u2019s leadership and gender budgeting, and LBH APIK that works on gender responsive legal drafting. HAPSARI, a federation of independent women farmers, has carried out leadership and political training to over 600 of its active members (out of 4,000 total registered) across six provinces, gender sensitization of village officials in some districts in North Sumatra as well as providing support for improved service delivery of local government. While over 60 CSOs in Indonesia have worked on budget reform \u2013 including in participatory budgeting, revenue monitoring, expenditure tracking, budget literacy and anti corruption measures60 \u2013 less than a quarter of them have been involved in gender budgeting work. Many CSOs that have worked with local governments on GRB have used the Rencana Kerja (RENJA) work plan and terms of reference (TOR) as entry points.61 58 USAID, \u2018Taking Stock on Decentralization Implementation in Indonesia\u2019, 2007. 59 SMERU \u2013 an independent institution for research and policy studies focusing on social, economic and poverty- related problems \u2013 studied around 20,000 CSOs throughout Indonesia involved in community development, community empowerment, advocacy and litigation work. Less than 10 percent of these CSOs were in the broader agriculture sector, 5 percent of the total worked on social education and training, and 3 percent in health and education, while the rest were in the areas of population, labour and others.

The Centre for Regional Studies and Information (PATTIRO), Civic Education and Budget Transparency (CiBA) and the National Secretariat of Indonesia Forum for Budget Transparency (Seknas FITRA) are among the few CSOs pioneering the implementation of gender budgeting in Indonesia. 14 PATTIRO has provided technical assistance to mainstream gender into development planning and budgeting for local governments and CSOs in Bone District, South Sulawesi and the City of Pare-Pare. It has also educated the community on budget literacy and the budgetary planning process with a gender perspective in the district of Pekalongan and Boyolali and the city of Semarang, Central Java.

This includes off-budget sums within the $1.3 billion ODA for 2006\u20132009 programmes with gender-related local CD; and about $1 billion in allocated budget for programmes with a community driven development (CDD) approach, under the umbrella of the PNPM, or Community Empowerment Programme, in 2009, which has significant women\u2019s", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a14352-299c-450e-9197-f392d23f5159": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9a14352-299c-450e-9197-f392d23f5159", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "64b2402cf87bc7b5bfa66c782cad425036062a56ebe7543b8d04dd9ed731cfa7"}, "3": {"node_id": "ef8dc86d-6cff-40c9-967b-e8693135c68d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f69a1a11ea84690ff7aa05c73c87f1302a9b3dc74d34d6a2b877abe7a535b8a7"}}, "hash": "0f3a81fe294ac81529f948f7de28e287d51362f44885807426d3e70ba77cb0a8", "text": "empowerment activities and budgeting embodied in it. In addition, some portions of both domestic funds and foreign donor funds are allocated to key government agencies for programmes to develop capacities of individuals and organizations. This is achieved through internships, extension work, and training for policy development and for improving public service delivery at the local level. The budget includes about $1.1 million allocated by MWE for gender mainstreaming and women\u2019s empowerment-related programmes. Local government budgets also include CD, through DAK and DAU, at least in education and health. Programmes that are funded by CSOs and the private sector also include CD components. The above figures have not answered the question of whether such investments are sufficient or not, and whether they meet the demand. Rather, they represent a rough example of the huge intent to promote gender equality through local CD initiatives. In per-capita terms, there has been decreased investment in local CD since decentralization. National CD budgets have also been inefficiently utilized. Issues on the implementation and effectiveness of investment are discussed in the later pages of this report. 3.2 Good practices 3.2.1 Capacity development as part of a sustainable development framework Conceptually, a country\u2019s ability to develop sustainably depends on the capacity of its institutions and people to understand complex environmental and developmental issues so that they can make the right development choices. Local government officers are required to understand and have expertise in the issues facing their local area. At the same time, CSOs, particularly women\u2019s groups, must be mobilized to advocate for their rights to access assets, to control the formulation of service delivery, and to influence the strategic decision-making process. 15 In Indonesia, sustainable development has followed the path of community driven development (CDD), which is seen as a strategic entry point for gender-responsive local CD. The CDD programmes work with the community, involving the poor and women, using gender equality concerns as part of the programme\u2019s objectives and as a way to manage and administer the programme. Programmes that apply a CDD approach place attention on the provision of technical expertise as well as resources. Capacity development through the CDD approach is about engagement between local facilitators and the community, advocacy by local facilitators to the local government, and mentoring62 by the programme\u2019s advisors to local facilitators. These are all processes that provide opportunities for stakeholders, individuals, CSOs, local governments and programme staff to talk, practice, test, enhance and learn. Such approaches have the potential to respond to the different practical, as well as strategic, needs of the community, the poor and women, to increase women\u2019s economic activity and to ensure that they are active participants in planning and decision-making.63 Under the CDD approach, gender equality concerns are not separated from other aspects of CD. CDD\u2019s success in catering for gender-responsive CD lies in its choice of entry points, approaches, strategies and modalities, as well as the availability of resources to support the implementation of the gender and CD strategy. At the community level, it means proper facilitation processes that are gender sensitive and raise relevant gender questions to capture the different concerns of women and girls, and men and boys. This has resulted in a lowering of resistance and an increase in performance.64 The ACCESS second phase has only provided funds for organizational capacity building of NGOs.64 Activities at the community level are resourced and owned by the community, whether from the local government, village grants (ADD), or from community owned resources. ACCESS also adopts a system approach, where activities within the system work at the same time, rather than in a flow process or sequentially. These activities thus provide the basis for specifying the roles and responsibilities of all parties. By establishing CD programmes for NGOs, ACCESS starts generating pools of service providers, which will sustain the programme\u2019s ideals. Successes are achieved where the focus is on people-centered or \u2018actor-centered\u2019 CD. Many large scale CDD programmes are too oriented toward tangible products or results, and less so toward efforts to strengthen the actors. Many programmes are concerned too much with physical deliverables rather than focusing on \u2018behaviour change in actors\u2019, which will ensure sustainability.

The AusAID-funded ACCESS programme has successfully implemented CD initiatives that were developed based on Organizational Capacity Assessments (OCA). The assessment tools were introduced to key training facilitators, who then used the tools to assess 27 NGOs and 40 CSOs in the ACCESS target areas. The programme also established a set of monitoring and evaluation tools that are used by the participating CSOs. Activity reports cover a wide range of topics including achievement of goals and objectives, learning needs assessments, participation, assessment of the facilitation team, assessment of materials and methods, and mainstreaming gender. An alternative method for assessing CD is a participatory gender audit methodology introduced by the International Labour Organization (ILO),66 which includes 12 critical aspects of gender mainstreaming, including policy context, gender competence, decision-making processes, human resource development, planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluation, gender mainstreaming structure and organizations, stakeholders analysis, and organizational culture. The tools encourage the engagement of stakeholders in meaningful participatory approaches, introduce learning, and establish benchmarks.67 UNDP\u2019s Papua People-Centered Development introduced the Papua Needs Assessment (PNA) to gather baseline information for developing a CD action plan in Papua. Employing an evidence- based approach like this is considered good practice. 3.2.3 Gender strategy and action plan A gender strategy clarifies what approaches are to be taken, what activities are to be undertaken, and what indicators can be used to measure performance. As a result, progress of the CD programmes and activities, including their gender equality components, can be monitored. 65 Indonesia Australia Specialized Training Programme (IASTP III), funded by AusAID and Indonesia Australia Partnerships, \u2018Most Significant Changes\u2019; GHD Hassall; October 2008. 66 ILO carried out training on gender audit methodology, attended at both the national and local level. 67 ILO, \u2018A Manual for Facilitators: the ILO\u2019s Participatory Gender Audit Methodology\u2019, Geneva, 2007. 17 An action plan is important to encourage an environment that builds incentives for learning. The use of an action plan and monitoring is more of a learning tool than a check for compliance.6869 What constitutes a sound gender strategy? The Indonesia Australia Specialized Training Programme (IASTP) III introduced a GAP68 that was monitored regularly, with technical assistance and mentoring provided to those who needed it. The MWE benefited from having ministry staff trained as qualified facilitators for gender mainstreaming. About 80 percent of training participants have become competent trainers, and many alumni who were in Echelon 3 have been promoted to the director level (Echelon 2). Methods and techniques that were used by the alumni were also being followed and replicated by other trainers, indicating the usefulness of the training materials. Alumni of IASTP III\u2019s gender training have established networks that have increased the pool of available gender focal points in the country, which has also increased the sustainability of the programme.69 Availability of gender expertise within organizations and programme management is critical to implementation of the gender strategy. Unfortunately, these competences are not widely available among government staff, and even when donors have developed a roster of national gender experts, often the expertise is unsuitable. Even well-designed gender-responsive programmes have produced inadequate results where the programme did not invest in gender-competent resource people.70 Ideally, it is more useful and effective to have sectoral experts with gender knowledge and skills than to have gender consultants who have to work across the whole programme. Gender-aware project staff or consultants may have a greater impact on outcomes and gender training. However, it is easier to recruit consultants with experience of facilitation and gender than it is to train them in these areas.71 While challenging, having male gender experts within a gender team is considered a strategic move, to produce effective gender-responsive CD activities in areas where resistance to gender equality promotion is high.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa0d356d-2175-4f8e-bb08-a43dc76030d4": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa0d356d-2175-4f8e-bb08-a43dc76030d4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "146976e9f73dcc21137ebbb7712fe5cb6c053c3db4b3299cd657a35b8cc7f15a"}, "2": {"node_id": "537a1b69-ca60-4cf8-a99f-5d410f37d5c5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e4e714c81d4405c147d5dec51e27987093c2456ecc5912894c43ea2bbea010f"}}, "hash": "fbe4d5d9a2d4a26768042f1c7bca37fbdb531c3eada41f23fbb30995263f0d7c", "text": "Local male decision-makers have found it easier to talk about the importance of promoting gender equality in their organizations when male gender experts are present. 68 Indonesia Australia Specialized Training Programme (IASTP III), funded by AusAID and Indonesia Australia Partnerships, \u2018Most Significant Changes\u2019, GHD Hassall, October 2008. 69 Australia Indonesia Partnership; op. cit. p31.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74ea0824-43cd-4553-aa28-f7060ca21343": {"__data__": {"id_": "74ea0824-43cd-4553-aa28-f7060ca21343", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28c7c3174863b6d16dd709e10d3e65719f77e3b347d3b4f390deedfdfa5b9640"}, "3": {"node_id": "6da82dbd-339a-4a15-a7b9-93730f1b5eda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d2b5a63f238aed427030f7ad0ba5a29a13a3604979cec540498d38bb01f5d157"}}, "hash": "66e201a7e19598136fc276dadcadf616a6d5e6befed7729507f05d0cddf8c3b7", "text": "70 The researcher has done some independent completion reports on many gender-responsive CD programmes. 71 \u2018Gender Review and PNPM Strategy Formulation\u2019 \u2013 Working Paper on the Findings of Joint Donor and Government Mission, Decentralization Support Facility, Jakarta, March 2007. 18 The Indonesia Australia Partnership for Basic Education (IAPBE), funded by AusAID, has proven to be a successful programme in promoting gender equality in East Java. Here, a gender team comprised of male and female experts worked to provide various CD activities for hundreds of madrasah principals and teachers to implement school-based management, as well as for officials of district education units to be effective decentralized education catalysts. In areas where communities are considered traditional and with very strong Islamic beliefs \u2013 such as Jember, Jombang, and Gresik districts in East Java \u2013 this three-year CD programme has taken an appropriate decision to hire both females and males for its gender team. Gender equality should be integrated into the CD programme\u2019s goals. To be effective, integration of gender equality and gender-based results indicators into the CD programme objective will help to ensure that gender-related activities and interventions contribute to the overall objective. Gender should be integrated into guidelines, manuals and processes. People will respond positively to gender messages when they have the tools and procedures they need, there are incentives for them to do so, and the messages from the management are strong and consistent. Local government staff, especially those who have been involved in project activities, have a better understanding and awareness of the importance of project procedures, and of training and capacity building, than national government staff. 3.2.4 Ownership and leadership Gender-responsive local CD requires ownership and leadership. Capacity development will only be sustainable where the government prioritizes regular investment in CD, either as part of routine planning and budgeting processes, or through comprehensive assessment and review, such as strategic planning. The ADB-funded Sustainable Capacity Development for Decentralization Programme is demand- driven. A needs assessment is carried out as an integral part of the local government\u2019s strategic planning, which promotes sustainability. Local governments also develop a capacity building action plan (CBAP), within which a gender action plan is integrated. Leadership has been critical in pushing for gender-responsive CD interventions to be realized. These should be assured not only within the government jurisdiction, but also within the programme management and staff. Programme staff who \u2018walk the walk\u2019 should be considered good role models for the success of gender-responsive programmes. 19 Former State Minister for Women\u2019s Empowerment, Khofifah Indarparawansa, played a critical role in initiating gender mainstreaming within the government system. The issuance of a Presidential Decree on Gender Mainstreaming would not have happened without Khofifah\u2019s forward leadership. Many good results in gender mainstreaming initiatives, including gender- responsive CD at the provincial and district level, have been made possible by strong leaders within government units. The provincial government of Lampung and the district government of Wonosobo in Central Java are two good examples of such cases. The IAPBE is considered a good example of a programme with strong leadership, making sure that gender equality is not only promoted in the programme, but also in the programme\u2019s management office. The programme hired a female driver as part of the effort to convince its partners that equal opportunities should start at \u2018home\u2019. For a programme operated in a traditional Islamic society, this was a breakthrough. 3.2.5 Managing development results Capacity development activities and interventions must be made accountable. Appropriate organizational assessment tools \u2013 used at the beginning of the programme as a way to gather baseline data, and at the end of the reporting period to measure improved capacity of the organizations \u2013 are important in this regard.72 Further, it is important to remember that promoting democratic local governance requires processes and learning over time.73 The ACCESS CD programme provides a good model of measurable indicators. Improved income and savings, better access to public goods and services such as education and water, and lower illiteracy rates are among the tangible and measurable indicators. As a bilateral funding organization, AusAID has progressively introduced gender and development measures, using Harmonized Gender and Development Checklists in its project design stage. It also requires that proponents respond to gender-related questions when tendering for an award.

The tools are process-oriented, aimed at developing the capacities of facilitators of participatory gender audits. The tools help facilitators to assist the staff of the organization in carrying out self-assessment, which is critical in strengthening organizational learning processes \u2013 including for gender equality promotion.74 3.3 Whose capacities need development?74 While the involvement of the national government in the local CD programme is critical \u2013 particularly in making sure the legal framework and policy settings for local CD are properly developed \u2013 capacity development for provincial, district and municipal governments is critical to the success of decentralization. It is vital, therefore, to influence national and local governments to work together when exploring and designing programmes. Developing DPRDs (district councils) to be more functional and receptive will require time and effort. Areas of focus should include increasing familiarity with, and proficiency in, the substantive issues faced; defining and refining DPRD processes and structures; placing greater civil society pressure on DPRD to be accountable to citizens; and building associations between parties and their DPRD members. Challenges for CD of the DPRD include the fact that many of the members change every five years, and that some donor organizations have internal regulations preventing them from supporting any political party and its members. Building partnerships with international foundations75 may be a way to provide continuous support to orient/reorient DPRB members and also assist them in performing their job.76 Village and sub-district governments need specific CD attention. Although they receive grants, there is no clear set of functions defined in the decentralization legislation for these two bottom levels of government. Capacity development for women and the poor is one critical aspect in building demand-driven CD, and promoting successful and sustainable development. Noting the limited number of CD service providers \u2013 particularly in areas in which the market is not strong, such as in eastern Indonesia or in Aceh \u2013 it is thus critical to focus on CD, including gender competence, for service providers. 74 ILO, \u2018A manual for facilitators \u2013 the ILO\u2019s Participatory Gender Audit Methodology\u2019, Geneva, 2007. 75 Foundations such as IDEA, the National Democratic Institute and the Asia Foundation have provided support to members of political parties. 76 Other support that may be provided includes communications, legal drafting, accountability and constituent building, communication and supervision, resource management, budget analysis, and party relations encouraging parliamentarians to develop greater reliance on intermediaries and associations (universities, entrepreneurs and professional associations). 21 3.4 Capacity to demand and accountability It is important to introduce accountability mechanisms and tools to promote improved capacity to demand. This means that the poor, women, and men, gain cognitive skills to understand issues in their locality, have an interest in learning, and understand their new capacity to demand their rights from the local government or local parliamentarians. This approach builds constituencies between the two groups, within two domains of accountability \u2013 bottom-up and top-down.77 Figure 2: Dynamics between top-down and bottom-up forces of change78 The first aspect is top-down accountability, in which social and public accountability is established by introducing economic and political opportunities, equity and inclusion, decentralization of resources, and transparency and governance. The second critical aspect is bottom-up accountability through efforts to empower by mobilizing and voicing rights and choices, as well as capabilities, assets and resources. Institutional transformation must be the focus of sustainable, gender-responsive CD. These envisioned changes are not only in the material condition of women, but also in the formal and social structures that maintain inequality. Organizations must be transformed so that women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality are firmly on the agenda and are supported by skilled, politically influential advocates. 77 This has also been supported by A Rao and D Kalleher in \u2018Is There Life After Gender Mainstreaming\u2019, Gender and Development, 13.2, 2005. 78 Ibid.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ecb75acd-5a8b-4d76-884d-a7c8c6e55574": {"__data__": {"id_": "ecb75acd-5a8b-4d76-884d-a7c8c6e55574", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d6744ccd85132ae249f45cc8a0d2570a5cccf76b199f88abf197caf21685daca"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ae27b57-fd68-4ba4-a574-2f3d8b11fd3d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebbc01a1c1296d16fd62d949816d716455f9055217c894efeb96adc7938c7616"}}, "hash": "763501486a8501a3d00d1360a08658726e714945d568941631f499b8153cffdf", "text": "78 Ibid.

The programmes have focused CD on the delivery of small-scale rural and urban infrastructure. Therefore, PNPM must ensure that in replicating those programmes, particular emphasis is placed on guaranteeing that the poor and disadvantaged benefit from this CD approach. In this regard, to be effective and sustainable, CD efforts in PNPM should focus on changing the behaviour of the actors, and changing engagements between and among stakeholders. These are to be facilitated for a long-term rather than short-term programme intervention. Empowerment should be seriously promoted. Awareness of people\u2019s rights and responsibilities, awareness of the importance of community and organized civil society, and efforts to mobilize resources are critical. 3.5 Service providers and quality assurance There is a clear need for improvement in the provision and delivery of quality public services in Indonesia. Issues of availability of qualified and accredited capacity builders or CD service providers have long been critical, particularly in the eastern part of Indonesia and in areas of conflict such as Ambon or central Sulawesi. For sustainability reasons, it is critical to improve and enhance CD services available to local governments and organizations, with an emphasis on improving competence to carry out gender-responsive CD. The ADB provides funds to LAN and MHA to implement a Sustainable Capacity Development for Decentralization Programme. Among other things, the programme supports the development of accredited service providers, including the existing training departments of government agencies, professional associations, associations of the regional governments and their agencies, universities, private-sector research and training institutes, management consultants, political parties, the media, and CSOs. Under this scheme, service providers may also be eligible for pre- financing through capital arrangements. Historically, MWE and donor organizations expected that the Women\u2019s Studies Centres (WSC) across Indonesia would actively fill the role of service providers and experts for gender concerns. In reality, most WSCs have neither sufficient financial independence nor the capacity to act as gender experts. WSC operations have mainly relied on budget support from the MWE, donor-funded programmes, or from programmes that the WSCs are contracted to implement by the local government. With some individual exceptions, the development of their capacity as gender experts has been mostly dependent on MWE training programmes. Unfortunately, the number of reliable gender experts within government and donor organizations is not enough to meet the need. 23 4. lessons leArned These lessons are drawn primarily from this study of gender-responsive CD in Indonesia, but also include lessons from findings in similar studies conducted in the Philippines, Viet Nam and Nepal.79 Comparing experiences from these other three countries in the region, some conclusions can be made: Lesson 1: Improve capacity to demand \u2022\ufffd All development cooperation should include an agreement for parties to promote gender equality as the foundation of supply-driven accountability. \u2022\ufffd The government and donors must focus on strengthening bottom-up accountability by building improved capacity to demand via community and women\u2019s empowerment. \u2022\ufffd Accountability in creating gender equality should be linked to organizational gender equality targets. \u2022\ufffd Strong promotion of gender equality within a government\u2019s policy documents \u2013 including within the CD agenda \u2013 encourages local governments, donors and programmes to implement GRB. Successful implementation, however, is dependent on a strong and effective accountability framework, as well as appropriate tools and technical assistance. \u2022\ufffd \u2018People-centered\u2019 or \u2018actor-centered\u2019 CD has been critical to the success of many CD initiatives in Indonesia. \u2022\ufffd Women and the poor who have taken part in participatory planning and leadership training are able to express their needs and raise their concerns to the NGOs and the local governments that serve them. \u2022\ufffd Women political leaders at the national, regional and local level are critical assets in building stronger accountability for promoting gender equality. The ACCESS programme in Indonesia has worked at the local level to improve bottom-up accountability and has improved capacity to demand. Lesson 2: Gender responsive CD needs assessment In Indonesia, no systematic and proper CD needs assessment is in place within the national and local government system. However, a sound gender-responsive CD needs assessment \u2013 one which considers the organizational context and operational arrangements of an organization as part of the strategic planning processes \u2013 is critical to the design and implementation of gender-responsive CD programmes. \u2022\ufffd In addition to providing strategic entry points for gender-responsive CD initiatives, an appropriate needs assessment then facilitates organizations to measure results and monitor progress, while also assuring CD sustainability within the organization. \u2022\ufffd To ensure proper targeting, the preparation of plans", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c64fe614-8b12-4857-ac53-51f595cee447": {"__data__": {"id_": "c64fe614-8b12-4857-ac53-51f595cee447", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4b34f2a00377478d7d78954e84cf0679e429ba4f069b6d1813be5f1649c4c88"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e89b420-e363-4e92-b93a-b88b4c77b7cc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4df89a4dd654392e1a2bb0251d9615cbd8015c604077689e94bbd536070cd4b0"}}, "hash": "0c958be48b5fbe1dce36f8a7d85170ed22cd962acf6dfd8883b550b69f330fb3", "text": "should be based on poverty profile analysis. To ensure that interventions are informed by MDG indicators, projects should track progress, particularly 79 The full text of those studies is available at: http://regionalcentrebangkok.undp.or.th/practices/ capacitydevelopment/projects-SNVPartnership.html. 24 on poverty reduction. It is critical for the relevant government staff to have competence and skills in carrying out poverty and gender analysis, as well as in collecting and analyzing sex disaggregated data and monitoring the progress of key gendered, poverty-related indicators. \u2022\ufffd Examples of successful CD needs assessments include: \u2013 The success of the sustainable capacity building programme in Indonesia is due, in part, to the integration of a GAP into the local government\u2019s CBAP. \u2013 UNDP\u2019s Papua People-Centred Development uses the PNA to prepare a CD plan within the programme for Papua, and supports strategic planning processes of key government institutions to produce institutional CD needs assessments. \u2013 The OCA \u2013 to assess the capacity of CSOs and NGOs in the ACCESS programme \u2013 has been a good example of a participatory needs assessment tool, which can be further expanded as a tool to monitor organizational capacities. Lesson 3: Affirmative actions are still needed Capacity development programmes must include gender equality as a mandatory requirement. In this regard, affirmative action has gone some way to increasing the awareness of gender equality among stakeholders. \u2022\ufffd Capacity development of technical-sector staff, in areas such as health and education, particularly for women in ethnic minorities, is considered a priority, particularly to address issues of sexual health among young people, sexual risk behavior, protection for survivors of domestic violence, and support and protection for migrant workers before and after migration.80 In the education sector, CD could be focused on improving school books to make them more gender sensitive.81 Some examples of affirmative action introduced at policy level include: a 5 percent quota for GAD budget in the Philippines; a mandatory minimum of 20 percent representation by women at the ward level, and 30 percent in users\u2019 committees in Nepal; and a mandatory 30 percent of the quota of elected positions for women in Indonesia. Good policy models at the community level include: the equal gender balance for women and the poor as beneficiaries of ACCESS; and a 30 percent quota for women in participatory planning in the KDP and UPP. An example of a broader affirmative action that is not limited to establishing a quota for women\u2019s representation is the mandatory establishment of a GAP as an aspect of the CD plan, as a condition of ADB funding. Lesson 4: Follow-up and continuity Linking individual action plans to organizational strategic planning is a means through which to make a sustainable CD investment. Individual training participants should have a clear understanding of how to implement the training into their future work. The leadership of organizations needs to provide follow-up and monitoring. 80 ADB, \u2018Vietnam Country Gender Assessment\u2019, 2006. 81 Ibid. 25 \u2022\ufffd Providing follow-up and continuity to allow CD to grow and strengthen within institutions will ensure that beneficiaries experience changes and improvements that are the result of the capacity development they evolved. IASTP III introduced technical assistance and mentoring. ACCESS facilitates NGOs by not only providing technical assistance and mentoring, but also equipping organizations with tools and skills to monitor changes and to facilitate continuous learning with the stakeholders. CIDA\u2019s Achenese Civil Society Organization Strengthening (ANCOR) practices mentoring and reflective monitoring processes. In the Philippines, the National Commission on the Role of Filipino Women (NCRFW) followed up the launch of \u2018Gender Checklists and Tools\u2019 with a training of trainers for national government staff, and monitoring of the implementation of the tools. Lesson 5: Gender analysis as a tool to learn and change \u2022\ufffd Gender-based analysis, participatory planning and practical gender-related questions to guide poverty mapping are useful means through which to curb strong gender resistance and to increase understanding on the importance of responding to the differing needs of the poor, women and men. There is value in exploring the use of gender disaggregated data produced by organizations other than the Central Bureau of Statistics in this regard. \u2022\ufffd Gender analysis tools that are too mechanical and methodological may discourage their use. Lesson 6: Leaders and role models who \u2018walk the walk\u2019 Individuals and organizations should act as role models in the promotion and implementation of gender equality policies.

It may be useful, over time, to avoid fatigue by introducing new and innovative approaches to gender mainstreaming and CD. \u2022\ufffd Allocating investment to CD, while necessary, is not sufficient without establishing a workable legal framework, and stimulating an enabling environment that offers incentives for learning and builds capacity to demand. \u2022\ufffd Capacity development needs to consider innovative ways to involve people in triple-loop learning,82 providing an opportunity for far-reaching change. 82 Triple-loop learning represents the highest form of organizational self-examination. It involves questioning the entire rationale of an organization, and can lead to radical transformations in internal structure, culture and practices, as well as in the external context. See: http://www.capacity.org/en/journal/feature/ organisational_learning_for_aid_and_learning_aid_organisations. 26 5. recommendAtIons 5.1 The donor community \u2022\ufffd Donors, and the national government, must support local CD service providers with the CD tools they need to ensure that service provision is in line with the specific conditions of the clients procuring them. \u2022\ufffd Donors should make careful selection of appropriate entry points for gender-responsive local CD programmes. Strong leadership, clear directives and simple messages are effective in promoting more progressive gender-responsive CD programmes for government staff, CD project implementers and communities. \u2022\ufffd CD frameworks, programmes and initiatives should market their gender strategies so that they are easily understood, including consideration of gender issues faced by both women and men. It is useful to show innovation in designing CD programmes that capture the dynamics of the learning process. \u2022\ufffd National and local governments should be supported to introduce practical gender analysis in CD initiatives by reviewing the role of women in the entire project cycle and longer-term impact, including during socialization, planning, decision-making, implementation, mentoring and monitoring. \u2022\ufffd Gender-responsive CD initiatives that take into account the causes of worsening poverty should be pursued through priority setting and not driven by donor agendas. This includes ensuring that CD initiatives are spread evenly throughout the country. \u2022\ufffd It would be useful for donors to build consensus with stakeholders on a gender equity strategy for the CD framework. Several regional consultations, perhaps facilitated by universities, could be organized to bring together local government and CSOs to draft the framework. Results from the regional workshops could be brought to a high-level meeting of national stakeholders to develop the overall goals and policy for gender mainstreaming and women\u2019s empowerment in the CD framework. \u2022\ufffd Local CD networks can establish collaboration between progressive universities, professional individuals and associations, and regional NGOs. Networking with national and local government agencies, as well as with regional and international organizations, will generate new knowledge sharing and good practices. \u2022\ufffd Capacity development should look beyond the macro level to the micro level. After all, development actors are human beings, who react differently to varied CD approaches. \u2022\ufffd Donor communities need to be role models for promoting and implementing gender equality within their own organizations, both through their programmes and management. 5.2 The national government \u2022\ufffd The national government should make an urgent commitment to, and demonstrate leadership in, establishing a coordinating mechanism for CD interventions at the national and local level. The national coordinating body for CD should finalize the regulatory framework for regional autonomy, develop instruments and working mechanisms that clarify the roles and responsibilities of national government agencies to become more demand oriented, facilitate and support the regions, build accountable relationships, and ensure sufficient stakeholder participation in these processes. 27 \u2022\ufffd Urgent civil service reform, including effective incentive mechanisms linked to staff performance, will ensure proper mechanisms for improved local government services. \u2022\ufffd The private sector should be encouraged to participate in CD. This could be done, for example, by providing a comprehensive list of action points to be presented to the private sector to help them firm up their commitments to the MDGs. \u2022\ufffd Capacity development programmes should incorporate bottom-up and top-down accountability relationships. 5.3 Local government \u2022\ufffd Proper participatory and gender sensitive strategic planning processes that build the available baseline information for developing gender-responsive capacity needs assessments are critical. \u2022\ufffd Facilitating a demand-driven approach and procuring CD and advisory services from accredited service providers will help local government agencies reduce duplication and inefficiency. \u2022\ufffd Local gender champions \u2013 females and males \u2013 should be identified to facilitate stakeholder acceptance of the importance of gender equality. In conservative areas such as Aceh, having a female and male gender team within CD programmes has proven more effective than having only one female gender expert. 5.4 The PNPM programme The Government of Indonesia intends to replicate the PNPM nationwide.83 Successful expansion will require not only increased", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "93663b2d-36f3-4b02-8931-6ac738f4f9fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "93663b2d-36f3-4b02-8931-6ac738f4f9fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing gender responsive local capacity development in Indonesia", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a95662b21740620aeda00958a31fc69d30167e6c70cc48a2f8d3466576ef2bfd"}, "3": {"node_id": "c599abe9-d4f6-425c-b8a1-d9367fec1d33", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-gender-responsive-local-capacity-development-indonesia", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce8ac97bdba7a75dc33a7284ecd7da589455ad4525cc3d19752ae272799c9304"}}, "hash": "1b88fcd72fc903cfdd032594ee17497a6395ecf5186a5e4ec893fc380dcd8b03", "text": "financial resources, but also replication, scale-up and transformation of commitments, leadership, values and principles (accountability, transparency, participation), as well as capacities at all levels of government and in all development actors. Recommendations to improve outcomes in the programme expansion are: \u2022\ufffd PNPM must develop and implement a holistic CD framework based on accountability relationships with local stakeholders. Such accountability relationships will stimulate public-sector organizations to remain relevant and responsive to the needs and demands of the society they serve. Experiences on the ground suggest that local governments tend to perform better when they are held to account by their clients \u2013 communities, women and men, girls and boys. These relationships create incentives for the local government and other service providers to perform better. \u2022\ufffd Gender-responsive approaches and steps should be integrated into the PNPM\u2019s manuals and formats, from planning to evaluation. \u2022\ufffd The programme needs to focus more on a \u2018people-centered\u2019 approach, with behaviour change as the goal, not only physical infrastructure. \u2022\ufffd Nationwide replication of the CDD approach requires the scale-up of common values and practices \u2013 transparency, accountability, participation, gender equality and empowerment. Local facilitators need to come from the community they are serving, thus ensuring continuity in the constituent\u2013 service provider relationship. 83 RPJMN, 2010\u20132014. 28 \u2022\ufffd Identification of individuals, leaders and role models among stakeholders \u2013 local government, local NGOs and CSOs, local parliaments and local communities \u2013 will generate, maintain and energize collective action for promoting good governance to sustain development and reduce poverty. \u2022\ufffd The national government must provide an environment that enables effective decentralization and community participation. Capacity is more than resources; it also includes motivation and commitment. Capacity development takes more than resources; it also takes time, motivation and commitment, with the capacity and commitment of facilitators and local leaders being particularly important. \u2022\ufffd The scale-up and replication of community centres with well-documented, context-specific experiences \u2013 through good monitoring, evaluation and operational research \u2013 will be useful in advocating for improvements to the contextual environment. \u2022\ufffd A \u2018learning by doing\u2019 culture that values adaptation, flexibility and openness to change should be fostered at all levels. A sufficient time frame should be allowed to support cultural change. The scale-up of PNPM could be assisted by: i. improving management of development to produce greater impact; ii. strengthening gender-responsive livelihood components of the programme, to produce concrete results and added value for the community; iii. facilitating partnership building among and between stakeholders at the national, regional and local levels, including the private sector, research facilities and civil society; iv. fostering a culture of learning as part of the PNPM\u2019s monitoring tools; v. promoting social and gender inclusiveness; vi. assisting in implementing a long-term approach to CD. 29 6. concludIng remArks System-wide capacity gaps in the public sector in Indonesia will not be bridged through a piecemeal approach to increasing investment in local CD. The government and donor organizations must replicate current good practice into the wider system, with strong support at the policy level. The CDD model is a good approach to improving the capacity of local governance. Results indicate that the CDD approach can increase the effectiveness, efficiency and sustainability of projects or programmes, making them more pro-poor and responsive to local priorities. CDD projects also develop capacity, build social and human capital, facilitate community and individual empowerment, deepen democracy, improve governance and strengthen human rights. 30 Annex 1: other experIences Aceh Localization of MDGs in Indonesia means contextualizing poverty issues according to the local setting. The different aspects of local CD in areas with specific needs, such as post-tsunami reconstruction and development, enhances our understanding of the different challenges faced in meeting the targets of the MDGs.

In practice, gender stereotyping and inequalities have shown considerable resilience in Aceh, and have proven difficult to change.

A report on the social sustainability of the MDF\u2019s portfolio85 indicated that the MDF\u2019s Recovery Assistance Policy requires attention to be paid to gender, voice and accountability. The absence of clear mechanisms and technical capacity within the MDF, as well as the lack of gender disaggregated baseline information and indicators, have reduced the opportunities for gender equality promotion and social inclusiveness. There must be improved analysis and corresponding implementation to support holistic, rights-based programming. Social and gender analysis has been carried out merely as a formality, due to: a lack of commitment to allocate investment to carry out proper social and gender analysis; a lack of capacity to carry out sound gender analyses; and resistance to the fact that gender issues occur and need special attention.86 One of the constraints for measuring success in Aceh has been the lack of baseline information. Most programmes with CD, for example, were not developed based on a proper CD needs assessment. Funding agencies tended to choose supply-driven interventions, owing to the challenges of organizing participatory processes to produce more demand-driven solutions. The objective of CD has been hard to achieve in projects with short time frames for implementation.87 The sustainability of 84 Oxford Policy Management, \u2018Review of Social Sustainability with the MDF for Aceh and Nias: Final Report\u2019, January 2009. 85 Oxford Policy Management; ibid. 86 From various gender audits that the researcher has carried out within the UN- and CIDA-funded projects in Aceh 87 With few exceptions, all programmes under BRR\u2019s coordination have to be completed by March 2009. 31 increased capacities for some or many programmes is in question.

If the Aceh government is strong enough to mobilize resources and to tap into quality technical expertise, the province may be able to maintain its capacity to run the work left by donor organizations. Papua Development in Papua takes place in a unique context. Papua was the lowest-ranked Indonesian province in the \u20182005 Human Development Report\u2019 and has a Gender Development Index rating of 54.3,88 indicating considerable levels of both poverty and gender inequality in the region. Papua\u2019s progress towards meeting the MDGs has been slow and uncertain. Papua has introduced a Strategic Plan for Village Development (RESPEK),89 which all donor organizations operating in Papua are obliged to follow. RESPEK operates on the principles of people-centered and growth-based development, stability and sustainability. The core objectives of RESPEK are to: \u2022\ufffd reduce the number of poor families; \u2022\ufffd ensure Papuans\u2019 human rights and increase the welfare of the population; \u2022\ufffd create more livelihood opportunities for Papuans; and \u2022\ufffd strengthen community facilitation. Results will be measured by improved access to food and nutrition, accelerated fulfillment of nine- year primary education, provision of accessible and equitable health services, and the creation of job opportunities and income across different sectors. RESPEK has assisted organizations to meet local development needs and has been highly relevant to the direction of national and provincial policy.90 Based on the results of the Papua Needs Assessment, the Papua People-Centered Development Programme91 (PPCD) was designed, and a CD strategy produced. The CD strategy of the programme involves such components as: senior government officials visiting villages in order to give communities the opportunity to identify their own development priorities; providing small grants to NGOs and CSOs working to achieve key human development goals in Papua; and support for key provincial government agencies to carry out CD needs assessments as part of their strategic planning process.

Introduction Historical evidence suggests that development and trade are co-varying variables. Which one leads the other is the big question that has been debated at length in political economy. Trade isolated as an end in itself had never been a policy for any of the nations which are now counted among the developed countries of today. On the contrary, we see several different industrial strategies, institutional settings, going hand-in-hand with strategic trade policies. The linkages between trade and development are complex and have been extensively debated in the literature. We see this complexity clearly when we look at the earlier studies focusing on the impacts of trade liberalization and external integration. There is no consensus on the relationship between trade liberalization and development. The conclusion that increased trade is sufficient for development is controversial. The best that can be said is that a consensus that there is no consensus on a direct correlation between external integration and development. Rather, development is associated with several different strategies and policies depending on the political, social and economic structure of the country or the region. In an integrated world economy, no single country can be analyzed in isolation from the world-wide regime. This is true not only because countries engage in trade but because there are many regulating regimes at multilateral and/regional levels, constraining nations\u2019 trade and economic policies both legally and practically. Since the beginning of the last decade, Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) have become an important feature of the global trading regime, imposing major changes in the international trade structure. Hence, 2 national strategies and policies cannot be discussed independently of the prevailing global geopolitical regime. Within the human development paradigm, trade is conceived of as a means to human development,2 not an end in itself. Many studies have focused on the question of whether RTAs expand trade, applying a welfare impact analysis on the net impacts trade creation and diversion. Our view is that we should not stop there. There is a need to identify the links between trade and development more carefully. We argue that this requires first questioning analyses that are solely based on trade performance. This requires incorporating other impacts from a a more holistic view of development. We suggest that any ex-post or ex-ante evaluation of RTAs should involve human development impact assessments. The underlying interest of this paper is to review assessments of RTAs, particularly within the context of Asia and the Pacific, and relate these to the broader objectives of regional cooperation directed at human development. We first review RTAs in general and summarize the theoretical debates with their policy implications in a broad-spectrum. A review of the methods used in earlier studies is useful for our purposes, thus an overview of these methods with their main findings is what follows next. Then we present where RTAs stand vis-\u00e0-vis the current multilateral trading regime and discuss what the limits and/or challenges are for developing countries in the context of RTAs. Next follows a discussion of the \u2018flying geese\u2019 framework, which provides, we argue, a potential alternative to conventional frameworks to analyze regional cooperation and the last section concludes. 2. RTAs and South-South Trade The rapid proliferation of regional trade agreements (RTAs) since the beginning of the last decade has induced a major change in the international trade structure. Ironically, since the establishment of the WTO and its \u2018Single Undertaking\u2019 the number of RTAs has increased 2 See Section 2 of UNDP [2005] for an expanded discussion of the links between human development and trade.

Traditionally RTAs are concluded among bordering countries, with comparable levels of development; however, the new wave of regionalism can involve diverse countries located in different time zones5. Recently we are also witnessing changes both in the scope and the content of RTAs. Many of the new waves of RTAs involve provisionss beyond tariff liberalization to include more intrusive obligations, especially on intellectual property rights, services, and investment. More and more countries have recognized the fact that not only the removal of trade barriers but also elimination of non-tariff limitations is required for effective economic integration. The accelerating process of regional integration has spawned several debates on the role of RTAs in development. In the broader context, regional cooperation would necessarily reflect a wide-ranging set of interconnected links among countries pertaining to their economic, social and/or political structures6. Such links are formed and shaped by existing differences among countries. Moreover, interconnectedness at regional level results in transforming the socioeconomic and political structures of countries involved. In fact, they also have indirect impacts on the outsider countries as well. Given how potentially complex and deep regional cooperation can be, the analysis here will focus on RTAs under the rubric of trade and development. The issue of regional economic cooperation had been considered peculiar to advanced countries. The possibility of regional economic cooperation between developing countries and their potential have been recognized in development debates mainly only after the Second World War. This coincides with the time when the view of development in the 3 As of January 2005, 312 RTAs have been notified to WTO/GATT (of these, 170 are in force) and a further 65 are estimated to be operational although not yet notified\u201d (Crawford et. al., 2005, p.2-3). 4 Mongolia is the only WTO member not engaged in any RTAs. The share of preferential trade in total trade for some of WTO members is high as 90 percent (Crawford et. al., 2005, p.1). 5 There is even a recent WTO discussion paper on RTAs, which argues that because RTAs are becoming increasingly complex complicated rules of origin makes trade more costly and complex (Crawford et. al.[2005, p.16]). 6 See Camilleri [2003] for discussions of regionalism in depth. 4 \u2018South\u2019 is not only necessary for the \u2018South\u2019 but for the \u2018North\u2019 as well. Promoting regional integration among developing countries has become a idea in the realm of common sense as part of proposals for development strategies, even though the actual practice has been spotty and results have tended to be difficult to measure. Early debates on regional trade agreements were in the context of how close trade agreements were to the free trade ideal, whether or not these agreements were worldwide, regional, or bilateral. The analytics of the proposition free or freer trade always improves welfare has been extensively developed. Starting in the late 1980s, the question shifted to how good is free trade? For whom? And what type of trade is good. Much of the research in theoretical literature started analyzing the comparative implications of intra versus inter- industry trade. In a similar manner, the diverse effects of trade were recognized, and the different implications of \u2018South\u2019-\u2018North\u2019 or \u2018South\u2019-\u2018South\u2019 trade. Research has turned its attention to the issue of regional agreements versus multilateral agreements. The changing nature of international trade over time is a key driver of the new focus. In the last decade, \u2018South\u2019-\u2018South\u2019 trade has increased as twice as much as world trade and this has increased interest in the significance of regional cooperation vis-\u00e0-vis multilateral institutions. RTAs in practice can be categorized as in figure A2 in Appendix from preferential trading areas to economic union according to provisions they cover. Under Preferential Trading Areas (PTAs) member countries agree to reciprocal partial tariff reductions. As they move from PTAs to free trade areas, the partial coverage of agreements turn toward the elimination of all tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs).

The annual growth rate of South-North manufacturing trade has been high as well; around 7 per cent, reaching $ 931 billion in 2003, achieving an increase in market share in the North of 3 per cent in 1995-2003. 3. The market share of North-North trade in manufactures declined due to a slower growth rate. Yet, total value reached $ 2,800 billion in 2003, $ 100 billion more than North-South, South-South and South-North manufactured trade flows combined. The report looking at the shift in the shares of regions in South-South trade acknowledges that East Asia dominates South-South trade with more technology intensive exports. However, while this benefits some regions, it in general occurs at the expense of other regions argues the UNIDO report. Sub-Saharan and Latin America suffer declining shares in resource-based and low-tech exports. On product-based analysis, the UNIDO report states that five out of the top ten products in South-South trade are high-technology manufactures (electronics) and more than 95 per cent of all South-South trade in electronics products, parts and components is accounted for by East Asia. East Asia also has an important share in the other largest most important products such as refined petroleum products (64 per cent), textile yarn (79 per cent), and polymerization and copolymerization products (86 per cent). Overall, according to UNIDO [2005] prosperity in East Asia has been accompanied by further marginalization of Sub-Saharan Africa. South-South trade expansion has had asymmetric implications for different regions. 3. Overview of Theoretical Debates In the West, theoretical debates on RTAs begin at the start of 1950s. That was when regional economic integration and theory of customs unions began in its present form 6 (Viner [1950], Lipsey [1957]). The welfare effects of economic cooperation has been the main focus of analysis. The concepts of trade diversion and trade creation were first introduced by Viner [1950]. Trade creation refers to the replacement of national production by trade when a partner is able to produce more efficiently. Trade creation is presumed to have a positive impact on welfare, arising from increased consumer surplus. Trade diversion refers to the shifting of imports from a more efficient country outside the cooperative agreement to a member country; through consumer surplus effects, this reduces welfare. These welfare gains and losses are calculated from a static framework. The basic argument posed was that economic cooperation benefits or gives harm to a member country depending whichever effect is stronger i.e. diversion or creation. Extensions of the basic framework involve assuming diverse initial conditions for participating partners. However, the concepts of trade creation and diversion have remained the basic approach in most of the studies last fifty-five years. For instance, Venables [1999] argues that RTAs if formed among low income countries are likely to harm the lowest income member due to trade diversion. Unless there is at least one high income member, convergence to high income level is not possible (Venables [1999, p.20]). The study supports earlier findings by Bhagwati and Panagariya [1996] that demonstrate the growing significance of trade diversion from non-members and least-cost suppliers and is likely to reduce welfare not only to outsiders but also to participating countries. Elevated trade and investment diversion is conceived as marginalizing the \u2018weakest\u2019 countries (Crawford et. al. [2005, p.16]). On the other hand, critiques of the conventional framework emphasized the significance of dynamic effects of economic cooperation rather than static impacts. There are many studies in the literature arguing that economic integration provides several possibilities for developing countries such as higher economies of scale with product differentiation. Also higher division of labor, hence higher productive efficiency, is mentioned as another benefit of RTAs. Such discussions indicate basically a recognition of possible impacts of RTAs on productivity and growth. 7 Among others, resource pooling (i.e. human resources or providing R&D expenditures jointly) and the extended diffusion of technology (i.e. higher technology spillovers, cheaper and more appropriate technology transfers) are considered to be the most significant factors in triggering economic growth. The argument about the potential of RTAs to create an environment for members to merge their R&D expenditures and form regional R&D clusters in the region has found a strong support in the literature.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60eac3a6-ce56-4ef5-92fe-3439204ac31f": {"__data__": {"id_": "60eac3a6-ce56-4ef5-92fe-3439204ac31f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing RTAs in the Context of the Flying Geese Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "28668afecba3df3bde8a5b83bdbb068871c6a0762f54fb1ccd91f75efd9b3d53"}, "2": {"node_id": "ecc419ce-7d4f-4c10-a4de-80a12f6f8996", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bd73b84bdb6e6a315090ec3c24c9a883059ea5130c81884eafe4e0e9a7d1c06"}}, "hash": "1c971027487d8b5926fbfed6c463f877f020f807825095353c48aece2a415740", "text": "Since uncertainty matters much in R&D expenditures, sponsoring them jointly might enhance higher motivation.

[2002, p. 16],) the same result can also be interpreted as RTAs are good for growth unless countries are locked in trading only with each other. One other strand of counter-arguments against adverse impacts of RTAs points to the trade and investment relations. Blomstr\u00f6m and Kokko [1997] argues for diverse impacts of RTAs on investments in general, particularly on FDI. RTAs affect FDI flows through two channels. First there are indirect effects through trade liberalization. Second, there are effects through changes in investment rules imposed within RTAs. How RTAs affect FDI depends on total magnitute of these two effects (Blomstrom and Koko [1997, p.2-3]). The study basically points out the fact that RTAs provide higher potential for investment, as a result of a bigger market size. On evaluating the diverse implications on different member countries of MERCOSUR, (Blomstrom and Koko [1997, p. 29-30]), they suggest inclusion of provisions in RTAs to facilitate FDI. Possible benefits of RTAs from investment point of view are discussed in other studies as well. Fernandez [1997, p. 27] states that RTAs might provide certainty and credibility as to the future policies and economic environment, which increase private investment7. There is yet another study on the positive welfare impacts of RTAs, which points to political 7 By reducing uncertainties via commitment, signaling and insurance mechanisms RTAs might serve to increase credibility and provide benefits to member economies. 8 dimension of RTAs. Schiff and Winters [1997] argue that, when viewed as a tool of diplomacy, RTAs unambiguously increase welfare since it reduces security tensions and conflict among members and addresses some existing externalities (Schiff and Winter [1997, p. 29])8. This supports also evolutionary arguments on the implications of Cold War dynamics on cooperation and inter-state relations. 4. RTAs in Asia-Pacific Context In Asia, countries have been involved in regional integration for many years, including the regional system of tariff preferences, the Bangkok Agreement, and sub-regional processes like SAFTA and AFTA. Recently, there has been an intensification of efforts to deepen such ties through the negotiation of bilateral FTAs, including within the framework of agreements between sub-regional groupings. China has become active in negotiating such FTAs, and countries like Japan, which have historically been aloof to RTAs, are re- invigorating their efforts. Asian countries are also negotiating FTAs with countries outside the region. SAPTA members recently agreed to make a transition to a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) from the beginning of 2006, with full implementation completed between 2009 and 2013. Questions thus arise on how these new integration arrangements promote trade and development, benefit and impact the poorer sections of society, and indeed whether they are compatible with the letter and spirit of the multilateral trading system. De Lombaerde, Pietrangeli and Weeratunge [2006] evaluate existing systems for evaluating the progress of regional agreements. The authors highlight the lack of a conceptual framework in many of the proposals which has led to an inconsistency between indicators and objectives of such monitoring processes. They stress the importance of the participation of all the relevant stakeholders which is considered a crucial factor in developing more effective indicator systems. In this context, the authors emphasis the need 8 See Brown et. al. [2005] for a counter-argument. The authors argue that regional cooperation is no panacea for regional conflict (Brown et. al. [2005, p.14]). RTAs cannot be taken as automatic brake on conflict. Even beyond, regional integration according to the authors can actually create tensions and trigger conflict via creating adjustment costs, social dislocation and widening wealth inequalities. trade diversion and exclusion can create tensions between members and non-members of trade agreements. 9 for improvement in the design and implementation of tools to monitor regional integration processes. The empirical methods commonly used in previous studies to assess the impacts of RTAs can be categorized under three groups: trade indicess, gravity models, computable general equilibrium models. The trade index approach involves the use of static measures of trade performance depending on the type of goods traded.

In aggregate, South Asia intra-regional trade doubled in eight years (the figure is 4.9 percent in 1998 where it is only 2.4 in 1990). The figures first imply that the significance of intra-regional trade increased in all member countries. Second, compared to the other regions, South Asian region\u2019s performance is very low in absolute terms, but when we look at the impacts in each country, we observe that figures for Bhutan (from 10 percent to 72 percent) and Nepal (12 percent to 33 percent) demonstrate significant increase. Given the fact that these two countries are landlocked this change might not be surprising, yet, such a notable increase would not have been achieved without RTAs. Thus RTAs have an important potential to increase trade for cases such as landlocked countries. The differing bargaining power and capabilities stemming from asymmetric political and economic strengths of nations are well-known drawbacks of regional trade agreements. Intra-regional imports shares in Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka rise more than the export shares. One underlying reason Pitigala [2005, p.9] argues is the imbalance as a consequence of India maintaining a higher level of border protection relative to its neighbors. Such imbalances may also have dynamic effects that show up on the extent of diversification of exports of the members. India and Pakistan are cited as the only countries 10 exporting a wide range of manufacturing goods from automobiles to medicine whereas others exports are concentrated usually in a single sector such as beans, rice or apparel.

Development, Trade and the WTO: A Handbook. Washington, D.C.: Worldbank. Box1. Definitions and Index Formulas One of the widespread indicators used is changes in the pattern of intra-regional trade in order to see the impacts of RTAs. Intra-regional trade calculations are based on intra- industry trade index. The IIT index ranges between zero and one, with larger values indicating a greater level of trade between firms in the same industry. Higher IIT ratios suggest that net gains from specialization in different products are being exploited and that the participating country is increasing its integration into the world economy. IIT is calculated as IITjk = 1 \u2013 [sumi | Xijk \u2013 Mijk | / (Xijk + Mijk)] Where Xijk and Mijk represent exports and imports of products from industry i in country j to and from country k. Increase in intra-industry trade according to some studies influencing the success or failure of efforts to promote industrialization and growth plays an important positive role. Intra-industry exchange produces extra gains from international trade over and above those associated with comparative advantage because it allows a country to take advantage of larger markets. By engaging in IIT, a country can simultaneously reduce the number of products it produces while increasing the variety of goods available to domestic consumers. Other indicators are the trade intensity index and trade complementarity indices. Trade intensity index is used to determine whether the value of trade between two countries is greater or smaller than would be expected on the basis of their importance in world trade. It is defined as the share of one country\u2019s exports going to a partner divided by the share of world exports going to the partner. It is calculated as: Tij = (xij/Xit)/(xwj/Xwt) Where xij and xwj are the values of country i\u2019s exports and of world exports to country j and where Xit and Xwt are country i\u2019s total exports and total world exports respectively. An index of more (less) than one indicates a bilateral trade flow that is larger (smaller) than expected, given the partner country\u2019s importance in world trade. The trade complementarity (TC) index can provide useful information on prospects for intraregional trade in that it shows how well the structures of a country\u2019s imports and exports match. It also has the attraction that its values for countries considering the formation of a regional trade agreement can be compared with others that have formed or tried to form similar arrangements. The TC between countries k and j is defined as: TCij = 100 \u2013 sum(|mik \u2013 xij| / 2) Where xij is the share of good i in global exports of country j and mik is the share of good i in all imports of country k. The index is zero when no goods are exported by one country or imported by the other and 100 when the export and import shares exactly match. 11 4.1 Gravity model estimations The", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61f01c31-2e9e-4089-b6bf-f4659954c997": {"__data__": {"id_": "61f01c31-2e9e-4089-b6bf-f4659954c997", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing RTAs in the Context of the Flying Geese Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79ae216d3db58188c8281bc7c061fa16ff2bd218f7fbd41bdcbe8208e77c0a20"}}, "hash": "79ae216d3db58188c8281bc7c061fa16ff2bd218f7fbd41bdcbe8208e77c0a20", "text": "basic underpinning of gravity models is Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation. The simplest equation used in gravity models predicts a positive relation between the volume of trade among two economies and the size of these economies (i.e. real GDP or per capita income is used as a proxy for size) and negative relation with respect to transaction costs (i.e. proxied by geographical bilateral distance). Standard simple equation can be summarized as follows: Tij t = f (GDPi t, GDPj t , Dij t ) where Tij is the trade flow such as exports from country i to country j at time t. GDPi and GDPj are the proxies used representing the size of the two economies. Dij shows the distance between two countries such as distance between capital cities. Trade is positively associated with size. The underlying assumption is high level of income indicates high level of production which would lead to high level of exports in the exporting country. In a similar way a high level of income in the importing country also implies a high level of imports that would again increase the amount of trade flows between the two i.e. level of exports in this case. On the other hand trade is restrained by longer distance as distance represents transaction costs that make trade costlier. The estimations employ a log-linear form of the above equation: log (Tij t ) = \u03b10 + \u03b11log(GDPi t) + \u03b12log(GDPj t) + \u03b13log(Dij t) + ut ut is assumed to have normal distribution. The expected signs of the coefficients for GDP variables are positive and for distance variable it is negative. There are many different versions of this model in the literature. Specific to RTAs usually different dummy variables are added. Some models also use different proxies for the size of economies such as GDPs weighted by the population of the countries included. 12 Table A3 presents some of the earlier studies on RTAs in Asia and the Pacific using gravity model estimation. The focus of analysis column indicates that these studies explore multiple dimensions, including the role of inward FDI on RTAs is as such. The weight of appears to fall toward the view that the trade creation impact of RTAs is offsets its trade diverting effect. And there is also evidence for investment creation in case of RTAs in Asia. Yet, the studies show that these outcomes cannot be attributed to all regional arrangements in the region. 4.2 Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) Models CGE models have been used to assess both the ex ante and the ex post impacts of RTAs on production and trade structures, employment, consumption and welfare. Table A4 surveys CGE-based studies. This table contains numerous instances where the benefits are positive and potentially large for participating members, at the same time that the arrangements are significantly trade diverting. The parties that would tend be hurt would be outsiders, notably the U.S. There is also the notable result that individual unilateral liberalization can lead to a deterioration in the terms of trade, which can be overcome by concerted liberalization. Still another finding is that \u201cnatural trading blocs\u201d made up of countries that have complementary economies can be significantly trade diverting. Because many of the researchers undertaking the studies are based in Australia, there is a disproportionate number of RTA studies involving Australia and New Zealand, two countries which have much interest in commodity and agricultural exports. The largest benefits, however, to participating countries across many of these studies are in manufacturing, and these benefits would accrue to Japan, Korea, China, and the ASEAN countries. 5. RTAs within the context of Multilateral Trading Regime Many economists have pointed out the risks of FTA proliferation. Findlay et al. [2003] in a paper that also interprets the motivations of countries undertaking FTAs, point out five risks associated with the proliferation. These five risks are: (1) inefficiency, (2) retaliation by non-members, (3) architecture of FTAs particularly as created by specific rules of origin, 13 (4) political economy of reform because FTAs could reinvigorate domestic lobbies against overall trade liberalization, and (5) increased political tension among members. By their nature, RTAs represent an exception to multilateral trading system and its one basic principle as of most-favored-nation principle. This fact has raised the question of whether RTAs pose a threat to WTO rules and objectives; whether the RTAs are building blocks or stumbling blocks. Some argued that RTAs are harmful to WTO rules not only because they diversion away from multilateral trading system, but also because they may lead to spaghetti-bowl problem due to their very diverse nature (Bhagwati (1995) and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "99138e1c-be9f-4044-982c-f205ed10f10a": {"__data__": {"id_": "99138e1c-be9f-4044-982c-f205ed10f10a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing RTAs in the Context of the Flying Geese Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "562433b0b04e1871c2b52f62ba834229126470357c317013676ad830f569d3ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "1a69ac21-1b68-41ae-98a6-c40776baa202", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cbc1d087eb3775dd5b11a1b67e4ab28c23fdbfb41d7c2ef9172d629210463db9"}}, "hash": "7cbcd6529a26731960728f9946ab5ab912312f8374f6e128e5ee198601030b4f", "text": "Krueger (1995)) On the other hand, there are many studies which take the view that regionalism is much more complementary to multilateral system, rather than posing a threat they are building blocks (Baldwin (1997), Ethier (1998) and Lawrence (1999)). A more general answer to the question concerned is provided by Winters (1998). The study points out the fact that it is not possible to answer the question easily. Yet, the study suggests RTAs might simplify the process to reach agreement at the multilateral level by reducing the number of players. A recent report by IDE APEC Study Centre discusses the existing practices of North-South RTAs, how they conflict with WTO rules. The study also identifies which North-South RTAs are compatible with WTO rules (Yanai [2004]). Under current rules, there are mainly two categories of principles related to RTAs. RTAs involving trade in goods are largely governed by Article XXIV of the General Agreement, whereas trade in services is governed by Article V of the GATS. Box 2 summarizes the general legal framework under WTO system for RTAs as discussed in this study. Based on these principles, North-South RTAs, must be reciprocal and must cover substantially all the trade. Yet, for instance, none of preferential schemes implemented by the EC and the United States satisfy this requirement. The EU\u2019s arrangement with the ACP countries began with the Lom\u00e9 Convention (now the Cotonou Agreement), while the United States established the CBI and the AGOA (legislated as national law), which benefits Caribbean or sub-Saharan countries through a discriminatory tariff measure. These examples are aimed at a limited groups of 14 developing countries do not meet the criteria under Article XXIV, and it is argued that hence all preferences need a waiver from WTO rules (Yanai [2004, p.27-28]). As stated above, WTO recognizes RTAs under certain conditions. However, the 2001 Doha Ministerial Declaration acknowledges that WTO rules include conditions on RTAs which have proven to be controversial, and this has been a central element in the work of the Regional Trade Agreements Committee. The declaration admitted this as an important challenge, given the fact that since 1995 the committee on RTAs has failed to complete its assessments of whether individual trade agreements conform to WTO provisions9. Source: Yanai (2004) 9 in the 46 years of the GATT up to the end of 1994, a total of 98 agreements had been notified under Article XXIV, most of which were examined in individual working parties. But, consensus on the conformity of these agreements with GATT provisions was reached in only one case: the Czech-Slovak customs union (WTO). Box 2. On Legal Frameworks for RTAs under WTO rules The study by IDE APEC Study Centre states that there are two categories of rules on RTAs in the area of trade in goods: the first is based on Article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (General Agreement), which generally applies to all RTAs; the second is based on the so-called Enabling Clause, which, in exceptional circumstances, provides special and differential treatment (SDT) or RTAs among developing countries. Although both categories allow for deviations from the WTO guiding principle of non- discrimination, the necessary conditions of RTAs negotiated under the rules differ considerably as the author argues. GATT system was established with the fundamental principle of non-discrimination. Beyond that an unconditional MFN clause was added as well. Given this, by construction WTO would not allow the creation of any new preferences. However, RTAs are recognized as exceptions to MFN obligations under the WTO system. For the establishment of RTAs specific conditions are imposed depending on the type, through three legally-binding rules: Paragraph 4 to 10 of Article XXIV of the General Agreement, Article V of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), and the so-called Enabling Clause. (Yanai [2004, p.4]). Article XXIV of the General Agreement provide the basic rules and definitions on preferential arrangements covering trade in goods. For instance, a customs union (CU) or a free trade area agreement has to meet the condition, phrased as \u201csubstantially all the trade.\u201d This requires that duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce must be eliminated on \u201csubstantially all the trade\u201d between the constituent territories of a CU or a free trade area in products originating in such territories.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1a69ac21-1b68-41ae-98a6-c40776baa202": {"__data__": {"id_": "1a69ac21-1b68-41ae-98a6-c40776baa202", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing RTAs in the Context of the Flying Geese Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "562433b0b04e1871c2b52f62ba834229126470357c317013676ad830f569d3ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "99138e1c-be9f-4044-982c-f205ed10f10a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7cbcd6529a26731960728f9946ab5ab912312f8374f6e128e5ee198601030b4f"}}, "hash": "cbc1d087eb3775dd5b11a1b67e4ab28c23fdbfb41d7c2ef9172d629210463db9", "text": "Besides the condition, \u201csubstantially all the trade,\u201d there is also a \u201cstand still\u201d condition: the duties and other regulations of commerce should not on the whole be higher or more restrictive than the general incidence of the duties and regulations of such commerce applicable in these countries prior to the formation of a CU or", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb976124-d834-4195-872a-a36a0744dfdf": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb976124-d834-4195-872a-a36a0744dfdf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing RTAs in the Context of the Flying Geese Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b92548d133342425f5bcf2a22d8a53e0c775474dd444600f0c643954fab17eac"}}, "hash": "b92548d133342425f5bcf2a22d8a53e0c775474dd444600f0c643954fab17eac", "text": "free trade area. And a reasonable length of time\u201d condition: any CU or free trade area should be formed within \u201ca reasonable length of time.\u201d This ambiguous term has lately been clarified to mean exceeding ten years only in exceptional circumstances. All RTAs and interim agreements must be notified to the Council for Trade in Goods (CTG) and be examined by the Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA) for their conformity to these criteria. In addition to these criteria, clarifications added on like all parties should liberalize their trade in products on a reciprocal basis. Article XXIV only covers RTAs \u201cbetween the territories of contracting parties.\u201d In other words, any RTA involving a non-contracting party cannot be understood as an RTA in the terms of Article XXIV and, consequently, cannot be justified as an exception to MFN obligations. In order for RTAs involving non-members to be approved, the procedure is expected to be in accordance with Article XXIV: 10. The Enabling Clause legalized derogations from MFN obligations in favor of developing countries. The Enabling Clause covers regional or global arrangements entered into \u201camongst less-developed contracting parties\u201d for the mutual reduction or elimination of tariffs and non-tariff measures \u201con products;\u201d. Trade arrangements among developing countries are designed not to raise barriers to or create undue difficulties for trade with any other contracting parties. Trade arrangements among developing countries shall not constitute an impediment to the reduction or elimination of tariffs and other restrictions to trade on an MFN basis;. Trade arrangements among developing countries are to be reported to the Committee on Trade and Development (CTD). Notification and examination of the consistency of such arrangements with WTO rules are not essentially required. The introduction of the Enabling Clause into the WTO legal framework implies approval of two different rules applicable to preferential trade arrangements in goods. Which rule applies to the relevant RTA depends on the status of participating parties. RTAs that include even one developed country as a participating party are governed by Article XXIV, whereas RTAs between developing countries fall into the Enabling Clause category. From the viewpoint of the current WTO legal system, North-South RTAs are covered by Article XXIV. One major challenge as the author states if the lack of definition of a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d within the leads to another problem of what countries can enjoy the rights granted by these provisions. However, some cases were or are examined for their compatibility with WTO rules by the related committee. For example, Mercado Com\u00fan del Sur (MERCOSUR) is under examination by the CRTA. 15 6. Regional Cooperation and Regional Trade Agreements Standard approaches for evaluating regional trade agreements utilize a metric that measures the distance between truly free trade and the less-than-free trade rules resulting reciprocal deals among countries. With relaxation of assumptions about the complete substitutability of goods across borders and the introduction of dynamic effects, the sophistication in the application of this metric has increased. However, this sophistication has been bought at the cost of results that suggest that it might indeed be in the interest of subgroups of countries to form trading blocs, and beggar the rest of the world, a result that most trade economists would frown upon. The development impact of trade is not as important as the efficiency impact and arguments about the undesireability otherwise of these results are suggested. As mentioned above, even the possibility of retaliation is an argument against countries should doing something in their interest (the proper principle being the net benefit, including the cost of retaliation). Standard approaches do not capture the wider range of economic cooperation activities that would be development promoting as has been suggested by the flying geese literature, which is discussed in the next section, or the development literature in general. Most conspicuously missing is the investment-trade impact of regional cooperation, which only gravity models can capture reasonably. Yeyati et al. [2002] attempt to correlate FDI location with regional trade agreement (in this case the proposed Free Trade Area for the Americas). Having these views, we argue an alternative framework, which emphasizes sector-by-sector trade, and production cooperation is required for an impact assessments of RTAs. While the CGE framework is capable of a sectoral disaggregation, its specifications are heavily mediated by prices, which discourage researchers from explicitly taking into consideration increasing economies of scale and learning-by-doing considerations. Research must also consider product cycles and sectoral development across national boundaries, the kind of approach that would be suggested in the following as the flying geese framework. 16 7.

Akamatsu analyzed patterns of the levels Japanese imports, domestic production, and exports plotted against time on a sectoral basis and noticed each of these variables followed an inverted-V pattern11 and were related to each other in a phased, overlapping, manner. For example, pattern of the level of imports increases in the initial period and would begin declining while domestic production begins to increase. When domestic production reaches a certain point, exports from the sector begin to increase. Eventually, domestic production would also begin to decline as the country loses competitiveness in the sector. He metaphorically called these patterns as \u201cflying geese.\u201d As opposed to Western-style theorizing which places heavy emphasis on analyzing associations between variables, \u201cflying geese\u201d is heavily time-bound and instantaneous jumps, such as the hypothesized positive impacts of sudden trade liberalization, are not in prospect under this framework. Nevertheless, three basic ideas can be seen as basic underpinnings of the approach: 1. Product cycle theory - As it applies to specific industries, the theory conforms with Vernon\u2019s [1966] product cycle model. Kwan [2002, p. 2] suggests that the flying geese pattern traces the product cycle trend in industrial competitiveness across sectors. Capital accumulation in the industry, interacting with forward and backward linkages with other industries, changes the comparative advantage of the country. When this pattern is examined through time across industries, one can see the march of these inverted-U curves toward industries of increasing capital intensity in successfully industrializing countries. 10 Kojima [2000] refers to Akamatsu [1935]. 11 The reported empirical patterns are closer to inverted U\u2019s , not V\u2019s. But \u201cV\u201d evokes the flying geese pattern better. 17 2. \u201cPro-trade\u201d oriented foreign direct investment (FDI) \u2013 This refers to the transplanting of production activities from countries losing comparative advantage to other countries in the form of foreign direct investment. Kojima [2000, p. 376] refers to this FDI as \u201cpro-trade\u201d because the production transferred is meant to be part of the production process of the investing country, and not primarily intended to serve the market of the host country. The transplanted production activities would strengthen the comparative advantage of the host country and would represent a move toward more advanced and capital intensive production. This is consistent with a contagion pattern of growth and industrial upgrading among investing and receiving countries. 3. \u201cAgreed specialization\u201d \u2013 While Kojima\u2019s terminology would strike most economists as a odd, it refers to the impact of cross-country production specialization if there is a need to attain a minimum scale of production.12 When production requires a minimum optimal scale, for example, unit production costs are decreasing until such a scale is obtained. By specializing in different activities, countries could take advantage of these scale economies and attain higher production levels and lower average costs than would be the case than if they attempted to undertake all activities. Because \u201cagreed specialization\u201d involves trade in subparts of production, intra-industry trade is more easily explained in this framework. The competing Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson (HOS) model of specialization through trade is predicated on diminishing returns to scale. The HOS model explains specialization as taking advantage of a country\u2019s inherited comparative advantage, which can be immediately accessed through precipitous trade liberalization. The HOS model is reticent about (domestic and foreign) investment and how comparative advantage can be built up subsequently in more advanced sectors. There has been a discussion about the utility of the \u201cflying geese\u201d framework. Is a purely descriptive account of Japanese trade-oriented development, mostly unconsciously implemented, which has no policy implications? Is the framework outdated and inapplicable because of the possibility of \u201cleapfrogging\u201d and because the product cycle is much shorter? 18 Using Kojima [2000]\u2019s interpretation, some of the policy implications of this framework can be summarized as follows: 1. The role of investment - The framework places equal emphasis on investment as on trade flows, as an explanatory variable to the patterns of imports, domestic production, and exports by sector. 2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1987e2d6-27cc-42d4-bc59-143f8d49b9f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1987e2d6-27cc-42d4-bc59-143f8d49b9f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Assessing RTAs in the Context of the Flying Geese Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83a5e474dbecacd957b0d4f9040d1e3e8064b6d8e5a5ca7ad84ca35e93513b8e"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d995926-ec82-49f3-a45a-f5c67a15645b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/assessing-rtas-context-flying-geese-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab5a6585f6280d6f7861c76a7acaf6e41c2a542d674d789c2a30dfa4aad41d87"}}, "hash": "bf61aa6d1bb067ab8be309eaf10c8af7c7b1662f1239798e5588526826323a40", "text": "2.

We are interested in the framework a source of indicators with which to evaluate efforts at regional cooperation in trade and industrial development in the region. 8. Scope for Flying Geese Type Regional Cooperation In the ideal world of independent actors, all countries are competitors in the world market and in their own domestic markets; this provides the needed pressure for innovation and efficiency. The cooperation in trade and investment among countries at different stages of development is based on the potential for mutual benefit. Are competitive pressures so dominant that they obviate regional cooperation? A key issue is: As a large economy with a significant human skill endowment, can China leapfrog the development process? A leapfrogging China will create a formidable competitor to the South East Asian economies, both in world markets and their own domestic markets. 12 This framework would also logically apply to the situation of increasing returns to scale in different subcomponents of the production process. 19 Kwan [2002] analyzes the potential for competition in the region using a flying geese inspired framework. He proposes a two stage procedure. First he derives a \u201cproduct sophistication index\u201d for internationally trade products using export data and per capita incomes of the countries exporting these productions. He then calculates an overall \u201ccountry sophistication index\u201d by applying the product sophistication index to a country\u2019s export structure. The country sophistication index then indicates whether countries are competitors or complements. Based on these calculations, Japan has the highest level of advancement in the region, the South East Asian countries are in the midrange of sophistication, and China is evidently behind the South East Asian countries. The distribution of each country\u2019s exports can be plotted against the product sophistication index and it is possible then to study extent to which these distributions overlap across countries. These patterns suggest that the Southeast Asian countries, tightly grouped around the middle, are competitors in terms of the sophistication of their export structures. Over time, China\u2019s distribution curve of export sophistication has been steadily moving toward greater sophistication. In 2000, labor- intensive products still dominated China\u2019s export structure; China and Japan were competitors in about 16.3 percent of their exports to the U.S. [Kwan 2002, p. 6]. There is a steady, but not sudden, trend in terms of China is becoming an important competitor to Southeast Asia. These calculations highlight the potential role that industrial and technological upgrading across that is found in the literature mentioned in Section 3 as an offshoot of regional cooperation (Schiff et. al. [2002], Blomstrom and Koko [1997]). 9.0 Conclusion In this paper we propose the argument that existing evaluations of RTAs based on conventional methods are not rich enough to provide all the necessary methods for assessing their impacts from a human development perspective. We claim this not only because of the static nature of conventional analysis, which leaves no room for dynamic impact assessments. More important, because increased trade does not necessarily coincide 20 with development, to focus narrowly on the expanded trade impacts of RTAs is to miss key aspects of the role of trade in development. The assumption that development is the default ex-post outcome of increased trade has an uncertain standing in the literature. Evaluations of RTAs need to consider the possible positive and/or negative impacts on industrial development of different sectors. We believe that assessments which focus only on the changes in trade volume and ignore investment, both in terms of the extent and the sectoral structure of investment, are incomplete and do not capture the links between trade, investment and development. In this context, we think there is a scope for the flying geese framework as a possible approach to evaluating RTAs. This paper does not provide a new comprehensive framework but makes an attempt to introduce the insights of the flying geese framework, which provides a good starting point for an alternative assessment methodology. We believe further research is needed to do the groundwork for a formal approach that takes into account the shorthcomings of the existing methods. 21 References Akamatsu, Kaname [1935] \u201cWaga kuni yomo kogyohin no susei.\u201d Shogyo Keizai Ronso, 13. pp. 129-212.

ASEAN has had no effect of its own on promoting trade among its member countries. The volume of trade among EAEC has been at a high level compared with the hypothetical trade level since 1960. The amount of trade between EAEC economies and other APEC countries has been growing throughout the postwar period. There has been close trade relations among APEC economies plus some other Asian countries.

At the extreme bounds, when all weight is attached to the prior distribution, none of the RTAs are found to be trade creating. Elliott & Ikemoto (2004) investigates the effect of AFTA on world and regional trade patterns Trade flows were not significantly affected in the years immediately following the signing of the AFTA agreement in 1993 and reinforces the findings of previous studies. However, when they find evidence of a positive AFTA effect overtime that has gradually increased. They also find that the Asian economic crisis may have worked as a trigger for a further acceleration of the process and de facto economic integration itself. Evidence suggests that the effect of the Asian economic crisis was to generate a stronger desire to source imports from within the region (even though the effect seems to have been relatively small). 28 Table A4. Previous Studies on RTAs in Asia and the Pacific using CGE Models Selected Studies Experiments Main Findings Scollay and Gilbert (2002) Experiments are done both full trade liberalization case and for liberalization of nonagricultural goods only. 1. China-Korea-Japan FTA 2. ASEAN+3 (ASEAN + China-Korea-Japan) 3. ASEAN plus three plus CER (ASEAN+ China-Korea-Japan- New Zealand-Australia) 4. ASEAN - China 5. ASEAN - Japan A China-Japan-Korea FTA has the potential to provide large benefits for its members, however it would be significantly trade diverting. Expanding it to an \u201cASEAN+3\u201d FTA would have even greater welfare benefits for those involved, but would still have noticeable trade diversion effects. Individual agreements with ASEAN provide only small welfare gains for China, Japan and Korea, but if they are excluded (i.e Korea from the ASEAN-Japan agreement), welfare effects become negative. Welfare for New Zealand and Australia is improved greatly in the ASEAN+3+CER arrangement, especially if agriculture is included. Japan gains most in the ASEAN+3+CER agreement, while for Korea it is second only to ASEAN+3. China experiences positive but weak effects in the context of this arrangement. Yang, Duncan and Vines (1999) 1. Australasia (Australia and New Zealand) unilaterally remove trade restrictions. 2. ASEAN joins Australasia in concerted unilateral MFN liberalization. 3. The \u2018Rest of Asia\u2019 joins Australasia and ASEAN in concerted unilateral MFN liberalization. 4. Japan and Nort h America join the countries in (3) in concerted unilateral MFN liberalization. 5. The Rest of the World liberalizes trade resulting in global trade liberalization. Unilateral trade liberalisation can lead to a terms of trade deterioration which may overpower the efficiency gains. The APEC strategy of concerted unilateral MFN liberalisation may overcome this problem, as countries liberalise at the same time, and the terms of trade effects are lessened. Economic size is important, as large countries which liberalise unilaterally could see large terms of trade losses, although even small countries which are important traders of certain goods could see significant terms of trade effects upon liberalisation. Thus, concerted unilateral liberalization will have the best effects when countries with complementary economic structures liberalize simultaneously. Overall the results are \u2018broadly sympathetic\u2019 to APEC\u2019s strategy of concerted unilateral MFN liberalisation. Chirathivat, Suthiphand (August 2002) 1. Tariff liberalization between China and ASEAN. 2. Removal of non-tariff barriers between China and ASEAN. Both China and the ASEAN-6 bloc stand to gain from the formation of an FTA, with overall trade creation exceeding trade diversion. In the case of ASEAN-6 there is evidence of trade diversion away from the US, Japan and the EU in favour of China. In the case of China these trade diversion effects are not so pronounced. Davis, Mckibbin, Stoekel (June 2000) 1. AFTA-CER liberalisation, Australia and New Zealand embark on reduction schedule in line with AFTA liberalisation. 2.

No time frame given. 4. Unilateral. Scenario 3 plus Vietnam extends unilateral liberalisation to the rest of the world. 5. APEC liberalisation on an MFN basis to 2.5% across the board. The static effects of Vietnam\u2019s accession to AFTA are small, excluded products limit tradecreation, while there is some evidence of trade -diversion. Since Singapore dominates as Vietnam\u2019s main export market, and trade barriers there are already low, gains from improved status in this market are small. MFN liberalisation is much more preferable. Accession to AFTA appears to benefit Vietnam\u2019s agricultural sectors, while broader unilateral liberalisation favours labour intensive manufacturing sectors. Moving from scenario 1 to scenario 4 there is a favourable impact on export volumes, however export prices fall and therefore terms of trade effects are negative Wang and Schuh (2000) 1. Formation of a Chinese Economic Area (CEA). Complete tariff liberalisation between China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Short term static effects only. 2. Formation of a Chinese Economic Area (CEA). Complete tariff liberalisation between China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Medium term capital accumulation effects considered. Trade creation exceeds trade diversion and if the political relationsh ip between China and Taiwan improves and transport costs on the Taiwan Straits decrease trade flows in this area could increase three fold. The gains from economic integration are substantial but many political factors stand in the way. Brown, Deardorff and Stern (December 2002) 1. APEC liberalization (preferential, not regionalism) 2. ASEAN + 3 ( Japan, Korea and China/Hong Kong) 3. NAFTA + Chile 4. Western Hemisphere FTA For these four scenarios liberalisation takes the form combined removal of agricultural and manufacture tariffs and services barriers. 5. Japan- Singapore 6. Japan- Korea 7. Japan- Mexico Benefits of preferential liberalisation accrue mainly to the developed countries and thus for developing countries multilateral liberalisation is more desirable. Multilateral liberalisation gives greater benefits across the board. Regional and bilateral trade agreements can be welfare enhancing for those involved, but trade diversion effects exist in almost all circumstances. 30 8. Japan- Chile 9. US- Chile 10.

APEC MFN liberalisation Both the gravity model analysis and CGE simulations find that there are likely to be significant welfare gains from the realization of some of the new RTA proposals in the Asia Pacific area. In some cases there seems to be a connection between \u2018natural\u2019 trading blocs and welfare benefits. However, these \u2018natural\u2019 trading blocs are not necessarily less trade diverting, and in some cases more so. APEC MFN liberalisation is by far the most welfare enhancing and by nature of the proposal does not lead to trade diversion. The question is whether the formation of smaller RTAs in the region will ultimately lead towards, or away from, this APEC liberalisation. Scollay and Gilbert (2001) 1. Japan- Canada 2.

Global liberalisation The effects of many of these subregional FTAs in the Asia-Pacific region tend to be negligible, however dynamic effects may contribute more than static effects alone can show. Larger groupings provide greater welfare benefits for those involved and avoid the complications of having various smaller blocs. APEC continues to offer superior welfare benefits for the region and is the best alternative short of complete global liberalisation. The welfare gains from having a large East Asian and/or Western hemisphere trading bloc are potentially large, but the agreements will need to be as inclusive as possible to realize maximum benefits. 31 28.

None of those studies, however, considered the heterogeneity in the impact of those shocks on agricultural wages by gender. Using district-level panel data based on national sample survey data for India from 1993 to 2007, the basis for this study was to examine how rainfall shocks, which affect demand for labour in Indian agriculture, alter wage gaps between men and women in the agriculture sector. Overall, it was found that such shocks do not affect the wage gaps, but in the rainfed rice-growing regions of India, low rainfall years widen gender wage gaps, with women farmers suffering a greater loss in their wages as compared to their male counterparts. The cultivation of rice is highly sensitive to rainfall variability under rainfed conditions. Women workers are heavily concentrated in the cultivation of crops, such as rice, that are severely affected by rainfall variability, making them more vulnerable to labour market losses during bad rainfall years. In other words, the effect of rainfall shocks on gender wage gaps in agriculture depends upon the gender roles underlying the technology of production in agriculture, which varies across cropping systems. Focus group discussions conducted in 26 villages in two states in India, Maharashtra and Orissa, validated the empirical findings. With regard to rice cultivation, low rainfall affected operations that tended to be conducted by women more than the operations that were predominately carried out by men and the shift in cropping patterns from rice to other crops as a result of low rainfall reduced demand for women labourers relative to men. In terms of labour supply response to weather variability, men appeared to have a clear advantage in searching for non-agriculture work outside their villages as compared to women, who are generally the main caregivers of children and other family members, as well the caretakers of the household.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b2d2c8c-85c1-4ffe-a86e-7aa8c6bd86ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b2d2c8c-85c1-4ffe-a86e-7aa8c6bd86ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eb02619b7f67ad5403821f39771f129b7e13fda8fdead0045b760792198ad555"}, "2": {"node_id": "b65ff1d1-442e-4d18-88a2-d39a251cac2f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80dcb0072437faff31274772133f9877056a911ac2310288d13aeb2e57f6c9db"}}, "hash": "699c6f2f2761f131943dcd879291be42dac5948a98cc25d6f51db7d9ebb4e3d7", "text": "The focus group discussions validated that women\u2019s increased time spent in home production activities, such as collecting water, fodder and firewood, and doing unpaid work, such as taking care of sick children, in years of low rainfall, kept them away from the labour market.

They characteristically reported increased incidence of joint pains, low platelet counts and fainting due to lower nutrition intakes and being tasked with the more stressful and exhausting work of fetching water. Not only did women undertake household chores, but in families suffering from economic difficulties, they also searched for non-agriculture or agricultural work outside their villages, which coupled with greater housework, led to fatigue. Drought and lack of alternative job opportunities also forced women into sex work. The paper concludes with some policy suggestions. The drought management policy of the Government of India has special provisions for women and children, such as supplying vitamins during drought years; however, the focus group discussions revealed that those schemes were mostly dysfunctional at the ground level. The distribution mechanism of nutritional supplements and other goods needs to be well defined in order to achieve greater accountability in implementing those schemes. The drought management policy calls for drinking water to be supplied only when no other source of drinking water is available. This policy needs to be revised by specifying a minimum distance within which water should be available to the villagers for other essential purposes, such as feeding livestock, bathing and washing utensils and clothes. In addition, even if drinking water is available near the village, it is often contaminated during low rainfall years and the limited amount of useable water leads to longer waiting hours for women tasked with collecting it. Since water collection is the sole responsibility of women in India, a comprehensive water management policy during drought can decrease their drudgery and reduce the adverse consequences on their health, which in some cases result in deaths. Thus, for drought management policies to benefit women, a strong focus must be placed on water, health and sanitation requirements. 1 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA 1. Introduction Labour economists have long been concerned with the measurement of wage gaps across demographic groups, such as gender, race and ethnicity, in different occupations. As noted in many countries, there is also a persistent gap in agricultural wages received by females and males in India. Agricultural wages in India respond to rainfall variability since Indian agriculture is predominantly rainfed. This can have an impact on gender wage gap in agriculture depending upon asymmetric labour demand and labour supply effects of rainfall variability on male and female labour in agriculture. In the present paper, the effect of rainfall shocks on the gender wage gap in agriculture was estimated and possible mechanisms that led to the observed results were explored. Most studies on wage gaps across different demographic groups have been concerned with the proportion of the wage gap that could be attributed to individual observable characteristics and market institutions or trends in wage gaps over time within countries that could be explained by changing labour market conditions. Very few studies examine the cyclical nature of those wage gaps due to tightening in the labour market caused by recessionary conditions. O\u2019Neill (1985) and more recently Biddle and Hamermesh (2011) analysed the impact of aggregate changes in unemployment rates in the economy on the gender wage gap in wages using data from the United States of America. O\u2019Neill (1985) found that the gender wage gap increased when high unemployment rates prevailed in the economy and attributed it to possibly the greater vulnerability of females to layoffs due to their lower skill levels. Biddle and Hamermesh (2011) also found that gender wage gaps were countercyclical in nature. They attributed them to greater discrimination against females during economic downturns. Contrary evidence to the above was presented by Solon, Barsky and Parker (1994), Park and Shin (2005) and Marchand and Olfert (2013). Using other datasets and time periods for the United States, they estimated that gender wage gaps were pro-cyclical in nature. This they argue was due to males being over represented in industries with more pro-cyclical demand. Aller and Arce (2001) also found that the gender wage gap narrowed during the 1990-1994 economic recession in Spain due to an increase in employment in service industries. Ashenfelter (1970) and Freeman (1973) are examples of other studies that examined the cyclical effect on wage gaps. The latter study entailed analysing the effect of unemployment rates on the black-white wage gap in the Unites States. In the Indian context, literature on the effects of recessionary conditions on labour market outcomes is limited. The only study that the author is aware of is Bhalotra (2010) who found that a decrease in state-level income (a proxy for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09f15055-1b12-4c67-97c6-af6c8680700b": {"__data__": {"id_": "09f15055-1b12-4c67-97c6-af6c8680700b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bcc5cc66346fdcb4f3af98b31face35c9a3d8a19c13ba41cb17cb95f71ca04ec"}}, "hash": "bcc5cc66346fdcb4f3af98b31face35c9a3d8a19c13ba41cb17cb95f71ca04ec", "text": "recessionary conditions in labour market) boosted women\u2019s labour force participation in the agriculture sector. The author has yet to find a paper that contains an analysis of the impact of adverse demand shocks in rural labour markets on gender gap in rural agricultural wages or employment in a developing country context. Agriculture plays a pivotal role in employment generation in developing countries. Indian agriculture witnessed rapid productivity growth during the 1970s and 1980s due to a series of steps which entailed the introduction of new farm technology, often referred to as the \u201cGreen Revolution\u201d. This led to the introduction of high-yield variety seeds, the expansion of irrigated areas and intensive input use. Thereafter, growth in agricultural productivity has slowed (Bhalla and Singh, 2001). In the 1990s and 2000s, Indian agriculture experienced very low-yield growth and correspondingly growth in agricultural wages also slowed (Himanshu, 2005). The contribution of agriculture to the Indian economy is low, approximately 15 percent of its gross domestic product (Ministry of Finance, 2011), and is declining. However, it continues to be the mainstay of the Indian economy in terms of its share of employment. Rural population comprises 72 percent of the total population of India, and three-quarters of the rural workforce is engaged in agriculture (Ministry of Home Affairs, 2001). Agriculture thus remains the sector that employs the most workers. Agricultural labourers constitute 45 percent of the agricultural workforce (ibid.). Landless households, which form the lowest income quintile in India, are completely dependent on wage labour for their income. The members of those households mostly work in agriculture as casual labourers since regular wage contracts in agriculture are limited (National Sample Survey Organisation, 2004). In terms of gender composition, about 74 percent of the female work force in India is engaged in agriculture. Notably, 2 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA feminization of the agricultural workforce is increasing as men are able to find alternate non-farm opportunities while women have difficulty in gaining access to non-farm jobs. As noted in many other countries, there is also a persistent gender wage gap in agriculture in India (table 1.1). Overall, daily wages paid to women are about 70 percent of the amount paid to men. This ratio has improved only slightly over the last decade. Mahajan and Ramaswami (2012) analysed the cross-sectional variation in wage ratios across Indian districts to find determinants that affected the spatial variation in wage ratios, particularly the large wage gaps observed in the southern states of India. They found that spatial variation in female labour supply, landholding inequality and rice cultivation were some of the important determinants of female to male wage ratios across Indian states. One cannot observe any trend over time in wage gaps except for in the Indian state of Rajasthan which showed a clear reduction in the gender wage gap. The present paper is focused on overtime fluctuations in gender wage gaps in agriculture due to productivity shocks that affect agricultural wages by altering the demand for labour in agriculture, such as rainfall variability.

In the past few decades, climate change has made rainfall more variable in India, leading to a recurrence of drought-like situations across different parts of India in different years. Each year, a particular area of the country suffers from rainfall scarcity, resulting in low agricultural output, which, in turn, affects the livelihood of people in rural India. Of the 22 countrywide major droughts that occurred in India in the last 120 years, seven took place in the last three decades. Indian agriculture is still predominantly rainfed with less than 50 percent of the cultivable area under irrigation. As agricultural output is highly susceptible to rainfall shocks, those shocks have an adverse effect on agricultural wages. Such aggregate shocks are difficult to insure against using informal networks as they are correlated at the community level.

Effect of weather shocks on economic outcomes Apart from affecting the labour markets in agriculture, weather shocks can have an effect on other economic and social outcomes. Weather variability provides a natural experiment for researchers. Consequently, a large body of research that focuses on the impact of climatic variability on a range of outcomes has been released in recent years. The discussions below consist of a few relevant areas in which those impacts have been analysed. 2.1. Wages A few papers have looked into the overall impact of rainfall shocks on agricultural wages. Jayachandran (2006) measured the impact of productivity shocks on district-level agricultural wages for men in India and concluded that a negative productivity shock lowered the wages significantly. This effect was less pronounced in districts that were more developed in terms of access to roads and banks. Mueller and Quisumbing (2011) studied the impact of the flood in Bangladesh in 1998 on agricultural and non-agricultural wages. They found that there was a short-term reduction in wages in general, but that the reduction was less for agricultural workers who were able to find employment in the non-agricultural sector. Mueller and Osgood (2009) looked at the short-term and long-term effects of droughts on wages. They argued that the long-term effect was the sale of productive assets during the shock to sustain consumption and the corresponding extensive time period to replenish them. They used data on both rural and urban areas in Brazil and found that adverse rainfall shocks of up to five years in the past could have effects on individual wages. Adhvaryu, Chari and Sharma (2011) quantified the impact of rainfall shocks on manufacturing employment and output in India and found that both of those figures fell when rainfall shock was negative, particularly to a greater extent in pro- employer states. This reduction was more significant for small factories and agro-based industries in India. However, as mentioned above, no studies have specifically looked into possible differential impacts of such shocks on female and male wages and their consequences on the gender wage gap in agriculture. 2.2. Agriculture and poverty There is considerable evidence in the Indian context about the impact of climate change on agriculture and poverty. Guiteras (2009) estimated the impact of climate change on Indian agriculture. Using a district-level panel data set, he applied a random year-to-year variation in weather to measure its impact on agricultural output, and predicted that over the period 2010-2039, major crop yields would fall by 4.5 to 9 percent. The long-term impact depended on the adaptability of Indian farmers to the new weather conditions. The ability to adapt would be hindered by low levels of education among the farmers and limited access to capital. Thomas, Christiaensen, Do and Trung (2010) found that in Viet Nam, short-term losses from natural disasters, such as riverine floods, resulted in welfare losses measured in per capita consumption expenditure of up to 23 percent, while hurricanes reduced per capita expenditure by up to 52 percent. They also found long-term negative effects associated with droughts, flash floods and hurricanes. Skoufias, Essama-Nssah and Katayama (2011) evaluated the impact of rainfall shocks on the welfare of households in rural Indonesia and found that lower rainfall had a negative effect on per capita expenditure of rice-farming households. Gaiha and Imai (2004), using a panel dataset from a semi-arid region of India, measured the impact of crop- income shocks on per capita income of the household and found that even relatively affluent households were vulnerable to long spells of poverty when such shocks occurred. 4 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA 2.3.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fb1a608-9e14-46aa-a6bc-83ba08dee675": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fb1a608-9e14-46aa-a6bc-83ba08dee675", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a42b9c4d57ff3cd7b1a068d0015f40a054a751559251869debb24d826a23c8f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a61ee82-8ce5-4110-8667-bc5905604b38", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0eb5726934470c837d72f775e61e6844bc6bf3036108d7ef16befdb3c7617991"}}, "hash": "0e132826df8d96b89879701b25188f88fa709e622536afd3550ece2e6051b8c8", "text": "Consumption smoothing Another body of literature has looked into the household responses to ex ante and ex post risk.

Aggregate shocks, on the other hand, affect the local area and to that extent are more difficult to insure against through informal networks within a community since all households face a similar adverse situation. Literature on consumption smoothing has suggested different mechanisms through which households in less developed countries could protect themselves against idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks. Among their options of doing this were growing their food crops for their personal consumption (Fafchamps, 1992; Kurosaki and Fafchamps 2002), diversifying the crops they grew in order to mitigate possible unfavourable conditions (Fafchamps, 1992), tapping credit and informal borrowing within village networks (Townsend, 1994), participating in village labour markets to diversify income sources (Kochar, 1999), migrating temporarily to nearby towns or cities (Halliday, 2010; Badiani and Safir, 2008) or depleting household assets (Fafchamps, Udry and Czukas, 1998). Kanwar (1995), Kochar (1999), Rose (2001) and Maitra (2001) used panel data in the Indian context to evaluate the impact of income shocks on household off-farm labour supply to cope with risk. Rose (2001) looked at the impact of ex ante and ex post shocks on household participation in market work, agricultural profits and income. In the theoretical model, she showed that households reduced ex ante risk by increasing off-farm labour work and partaking in less leisure activities. Households, in response to ex-post shocks, increased their off-farm labour work to smooth income. Empirically, she found that market work increased in response to negative shocks and households in riskier environments participate more in market labour. Maitra (2001) analysed the impact of idiosyncratic and aggregate shocks on household leisure consumption and off-farm work and found that for small farmers, off-farm work acted as a safety net. Kanwar (1995) and Kochar (1999) examined the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on male and female off-farm work hours separately. They failed to find any significant effect of household specific shocks on female off-farm labour supply and reported only suggestive results of consumption smoothing through participation in market labour by males. The above studies, notably, did not make a distinction between types of off-farm employment. Ito and Kurosaki (2009) filled that gap and further divided the off-farm activities of a household into agricultural wage work in cash and in kind and non-agricultural wage work. Their study offered better insight into the possible mechanism through which off-farm labour might act as a shock-absorber in the advent of aggregate shocks. They used the cross-sectional variation across Indian districts and not over-time changes in labour allocation due to such aggregate shocks. Halliday (2010) appeared to be the only paper that looked into time disposition by gender of idiosyncratic shocks. This is an important aspect as risk coping strategies may be different for men and women and may have a differential impact on their welfare. Halliday (2010) found that harvest loss led to an increase in field hours of men while livestock loss resulted in increased field hours of both women and men. An earthquake, on the other hand, increased demand for home production and hence, boosted the hours spent on domestic work, and decreased livestock production by women. He argued that this was compatible with a theoretical framework in which household members were allocated to sectors according to their comparative advantage when their household was affected by an adverse income shock. A stream of literature focused on migration as a mechanism to cope with aggregate shocks. Halliday (2010) and Badiani and Safir (2008) are a few important papers on this topic.1 Halliday (2010) found that in El Salvador, negative agricultural idiosyncratic shocks led to the migration of males, whereas earthquakes significantly led to a cutback in the migration of females as households tended to retain labour for recovery following a major natural disaster. Badiani and Safir (2008) analysed the panel data from India to see if temporary migration was a strategy adopted by households to cope with income shocks in rural parts of the country. Notably, India is a very special case for migrant labourers because most of the migration is temporary 1 Davis and Winters (2001) did not specifically estimate the effect of shocks on migration. They studied the factors that influence migration and found that networks dominated by females affected the probability of female migrants travelling to a specific location. 5 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f867b7d3-55c8-4183-8fc2-fc3b02064fe3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f867b7d3-55c8-4183-8fc2-fc3b02064fe3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "face22d33991c28ab61378e13d4bd57fdc5a4ff4d0dc2b90ec6499586bd5ddaf"}, "2": {"node_id": "230590e5-c0c9-41dc-8dc2-be965fa547cd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "024aea99ee1df134434cf8f91f33d5eb5f8b52dfba4f6f6091707d8ecc545085"}}, "hash": "c57d092afc9e1fecf81ab68b8e9fbdd231016ab95e8c951ef33fda46c0d0e330", "text": "5 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA in nature and very seldom do people settle in their new locations permanently (Munshi and Rosenzweig, 2009).

They found that cultivator households temporarily migrated during bad years while agricultural labourer households, in general, engaged in temporary migration to diversify their income. Migration seems to be a strategy used in aggregate shocks, while the local village labour market was used to smooth income in the case of idiosyncratic shocks. Dillon, Mueller and Salau (2010) found suggestive evidence in Nigeria to support the hypothesis that households with higher ex ante risk were more likely to send males to migrate. In response to an ex-post shock with a high temperature, however, they found that the number of men migrating from a household fell. Sabarwal, Sinha and Buvinic (2010) presented a survey of the papers that looked into the impact of economic crises on women\u2019s participation in the labour force and other welfare outcomes, such as fertility, schooling and health. They found that women\u2019s participation in the labour force increased more among low- and middle-income households than in upper-income ones and households in which members were less educated. Those studies mostly focused on urban areas. In a few rural studies, it had been found that the female labourers work hours in agriculture increased, but the number of women employed did not. Bhalotra and Uma\u00f1a-Aponte (2010) found that in Asian and Latin American countries, income and employment of women was countercyclical in nature. Bhalotra (2010) found that women in India on average were more likely to work in recessionary conditions. However, as indicated by Kim and Voos (2007), the context and the level of development were also factors. They noted that in the Republic of Korea, during economic crises, a greater number of young girls dropped out of the labour market as compared to labour force entrants. Thus, the nature of the crises mattered in terms of sectors affected by it and the alternative work opportunities available to men and women. 2.4. Social outcomes Apart from the above labour market and household welfare-related outcomes, a few papers looked into other possible impacts of the shocks on social aspects from a gender perspective. Using data from the National Family Health Survey, Zimmerman (2011) found that girls' school enrolment was more vulnerable to rainfall shocks than that of boys, with 6-10 year-old children driving those results. She further attributed the absence of young girls in school to credit constraints, and of older girls to the low perceived net benefits of education. Young girls might also be kept out of school during adverse shocks to help their mothers with daily chores, such as fetching water or fuelwood. Rose (1999), in her estimates based on a sample of rural Indian children, found that in early childhood favourable rainfall shocks increased girls\u2019 probability to survive. These findings also suggest that in the case of adverse shocks, such as drought, girls were the first ones to leave school and perhaps the first ones to die from hunger. Another strand of literature has looked at the persistence of the adverse impacts in early childhood on long term socioeconomic outcomes of men and women, such as health and education. Maccini and Yang (2009) analysed the impact of positive rainfall shocks in early childhood and found that those shocks were associated with better long-term socioeconomic outcomes for Indonesian women than men, reflecting gender bias in the allocation of resources. Sekhri and Storeygard (2011) examined the effect of local precipitation shocks in India using annual deviations of rainfall from the long-term local mean, and found that dry shocks (below-average rainfall) were associated with increased reported domestic violence against women and dowry deaths, while other forms of sexual harassment declined. They argued that those patterns were consistent with a framework of consumption smoothing by those exposed to weather risks since dowries could be used to boost household income. Neumayer and Pl\u00fcmper (2007), using a sample of 141 countries in which natural disasters occurred during the period 1981-2002, analysed the impact of natural disasters on life expectancy of women and men. They found that natural disasters lowered the life expectancy of women more than that of men and the stronger the disaster, the greater that effect had on the gender gap in life expectancy. They also found that the higher the women\u2019s socioeconomic status, the weaker that effect had 6 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA on the gender gap in life expectancy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9032bb14-3f69-4149-8c00-eac9abdeaa36": {"__data__": {"id_": "9032bb14-3f69-4149-8c00-eac9abdeaa36", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e71797ad7cbd26c7eb3b33e921cbbf2a52b87d7e3964ae1b07edf29cf9b7fd3"}, "2": {"node_id": "41e7d6c7-a1f8-4b70-abf6-6d55014a0b56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "241191b751ad9a40a1b85279ad802839b425bc78cb98e6bf35e9c2c81cbf7888"}}, "hash": "08d850587a960aab38f1befb84f21b4fa136e24d138692ec6335b306fa306a16", "text": "Dankelman et al.

Climate change and women Limited empirical evidence exists on the potential impacts of climate change on women. There is, however, growing recognition that climate change can affect the lives of women by limiting the availability of natural resources, such as fuelwood, water and forests. Also, men and women are likely to cope differently with climate change due to socially-constructed gender roles (Dankelman et al., 2008). Deforestation can lead to shortages of fuel for cooking, which particularly affects the large number of rural households that depend on wood for their fuel needs. Also, the drying up of nearby bodies of water due to droughts or over-exploitation increases the time spent retrieving water for household chores, a task that is usually carried out by women. Notably, the additional time spent to carry out this task cuts into the time available to engage in income- generating activities. Livestock management in households is also typically performed by women. During times of drought or flood or extreme temperature conditions, animals are lost due to drowning or starvation. This lowers the amount of animal products which were earlier available to the household for either self- consumption or sale in the market (though the marketable produce is usually sold by men). Batani (2011), in a study of two farming communities in Northern Philippines, found both non-farm work, such as selling agro products and household care work, increased for women in years of climatic disasters, which, in turn, resulted in low-farm income. Given the already low status of women, any income shock to the household can result in the worsening of a woman\u2019s status in the intra-household allocation of resources, as well as lower their bargaining power by altering economic opportunities available to them. Behrman (1988) and Behrman and Deolalikar (1990) found that Indian households were biased towards boys in nutrient allocation during difficult times. There is also considerable evidence that the education and health conditions of women were worse in poorer households. Such income shocks can push a family into poverty for many years and further deteriorate the position of women. It is hence imperative to understand the impact of such shocks on gender-specific outcomes in order to put in place effective policies when adverse shocks occur. From an economic perspective, climate change can affect the livelihoods of women by changing the crop composition and technology. Women in agriculture, which is the mainstay of the rural economy and also most susceptible to vagaries of nature, have lesser access to assets, such as land, capital and technological information. Low levels of education and health lower their ability to weather economic shocks. Alternative employment opportunities for women are also constrained during such distressful times either due to social norms or lack of alternative skills. Thus, women need to adapt to the new challenges posed by weather variations. The effects of climate change hence are not poised to be gender neutral (Vincent et al., 2010). Climate change can have an impact on a variety of outcomes, including, among others, education, health, time-use, income and migration. The view that this impact is unlikely to be gender-neutral has been well recognized in literature but remains a black hole in terms of empirical evidence to substantiate the claims. Out of all the possible effects on women, perhaps the least researched is the impact on labour markets for men and women in rural areas due to those variations. This can manifest itself through wages, income, time use and migration possibilities, which have repercussions on labour market outcomes. It can also affect labour supply and wages for both men and women. Those effects can vary between the sexes. 7 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA 3. Theoretical framework Before proceeding with the empirical analyses, it is useful to discuss the theoretical implications of productivity shocks, such as \u201crainfall\u201d on male and female wages. In the model below, it is assumed that there is a competitive agricultural labour market and three factors of production \u2013 land (L), male labour (Lm) and female labour (Lf) - and rainfall (R).2 The production function is continuous and differentiable and male and female labours are imperfect substitutes in production.

A positive shock increases marginal productivity of both males and females and hence increases male and female wages. So, the above expressions are unambiguously positive. The female wages are affected more than male wages if the effect of rainfall shocks on marginal productivity of females is greater than that on marginal productivity of males. However, in general, labour supply is unlikely to be fixed. To relax this assumption, in a general equilibrium framework, consider two types of households-landless (N) and landed (D). Landed households supply farm labour and also hire labour on their farms, while landless households only hire out labour to landed households. Both male and female labour are used in agricultural production and supplied by the two types of households. Male and female labour are imperfect substitutes in production but labour of each gender from different household types are perfectly substitutable. Male and female leisure are also assumed to be substitutes in the household utility function. All households are assumed to be price takers but wage rates are determined endogenously by the market clearing equilibrium conditions. The two types of households maximize an identical, twice differentiable utility function with respect to the consumption commodity (x), leisure of male members (lm) and leisure of female members (lf) subject to the budget constraint. The household maximization problem is thus given by: Max \ud835\udc45\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd(\ud835\udc63\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc56, \ud835\udc58\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ud835\udc56\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd

There are few estimates of labour supply elasticity of males and females in rural areas of developing countries.

He found female labour supply to be more elastic with respect to their own wage and male wage at the household level, 3 The stability condition is necessary to hold, otherwise the equilibrium cannot be characterized. 9 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA and that both were irresponsive to wage at the aggregate level. Goldberg (2010), in another developing country context, found that while using an experimental setting, which took care of identification issues, male and female labour supply in rural areas was equally elastic at the aggregate level. There is little evidence about behaviour of female labour supply due to rainfall shocks in India. If male and female labour supply was equally elastic and was equally affected by rainfall shock, then any observed variation in female to male agriculture wages should be a consequence of the differential effect on labour demand for the two sexes. 10 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA 4. The rainfall shock and its impact on wages \u2013 empirical analysis 4.1. Data and variable construction The primary dataset used in the paper is the employment and unemployment rounds (1993-1994, 1999- 2000, 2004-2005 and 2007-2008) of National Sample Surveys (NSS) in India. NSS is a cross-sectional dataset, which is representative of the population of India. The survey contains details on labour force participation and earnings for the reference period of a week and follows a two-stage sampling design. In the rural areas, the first stratum is a district. Villages are primary sampling units (PSU), which were picked randomly in the district over an entire agricultural year (July to June) over quarters to ensure equal spacing of observations over an agricultural year. The households were randomly chosen in the selected PSUs. The district-level analysis included 14 major states in the sample: Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh (includes Uttarakhand), Madhya Pradesh (includes Chattisgarh), Bihar (includes Jharkhand), Gujarat, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Average agricultural wage in an agricultural year was estimated by calculating average daily wage rate (seven hours per work day) for all casual wage labourers in agriculture in a district weighted by sampling weights provided in the survey so that the district-level average wage rate was representative of the district population. Wages were adjusted for changes in price levels overtime by using the consumer price index for agricultural labourers as the deflator. Rainfall data used in the paper came from the gridded dataset of the Center of Climatic Research at the University of Delaware, which included monthly precipitation values on 0.5 degree intervals in longitude and latitude centred on 0.25 degree. This grid value was achieved by spatial interpolation using data from nearby weather stations and other sources of rainfall data.4 District-level monthly rainfall estimates were arrived at by averaging the monthly precipitation value of all the grid points lying within the geographic boundaries of a district in a year.5 The geographic boundaries refer to the 1991 Indian census boundaries as Indian districts have been split over time into two or more districts. Districts across NSS rounds (1993, 1999, 2004, and 2007) have been merged into their parent districts according to district boundaries in the 1991 census.6 About 75 percent of the rainfall in India occurs during the monsoon season, which takes place from June to September.7 The monsoon precipitation levels are very critical for agricultural yields during the agricultural year not only for the kharif (summer) crop (June to October) but also for the rabi (winter) crop (October to April) since the rainfall helps recharge the aquifers and also replenish the moisture content in the soil. The methodology used for constructing rainfall shocks was similar to the one used by Jayachandran (2006) who argued that, in the Indian context, above normal level rainfall improved agricultural productivity and below normal level rainfall reduced it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1ab5ac6-8931-4f1f-a81c-86a1996a90ad": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1ab5ac6-8931-4f1f-a81c-86a1996a90ad", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acdf4fd862e46e886c956f79781bd04950e0b260f963f4c77361223cac83c3f9"}, "2": {"node_id": "5ce59afe-48c6-4ec5-925f-829e8dec2486", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "596ca35bb4fb0615ae76685351ae5be56a6d96a8d0adfc4bd7cd91d6d1ecdf24"}}, "hash": "92dc05fd4f38ee2602a288d7d8b33b5453c11731feec552068aa49e3098cb2fb", "text": "Thus, excess rain was treated as a good shock while a shortfall was taken to be a bad shock.

Rainfall variability and its effect on agricultural yield in India Weather varies across regions in India, but most areas of the country experience four seasons \u2014 winter (January to February), summer (March to May), the monsoon season (June to September) and the post- monsoon season (October to December) (Ribot, Najam and Watson, 1996). India has been divided into 20 agro ecological regions by the National Bureau of Soil survey (Gajbhiye and Mandal, 2006) based on the soil, physiography of the area, bioclimatic conditions and the length of the growing period, which depends on moisture availability in the soil. The nature of crops grown in an area depends on climatic and soil suitability. The precipitation levels in each region differ greatly, ranging from being scanty to being heavy. The rainfall pattern thus differs spatially and temporally. The alternating sequence of multi-decadal periods of thirty years having frequent droughts and flood years are observed in the monsoon rainfall data. There has been no overall trend in rainfall observed in India, but the frequency and intensity of rainfall appears to be changing (Kumar, 2009). In the past few years, many states in India have witnessed droughts and floods. Some major drought years have been 1877, 1899, 1918, 1965, 1972, 1987, 2002 and 2009. Thus, the frequency of droughts seems to have been increasing over time. Indian agriculture is subject to vagaries of nature as it is mostly rainfed and yields are highly sensitive to rainfall conditions. Agricultural output depends on the monsoon, as nearly 55.7 percent of the area sown depends on rainfall.8 In the period 1991-1992, about 35 percent of the area under agriculture was irrigated. This increased to 41 percent by 1999-2000 and 44 percent by 2007-2008 (Department of Agriculture and Co- operation, 2003; Directorate of Economics and Statistics, 2010). Thus, there has been virtually no growth in the irrigated area in the past decade. Sources of irrigation, such as canals and groundwater, have been depleted during drought years. The exogenous shock that this study focuses on is a local aggregate shock to productivity in Indian agriculture. It is captured by deviation in rainfall in a particular year from its normal value for a district. In defining drought, the present paper uses the meteorological definition which is defined in terms of deviation from the long-term normal rainfall in an area.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df368dec-f354-43c3-a370-2cecdf1d488c": {"__data__": {"id_": "df368dec-f354-43c3-a370-2cecdf1d488c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3d8be58ad92442abe33db04dc8ab1ec7f0923f5f494daef461629a253eba4634"}, "2": {"node_id": "c990872f-540e-46e6-8b0d-44a0db5e4f91", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0ba9e7416c0e011554497c8d6c1643fdcab1c2b66aa468f0ffce7fb93205c582"}}, "hash": "d8fb89e842fbe95a3f95335a2a4350bb2b191e313da37443771f0562ebf2b0d1", "text": "Such rainfall shocks affect most of the households in a local area and hence are more difficult to insure against, through local village insurance networks or credit.

The plot of coefficients shows that this is not the case.

Effect of rainfall deciles on yield Table 4.1 shows the effect of the rainfall shock variable constructed on the yields for five crops, namely rice, wheat, bajra, gram and maize. For all the crops the shock has a significantly positive effect on yields. A positive shock results in approximately 8 percent higher yields than in normal years for rice, bajra and gram while for wheat this effect is 5.7 percent. The magnitude is highest for rice at 8.7 percent. Rice is also a very different crop in terms of the gender roles involved and cultivation practices. Soil and climate conditions in a region usually determine the nature of crops grown. Rice crop requires a lot of water and it takes 3,000-5,000 liters to produce 1 kg of rice, which is about two to three times more than to produce 1 kg of other cereals (International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), 2002). Rice is best grown under flooded conditions. Though rice can be grown in both dry or semi-dry conditions and wet conditions, the cultivation practices are different. In dry areas, the soil is ploughed in summer and the seed is sown by broadcasting or by sowing the seed behind the plough. In wet cultivation, transplanting in puddled fields is adopted. Wetland conditions are created in semi-dry areas by impounding the rain water. Thus, areas that receive high amounts of rainfall and have a tropical climate are climatically the most suitable for rice cultivation. Among the Indian states in the analysis, Kerala, West Bengal, Orissa and Bihar receive the highest monsoon rainfall. Table 4.2 shows monsoon rainfall levels and area under rice cultivation in the fourteen states of India included in the analyses. As the table shows, the states in which at least 50 percent of the area is under rice cultivation have the highest levels of rainfall in the country. Those states are Kerala, located on the western coastal plain and West Bengal, Orissa and Bihar located in the Eastern Gangetic. The climatic conditions in those states are thus highly suitable for wet cultivation of rice. Table 4.1.

Years 1999-2004 were used as data for all the state. Proportion of area under rice is defined as the area under rice divided by area under all crops except horticulture crops (spices, condiments, fruits and vegetables). Researchers have documented that cultivation of rice involves greater labour-days, particularly for activities mostly carried out by women, such as transplanting and weeding. Wet cultivation of rice requires rice to be grown in flooded fields. Rice seeds cannot be germinated under flooded conditions and therefore need to be grown in nurseries and then transplanted manually in the flooded rice fields. Women are considered more efficient than men in transplanting and seem to have a comparative advantage in these skills.9 Bardhan (1974) noted that female labour demand is higher in rice growing areas: Transplantation of paddy is an exclusively female job in the paddy areas; besides, female labour plays a very important role in weeding, harvesting and threshing of paddy. By contrast, in dry cultivation and even in wheat cultivation, under irrigation, the work involves more muscle power and less of tedious, often back-breaking, but delicate operations (p. 1304). There is also a distinct sequential nature of tasks by gender in rice production under wet conditions. Men are involved in land preparation, sowing and seed-bed preparation. The next stage involves transplanting of rice by women. Thereafter, men are only involved with irrigation and application of fertilizer while women undertake most of the manual weeding operations, harvesting and post-harvesting operations, including the threshing of crops (IRRI, 2000). Tasks, such as transplanting and weeding, in which females supposedly have a comparative advantage, account for one-third of total labour percentage used in rice farming (Mbiti, 2008). Using this observation, Mbiti (2008) found that agricultural households in rice growing areas did not marry their daughters in high rainfall years and attributed this to greater relative value of female labour during those years. If this were indeed true then the positive effect of rainfall on equilibrium wages must be greater for females in rice growing areas as compared to male wages assuming that labour supply responses do not differ across sexes or at least are not able to completely offset the changing demand for female labour. To test the above hypothesis, for the present study, an indicator of rainfed rice cultivation intensity was constructed on the view that the heterogeneous gender impact would be the highest if rice is grown under 9 This is a historical pattern of tasks division which farmers attribute to the fact that women have small feet and hands and thus are less likely to destroy the seedlings while transplanting. Another explanation for the division is that men have traditionally tried to avoid this type of work because it entails long periods of back bending. 14 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA rainfed conditions. If a state has at least 50 percent area under cultivation of rice then districts in that state are classified as rainfed rice growing areas.10 A state level indicator of rice cultivation is used since rice can be grown in select districts within a state having irrigated agricultural systems. In southern states of India and in the state of Punjab due to lower rainfall, rice cultivation is only done in a few districts under well-irrigated conditions. Thus, around 90 percent of area under rice is irrigated in those states (Sen, 1985). In such areas, rice cultivation may not occur due to better climate suitability but rather due to better irrigation facilities, which also mitigates the effect of rainfall shocks on rice yields. Hence, a state level indicator was applied for rice cultivation, since the heterogeneous gender impact of rice cultivation was expected to be the greatest in rainfed rice systems. To check the robustness of the results alternative definitions of rain-fed rice cultivation was applied in a region by using a district-level area under rain-fed rice cultivation. 4.3. Estimation strategy and findings The effect of rainfall shocks on male and female wage gap in agriculture is examined. In addition to the above any different impact across rainfed rice cultivating areas relative to other areas in India is investigated.

The identification of the parameter of interest is thus based on over time variation in wages and rainfall in a district. The parameter of interest \ud835\udefc\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd1 gives the impact of rainfall shocks on gender wage gap. The realized rainfall shocks are random and hence the regressions give an unbiased estimate of \ud835\udefc\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd1. A district is a smaller administrative unit within states in India and is taken as the unit of analyses. This is based on the assumption that districts constitute separate agriculture labour markets in the country. Previous studies by Jayachandran (2006) and Rosenzweig (1984) also make a similar assumption since districts can be considered as distinct labour markets due to low mobility of rural labour across districts in India. We allow for clustering of standard errors within a region-year. The district level regressions are estimated with analytical weights equal to district population since the wage variables are means estimated at the district level. As discussed earlier, there can be a heterogeneous impact of the rainfall shocks on gender wage gap in the rainfed rice cultivating regions.

Chin (2011) exploited a similar strategy of using the interaction of rice cultivation with rainfall shock, as an instrument for the labour force participation of females. While she used cross-sectional data, our estimation is based on panel data that allows us to control for district fixed effects. One possible concern may be that rice cultivation can be determined by local conditions that also affect labour market outcomes. Since the average is taken over a span of five years for arriving at the percentage area under rice cultivation, the rice indicator variable did not represent crop choice as a response to agricultural conditions prevailing in any given year. It reflects whether on an average there is rice cultivation in a district. District fixed effects are controlled for in the econometric specification, further alleviating any concerns about the endogeneity of the rice indicator variable. Even so an additional instrumental variable check is presented in the next section. Table 4.4 gives the estimates for the impact of rainfall shocks on wages. Both male and female wages seem to be affected equally by the shocks. A positive rainfall shock, defined as when rainfall is above the eightieth percentile of the district rainfall, led to an increase in female wages by 3.6 percent and male wages by 2.4 percent as compared to a normal year when rainfall was between the 20th and 80th percentile of the district rainfall. There was, however, no significant effect of rainfall shocks on the gender wage gap. Table 4.5 shows the results for the specification with rainfall shock interacted with the rice cultivation dummy. Here, it was observed that the gender wage gap fell during positive shocks in rice suitable areas and increased during years of negative shock, defined as when the rainfall was below the 20th percentile of the district rainfall. Therefore, a positive rainfall shock in rice cultivating areas increased the female to male wage ratio by 4.8 percent. This was driven by a lower impact of rainfall shocks on", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cbc9c49a-676b-49bc-bbb3-1a6993796a8b": {"__data__": {"id_": "cbc9c49a-676b-49bc-bbb3-1a6993796a8b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3854796871fec39aa6645b9d5085a7c3b08480e6ba85489d18190cd3848a1f49"}, "3": {"node_id": "08f6f444-0345-4050-80ac-3cb26f2fa0a9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07d3931ca3e8c2b0649110a86846b4ee03880f79fe4c1030079b7f4b76b1ec1b"}}, "hash": "a2abd0f004bc756c225b80b5421e8069810502f14311512152435db13ffe1b5c", "text": "male wages in rice-growing areas.

To control for other variables that may affect the wage responsiveness to shocks in a district, the percentage of literate population in a district is included in the econometric specification as an indicator of education and interacted with the rainfall shock. Generally non-farm sector enterprises are in areas with better infrastructure and higher population education levels. By improving access to non-farm jobs, high education levels can insulate agriculture wages from rainfall shocks. The technological advancement in agriculture may also be greater in areas with a more educated workforce. So, it is expected that in districts with a larger literate population agricultural wages are likely to be better protected against rainfall variations. The percentage of the irrigated area in a district may lead to a differential effect of rainfall shocks on wages as well. To the extent that well irrigated areas experience smaller effects of rainfall shocks on yield of crops, the wages in irrigated areas tend be insulated against rainfall variations. However the cultivation of more risky crops in well-irrigated areas can make local agricultural wages more responsive to rainfall shocks. Using data from three Indian villages, Wadood and Lamb (2006) showed that areas with risky crop varieties increased with irrigation availability. In well irrigated areas, high value but risky water-intensive crops and varieties are a major source of income.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "08f6f444-0345-4050-80ac-3cb26f2fa0a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "08f6f444-0345-4050-80ac-3cb26f2fa0a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3854796871fec39aa6645b9d5085a7c3b08480e6ba85489d18190cd3848a1f49"}, "2": {"node_id": "cbc9c49a-676b-49bc-bbb3-1a6993796a8b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a2abd0f004bc756c225b80b5421e8069810502f14311512152435db13ffe1b5c"}}, "hash": "07d3931ca3e8c2b0649110a86846b4ee03880f79fe4c1030079b7f4b76b1ec1b", "text": "While rainfall shocks may not affect the yield of cultivated crops, lower groundwater levels and less availability of canal water, due to insufficient rainfall, can result in less area planted under high value crops in a low rainfall year, affecting the value of the marginal labour input.11 11 The accessed report documents crop composition shifts to less water-intensive crops, such as gram and oilseed, as advised by the government in irrigated areas in years of drought, especially in the rabi season when the alternative seeds could be made 17 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA Table 4.6 shows the results conditional on the above indicators of development.

Jayachandran (2006) found that the effect of rainfall shocks on wages was lower in more developed areas. A host of other development indicators, such as accessibility to villages in a district by bus, road and rail, closeness of villages to a town and banking activity in a district, were used by Jayachandran (2006). The level of per capita expenditure as an indicator of poverty and the percentage of landless households in a district were also used as indicators of the subsistence level in a district. The robustness of the above results, when those indicators are included in the specification, was examined as well. Table 4.7 shows the results for indicators of accessibility, such as bus, road and rail, mean distance to town and banking activity, with the available by the government to the farmers. Sometimes the irrigation water is diverted for drinking purposes as well (http://www.empowerpoor.org/downloads/drought1.pdf). Though, overall irrigation will improve the welfare of households since even with a greater percentage fall, the average wage in irrigated areas will be greater than in unirrigated areas in drought years. In India, among the irrigated districts in the study period, 90 percent have less than 75 per cent area under irrigation. 12 Specification with separate female and male district-level education was also estimated, but due to high collinearity between the two, only male education was significant for males and female wage equations when both were added. However, when entered alone, female education was also significant. No effect on gender wage gap was observed for any education variable. The specification with average education was hence preferred. The other results did not change. 18 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA last column incorporating all five indicators.

Robustness checks In the previous section, it was argued that the interaction of rice cultivation with rainfall shock is exogenous since district fixed effects were controlled. To further allay any endogeneity concerns, the rice growing states dummy is instrumented using the mean state rainfall level during the period 1971-2008. The interaction of \u201cRainShock\u201d with mean monsoon rainfall is used as an instrument for the interaction of \u201cRainShock\u201d and \u201cRice\u201d. Long term mean rainfall is unlikely to be correlated with the labour market outcomes once district fixed effects are controlled since it is an exogenously determined weather variable. It is also likely to be highly correlated with average rainfed rice cultivation in a region since rice is a water-intensive crop. The first stage 19 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA results showed that the interaction of rainfall shock and mean rainfall level was a significant predictor of the interaction of rainfall shock and rice cultivation, which would be the case if mean rainfall level acts as the determining factor behind the choice of farmers to cultivate rice in a particular state. Table 4.8 shows the result of the two-stage least squares estimation along with the F-statistic of the first stage. The F-stat showed that the instrument was significant at one percentage level. The second stage result confirmed the findings of the previous regressions that the gender wage gap reduced in rice growing regions in years of high rainfall and increased in years of low rainfall. The magnitude of the impact was only slightly higher than the reduced form regression in table 4.6, indicating that endogeneity is not a major concern.

To further check the robustness of the results obtained in the previous section, a district-level indicator of rice cultivation was used. The percentage area under rainfed rice cultivation in a district was calculated by multiplying the district-level percentage area under rice cultivation with the percentage area under rice crop which was unirrigated in the state to which the district was located.13 This was expected to be a good indicator at the district-level due to uniformity within the states in rainfed rice cultivation. In the states of Punjab, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, rice is intensively cultivated in a few districts and the entire area cultivated under rice is irrigated. In other states, the area where irrigated rice is cultivated is limited. Rice can be grown under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. It is very crucial to make this distinction as the rainfed areas are more likely to suffer yield shocks in rice production that affects demand for labour. Table 4.9 shows the result with this alternative district-level indicator of rice cultivation.

The results after controlling for state specific time trends are shown in the last column of table 4.9. As can be seen, the previous result was robust to the inclusion of those trends as well.

Possible mechanisms As discussed in the theoretical section, there can be both a demand-side and a supply-side phenomenon, which can result in a differential effect of rainfall shocks on male and female wages. To understand the gender dynamics in the agricultural labour market, the side of the labour market that is driving the above findings must be determined. The documented anecdotal evidence on rice cultivation and women suggested that demand for women was more in rice-growing areas in years of good rainfall as women were in greater demand for work in the rice fields due to their comparative advantage in tasks, such as transplanting and weeding. But, it could it also be that in those rice-growing areas, women were less able to adjust their labour supply in bad rainfall years as compared to men, which resulted in a larger wage gap. The documented evidence also pointed to the mechanism of demand-side effects on female labour in the rice-growing areas due to changes in crop composition and cultivating methods. Pandey, Bhandari and Hardy (2007) document in their report the coping strategies of rice farmers in regions in eastern India during years of low rainfall. About 40 percent of the farmers reported a change in cropping patterns during bad rainfall years with either an early sowing of the next season crop or replanting with a different crop (Pandey et al., 22 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA 2007). Usually in rainfed rice-growing areas, the rice-wheat or rice-pulse cultivation pattern is followed. Maize, oilseeds, pulses or cash crops, such as vegetables, are often grown to compensate for the loss of the rice crop, depending on soil suitability and seed availability. Pandey et al. (2007) also found that 10-30 percent of the farmers in the states of eastern India changed the crop establishment method of rice from transplanting to broadcasting, if they had not already sown the rice crop when the drought hit. In normal years, farmers use transplanting as the broadcasting method of sowing rice generally results in lower rice yields.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "51638367-5ce8-4b61-ae32-0710cb154a92": {"__data__": {"id_": "51638367-5ce8-4b61-ae32-0710cb154a92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "13dfaf09d7f22c6bfe0c604822958cc421131ecd3ed595e9e99bbb4c1d519e51"}, "2": {"node_id": "bae879d3-8438-4246-b2fe-64cae9e03ee3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77ab31258586911d0fa428306c3f918e28a2bb237e4f8cc35b49b1f506b9493e"}}, "hash": "667f561d7675041047d311f6c7123765a31bb27e775045e9a1737d1f5dcde3d6", "text": "Farmers who had already sown the crop before a drought also replanted the rice crop again if possible (using broadcasting).When the broadcasting technique was applied, fewer women were employed as compared to when farmers applied the technique of transplanting, which can only be conducted in flooded fields (Sen, 1985). As a test of the above documented evidence one could look at the response of major crop yields to rainfall shocks in rainfed rice growing areas relative to the other areas. Farmers in rainfed rice areas are likely to shift to crops other than rice in response to low rainfall when the yields of other crops do not fall while the yield of rice crop is lower.

The above findings on crop yields and the documented evidence on farmers\u2019 coping strategies suggested that in rice-growing areas, the crop was transplanted in high rainfall years, whereas in the low rainfall years, rice was either grown by broadcasting or substituted by other crops. Both of those coping strategies resulted in a greater fall in female labour demand than male labour demand in low rainfall years. Thus, the observed impact of rainfall shocks on wage gap in rice-growing areas relative to the other areas could be the result of a relatively greater fall in the marginal product of female labour as compared to male labour due to the asymmetric demand effect. Another test to distinguish between the labour demand and labour supply effects could be to evaluate the impact of rainfall shocks on the quantity of males and females employed in agriculture. Under the assumption of upward sloping labour supply curves in own wage for both males and females, if a greater fall in women\u2019s wages relative to men\u2019s is due to a differential fall in demand, then female hours of work are likely to decrease more relative to men hours of work in rice-growing regions when a negative rainfall shock occurs.14 On the other hand, if differences in labour supply elasticity or labour supply shifts are driving the results, then women\u2019s hours of work are likely to be affected less relative to men by rainfall shocks in rainfed rice-growing regions.

Rainfall shock and the proportion of days worked in agriculture were positively associated as expected, though not significantly. In rice-growing areas, low rain years led to higher demand for male work days than for women work days. The effect on relative female employment was positive and significant in both panels A and B.

The last column in table 4.12 shows the results for the estimation with unemployment days. The results showed that women in rice-growing areas suffered a larger increase in unemployment relative to men when rainfall was low. Again, this evidence also suggested that there were demand-side effects, resulting in a larger gender wage gap in rice-growing areas in years of low rainfall. The employment of females might fall due to more females attending to domestic chores, such as collecting water and fuelwood, the demand for which increases during drought years. However, the relatively greater fall in female employment in rice-growing areas during drought years as compared to other areas was likely due to the demand effect as the increased burden of domestic chores was likely to be equal across all areas.

Selection of study areas To assess the impact of rainfall shocks on various aspects of agricultural households in India, focus group discussions were conducted in two states, Maharashtra and Orissa. Maharashtra was selected because drought was declared in many districts in the state during the 2011-2012 agricultural year. The villagers were thus able to recall the effects of the drought vividly. Two adjacent districts with geographical differences, Nashik and Ahmadnagar, were selected in Maharashtra. Western parts of Nashik belong to the \u201cWestern Ghats\u201d, which receive on average higher rainfall. Eastern Nashik and Ahmadnagar, on the other hand, are in the rain-shadow region, which is part of the \u201cscarcity zone\u201d. Also of note, parts of Nashik are tribal dominated. In Orissa, the district selected for the study was Keonjhar. This district has tribal and non-tribal areas, and its general climatology matches that of the rainfed rice-growing areas of Eastern India. Thus, the latter was chosen to be able to provide insights into the mechanism leading to observed differential wage changes for males and females in the rainfed rice-growing regions. Also, Keonjhar was declared as being drought-hit in 2010 due to less than normal rainfall, which resulted in a more than 50 percent loss in agricultural output. This further increased the recall value of responses in the discussions. The district collector\u2019s office in each district has a list of the drought-affected blocks and villages. The latest years for the lists in Nashik, Ahmadnagar and Keonjhar were 2011, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Those lists aided in the selection of villages within those districts. District officials follow a system of paisewari (crop cutting estimates) to declare a village drought affected. If the fall in output is more than 50 percent due to less rainfall in a village, the village is declared as drought hit. The fall in output is estimated by selecting a few sample fields or on the basis of a visual inspection during harvest time. If many villages in a block are declared drought hit, then the entire block is declared as drought hit. If more than half of the blocks have been declared as drought hit, then the entire district is declared as drought affected by the government. Table 5.1 contains a brief description of the selected districts. Nashik is the most urbanized in the selected districts and also has the lowest number of people dependent on agriculture. Among the three districts, Keonjhar has the lowest literacy rate of 60 percent and the highest proportion of scheduled tribes15 at 40 15 Tribes in India which are regarded as socially disadvantaged. 26 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA percent. Keonjhar also has the lowest percentage of cultivated area due to high forest coverage. In all three districts, less than 30 percent of the area is under irrigation. As for the crop composition, major kharif crops are millets and maize in Nashik and Ahmadnagar followed by rabi crops of wheat and other crops, such as onion, that are grown throughout the year. In Keonjhar, rice is the main kharif crop, grown in some areas in rabi as well. Maize, gram, vegetables and oilseeds are other crops grown. Thus, the crops grown are in line with the general climatology of the districts, with dryland cereals, such as bajra and jowar being grown in the selected districts of Maharashtra and rice in Keonjhar. Apart from cultivation, in Ahmadnagar, livestock activities, such as dairy and poultry farming, also serve as a major earning source.

Selection of blocks within districts Table 5.2 shows the blocks selected in the districts for the study. In Nashik, the Triambhak block is in the Western Ghat region and is tribal dominated, while the remaining blocks are in the plain zone, an area that receives less rainfall. The blocks of Ahmadnagar are in the scarcity zone and are not dominated by tribes. Keonjhar, Banspal and Telkoi are in hilly tribal areas where farmers grow upland paddy, while the other blocks are in plain areas, where lowland paddy is grown. One block in each state that had not been declared drought hit by the state government was selected in order to get more heterogeneity in the study and to understand the extent to which shocks tend to be correlated across villages despite the low intensity of shocks at the local level. They are Triambhak in Maharashtra and Patana in Orissa. In those two blocks, low rainfall resulted in a drop in output in 2011 and 2010, respectively, but the decline was less than 50 percent for each block. The other selected blocks that had been declared drought affected were chosen on the basis of distance from the district headquarters and heterogeneity in agricultural conditions. Thus, blocks within a district were selected on the basis of criterion sampling. 27 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA Table 5.2.

Two villages on the lists were chosen randomly from each block selected, except for the two blocks that were not declared affected by drought, namely Triambhak in Maharashtra and Patana in Orissa. From the Champua block in Orissa, four villages were selected. Those four villages had been declared drought affected in 2010, with the intensity of drought being the highest among all the blocks in Keonjhar.

Time period of the study The focus group discussions in Nashik and Ahmadnagar were conducted in June 2012, while the one in Keojhar was conducted in early July 2012. They were thus carried out during an agriculturally lean season (before the monsoon begins) in Maharashtra and in the intermediate season between sowing and transplanting in Orissa (the initial monsoon rains). The choice of this time period ensured that agricultural workers were available in the village for discussions and not pre-occupied with agricultural work. Due to the time period selected, it was easier to organize the discussions and the participating households were more willing to share their experiences on the effect of low rainfall on different aspects of their lives. 5.2.

Cultivator households are defined as households whose members work on their own land and also work on other people\u2019s land as labourers. In general, their landholdings are less than five acres, a medium land-holding size. The participating households in the focus group discussions were limited to those that had landholdings of up to a maximum of five acres to ensure that the study did not concentrate on the lower end of the landholdings or the higher end. The age group of the participants was 15 to 60 years. In villages with a substantial number of landless labourers who primarily relied on agriculture for their livelihood, separate focus group discussions were conducted with them, one each for men and women. Each focus group discussion had a minimum of five participants and a maximum of 15. The households were informed about the discussions by either an Anganwadi16 worker or the Sarpanch (head of village governing body)/ member of panchayat (village governing body)17 of the village and the interested participants came for the discussion on a voluntary basis. The discussions were organized, based on convenience, either in the panchayat office or in the Anganwadi centre or the common meeting place for villagers in the village. Care was taken to ensure that male participants were not present during the discussions groups comprised of females. However, in three villages in Maharashtra, the males did not let females speak in isolation. In those villages, the men were requested not to answer any questions and to let the women speak their views. If they did not agree with anything that the women reported, they were told to tell the discussion organizers at the end of the discussion. As the focus group discussions did not involve questions that could provoke direct confrontations between men and women, the men did not interfere and only wished to be present due to concern about the women\u2019s security in meeting with people from outside the village. Among the two states, it was more difficult to organize separate female discussions in Maharashtra. This was because the men in that state were of the view that the women were not informed enough to answer the questions and due to cultural constraints of women being alone with persons from outside the village. The focus group discussions began with a brief introduction of the study and the type of information that was to be solicited from the participants, as well as an assurance of confidentiality. The people were clearly told that the study might help in developing policies at different levels of government but that there was no guarantee that it would have a direct positive effect on their lives. Reference to the UNDP was avoided unless the participants specifically asked which organization was conducting the study. In order to obtain honest opinions from the villagers, a field staff from two non-governmental organization (NGOs), Pragati Abhiyan and Prakalpa in Maharashtra and Orissa, who was already familiar with the local area and people, participated in the focus group discussions as facilitators. The author of this present paper took notes instead of recording the discussions,18 which were limited to 1.0-1.5 hour each so as to keep participants interested and actively engaged. 16 These are workers responsible for managing the Anganwadi centres, which provide health-care facilities and food to children in the age group 0-5 years and pregnant and lactating mothers. 17 Gram Panchayat is the local elected governing body at the village level in India. 18 Recording on tape often makes participants conscious and leads them to give false or pretentious answers to the questions, especially when their livelihoods are being discussed and questions related to governance are included. Recording the interviews also discourages voluntary participation by the community members (Narayan and Petesch, 2005). 29 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA The three themes of the questions asked were the following: 1) local agricultural conditions in the village in terms of irrigation facilities, crop composition, training imparted to farmers and wages; 2) non-agricultural livelihood opportunities available to the participants during the off-agricultural season; and 3) the effect of low rainfall/drought on the participants\u2019 agricultural wages, livestock, food, health, agricultural employment, and livelihood diversification.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e8c61d3-d2c2-48a0-b002-aee82b7823f1": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e8c61d3-d2c2-48a0-b002-aee82b7823f1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "44e23f83662e12736737ad0e6286d84045b2db205d20f92debeca54d821de96b"}, "2": {"node_id": "3ed52456-d0ff-45fa-af5b-b51d08609115", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66b5bb43b17dfea3e69466c9562201f0716690a164bf46127761d20cb6dc1f77"}}, "hash": "a4b88559419b9b4e9380531a980513042ea27b5d8fd1b4d911b07e42e21e80cb", "text": "During the discussion groups involving men, the participants were asked questions about the general infrastructure facilities available in the village, such as schools, health centres, power supply, sources of drinking water and the existence of disaster management committees and self-help groups (SHGs).

Additional questions on activities, such as fodder, water and fuel-wood collection and the obstacles faced by women in participating in non-farm activities were discussed in the women\u2019s groups. 5.3. Description of the selected villages 5.3.1. Demographic characteristics As summarized in table 5.3, the size of villages with the number of households varied from 73 to 977. Overall, villages in Keonjhar are smaller as compared to Nashik and Ahmadnagar. The habitations in Keonjhar are widely spread out due the geography of the district. The proportion of scheduled tribes also varied among the villages, with Triambhak in Nashik and Banspal and Telkoi in Keonjhar being tribal dominated and more backward. The scheduled castes population was randomly distributed across villages. 5.3.2. Infrastructure facilities Table 5.4 shows the infrastructure facilities in the selected villages. Primary schools were present in all the villages; however, the selected villages in Maharashtra had a higher share of middle and secondary schools than the villages in Orissa, perhaps because the population of its villages is larger. The villages in Orissa that lacked middle schools used ones in a neighbouring village that were within a half an hour walking distance. Connectivity by road was universal across the villages thanks to Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojna, a centrally sponsored scheme started in 2000, which has led to near universal accessibility of all villages by all-weather roads in these districts. Electrification was complete in all of the villages in the districts of Maharashtra, while only eight villages in Orissa had power supply. The villages in Orissa had more Anganwadi health centres, which also appeared better equipped and more functional in comparison to those in villages in Maharashtra. In terms of sanitation, the villages in Orissa were worse off as they lacked public toilets and private toilets were constructed in very few villages. Women and men mostly defecated in the open and went to nearby streams for bathing when the water supply from hand-pumps was limited. In both Maharashtra and Orissa, the most common source of drinking water was the public hand pump followed by government wells and private wells. Piped water was available in half of the villages in Maharashtra mostly under the Jalswarajya scheme of the Maharashtra government. The importance of drinking water was very significant in the lives of women since they were primarily responsible for the collection, storage and purification of it. Availability of piped water had reduced their drudgery and the lack of it appeared to be a constraint in the lives of women in the selected villages in Orissa and to some extent in Maharashtra. SHGs for women existed in almost all of the villages in all of the districts, while men\u2019s SHGs were almost non-existent in Keonjhar and operational in five villages in Nashik and Ahmadnagar. Nashik, Ahmadnagar and parts of Keonjhar have been covered under the Disaster Risk Management programme, which had been undertaken jointly by the UNDP and the Government of India. However, in only one village in Nashik and in the five villages in Ahmadnagar, people were aware of the existence of disaster management committees; thus, lack of awareness among villagers in Nashik were reported as a concern. No focus group participants in Keonjhar knew about the existence of the committees. This could be because only villages subject to disasters were covered under the programme. However, in villages where the 30 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA committees existed, the focus group participants viewed them as being dysfunctional. In the village-level plan reports and a sample report shared by Mr. Virendra Badadhe, the district disaster management officer involved in the implementation of the UNDP Disaster Risk Management project in Ahmadnagar, drought was not highlighted as a potential disaster in those villages even though the villagers themselves reported that drought was perhaps the greatest natural hazard they faced in terms of its economic impact. The disasters discussed in detail were earthquakes, flood, fire and cyclones. Rain-level projections issued by the government were also not provided to the farmers.

Agricultural characteristics Table 5.5 shows the importance of agriculture in the village economy in terms of percentage of labour force dependent on cultivation. Except in Mahadevpur village in Keonjhar, at least 70 percent of the population was dependent on agricultural cultivation for their livelihood in all the villages. In a few villages, this proportion exceeded 90 percent. The second column provides the proportion of the labour force that depended completely on agricultural labour earnings as their main source of income. This proportion reflected those households whose landholdings were too small to give them a sustainable income from their own crops or those who were landless and worked in agriculture. As the table indicates, complete dependence on agricultural labour was more in the villages of Keonjhar. 31 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA Only four out of 26 villages visited had irrigation on more than half of their cultivable land area. This clearly indicated that farmers mostly depended on rainfall to meet their water requirements for crops. More villages in Nashik and Ahmadnagar had tube-well and dam irrigation in comparison to Keonjhar, where even if irrigation was present, it was mostly canal irrigation, which is again very sensitive to rainfall variability. The major crops grown in the villages were in consonance with the district-level findings from the data. While villages in Nashik and Ahmadnagar predominantly grew millets, such as Bajra and Jowar, the main Kharif cereal crop in the villages of Keonjhar was rice. Along with those cereals, pulses, such as soyabean in kharif and wheat in rabi and onion cultivation, was predominant in the selected villages of Maharashtra. Along with rice, the other crops grown in Keonjhar included maize in kharif, vegetables, pulses and mustard mostly in rabi. The crop composition of the two regions was thus very different from each other. Table 5.5.

In two villages, the agricultural officer, Krishi Sahayak, extended training to the village men on best cultivation practices and the choice of seeds. In another village, the state training agency imparted training on the cultivation of horticultural crops to the men. However, none of the women in the villages reported having attended any training workshops. This was confirmed in the men\u2019s discussion groups. With the exception of the village of Karanjad in Nashik, Maharashtra, the women in villages where men reportedly had received training were aware that the training session has taken place. In Keonjhar, Orissa, men in six villages and women in five villages responded affirmatively to having received training from the government on the following: rice, maize and vegetable cultivation; burning compost and mango cultivation; and seed treatment. The men in the village of Jantari in Banspal, Keonjhar, however, complained that the training did not have much impact. In that regard, one man stated that after the training session, seeds and materials were not provided to the villagers, making the training useless. The involvement of women in the training process was very different in the two states. In Maharashtra, the training concentrated on horticulture crops and irrigation methods. It primarily benefited the cultivation of cash-crops, which are generally marketed by men. On the other hand, both women and men grow cereal- crops, such as rice, maize and vegetables, in Orissa. This could be a reason why the trainings were conducted for both women and men in Keonjhar, Orissa. Cultural practices and gender roles thus were reinforced by the government agricultural trainings in these villages. 5.4.2. Agricultural Wages Table 5.6 shows the average daily male and female wages reported by men and women participants for an eight hour work-day. There were only a few discrepancies among the participants in a group on the wages paid and whether different wage rates prevailed by task and gender. In two villages, there were some differences in the reporting of wages between male and females.19 The two states differ in terms of wage decisions at the village level. Workers and large land cultivators who employ workers bargained in both states. In Nashik and Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra, landlords reportedly played an important role in deciding wages, but in Keonjhar, Orissa, workers had greater power in determining wages due to the highly seasonal nature of labour demand in that district. In Keonjhar, the demand for labour peaks at certain times of the year as rice requires extensive work in a short duration of time. In Maharashtra, the participants were able to give the exact wage rate if it varied by task, while in Orissa, the participants generally gave a wage figure in an interval as the wages varied depending on the seasonal nature of supply and demand during the year; thus, there was no fixed wage by task. The average wage (averaged over tasks if it varied by task) for villages in Maharashtra is listed in table 5.6. Gender differential in wages was reported in the villages for the same task, with the exception of Virgaon and Pokhari in Maharashtra and Jantari, Oria and Halpuri in Orissa. In those villages, the participants indicated that males and females were equally productive. The two main reasons given for the existence of the gender wage gap was that the men tended to do harder work even while carrying out the same task and thus were more productive than women and the persistence of the gender wage gap over time. On average, female wages were reported to be lower than male wages, with the differences being greater in Maharashtra 19 In the village of Pangarmal in Maharashtra, women reported lower wages for both males and females in the village. Later, other women verified that the actual wages seemed to be in the middle. In the village of Kuanar, Orissa, women reported lower wages than what men reported for women. When the questions about wages were posed to men again after the women\u2019s focus groups discussions, the men agreed with levels that the women had reported. 33 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA as compared to Orissa.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d624cee9-fd37-4235-8b88-d22be3fa481a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d624cee9-fd37-4235-8b88-d22be3fa481a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8e59d381b76c2f599bb975c1fb1742fc13cef59154c9a0eb1c9b905273f8a0d"}, "2": {"node_id": "65627414-af93-41a0-abfd-713137af1e18", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba8f9b2a8d7c112b637513463bec2a1d7923a72540356ec846451089b0c7f095"}}, "hash": "36b04ba953c136cdd65933a115fa55d04f718d16840e41fbc82935524e3ffaf5", "text": "This is in accordance with the general finding that in rice-based cropping systems, female wages were higher due to greater demand for women workers.

At times, the wages were paid on a contractual basis to get the transplanting completed quickly. Contractual wages when calculated on a daily eight-hour basis turned out to be higher. Similarly, in Keonjhar, Orissa, in 10 villages, the women reported that during the transplanting and weeding seasons in rice cultivation, they received higher wages as the demand for women labourers peaked in line with need to carry out those two operations. In fact those two operations were performed only by females in most cases. Villagers attributed this to women having a physical comparative advantage in performing those tasks as the nature of the work entailed extended periods of bending of backs and the need for tender hands and feet.

Non-farm employment opportunities The NSS in India show that women\u2018s participation in non-farm jobs in rural India is very limited. This was validated by the focus group discussions. A woman in the village of Karanjad in Maharashtra summed up the reasons why women do not engage in such activities: There is lack of availability of work near the village that is desirable for us since we cannot leave children behind alone for long hours and lack of training since we have never participated in work outside agriculture. There is also a concern of security in the cities and also housing and sanitation is a problem when we need to stay there for a few days. Commuting to the urban centres for work takes up a lot of time. The lack of mobility of rural women in India is leading to the feminization of agriculture as the role of women has been increasing over the years. Lack of 34 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA mobility was reported by women in 14 out of the 26 villages studied. Women face the burdens of childcare and housework as well as security issues, constraints not faced by men. In Maharashtra, Pimpalgao Nipani was the only village from which the men reported that they did not participate in non-agriculture activities. In other villages in Nashik and Ahmadnagar, the men worked mostly in nearby sugarcane factories or the factories in the Maharashatra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) centres and as construction workers in the cities or in nearby areas. In the villages of Sayale, Dodi Bk, Kalmuste, and Pokhari in Maharashtra, the men reported that they migrated for days or months to do non-agricultural work.

An exception to this was in the village of Telkoi where the women also migrated to areas 40-50 km away to do construction work. In the village of Oria the women tended to accompany the men to the mining sites while in the village of Sadangi, they worked at a nearby brick kiln, located 5 km away. This was to supplement income earned by the men of the house, which was not enough to support the household. Women were also engaged in self-employment activities that could be performed at or near their homes; e.g., collecting non-timber forest products for sale, making plates for eating from leaflets, and producing earthen utensils. In India, a nationwide rural public works programme entitled the \u201cNational Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS)\u201d was launched in 2005. The distinguishing feature of NREGS not found in previous public works programmes has been its rights-based framework under which the programme provides a \u201c\u2018guarantee\u201d of 100 days of minimum wage employment to each rural household in the country. Its main aim is to enhance the livelihood security of people in rural India on a permanent basis by providing annual wage employment in public works to households whose adult members are willing to do unskilled manual work. Since NREGS provides an alternative work opportunity for villagers, enquires were made during the study about the availability of work under the scheme. The villagers were asked if the scheme had been used to provide work to them over the past three years. In Maharashtra, out of the 13 villages, employment had been provided under NREGS in eight of the villages, but in none of the villages, all the requests for work under the programme were granted, and those who did get work did not necessarily work 100 days. In Orissa, out of the 13 villages, people in 10 villages received employment under NREGS, though not for the full 100 days. Both males and females reported working under NREGS. Also of note, employment under NREGS was not available every year and as a result, the villagers reported extreme uncertainty in getting alternative employment under the scheme and viewed the programme as not being reliable. The strategies of dealing with monsoon failures for agriculture households can be either adaptive or coping in nature. One of the adaptive strategies is diversification into non-farm work. Women face more constraints in access to non-farm jobs; these constraints limit their ability to adapt to rainfall shocks. 5.4.4. Effect of low rainfall Crop wise gender composition 35 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA Table 5.7 shows the average person days per acre of land cultivated in the selected villages in the cultivation of major crops. The women\u2019s workload was more intensive in the cultivation of two crops\u2013rice in Orissa and onion in Maharashtra. With regard to the other crops, the gender proportions were equal or the men\u2019s work days were longer. This finding is in line with other anecdotal evidence that the role of women is more prevalent in transplanting rice. The focus group discussions revealed that in the production of other crops that require transplanting, such as onion, demand for women labourers was also high; in onion cultivation, the demand for women\u2019s labour was higher for transplanting as well as for weeding. As onion is grown only in some parts of Nashik and Ahmadnagar, the effect of onion cultivation on gender roles may not be so significant. Among the predominant cereal crops, only rice requires transplanting, thus the effect on gender roles in cultivation was highly visible in the rice cultivating regions. In years of low rainfall, the proportion of male labour utilized per acre of land increased in rice cultivation, as the women\u2019s work days fell more than men\u2019s work days. The focus group discussions confirmed that ploughing and sowing operations\u2013men\u2019s jobs\u2013were completed before the low rainfall shock was realized. After the low rainfall shock was realized, it was primarily the operations in which females were involved in, such as transplanting and weeding, that suffered.

In Karanjad, only women in landless households reported this. In other villages, women who owned land also reported participating in non-agriculture activities.

Also the number of men seeking work in non-agricultural activities reportedly increased. Men reported to have migrated only in drought years in Talwad in Maharashtra. Apart from non-agricultural activities, the women and men from the villages of Pimpalgaon Nipani, Talwade, Dodi Bk, Bhondre and Nimon in Maharashtra, reported going to nearby villages with irrigation facilities to seek agricultural work during low rainfall years. In the villages of Sayale, Mulegaon, Kalmuste, Pemgiri and Pokhari in Maharashtra, women and men were engaged in agricultural activities outside their 36 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA village in both good and bad rainfall years, but the number of days of doing this was greater in years of low rainfall since work opportunities in their villages were low. Working in agriculture outside the village was limited to the cultivation of sugarcane, grapes or onions. Those products are grown only under irrigated conditions and thus are less affected by rainfall. To work outside the village, the workers travelled daily from their villages to irrigated areas, which were not too far from their homes. Only in Karanjad, Maharashtra, both men and women migrated across the border to the state of Gujarat to engage in sugarcane cultivation. This evidence suggests that the presence of irrigated areas nearby the drought-affected villages in Maharashtra prompted both men and women to go to those areas in search of work during low rainfall years. This migration flow depressed agricultural wages in the irrigated areas as well. In the village of Keonjhar in Orissa, in six out of the eight villages where women reportedly participated in non-agricultural activities, their work days increased in low rainfall years by a very few days and in two other villages, they worked for the same number of days in those activities. In one of the villages where women made plates for eating from leaflets collected from the forest, they reported a fall in work days in this activity due to lack of fresh leaves during dry periods. In Keonjhar, the women did not seem to depend upon the non- agricultural sector as a coping strategy while men reported working a greater number of days doing non- agricultural activities, such as factory work, construction and mining. However, women in seven villages reported doing agricultural work outside their village. The women from Nuagaon said that they travelled 50 km within the district to do transplanting work in the drought year since no work was available near their village and lower wages were quoted due to the influx many women from other villages seeking work.

In Maharashtra, the participants \u2013 both men and women \u2013 in 10 out of the 13 villages reported a fall in wages during periods of low rain rainfall as compared to periods with normal rainfall. The most common reason for this was explained by a man from Karanjad who said, \u201cThere is lower demand in low rainfall years. But with the same availability of labour, bargaining power of labourers goes down.\u201d In three villages, workers reported no wage decrease during low rain years. According to a man in the village of Virgaon, who is an agricultural worker, with the option of working in non-agricultural activities available, the labourers would not agree to work in agriculture for lower wages even if it meant that they would not be hired since there was an option of working in the non-agriculture sector. Availability of alternative employment opportunities was the reason for wages not falling during low rainfall periods in the village of Nimon, as well. In the village of Pemgiri, however, the participants reported that the fall in demand for labour was less, so the wages did not fall too much and that there were jobs available in the non-farm sector. Participants from villages in Orissa offered a different story. The men reported no fall in wages in all of the villages with the exception of Jajopasi. According to the villagers of Jajopasi, demand for men workers also fell as little rice crop was sown and the production of the other crops tended to be less labour intensive than the production of rice). The men from Jajopasi reported their bargaining power in negotiating wages was reduced due to very few non-farm work opportunities. The women reported receiving lower wages in eight villages due to less rice transplanting work available. Based on the group discussions, land preparation, ploughing and sowing \u2013 tasks carried out primarily in the cultivation rice \u2013 are performed before the monsoon sets in; however, when transplanting and weeding cannot be done due to lack of sufficient standing water in the fields, the demand for female labour falls along with their wages. During a low rain season, other crops, such as maize and vegetables, were not affected as the rainfall received was sufficient to grow those crops. In some villages, the participants reported an increase in 37 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA maize and vegetable cultivation in kharif season and mustard, niger and wheat acreage in other seasons, which resulted in more utilization of male labour relative to female labour. In the other five villages, neither the males nor the females reported any loss in wages since there was no active labour market as households had small landholdings and mostly just worked on their farms or in other non-farm activities during low rainfall years. The differing wage responses to drought across villages were the result of a combination of factors including, among them, the effect on demand for labour and availability of other non-farm work. Thus, demand and supply changes were reported as the main channels that affect wages: notably, weak health was not reported in any village as a possible reason for receiving lower wages. The above was also reflected in work days in agriculture reported for high and low rainfall years. On average, women reported working for 144 days in Maharashtra in a normal rainfall year and 43 days in a low rainfall year while men reported working for 137 days in a normal rainfall year and 42 days in a low rainfall year. Thus, the fall in employment for both men and women was about 70 percent. In Orissa, on the other hand, women on average reported getting work for 68 days in a normal monsoon year20 and 19 days in a low rainfall year, while men got work for 68 days in a normal year and 40 days in a low rainfall year. A fall in employment was 70 percent for women and 40 percent for men, indicating that demand shifts are gendered in rainfed rice-growing areas due to cultivation practices. Triambhak and Patana blocks were not declared drought hit by the government since their loss in crop yield was less than 50 percent. Comparing these blocks with others shows that wage responses did not differ much across these and other blocks due to overall low rainfall in the entire district, which resulted in a reduction in crop yields even in these blocks though their losses were less than those of the other blocks.

For children, the specific recommendations include extension of midday meals on holidays for school children and greater provisions through the Anganwadi centre for infants. The participants in Nashik and Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra, reported that no supplemental food was provided by the government in any of the villages. The villagers relied on the Public Distribution System (PDS) for their cereal provisions. They consider the PDS grain to be of inferior quality, but during the low rainfall years, they also increased their consumption of it as other options were limited due lack of money. In Maharashtra, drinking water was being supplied through tank in 11 out of the 13 villages, while fodder was being made available for livestock in seven villages only recently. Many of the villagers had already sold some of their livestock as they were unable to arrange sufficient water and fodder for them in the time of need. Villagers, however, noted that the water from tanks was irregular and inadequate to meet their daily needs. As a result, despite the provision, women had to fetch water from alternative places to meet the daily needs of family members and livestock. No other financial assistance was provided by the government except loan assistance in a few places. An employment guarantee scheme and other schemes had been set up in 2011 to meet the demands of the villagers as agricultural work was limited in eight of the 13 villages. In Orissa, on the other hand, none of the participants reported having received supplemental food, water supply from the tanks or fodder help. The latter could be because the lack of fodder problem was less severe in the hilly areas as they are close to forests. However, in the villages in the plain lowlands, the shortage of fodder resulted in the death of a few livestock. In five out of the 13 villages, the government had provided financial assistance to cultivator households depending upon their losses (on a per acre landholding basis). On the discussion of provisions, a man from Sadangi village said, \u201cthe farmers pay for mandatory crop insurance at the time of receiving crop loans but no claims were entertained despite losses last year.\u201d The government started an employment guarantee scheme and other construction programmes in 2010 in 10 out of the 13 villages. Other provisions by the government included free supply of oilseeds and others products for the next crop to make up for the losses in rice production. In addition, the government set up a medical camp in Kantiapada to deal with increasing cases of diarrhea in the village. According to the participants, the only government provision that seemed functional was the public works provided under NREGS. In Maharashtra, out of the 13 villages, participants from seven villages reported getting some employment under the public works programme in drought years. In Orissa, out of the 13 villages, participants from eight of the villages reported having received employment under the programme 21 The manual can be accessed at http://agricoop.nic.in/DroughtMgmt/DroughtManual.pdf 40 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA in drought years. However, as discussed earlier, not all households that requested work received it and less than 100 days of work was provided under the scheme even in drought years. The days ranged from 10-60 per household across villages, according to the villagers. Water was provided in selected villages in Maharashtra. Fetching drinking water was not much of a problem in selected villages of Orissa but the contamination of it and lack of water for livestock and for other purposes were concerns of the women participants. In the focus groups discussions women were asked whether the measures stated in the drought manual were put in place during the last drought year in their village. In none of the villages women reported them being functional and none of the specific health measures targeted at women were undertaken although women in many villages in Maharashtra, reported joint pains due to calcium deficiency and low platelets as a result of vitamin deficiencies. Livestock The sale of livestock as a coping mechanism by households was reported in 10 villages in Maharashtra and in all 13 villages in Orissa. In Maharashtra, the participants estimated that 25 to 50 percent of the households may have sold some of their livestock.

This difference could be driven by the fact that farmers in Maharashtra raise livestock, such as cows and buffaloes, for milk and other dairy products whereas farmers in Orissa raise goats, chicken and sheep for meat. Thus, in Maharashtra livestock were treated as an investment which needs to pay off in the coming years and as a result, the owners would part with them during extreme economic circumstances. The participants did report, however, that milk production had fallen by as much as 50 to 80 percent due to insufficient water and fodder during the low rainfall year. Women mostly look after rearing the livestock at home while men are more concerned with marketing the produce in the rural areas. Thus, a concern among women was lack of fodder, which increased their time spent on collecting fodder to feed the animals. Food The women participants were more worried about food intake than men since they were the primary caretakers of children and children\u2019s health was a matter of greater concern to them. The men in most of the villages reported only a limited reduction in food intake. They attributed this to access to loans from the cooperative society or the cutting of other household expenditures to buy food. They also noted a reduction in the quality of the cereals they consumed because more of their food purchases were made at ration shops. Women, on the other hand, were much more concerned about food quality. They noted that their consumption of pulses and vegetables had dropped to almost nothing and to meet their food needs they mostly relied on inferior quality cereals. While the minimum food requirements were being fulfilled, children and adults were undernourished, with weakness and fatigue becoming a common problem among them due to lack of sufficient nutrients. The women in Keonjhar also said that changes in dietary composition were a concern. They reduced rice, pulses and vegetables in their diet and in some cases increased the intake of bajra, a coarse cereal. The reduction in quality was worrisome, especially for the young children in the family. Health In five villages in Maharashtra, namely Talwade, Nimon, Bhondre, Pokhari and Pangarmal, the men did not report any adverse consequences on their health during low rainfall years. In Talwade, they explained that water was being treated with chlorine, and as a result there were no reported cases of stomach-related disorders or other health problems. The men from Nimon said that they did not suffer major health problems as the primary health centre was nearby. In the other villages, the commonly reported health problems by men were diarrhoea, dysentery, fatigue, fever and dehydration. Women in the villages in Maharashtra reported that they had suffered health problems during the low rainfall years. In addition to the ailments mentioned above, the women indicated that they experienced fainting and exhaustion due to the need to 41 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA walk long distances to fetch water, fodder and firewood. In Pimpalgaon, Talwade, Sayale, Pemgiri, Pokhari and Pangarmal, the women complained about joint pains. A 34-year-old woman in Pokhari explained that the women were suffering from joint pains and swollen legs due to the need to walk long distances in order to get useful work and to carry out housework tasks like fetching water and fodder. To emphasize her point, the woman showed the group her swollen legs. A 25-year-old woman from Talwade noted that joint pains were common among women due to calcium deficiency in the area as the milk production had gone down and consequently the intake of milk had fallen. In Pangarmal, a 40-year-old woman also complained about the burden of looking after children and the increased household chores while searching for work coupled with lower nutrition, which had drained her physically and resulted in body pain, fatigue, joint pains and swollen legs. A woman in Nimon also reported that a few women from her village had their blood tested after feeling extreme fatigue and were found to have very low platelet counts. Such problems were not reported by men, highlighting clearly that the health problems suffered by men and women were different. Increased fatigue among women is a manifestation of an increased workload associated with household chores and lower iron and calcium intake as milk and vegetable consumption reduced. Men, on the other hand, did not fetch water and firewood due to traditionally predefined roles by gender in the rural households of India.

In the village of Kantiapada, a doctor camp was set up after most of the residents of the village reportedly were suffering from diarrhoea. The doctors provided the villagers with medicine and chlorine to purify the drinking water. The women participants showed two extra concerns, the increased burden of childcare as diarrhoea and dysentery became rampant among children and fatigue and fainting stemming from the need to walk long distances to fetch water. A 30-year-old women from the village of Parudiposi said that in her community there were increased incidences of fainting and falling down, especially among pregnant women. A 36-year-old woman in Ukhunda reported that an acquaintance of hers had a miscarriage after falling down while fetching water. Deaths of women occurring while fetching water were also not uncommon. Although none of the female participants reported any such event, media reports shed some light on this issue. According to Dipti Raut, an employee of Indian Broadcasting Network Lokmat, a Marathi news channel, deaths and injury of women had been reported in two other districts of Maharashtra,22 which had also been affected by water scarcity in 2011. She said these were only a few reported incidences, but villagers conveyed to her that every year such deaths happen when there was scarcity of water due to low rainfall. These deaths, however, go largely unreported and unnoticed. Some women fell in the well in search of water or while digging at the base to impound some water. Some women died on their way to fetch water due to dehydration and exhaustion. Fodder, water and fuelwood collection The woman participants were also asked about the average hours they spent fetching water, looking after livestock, including the collection of fodder, and collecting fuelwood in a normal year as compared to the year when the rainfall was low and water was scarce. In the villages in Maharashtra that had access to piped water, the women didn\u2019t need to spend time to collect water in normal years. However, in 2011, when the rainfall level was low and the piped water stopped flowing, they had to fetch water from nearby wells or streams. In Mulegaon, women participants complained that during that period, they had to queue up at a canal near the village from 12 a.m. onwards to get water in the morning, and that the whole process took three to four hours. A 40-year-old woman in the village of Nimon commented that the women were spending so much time collecting water and fodder that they had little time to participate in the employment guarantee work scheme that had been started in the village. In the village of Bhondre, women complained that the water 22 A few incidences she shared with the author were; death of Parvati Jadhav in Dolara village on 15 April 2012, death of Roshana Shinde in Kinaste village on 24 May 2012, and injury of Sonali Gotarane in Shirasgoan villagein Thane District on 6 June 2012, and death of Rakhmabai Sonawane in Walvadi village in Nashik on 9 May 2012 District. 42 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA in tanks was so unfit for drinking that it was only given to the animals and that the women of the village had to fetch their own drinking water from a well 3-4 km away. In many villages in Orissa, drinking water was available in a hand pump but it could only be used for drinking purposes because the pressure was low and people preferred to conserve it. For example in Jantari, the hand pipe was partially functional so village drinking water was not an issue. However, as the hand pump provided only a limited amount of water, the villagers went to a nearby stream to get water for other purposes. In Kuanar, the women were very concerned about the condition of a nearby stream. This stream was the village\u2019s only source of water and it had dried up in 2010 when the level of rainfall fell. A 28-year-old woman from the village recalled that collecting water during that time took a lot of time and energy as she had to dig up the soil in the stream and use a mug to collect it.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2177a3f0-f5ab-44f6-a299-4c71e166de40": {"__data__": {"id_": "2177a3f0-f5ab-44f6-a299-4c71e166de40", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd3cd26eaa510c0fba73594c1d204ab8a27c304a1440ad98522826337200f62c"}, "2": {"node_id": "af7aa5c8-9bf4-43f9-94c7-2230fe2060d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d189c9f5cec758355d45629bfe54c6a73af5eeec937e3c2d4e20f2fa788af174"}}, "hash": "c94889bf4da4f015c6a47062cfdc06454482d4829133a8d58b0dd48c7f831c3b", "text": "The women in the village of Nuagaon had similar complaints about a nearby river drying up, which forced them to dig in the river bed to impound water and also make multiple trips to fetch water.

They also noted that there were long queues for retrieving water from the hand pumps due to the low water pressure. In the village of Ukhunda, a 35-year-old woman said the women of the village had to walk 7-8 km to get water after the only hand pump in the village had become dysfunctional, and that many of them fainted on the way to get water. Table 5.9 contains a summary of the average hours women reportedly spent to fetch water, look after livestock, including the collection of fodder, and collecting fuelwood in a normal year and in the year with low rainfall. In all of the villages, with the exception of Kantiapada, the women reported spending more time collecting water in the low rainfall year. Although this village was not declared drought affected by the definition adopted by the Government of India, water was scarce and the crop yields declined. On the whole, the women spent five times longer to fetch water in a low rainfall year as compared to a normal year in Maharashtra and four times longer in Orissa. On average, during a low rainfall year, the women in Maharashtra spent 2.1 hours per day to collect water while those in Orissa spent 2.7 hours. In Maharashtra the women raise cows and buffaloes. They reported spending more time taking care of their animals, largely due to increased time spent to collect fodder. In seven villages in Orissa, however, the villagers did not suffer from a shortage of fodder. This is because the villages are near a forest, and the women tend to raise animals that require less fodder in their diet, such as goats and chickens. The impact of low rainfall affected women\u2019s time for collecting firewood more in Maharashtra than in Orissa as Keonjhar is rich in forest resources. Also, in Keonjhar, the women tended to use dried leaves as fuelwood. In the villages of Nuagaon and Jajopasi, the households mostly purchased those leaves from the market instead of collecting them, thus saving time spent on firewood collection. Commercial sex work by women for survival during drought During the discussion with local partner NGOs, a matter of concern which came up was if girls during years of low rainfall were also pushed into prostitution because of hard economic conditions. Activists from the Pravara Medical Trust, a NGO in Nashik, which looked into the medical needs and rehabilitation of the sex workers in the Nashik area, set up a meeting with two sex workers who allegedly were forced into prostitution in drought years in their village due to lack of other job alternatives. Ms. Radha, aged 43 years, and Ms. Gita, aged 40 years, were interviewed about the circumstances that led them into prostitution. They had entered into the profession as young girls. The mother of Ms. Radha had been ailing and did not receive any form of compensation. In her search for work, Ms. Radha found that the jobs available under the employment guarantee scheme were 3-4 km away. She was in a desperate situation as her family was landless and she also needed to care for three siblings. Ms. Gita and her family members could not find work under the employment guarantee scheme due to corruption. Unavailability of other work in the village due to lack of rain forced Ms. Gita into prostitution to earn income for her family to prevent them from dying of hunger. Ms. Radha and Ms. Gita said that many other women whom they knew had entered into prostitution in drought years in their villages due the lack of job opportunities and dire economic conditions. 43 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA Table 5.9.

Conclusion The first part of the paper aimed to determine if the shocks to agricultural productivity, such as rainfall variability, affect the wages received by men and women in rural India differently. After examining data from 1993 to 2007 from 17 states of India, the results showed that rainfall shocks had only a limited effect on the gender wage gap. However, notably, in the rainfed rice-growing regions of India, women farmers suffered a greater loss in their wages as compared to their male counterparts in low rainfall years. As a result, the gender wage gap increased in low rainfall years in the rainfed rice-growing regions in comparison to other areas. The results suggest that relatively large concentration of women in the cultivation of crops that were severely affected by rainfall variability made them more vulnerable to labour market losses during low rainfall years. The second aim of the paper was to understand the differential impact of drought on men and women in rural India through focus group discussions. The discussions revealed that in terms of the labour supply response to weather variability, men appeared to have a clear advantage in searching for non-agriculture work outside their villages. Women tended to be the main caretakers of children and other family members, as well as tasked with carrying out the household chores, and thus preferred to work near or inside their villages. That constrained their ability to cope by taking another job during years when it rained little. The focus group discussions showed that women\u2019s increased time spent in home production activities, such as collecting water, fodder and firewood, and unpaid work, such as taking care of sick children, during years of low rainfall kept them away from both the agricultural and non-agricultural labour markets. Empirically, the lack of time use data over years in India served as a constraint in analysing the effect of weather shocks on time use and the welfare of women. The focus group discussions highlighted the need for regular time use surveys to understand the potential impacts of various macroeconomic shocks. The focus group discussions also revealed that lower access to clean water and nutritious food were of greater concern to women than men since these concerns fell in their purview of taking care of the household chores, while the availability of loans and financial compensation for farm loss were greater concerns for men. This indicated that the spheres of influence were gendered and the concerns were also therefore gendered. Women also suffered from greater health effects than men. They reported increased incidence of joint pains, low platelet counts and fainting due to lower nutrition and being tasked with the more stressful and exhausting work of fetching water.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9db89404-669e-4480-9df4-88275ad8c1c0": {"__data__": {"id_": "9db89404-669e-4480-9df4-88275ad8c1c0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Blame it on the Rain?: Gender differentiated impacts of drought on agricultural wage and work in India", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1845ab1260f0a22f06e16d22de00047ab56ed9345ae7a1ef50bffee4a2a184e"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2e24f39-7fe4-4228-bc21-0192e4186c31", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/blame-it-rain-gender-differentiated-impacts-drought-agricultural-wage-and-work-india", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "acf659c511548a6caf6ca6a44bc0a1fd6a35aa29bead0838d4a26bb9ef451e5d"}}, "hash": "c5c5ff2374ce5cc4f4c060285bc7e107708bd7f5bbd16919dbc3466e00d85adc", "text": "Not only did women undertake household chores, in families with economic difficulties, they also searched for non-agriculture or agricultural work outside their village, which, coupled with greater housework, led to fatigue. It was also noted that drought and the lack of alternative job opportunities could also force women into sex-work. The drought management policy of the Government of India has special health provisions for women and children during drought years. However, the administration support to carry out those provisions was mostly dysfunctional on the ground as the villagers surveyed reported that they had not received them in recent years. The policy does not clearly specify how those provisions are to be distributed, which resulted in lack of implementation of the schemes. The government policy only states that state public health departments are responsible for disbursing them through Anganwadi or health centres. Further clarification on the administration of these schemes is required in order to give greater accountability in their implementation.

This policy is clearly myopic. Firstly, water is needed for other essential purposes, such as for livestock, bathing and washing utensils and clothes. Secondly, even if drinking water is available near the village, it is often contaminated during low rainfall years and as reported, the pressure in the village water pipes is very low, leading to longer waiting hours for those who are collecting water. Since water collection is the sole responsibility of women in India, a comprehensive water management policy during drought can decrease their drudgery and reduce adverse consequences on their health, which, in some cases, results in deaths. Thus, water, health and sanitation requirements need to be stressed in formulating drought management policies in order for them to have a beneficial impact on women. 45 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA There is a provision in the existing policy for involving women SHGs at the village level in deciding drought management in the village. Yet, this had not been taking place in any of the villages visited. The only people responsible for taking governance decisions are panchayat members. The Panchayat members put up demands to the local authorities but have little control over what is given unless they are very influential. Thus, the existence of comprehensive drought management plans could facilitate the smooth delivery of essential services. The drought management policy should be set as a packaged deal in a village while at the block level, the package can be decided for the entire block in advance based on the usual needs of the area, and immediately implemented if a drought-like condition prevails in any village in the block. Piecemeal provisions are clearly inadequate, particularly when they are left at the discretion of local governing personnel who often only make decisions on drought management when a drought hits. The setting of long-term strategies for rainwater harvesting and the creation of irrigation sources, such as canals, also need to be stressed and cannot be neglected. These tools are critical as they not only help reduce the vulnerability of the population to drought, but they also increase the well-being of farmers by helping them to diversify into other cash crops, thus improving their incomes. 46 BLAME IT ON THE RAIN?: GENDER DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS OF DROUGHT ON AGRICULTURAL WAGE AND WORK IN INDIA References Adhvaryu, Achyuta, A.

This paper focuses on an analysis of the lessons learned from applications of the Peace and Stability Development Analysis (PSDA)1 that was initiated in 2005 by UNDP and the Government of Fiji (Ministry of Multi Ethnic Affairs and National Reconciliation and Unity - MNRU), in collaboration with the Ecumenical Centre for Research, Education and Advocacy (ECREA)2.

I Summary 7 3. The decision to undertake a Peace and Stability Development Analysis (PSDA) in Fiji was guided by a desire to obtain a comprehensive overview of the Fijian society\u2019s perceptions of the issues and problems around peace, stability and development (to complement available knowledge and understanding) and to obtain consensus on priorities for peacebuilding and development. This was not a detailed con\ufb02 ict analysis3 exercise. The PSDA was also used to provide a legitimate space for moderate voices (just before the national parliamentarian elections of May 2006) and to create a number of \u201centry points\u201d for a more sustained engagement of UNDP, other UN agencies and donors in supporting the development of a peace and stability architecture. 3 To complement the PSDA, UNDP commissioned a series of papers on con\ufb02 ict dynamics and instability in Fiji. CONFLICT SENSITIVE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND PROCESSES Con\ufb02 ict sensitivity focuses on shifting responses from working around con\ufb02 ict to working on and in con\ufb02 ict. That is, outcomes of con\ufb02 ict analysis are used to programme interventions and activities that are geared towards either working directly on the dynamics and causes of con\ufb02 ict and strengthening the foundations of peace, or that have taken into account those dynamics so that risks of development interventions deepening and/or accelerating con\ufb02 ict dynamics are minimized. Con\ufb02 ict analysis and development tools contribute by placing the issues on the agenda and enabling a number of possible outcomes to emerge: \u2022 Context analysis: provides an overview of the actors and interests/processes/dynamics of the con\ufb02 ict as well as an understanding of root and proximate causes, the multiple manifestations and triggering factors of con\ufb02 ict and instability; \u2022 Transformative processes: Depending on the approach in the application of the tools, the combination of participatory /consultative approaches associated with the use of the tool provides signi\ufb01 cant insights into priorities to transform status quo and creates spaces for \ufb01 nding common ground; \u2022 Con\ufb01 dence building: The extensive use of dialogue amongst all stakeholders as part of these processes is an essential element in trust building. The application of the tool is part of a broader strategy to build trust through consensus and is part of the con\ufb01 dence building measures promoted by donors and or governments for peacebuilding and con\ufb02 ict prevention; \u2022 Commonly agreed priorities: These tools and processes seek to identify and elaborate the areas of work where different stakeholders can \ufb01 nd common ground to move forward. The emphasis is on \ufb01 nding agreement for priorities rather than developing radically new ideas and propositions to move forward on. II Background to the Peace, Stability and Development Analysis (PSDA) in the Fiji Islands 8 4. The focus was on identifying what would be required in promoting a peaceful and stable Fiji and strengthening of peacebuilding efforts. As an exercise, it was visionary and future orientated, rather than a focus on the past or reconciliation of past grievances. It emphasized the critical distinctions between negative and positive peace and circumvented a direct analysis of stakeholders given the sensitivities associated with addressing these at all levels in public. 5.

(2006), \u201cPeace Building as a gendered process\u201d in: Journal of Social Issues, Volume 62, No 1, 2006, pp-141-153. III Conceptual Underpinnings of the PSDA and Gender Considerations 7. Given that con\ufb02 ict analysis is increasingly used as an entry point for recovery and developing programming, the question of how gender is taken into consideration becomes ever more relevant. Economic development and democracy, central tenets of UNDP\u2019s development agenda, are inextricably linked to gender equality. Effective participatory and bottom-up PSDA type of exercises should encompass a gender approach as i) they help link gender issues to multi-stakeholder processes, ii) create spaces -particularly for those sectors of the community who experience marginalization in the public sphere, and iii) legitimize marginal voices to raise and address aspects of gender and other issues. 8. Peacebuilding operates within a speci\ufb01 c set of cultural values and local contexts. Cultural values and traditions also play a very strong role in determining gender roles and relations. Both culture and gender are dynamic and evolve and change in relation to all forms of con\ufb02 ict. While we know more of the differentiated impact of con\ufb02 ict on men and women and have an initial understanding of how women contribute to recovery and peace building, there is still a signi\ufb01 cant gap in understanding to build response frameworks that take gender differentiated perspectives as the starting point. For example, some initial research has shown that women tend to focus more on the processes and relations of social reconstruction4 and alleviating the impacts of con\ufb02 ict on communities and less on physical and institutional rebuilding. Women activists in con\ufb02 ict contexts advocate for transformative approaches that link the private and the public spheres in the discourses and practice of peacebuilding. This is in sharp contrast with mainstream responses that tend to focus almost exclusively on rebuilding infrastructure and the machinery of public institutions. 9. Building the practice and knowledge of the gender dimensions of peacebuilding is important because PSDA approaches are often deployed in situations of negative peace and/or post-con\ufb02 ict contexts where peace building is a priority. As a concept, peacebuilding is de\ufb01 ned, interpreted and executed in a wide variety of ways. While a precise de\ufb01 nition does not seem desirable or possible, the acknowledged focus is on a process that has a structural, relational and cultural orientation and encompasses goals and values of equality, social justice, improved social relations and meeting basic needs. What is required now is an in depth understanding of the gender dimensions of peacebuilding both in research and in methodologies of con\ufb02 ict analysis and planning, to ensure that response frameworks and transformation models acknowledge women\u2019s contributions to peacebuilding, address their strategic interests and respond effectively to women\u2019s practical needs. 10. The importance of the distinction between immediate practical needs and longer term strategic interests serves to illuminate the domain of gender politics in the context of a con\ufb02 ict and development analysis and translate \u2018prioritized concerns\u2019 of women as well as men into planning processes for addressing them. Practical needs relate to the condition or 10 immediate material circumstances, their present workloads and responsibilities. For women, they frequently refer to, for example, the need for a clean and reliable water supply, health services, credit schemes or access to rural banking. These needs may be addressed by practical and short-term development interventions, but taken alone, they are rarely suf\ufb01 cient to transform unequal aspects of gender relations in the private and public domains. However, responses to practical gender needs can provide the initial entry point to work with women and develop links to strategic interests. Unintentionally, responses might have negative or even violent impacts on women\u2019s situation by not involving, or sensitizing men, or linking them to the longer term and underlying strategic interests; e.g. credit schemes for women can exacerbate Gender Based Violence (GBV) when there is a failure to address GBV as a strategic issue in con\ufb02 ict analysis.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "24d820ad-f8a9-4a9f-9747-500261c8f3b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "24d820ad-f8a9-4a9f-9747-500261c8f3b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Can Conflict Analysis Processes Support Gendered Visions of Peace Building?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fc2c86e065cacd40a9d75ec31b7966ed497fcb7f4091a89b45b0279c48fd2d7"}, "2": {"node_id": "36d6ef97-a4c2-4a5b-8d90-ea7426adef69", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e02364124686fb66b9f3349e95dbd90cbe155baf018cdb1ce3cbcf009b0ff865"}}, "hash": "1b18fe503e00c3c8c667b20d6f20c80cf34e907e8fa734b7a08e95a625622b7d", "text": "11.

A con\ufb02 ict analysis and the resulting planning discourse that remains at the level of needs and is blind to gender strategic interests will not promote the required transformation of institutional rules, practices and perceptions that can change women\u2019s position and may even exacerbate a state of negative peace and instability for both men and women. 12. In order to elicit gender practical needs and strategic interests as part of the analysis process, it is necessary to undertake purposely-designed activities to encourage women - and men in subordinate positions - to participate, as there are many factors that mitigate against ensuring that their perspectives, needs and interests are made visible and prioritized. This is particularly the case for women whose voices are silent for a number of reasons: \u2022 Women and youth are excluded or marginalized in processes of public planning, political discourse and other public domains; \u2022 Culture and tradition dictate submission to men as heads of households in the private sphere and deference to the opinions and decisions of traditional male leaders in the public domain; \u2022 Prevailing notions of unequal gender relations resulting from religious beliefs, biological pre-determination or the enshrinements of culture; \u2022 Fear of GBV for speaking out or against male leadership or behavior in public; \u2022 Dominant social, ethnic and religious cleavages of a whole community or grouping may blind recognition and action across gender lines; \u2022 Lack of recognition, self-esteem and acknowledgement of women\u2019s work in rebuilding communities, building peace and overcoming trauma; 11 \u2022 Predominant focus of analysis in the tools is on the institutions of the public sphere; \u2022 Lack of an enabling political environment for gender sensitive analysis coupled with perceptions of gender-blind institutional planning, practices and procedures entrenched in hierarchical and bureaucratic structures; \u2022 Lack of, or limited, preparatory work with women and women\u2019s organizations to facilitate the development of gender transformative agendas; \u2022 Marginal level of gender perspectives and tools of analysis present in the contemporary con\ufb02 ict prevention and peacebuilding theory and practice. 13. A key dimension of a gender sensitive framework consists in including men and moving beyond stereotypes of men and boys. Gender equality and the transformation of gender relations to sustain peace are usually considered to refer exclusively to women. This perception has obscured important facets of con\ufb02 ict analysis and hindered effective mainstreaming and planning responses. There is an emerging body of research on boys\u2019 and men\u2019s gendered identities, masculinities and relations between men and between men, women and girls. The importance of these issues and the way they are linked to violence, con\ufb02 ict and negative peace are largely left unaddressed in con\ufb02 ict analysis and in policies and programmes of Governments and international organizations. There is an urgent need to unpack this complex set of issues and revisit tools of analysis and planning to incorporate gender issues of men and boys -as well as women and girls- and challenge the social construction of masculinities and femininities. This could help address inequities in socialization, issues of identity and in the longer-term support processes that generate more balanced gender relations between men and women and between men themselves. 14. In practice the above means that PSDA tools and processes will need to be contextualized and strengthened to ensure that gender considerations for women and men and between men are explored as part of the analysis. 12 5 Thomas, P.

In Fiji and other parts of the Paci\ufb01 c5, attention has been seldom given to formally acknowledging or documenting the roles and contributions women make to restoring or maintaining peace within and across communities. Their stories are told in informal contexts and meetings and often pass unnoticed by formal institutions and leadership. During the implementation of the PSDA, participants learned important lessons on the different roles women and men play in building and maintaining peace and understanding the root causes of con\ufb02 ict and their differing consequences. These points are elaborated in the different phases of the PSDA. 16. Deliberate efforts were taken by the technical experts and the facilitation teams to reframe gender issues to be seen as legitimate and relevant obstacles to peace in the context of the overall exercise.

Gender, ethnicity, class, age, sexuality and religious beliefs mediate these differences. The idea was to develop a participatory process to enable planners a better identi\ufb01 cation of who is affected and in which way. In Fiji it enabled the voices of local communities (different social and ethnic groups, gender roles and social class) to be heard and validated. There are still relatively isolated experiences of this nature. 17. The key components of the tool (vision, obstacles to peace, peacebuilding lessons learned, scenarios and planning responses) were not modi\ufb01 ed to integrate a gender dimension. Instead, a strategy was developed to counterbalance cultural and locally contextualized barriers for women and other marginalized voices to participate. Given the context of Fiji (i.e. the signi\ufb01 cant interplay of religion and tradition in mediating and controlling gender relations) the analysis of gender and con\ufb02 ict was not singled out as an issue that needed special attention in the consultations. Instead, the approach was to try to ensure that marginal voices were included with the mainstream development actors and their concerns heard and taken into account in the design of response strategies. Partnership development 18. The experience of PSDA in Fiji highlights that integrating gender considerations required both conceptualizations of the key issues and extensive consultation with partners and others in the design phase (as well as the critical follow-up to analysis in mainstreaming and programming initiatives) in order to ensure they are tackled effectively. In Fiji careful 13 consideration was given to the identi\ufb01 cation of NGO partners that had both a record of accomplishment of working on con\ufb02 ict issues as well as gender (e.g. trauma healing, peace camps for youth and peacebuilding with women in communities and advocacy, and training on UN Resolution 1325). Other institutional considerations included the presence of women in management positions and the availability of diverse women and men facilitators with gender sensitivity. 19. During the preliminary discussions with partners and the implementing agencies, workshops were held on the adaptation of the PSDA for the local context. This included the principle of women\u2019s and youth\u2019s active participation, the range of current gender concerns, the links to peace and development and the concepts of practical and strategic responses for peace and con\ufb02 ict transformation. As a result, a number of gender related issues came up as a barrier for women and youth to participate effectively in the process and for gender issues to be elicited, e.g. speaking out in mixed gender grouping; lack of women\u2019s public leadership; speaking in front of traditional and religious male leaders; marginalized voices of young women and men in public forums or processes; public shame and recrimination associated with taboo subjects of GBV such as family incest, violence, rape sexuality, etc. Based on this preliminary analysis a number of collective strategies were developed with the partners to mitigate against these barriers and try to maximize the participation and voices of women and other marginalized groups from all sectors of the society. 20. The key strategy agreed upon in the PSDA was to ensure that gender equality and the links to peacebuilding objectives were made explicit throughout the process. In the context of Fiji, this required that women as well as men had leadership roles in each stage, had the capacity to de\ufb01 ne and analyze the issues, construct visions of peace and to identify a series of actions to help realize the goals of a positive peace. This approach helped integrate diverse women and men\u2019s voices to the process. Selection of facilitators 21. Facilitators for the PSDA process were drawn from the staff of implementing agencies in the Government and the NGO. While the NGO staff had greater levels of experience on mediation issues and facilitation skills, overall the PSDA was a new approach (both conceptually and methodologically) for all involved. In total, 15 facilitators/team members were selected and deployed in mixed teams throughout the whole PSDA project. 22. The goal in the selection of facilitators was to achieve gender, age and ethnic balance. Having women as facilitators was important both in terms of ensuring they were bene\ufb01 ciaries of capacity building but also for their role in the workshops. Their presence in a lead role helped facilitate women\u2019s participation and create legitimate spaces for gender issues to be addressed. This was consistently reinforced in the training of facilitators as well as team meetings and backstopping throughout the PSDA process. 14 Capacity building 23.

In addition, facilitators were accompanied throughout the project with refresher and lessons learned workshops in between key phases. 24. In Fiji, the capacity building with government and NGOs needed to address a range of issues pertaining to Con\ufb02 ict and Development Analysis as well as participatory development, facilitation and mediation skills and issues of equality and empowerment. Overall, there were severe constraints associated with partner capacity, time-lines, availability of facilitators and trust between government and civil society. 25. The above context made it dif\ufb01 cult to also focus on gender issues in their own right. The gender objectives were about sensitizing facilitators towards women\u2019s needs in the context of the workshop and in make possible the identi\ufb01 cation of key gender issues and perspectives. 26. It was during this phase, that teams identi\ufb01 ed a range of possible challenges to overcome during facilitation. One of the most important was around the issues of younger women facilitating the process or being perceived as challenging the traditional power hierarchies of senior men or religious leaders. To help counterbalance this, the facilitators designed and enacted role-plays in small teams and shared feedback and strategies to deal with possible gender and culture based challenges and stereotypes. Techniques and assertiveness skills were shared and adapted in the facilitation training. 27. In many contexts where Con\ufb02 ict Analysis tools are used, notions of con\ufb02 ict/development and peacebuilding tend to be fragmented and/or compartmentalized. Overall, conceptual and practical linkages between development and security on the one hand, and between development and peacebuilding on the other, are relatively new. It is also the case that gender perspectives of con\ufb02 ict and instability are new for many governments and civil society organizations facing dilemmas towards peace building and attempting to construct alternatives on a daily basis. Adding the critical dimension of gender to capacity building initiatives requires additional time, greater conceptual demands and above all, an effective theoretical/practical integration of the issues in both the CDA tool and the capacity building modules. The PSDA process was able to partly achieve these goals but was continuously constrained by the schedule and the intensiveness of the process. Socialization and familiarization of communities with the PSDA 28. Socialization was part of a broader communication strategy to ensure transparency in the process and greater levels of con\ufb01 dence on the integrity of the project vis-\u00e0-vis all relevant stakeholders (including potential spoilers). The socialization programme consisted of a series of pre-workshop visits where government authorities, chiefs and religious leaders, local NGOs, women\u2019s youth and farmers groups were informed of the exercise and \u2018consulted on how to consult\u2019. These were the spaces in which the issues of who should be involved in the workshops were discussed. Local government and traditional leaders were involved in discussing the goals and the operating principles of the PSDA for Fiji. The issues 15 of involving women, youths, minority ethnic groups and local business were talked through and candidates were proposed and discussed in light of the criteria sought. Consensus was sought on holding the forthcoming consultations in a neutral venue (e.g. hotel) where greater levels of interaction and informality would be accepted more readily than in a church or traditional village meeting place. People agreed that this would help facilitate greater interaction of women, youth and other marginal groups and avoid the obstacles of formal seating and roles attributed to cultural and religious meeting venues. Given the complex social relations in Fiji and the high levels of distrusts that exist primarily between Fijians and Indo-Fijians and between higher authorities (chiefs, government of\ufb01 cials, priests, etc) and ordinary citizens, deciding on who should participate was a highly sensitive and political stage in the process. 29. As mentioned above and elsewhere, the consideration of gender, youth and minority balance and active participation was stressed throughout the participant selection procedures. Criteria were drawn up and a selection process designed with intended vetting by a committee of the key partners and others. Challenges were encountered with implementing this plan especially during the consultations. Comments were frequently made by government partners about people being averse to completing selection or application forms when people were usually invited to a government led event based on position, social relations and institutional af\ufb01 liations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d53bea20-edab-436f-99a6-c6d1e5e9651d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d53bea20-edab-436f-99a6-c6d1e5e9651d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Can Conflict Analysis Processes Support Gendered Visions of Peace Building?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1fb13dd8fcbf586fc47e04752d9360d21cc952800006afcd6967ff63f8bec5ef"}, "2": {"node_id": "099417c6-f7a1-442b-8af4-914b3cb741ae", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b86c59a9822f39b092db0209779ca0abb92428f78195dcb7c06c0494c503820b"}}, "hash": "eeb10246ee64d5934df4c88f49808732e687a920cde0d8e01df6e150c1ac8bcb", "text": "The implication was that a process of nomination and selection might be considered offensive to of\ufb01 cials, traditional leaders or religious leaders.

Beyond a few women\u2019s groups focusing on gender-based issues in the capital, women are active and/or organized around traditional, religious based groups or government programmes. Most of these groups focus on sustainable livelihood issues as well as the maintenance of the social and religious fabric of communities and tend to be traditional and conservative. They represent an important part of maintaining the status quo in a social structure constructed along the lines of ethnicity, clan hierarchies and religion. However, the same groups also have an awareness of increasing levels of GBV (especially violence towards women), higher levels of human and economic insecurity and concerns with drugs, chemical and substance abuse, etc., since they deal with the burden of the consequences on a daily basis. 31. The PSDA team structures for the socialization, consultations and national seminar were designed to help counter some of the challenges described above as well as other potential challenges. The teams were gender balanced and the men in the teams were sensitized to pick up gender issues and ensure dynamics did not silence women. Daily team meetings and debrie\ufb01 ngs looked for these issues and brainstormed on problems. Anticipating some of the challenges during the capacity building stage was an important backstop and source of support to the teams. 16 V Phase II: The Consultation Workshops and National Seminar PSDA consultation workshops 32. The consultation workshops (eight in total with an additional one-day National seminar) consisted of three residential days in each of the venue locations. An average of 40-50 participants attended from a wide area including the smallest island groups of the Fiji Islands. The participants focused on: \u2022 Envisioning the future; \u2022 Identifying obstacles to peace (structural and proximate factors); \u2022 Peacebuilding capacities and gaps; \u2022 Scenario building; \u2022 Future priorities and planning for positive peace 33. The format of all workshop activities was designed to help address common gender dynamics and challenges. This could be seen in the mixing of groups, small and plenary discussions, presentation opportunities for all of the participants, appropriate/gender sensitive icebreakers/energizers, probing and clarifying questions that capture gender issues and summaries and explicit ground rules on respect, con\ufb01 dentiality sharing and valuing differences etc. The regular morning and evening team debrie\ufb01 ngs were also opportunities to identify sensitive issues of\ufb02 ine and strategize support from the whole team. Examples included discreetly approaching women, youth and other minorities whose initial participation was low and discussing their needs and expectations for a fuller engagement in the workshop. This was followed up with monitoring and backing from the facilitators in session, e.g. joint small group presentations with a gender balance. 34. Despite earlier reservations by the teams, the participation and contributions of women and youth was often apparently appreciated by participants in traditional leadership and hierarchy roles. These contributions in the form of plenary presentations or small group sessions often led to positive comments or discussion by leaders and seniors on the importance of ensuring greater future participation of these marginalized voices in the public domain and decision-making forums. These reactions and the overall process was an empowering experience for many of the women, youth or minority people who took part in the PSDA. 35. An interesting and unexpected outcome of this process was that many of the participants perceived the PSDA consultation as an emotional and emancipatory experience. A great deal of emotion was expressed across a range of people. Some of this was captured on \ufb01 lm and in talking head interviews, and later edited into a short seven-minute \ufb01 lm of the PSDA and a longer documentary of 30 minutes, for National television. These reactions were explained by people as having a lack of spaces in their homes, schools, communities and workplaces to articulate their needs and views on obstacles to peace and ongoing efforts to 17 build peace. For many of the participants it was an important and often unique experience, to say something and \u201cname it\u201d and to think about and acknowledge these issues. This was particularly the case for women and young people speaking out on GBV, family violence and incest. Other sensitive topics were the impact of political violence in the family and on the main breadwinner as well as issues around women challenging husbands and other men on excessive alcohol consumption and kava/grog sessions. 36. There was a marked difference in how gender issues were addressed in the sub-national workshops and the national consultation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b48b1ec-6562-4ce7-9c3c-45d1325614c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b48b1ec-6562-4ce7-9c3c-45d1325614c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Can Conflict Analysis Processes Support Gendered Visions of Peace Building?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81627d5953df66ad85d3c8a39e6cb69004784e24281f5f32009a9b011bc443f5"}}, "hash": "81627d5953df66ad85d3c8a39e6cb69004784e24281f5f32009a9b011bc443f5", "text": "In the provinces, eliciting gender issues in the analytical process was easier as facilitators had a greater level of control over the agenda, much more time and were able to ask questions, challenge assumptions and engage women and young people in a constructive manner. During the National Seminar, gender issues were highlighted in the opening address by the Honorable Vice-President but were much less explicit in the subsequent plenary and working group sessions of the day, despite the participation of senior level government and NGO participants. This may re\ufb02 ect a focus or tendency towards addressing the macro-level and public domains while omitting or overlooking the gendered realities and concerns surfaced in the micro and meso levels of the consultations. 37. Given the shorter time (one day) for the National Seminar and the large number of participants (approximately 100), it was more dif\ufb01 cult to elicit views from a wide range of stakeholders. Discussions remained at more general and cautious levels, issues were only touched upon and it was more dif\ufb01 cult to ensure an equal number of men and women as participants. Given the combination of these factors, issues related to gender inequalities were addressed in a less visible way, in spite of efforts of the facilitating team. In order to ensure that gender does not get lost in a consultative format like the National Seminar, it may be important to have speci\ufb01 c working groups discussing gender and peacebuilding issues at all levels. At the time, this was not seen as the most appropriate approach by the Steering Committee and PSDA team. However, a subsequent assessment by the UNDP and partners team highlighted the need for a more explicit focus on gender issues that could have been cued, for example, from the opening speech of the Vice-president who is regarded as one of the most senior and progressive traditional leaders with a gender transformative agenda for peace. Findings 38. The \ufb01 ndings of the PSDA were structured into two main reports. A \u201cPeople\u2019s Strategy for Peace and Stability\u201d was a short, concise and very action orientated report targeting key civil society, government and business sector decision-makers participating in the national seminar. The report was aimed at identifying priority issues/challenges and delivering strong messages in a pre-election period. The second report, \u201cPSDA: A Framework for Action\u201d was an extended report structuring the \ufb01 ndings and presenting a series of recommendations to the Government of Fiji. The latter report was the basis for integration of issues into the National Development Plan and the design of an implementation strategy. Neither of these reports highlighted aspects of gender, peace and development. 39. During the consultations, gender-based issues were typically slow to surface but began to emerge from the stage of identifying obstacles to peace when issues were discussed 18 intensely in small groups. Examples ranged from issues of GBV and child abuse to the absence of women and youths\u2019 participation in traditional decision-making structures. It was apparent that the PSDA analysis helped to validate these issues as public concerns and everyone\u2019s obstacle to positive peace despite the fact that they are not discussed openly in other forums. 40. Subsequent steps in the PSDA process brought forth concerns on how to prevent future con\ufb02 ict, transform situations of negative peace and worse case scenarios and the role that women played unacknowledged in these processes. Women\u2019s initial concerns and responses were often linked to their family and community roles and focused on the practical and immediate needs, e.g. improved health in isolated island communities or access to markets in areas destabilized by poor roads or roadblocks demanding extortion for passage. Women\u2019s peacebuilding activities at the community level were acknowledged during the workshops and, in some cases, celebrated. It is clear that women bring to these processes the emotional components of peace (e.g. love, social harmony, trust support) both in their envisioning of the future and their analysis of what is lacking and/or an obstacle to peace. 41. The traditional emphasis amongst indigenous Fijians is on the act of \u201cpeace making\u201d or con\ufb02 ict resolution. These traditions are formally prescribed and are a revered part of indigenous culture. They are normally carried out by male actors and traditional or religious leaders. It appeared that a more expansive concept of peacebuilding as a process, open to formal and informal interventions and carried out by either women or men in both the public and private spheres is neither a tradition nor a widely understood or promoted practice. During the implementation of the PSDA, participants in the consultation workshops struggled to broaden their paradigms of peacebuilding", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aea454d9-5e09-4022-9fdf-93cbc4acd813": {"__data__": {"id_": "aea454d9-5e09-4022-9fdf-93cbc4acd813", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Can Conflict Analysis Processes Support Gendered Visions of Peace Building?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c2f080d6c2ca0c73d7fbf9869b0cc9aa1d84b379727cd1cce87611118b30484"}, "3": {"node_id": "3beb2f2b-b23c-4784-9c8b-2639fdcaf7e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3d3b69471bec92d7e15e024cf93950b86dac3c65626dc44d09ca9ca8d51b99b"}}, "hash": "43c5d614fd3437a190e1c26663a9467f4d3aac2740938d8ce263752b9e858664", "text": "efforts and initiatives to include and acknowledge a broad range of activities in addition to the traditional understandings of peace making and con\ufb02 ict resolution. This intersection between gender and culture, on the one hand, and the way peacebuilding is understood, on the other, was a distinctive feature of the process in Fiji. 42. Most signi\ufb01 cantly, many of the initiatives and activities identi\ufb01 ed as \u201ccapacities for peace\u201d in the workshops and the National Seminar were activities undertaken or initiated by women \u2013mostly at community levels, and rooted in values and behaviors associated with Fijian and Indo-Fijian culture such as co-existence, social harmony, respect and protection of the family and community orientated values. The examples covered a broad range of activities and cut across the differences of ethnicity, religion, class, etc. They included everyday efforts to build social harmony, inculcate peaceful values in children and young people, protect the environment, enhance personal and community security and speak out against gender- based violence in the private and public spheres. The sub-national workshops were critical spaces in acknowledging, sometimes for the \ufb01 rst time, the invisible role and contributions of women in peacebuilding as well as their insights in identifying the increasing vulnerabilities to peace. Documenting and reporting 43. The \ufb01 ndings and re\ufb02 ections of this paper were mostly articulated in the provincial consultations. Unfortunately some of the most interesting issues on gender were not 19 adequately incorporated in the design of the Action Framework. The Framework document focused primarily on promoting recommendations and actions on institutions of the public sphere (government, the private sector and civil society). The lessons learned from this re\ufb02 ection exercise emphasize the need to revise the PSDA tool, documentation and systematization processes to integrate three important considerations: i) requirements to explicitly address gender in the documentation and analysis of information, ii) integration of analysis and actions pertaining to the private sphere (household and family), and iii) provision of space for aspects related to the cultural context and individual/emotional issues. An important example is how GBV and family violence issues emerged as signi\ufb01 cant obstacles to peace. These issues could have been given greater prominence in the reports produced for the national seminar and the \ufb01 nal Framework for Action. 20 VI Phase III: Moving forward with the PSDA 44. The \ufb01 nal phase focused on the design of a process to support the mainstreaming of \ufb01 ndings into the overall national machinery of government. Activities included the presentation of the \u201cFramework for Action\u201d to Cabinet, discussion of the \ufb01 ndings by government of\ufb01 cials in the National Economic Summit (where the National Development Plan is presented) and, integration of key issues and a new chapter in the National Development Plan. In addition, a series of bilateral consultations were held with all government departments, including meetings with ministers, senior civil servants and technical staff, where speci\ufb01 c issues pertaining to their mandate were discussed. In order to ensure that the process of moving forward brings back a strong gender dimension, a separate consultation with women\u2019s organizations has been recommended, together with support for a Women and Peacebuilding caucus in parliament. It is expected that subsequent corrective and proactive measures during this phase will help ensure that gender considerations are taken into account and addressed as part of the overall plan to mainstream the PSDA into government. 21 6 Piza Lopez, E; Nyheim, D. and Trijono, L.

A key lesson from the PSDA in Fiji and other similar exercises6 is the need to include elements of an expanded gender sensitive planning into the adaptation and application of PSDA tools. These are: \u2022 A gender differentiated context analysis that focuses on women, men and the gendered relations and includes the social construction of masculinities and their impact on peace and con\ufb02 ict; \u2022 Processes to ensure different women\u2019s voices are present and women\u2019s interests articulated; \u2022 A gendered prioritization of responses and identi\ufb01 cation of entry points and links; \u2022 A focus on transformative processes/relations and institutions of the public and the private sphere for greater gender equality.7 46.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3beb2f2b-b23c-4784-9c8b-2639fdcaf7e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3beb2f2b-b23c-4784-9c8b-2639fdcaf7e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Can Conflict Analysis Processes Support Gendered Visions of Peace Building?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6c2f080d6c2ca0c73d7fbf9869b0cc9aa1d84b379727cd1cce87611118b30484"}, "2": {"node_id": "aea454d9-5e09-4022-9fdf-93cbc4acd813", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43c5d614fd3437a190e1c26663a9467f4d3aac2740938d8ce263752b9e858664"}}, "hash": "c3d3b69471bec92d7e15e024cf93950b86dac3c65626dc44d09ca9ca8d51b99b", "text": "There is a need to capture, re-focus and expand on how to best articulate and act upon women\u2019s and gender strategic interests in relation to peace building.

What the PSDA exercise highlighted were the challenges of integrating gender effectively in the mainstream planning frameworks resulting from con\ufb02 ict analysis processes. One of the key limitations to emerge was that the tool provides limited or no space to systematize gender issues elicited from women or men and carries them forward. Although the tool covers analysis of the social, economic, political and security spheres there is a gradual tendency to focus on the economic, political and security spheres (mostly in relation to the public domain). Therefore issues such as GBV (which often emerge in the social sphere and private domain) and the complex set of drivers and root causes (which cover all spheres) become dispersed or sidelined to the realms and responsibilities of households and community level actions and were not apparent in the planning and follow-up phases. A second concern is that the tool as a strategic planning instrument tends to ascribe more meaning to actionable activities within the spheres of the public domain and to addressing the relevant public institutions (e.g. institutions of the state, religious faiths or the private sector). As a result, the rich tapestry of issues resulting from inadequate, hierarchical and unequal gender based relations in the private sphere tended to get lost and marginalized. 22 48. In conclusion to this study of the PSDA in Fiji, a number of ways are recommended in which the tools of analysis and planning could be strengthened to enable a better understanding of the gendered context and gender related outcomes for women and men/girls and boys: \u2022 Undertake a gender differentiated context analysis; \u2022 Integrate key aspects of culture such as the construction of masculinities and femininities into the analysis and unpack the consequences to GBV and other forms of structural violence; \u2022 Adopt a gender-disaggregated approach to highlight women\u2019s contributions to peacebuilding and the identi\ufb01 cation of vulnerabilities that may be identi\ufb01 ed as gender speci\ufb01 c; \u2022 Elaborate steps two and three of the tool (i.e. obstacles to peace and peacebuilding lessons learned) to facilitate a gendered prioritization of responses across the spheres/ domains and identi\ufb01 cation of entry points for responses. 23 PSDA Activity How Gender was integrated Lessons learned Adaptation of tools Focus on excluded groups e.g.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a0c5a126-4021-4956-949f-2bcf1ec1ab8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "a0c5a126-4021-4956-949f-2bcf1ec1ab8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Can Conflict Analysis Processes Support Gendered Visions of Peace Building?", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "43bd2c35a25b8a78f5c64fcb2b8ea595fc4f7b80b25a0dc29d5bcc981969af1f"}, "2": {"node_id": "32ddbe16-bc69-4595-b536-938761c16e0d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/can-conflict-analysis-processes-support-gendered-visions-peace-building", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f2f61698987b8b7811539848872c0ccac575ce9dc55f97eaaf66798927ad892c"}}, "hash": "10f3de76fe19b93c0980ea6cc3c64b51cf21cd5c672774fcbba01cf530699739", "text": "women, youth, ethnic/ religious minorities, tenant farmers etc and how to engage them and enable their participation \u2022 A strategy for the participation of women, youth etc., was applied \u2022 Gender outcomes were not made explicit in the documentation \u2022 Make gender outcomes of the PSDA explicit \u2022 Include gender disaggregated analysis in each step of the tool, particularly steps two and three (obstacles to peace and peacebuilding lessons learned) \u2022 Conduct more consultation with women and a range of Government and Civil Society Groups focused on Gender to provide a deeper local contextualization from a gender perspective Partnership development Identify criteria/seek partners with proven record/sensitivity to issues of gender \u2022 Workshop strategies on local gender issues were conducted \u2022 Challenges in process were identi\ufb01 ed and commitment to action was developed \u2022 Consider criteria on gender policy, track record on delivery and political commitment to gender in the selection of government partners \u2022 Invest in building capacity on gender with government partner as well as NGO Selection of Facilitators Balanced teams;

CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 1 Foreword Under the Pacific Plan endorsed by Leaders in 2005, the ratification of human rights instruments and the advancement of gender equality are included as goals towards achieving the Pacific Leaders\u2019 vision of a Pacific people living free and worthwhile lives. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is often described as the premier international human rights instrument for women. No other commitment is more central to the effective implementation of National Development for Women than the ratification and implementation of CEDAW. This pocket guide is designed to familiarise parliamentarians with the Convention and the Optional Protocol and describes what parliamentarians can do to ensure effective implementation of the Convention. Countries around the world have progressed enormously on gender equality through the hard work of women\u2019s organisations and their respective national women\u2019s machineries. They have also progressed because high profile champions such as parliamentarians have recognised the importance of gender equality and the protection of women\u2019s rights and made the implementation of the Convention their personal mission. This publication is timely as it coincides with the 60th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It is ironic that sixty years down the road some of our Pacific nations have yet to ratify CEDAW. Only New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have ratified the Optional Protocol. In addition to this Pacific women only make up 3.1% of Pacific Parliamentarians (excluding Australia and New Zealand), with five of our Pacific countries have no women representatives at all. It is obvious that the Pacific still has a long way to go. The contents of this pocket guide has drawn on other important publications on the Convention such as the \u201cCEDAW Handbook for Parliamentarians\u201d by the IPU, the \u201cCEDAW Roadmap\u201d by the Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT) and \u201cCEDAW Legislative Compliance in Nine Pacific Island Countries\u201d by UNDP Pacific Centre and UNIFEM. Our thanks goes to them for their work on this important convention. We hope that this booklet will help towards an understanding of CEDAW and what can be done to advance gender equality.

It is designed as a simple, user-friendly guide to familiarise legislators with CEDAW. It does not seek to go into detail on the technicalities of the Convention, as there are already a number of global and regional resources which do that already. The most relevant of these have been listed in Annex 1 of the Pocket Guide for easy reference. This Guide draws on existing Pacific and international resources on CEDAW produced by UNIFEM, the Regional Rights and Resources Team (RRRT), the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and the Fiji Women\u2019s Rights Movement (FWRM).

This Guide specifically focuses on what members of Pacific parliaments and congresses can do to ensure effective implementation of CEDAW. Members of the legislature, whether they are in Government or in opposition, have a key role to play in ensuring that their country ensures non-discrimination against women in accordance with the provisions of CEDAW. The Guide identifies that members of Pacific parliaments and congresses can be active in ensuring that Pacific Governments ratify CEDAW and its Optional Protocol. After CEDAW is ratified, legislators have a vital role to play in ensuring State obligations are implemented, and in ensuring respect for the principles of CEDAW. The Pocket Guide outlines measures to ensure that national laws, policies, actions, programmes and budgets reflect the principles and obligations in CEDAW. CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 6 Legislators are recognised by the community as national leaders. In this context, members of Pacific parliaments and congresses can also be active in raising awareness about the standards for the treatment of women which are contained in CEDAW. In the Pacific, each country is unique in its culture and local context. The method your country chooses to promote gender equality will take account of your own national circumstances. CEDAW can be a key framework to guide local work directed at promoting women\u2019s equality. In any case, the long-term goal remains the same \u2013 namely, to ensure that every Pacific person, whether man or women, is treated with respect and dignity and does not suffer from discrimination. Guide outlines measures to ensure that national laws, policies, actions, programmes and budgets reflect the principles and obligations in CEDAW. Legislators are recognised by the community as national leaders. In this context, members of Pacific parliaments and congresses can also be active in raising awareness about the standards for the treatment of women which are contained in CEDAW. In the Pacific, each country is unique in its culture and local context. The method your country chooses to promote gender equality will take account of your own national circumstances. CEDAW can be a key framework to guide local work directed at promoting women\u2019s equality. In any case, the long-term goal remains the same \u2013 namely, to ensure that every Pacific person, whether man or women, is treated with respect and dignity and does not suffer from discrimination. CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 7 D iscrimination against women is defined as \u201c\u2026any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.\u201d 1. www.un.org/rights/50/decla/htm 2. www2.ohchr.ch/htm/menu3/b/a_ccpr.htm 3. www.unesco.org/education/pdf/social_E_pdf what is CedAw? CEDAW is the short name given to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Convention is commonly regarded by many as the international bill of rights for women. CEDAW was adopted in 1979 by the members of the United Nations following decades of national, regional and international efforts to promote and protect the rights of the world\u2019s women. A CEDAW Optional Protocol was developed in 2000. CEDAW builds on the protections already included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR),1 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),2 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).3 These three UN human rights agreements are commonly referred to as the International Bill of Rights. CedAw in Brief CEDAW seeks to comprehensively address women\u2019s rights to equality in all areas of women\u2019s lives, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural. CEDAW also provides a comprehensive description of discrimination against women and requires state parties to take all the necessary measures to eliminate such discrimination. Although the provisions in the International Bill of Rights also apply to women, CEDAW was developed in recognition of the fact that the basic rights of vulnerable members of society like women are still not fully applied in practice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6dbbed7c-3390-4156-9e7b-0532374ac558": {"__data__": {"id_": "6dbbed7c-3390-4156-9e7b-0532374ac558", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cedaw-pocket-guide-pacific-parliamentarians", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cedaw-pocket-guide-pacific-parliamentarians", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "249558a0d64efdd41d4eb46dd3ec3d434678b5d090269475f037ff3c567e0a6a"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ec6aa5b-92ec-4bc7-92b6-b7f55a975b49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/cedaw-pocket-guide-pacific-parliamentarians", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "659d0659bde5e9b58600236e4dd3f420dbbfa8d4682b6f808377afae812893a1"}}, "hash": "73682ad62276c6dd66c2f735fa6d4c67752d9773a0ca461fce1fe2840d634f82", "text": "Developing a more specific convention is intended to ensure that government attention and resources are devoted to more effectively tackling women\u2019s issues.

Taken from RRRT Roadmap to Reporting CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 9 CedAw optional protocol An Optional Protocol is a legal instrument related to an existing treaty, in this case CEDAW, which addresses issues not covered by the treaty or insufficiently developed in the treaty. It is described as \u2018Optional\u2019 because states are not obliged to become party to it, even if they have ratified or acceded to the related convention. The Optional CEDAW Protocol describes: (1) A communications procedure, which enables individuals or groups to submit claims of violations of rights protected under the Convention, to the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, subject to certain criteria being met; (2) An inquiry procedure, enabling the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women\u2019s rights. The Optional Protocol was developed because CEDAW itself does include a monitoring system, apart from the regular country reports that states must submit. Under the original Convention, individuals and other groups have no way of making complaints on human rights violations that occur in their country. Only three Forum Pacific Island countries have ratified the Optional Protocol, namely New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. Notably, even where a state has ratified CEDAW, for the Optional Protocol to be relied upon by citizens, the state must separately have ratified it. E ssentially, the Optional Protocol is a backup to domestic laws and policies. Sometimes domestic laws and policies have some gaps whereby women find they cannot exercise or protect their rights. The Optional Protocol provides for a complaints mechanism that ensures protection. Committee on the elimination of discrimination against women CEDAW established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, an expert body which is tasked to oversee its implementation. The Committee is composed of 23 members from around the world who are responsible for monitoring the progress made by states in implementing the Convention. The Committee examines the regular reports that every State Party is legally bound to submit on the measures it has taken to give effect to the provisions of the Convention (see page 19 for more on reporting). The Committee is also empowered to make suggestions and recommendations based on the examination of reports and information received from State Parties.

A state which only signs a convention is not legally bound to give effect to its provisions. However, a signature at least creates an obligation to refrain in good faith from acts that would defeat the purpose of the convention. Conventions are often signed first by a member of the Executive, for example, the President, Prime Minister or Foreign Minister. The gap between signature and ratification then provides time to obtain approval of the convention at the national level, usually by submitting the convention to review and comment by the legislature. Formal ratification occurs when the government deposits an \u201cinstrument of ratification\u201d with the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Acceding to a convention simply refers to a ratification that occurs after a convention has come into force. Usually the Executive, that is the government of the day, has the power to ratify or accede to international agreements. However, ratification at the international level should not be confused with ratification at the national level. In some countries, particularly those with presidential-style systems, there may be domestic legal requirements to meet before the government can consent to an international treaty or convention that will bind it at the international level. For example, Congress may be required to pass a resolution empowering the President to ratify the convention. N auru, Palau and Tonga have not ratified CEDAW. Only New Zealand, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have ratified both CEDAW and the Optional Protocol. Legislators who are members of Government can be active in encouraging Cabinet colleagues to ratify CEDAW and its Optional Protocol. The Minister of Justice, Minister for Foreign Affairs and/or Attorney General often lead the way. CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 12 reservations Article 28 of CEDAW permits ratification or accession to be made subject to \u201creservations\u201d. A reservation is a formal declaration that the State does not accept part of the convention as binding. It is clear in international law, however, that no reservation can be made which is incompatible with the convention\u2019s object and purpose. Ideally, your state will ratify CEDAW completely. However, sometimes a State will lodge a reservation because they feel that implementation of an Article may take time and they do not want to be in breach of the convention in the meantime. This highlights the importance of constantly reviewing any reservations your country may have lodged at the time it ratified CEDAW. The CEDAW Committee\u2019s reporting guidelines require states to explain any reservation to any article of the Convention and to justify their continued maintenance. States may withdraw reservations at any time. Withdrawals must be formulated in writing, and signed by the Head of State, Head of Government or Minister of Foreign Affairs, or person having powers for such purposes.

This is a key opportunity for members of Pacific parliaments and congresses to get involved in ensuring that CEDAW is meaningfully implemented. In 2007, the UNDP Pacific Centre and UNIFEM produced a comprehensive handbook to assist Pacific legislators to assess whether the laws are in compliance with CEDAW called \u201cTranslating CEDAW Into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in Nine Pacific Island Countries.\u201d The handbook included a list of 113 questions which legislators can ask to check whether national laws comply with CEDAW.

They also provide practical guidance on what issues to look for when assessing Bills or regulations. When CEDAW is first ratified, the Government should task the Attorney General or Justice Ministry with undertaking a legislative review of all existing legislation to ensure that it is compliant with the provisions of CEDAW. All laws must be included in the review. Laws which deal with discrimination may be a priority, but it is important to remember that even laws which appear to be \u201cgender-neutral\u201d can have a differential impact on men and women. A ffirmative action measures to address inequalities should be considered. For example, throughout the Pacific, there have been suggestions that laws be enacted to reserve seats in the legislature for women or to introduce women\u2019s quotas into political parties. Such temporary measures would go some way to implementing CEDAW Article 7 which promotes equality in political life. CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 14 At a minimum, any legislative review needs to examine existing laws in order to: Identify those laws which are discriminatory; Identify existing legal gaps or loopholes; Identify situations in which: Inconsistencies between different kinds of laws (constitutional, penal, civil, administrative) result in gender bias; Administrative procedures discriminating against women undermine the law; and Harmful traditional practices and negative customs run counter to existing law. Once this initial analysis is done: Where laws need to be updated, amendments should be tabled in the legislature as a priority; Where new laws are needed to protect or promote women\u2019s rights in accordance with CEDAW, they need to be developed participatorily \u2013 with a chance for public input. Draft Bills need to be referred to a relevant parliamentary committee, which can hold public hearings. Specific invitations to provide evidence and advice at such hearings should be sent to community groups with expertise on women\u2019s issues. Tapping their experiences can be useful in ensuring that legislation properly deals with your local context. Committee hearings provide a great opportunity for legislators to consider a Bill in more detail and to discuss amongst themselves whether it achieves what it sets out to do. Non-Cabinet or non-government members can be active in promoting CEDAW legislative compliance. Questions can be asked during Question Time to draw the attention of the government to key areas where you believe action needs to be taken, for example, amending discriminatory rape laws or enacting anti-discrimination legislation. Members of the Opposition can also consider developing a Private Member\u2019s Bill on topics you believe are important. If the government does not want to take action on an issue, a Private Member\u2019s Bill can be a strategic way of prodding them into action. L egislators can draw on specialist Pacific NGOs and community groups for assistance with legislative reviews and analysis. Many women\u2019s organisations in the Pacific are capable of providing legal inputs on Bills. Most such groups will provide advice and assistance for free, and increasingly there are organisations in the Pacific, such as the Regional Rights and Resources Team, that can provide legislative assistance to Pacific legislators.

Budgeting for CedAw One of the most important opportunities for Members of Pacific Parliaments and Congresses to engage in national policy development is through review of the annual national budget and ongoing oversight of budget expenditures. In this context, the budget process is crucial to the effective implementation of CEDAW\u2019s provisions. CEDAW focuses substantially on preventing discrimination against women. While this clearly requires the enactment of legislation and the development of policies to protect and promote women\u2019s rights, at the same time it also requires positive action to enforce laws and implement policies which will result in improved outcomes for women. In practical terms, enforcement of laws and implementation of policies requires money!

These questions may be sectoraly focused, for example, regarding the health sector or rural employment. Or questions may focus on more administrative issues, for example, regarding support to the women\u2019s department. T he Public Accounts Committee, when reviewing past budget expenditure, can follow up on questions asked during the budget approval process. It is important to make sure the bureaucracy knows that legislators are committed to ensuring the implementation of CEDAW and will check to make sure that expenditures promote this objective.

What can you do as a Parliamentarian? CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 17 mainstreaming CedAw into national Initiatives In 1995, the UN held the Fourth World Conference on Women, in Beijing, China. That conference produced a plan which is commonly referred to as the Beijing Platform for Action. The Beijing Platform recognises the need for a \u201cnational machinery for the advancement of women [to be] the central policy-coordinating unit inside government. Its main task [would be] to support government-wide mainstreaming of a gender-equality perspective in all policy areas.\u201d Throughout the Pacific, most countries have established a Women\u2019s Ministry or its equivalent. However, by and large, these bodies are provided with only minimal staff, often with limited expertise on women\u2019s issues, and are given very few resources to do their work. The Beijing Platform for Action recommends that women\u2019s machineries are located at the highest possible level in the government, falling under the responsibility of a Cabinet minister. Members of Cabinet should seek to action this recommendation, and non-executive legislators can push for this to happen via the strategic use of Question Time. Most Pacific Island countries have developed specific national women\u2019s policies or plans. Where your country has not, you may want to use Question Time to find out why and whether there is any plan by the Government to develop one in future. A national women\u2019s action plan will set out the government\u2019s programme of activities for implementing CEDAW\u2019s provisions and achieving better outcomes for women. The plan will also identify the resources needed and the bodies responsible for taking action. The plan should guide ALL government agencies \u2013 not just the national women\u2019s ministry. F ind out what your national policies and programmes are for women. Call your gender focal point.

CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 19 reporting on CedAw Once CEDAW is ratified by a country, Article 18 requires that a report is submitted to the CEDAW Committee on implementation of CEDAW. An initial report is due at the end of the first year and updates should follow every four years or when requested by the CEDAW Committee. national reports All countries which have ratified CEDAW must submit a State Report which covers the legislative, judicial and administrative measures that the State has implemented as part of their obligations under CEDAW. It is also an opportunity for the State Party to take stock of the current situation of women, compare the current situation to that of the past (via previous national reports) and identify areas that require reform to ensure compliance with the convention. States must also explain any reservation to any article of the convention and to justify their continued maintenance. The main aims of a State Party Report to CEDAW are to: Provide a record of performance of the Government according to the standards of CEDAW; Identify problems and obstacles to women's equality and suggest solutions so they can be addressed; Identify best practices; Identify priorities for the next four years; Provide an opportunity for the State to show good faith in living up to its obligations by engaging in a transparent process of accountability. The Regional Rights and Resources Team has developed a comprehensive guide called \u201cCEDAW Roadmap: A Guide to Reporting before the Committee\u201d, which is intended to assist Pacific Governments in developing their CEDAW Reports. A summary of the roadmap is provided in Figure 1 on the following page. Figure 1: RRRT Roadmap To Reporting I n some countries, NGOs develop their own \u201cShadow Report\u201d, which provides additional and sometimes alternative information on CEDAW implementation and the adequacy of the Government\u2019s efforts. This Shadow Report can be a useful resource for legislators, in particular during a parliamentary committee review of the government\u2019s CEDAW Report. CEDAW: A Pocket Guide for Pacific Parliamentarians 20 Reports by NGOs are referred to as Shadow Reports. The CEDAW Committee will only consider NGO reports if their government is appearing before the committee. NGOs can use their report to raise concerns with committee members on pressing issues. NGOs must prepare a 5-7 minute summary of their report for the oral session and a 1 page summary of pressing issues. Time may vary depending on CEDAW Committee workload. Session usually 45 minutes. This presentation is a summary of the submitted report and can also be used to update the committee on things that may have happened since writing of report. The aim of the presentation and questions is to develop constructive dialogue between the reporting states and the Committee. The committee accepts answers provided by the state party and asks no further questions. Any unanswered questions or issues are highlighted in the concluding comments. Usually two committee members are responsible for drafting of the concluding comments for each state party. These are not legally binding on states but often can lead to domestic debate on issues raised. NGOs are usually given a short time (about 10-15 minutes) to present their report to the committee before the state party appears. NGOs are also questioned on issues highlighted in the report. The committee meets and identifies which members will ask questions for each article. This is done in a closed session before the reporting state appears. NGOs \u2013 Find out which member is drafting your country\u2019s concluding comments. You may want to discuss certain issues you feel are important for G overnment to consider. There are comprehensive guidelines on how to report. Important for government to consult NGOs in this process.

In the Pacific, it is most common for CEDAW Reports to be compiled by the relevant national women\u2019s ministry or department. However, this is not a requirement and indeed, practice in our region has shown that these bodies too often lack the technical and financial resources to do so on their own. CEDAW reporting is the responsibility of the State. Reporting should be a combined government effort, because it is supposed to cover all sectors, including education, health, rural development and employment. While one m inistry needs to take primary responsibility for the report, this could be the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Justice or even the Prime Minster\u2019s Office. A multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral approach is needed, which engages bodies like the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Economic Planning Unit, the Public Service Department and Treasury. The National CEDAW Report is submitted by the Government to the CEDAW Committee. The report is presented by a representative of the Government. The Committee discusses the report with country representatives, including civil society if they are in attendance. The CEDAW Committee eventually releases concluding observations and recommendations for action, which provide guidance on what more needs to be done to ensure proper implementation of CEDAW.

James Vernon, Hunger - a modern history (Harvard University Press, 2007) F ood riots in Haiti, Egypt, Senegal, and street protests in Bangladesh, and several Asian, Latin American and African countries. These Malthusian images shocked a world in the first decade of the 21st century. Material abun- dance had made the 20th century distinct from any other in history. Post-industrial services societ- ies came to dominate the global economy, signaling the welcome relegation of agriculture\u2019s share in gdP and a shift into higher produc- tivity activities, which raised living standards. A life of subsistence and drudgery had been the fabric of rural exis- tence through the course of his- tory. Low yields in food production generated the fears associated with reverend Thomas Malthus, whose dire predictions of food scarcity and famine were based on a projected imbalance between population growth rates and food production. This earned economics, essentially a study of prosperity, the unfortu- nate title of a dismal science. The 20th century defied many of the numerical myths of doom emanating in the 19th century. Predictions of a falling rate of profit and worker immiserisation did not materialise, nor did the threat of geometric increase of population and an arithmetic progression in food supply. Such rigid ratios were undermined by spectacu- lar increase in productivity due to the exponential expansion in the material fruits of science and technology. An example was the green revolu- tion, which was based on new, high yielding varieties of wheat and rice that led to a quadrupling of yields in the space of a few years, in the 1960s. At the global level, food was so ample that farm- ers had to be paid, in some countries, not to grow any more. World food prices showed a secular decline partly due to abundant supply and agricultural sub- sidies. The problem of food shortage seemed solved. However, even in the midst of such triumph, distributional issues gnawed at con- sciences, especially when they exploded into visible famines. The extremes of starvation and famine were typi- cally related to conflict, violence and discrimination. They were not viewed as disasters emanating in agriculture. There was enough food in the world, and countries built enough food stocks and suffi- ciently supple emergency systems to avert famines, in normal politi- cal circumstances. occasionally, dictatorships and closed societies could not react to famines but even these, by and large, had successful 1 inoculation against starvation. The role of a globalised internationalist media, as well as national informa- tion transmitting systems, in freer societies, acted as effective early warning systems against extreme hunger. Perhaps because of the success in food availability, countries invested their energies towards industry and services. These were the new frontiers of prosperity. The com- placency over food and reliance of an integrating global economy encouraged the view that coun- tries could import food and export higher value products and thus earn the foreign exchange through which they could, not only import food, but also the extra resources to make them richer. For some coun- tries, food security was neglected, and they became vulnerable to a rise in food prices. Hunger is not starvation. This was an important distinction that food complacency overlooked. The world had largely created institutions to prevent famines. yet, globally and nationally, the persistence of hunger has been ignored because of the absence of starvation. Hunger can, and does, persist in the absence of starvation. insufficient food has debilitating consequences due to nutritional deficiency. A lack of mental and physical development, handicaps the sufferer and, frequently, traps their children in a cycle of underde- velopment. A tragedy made more acute by the impressive advance in average prosperity. in the Asia-Pacific region, some of the fastest growing economies, such as india\u2019s, have hardly made a dent in malnutrition. results of the recent National Family Health Survey (2005 - 2006) revealed that 46 percent of india\u2019s children under three years are underweight. indeed, in some countries, malnu- trition has worsened in some parts of the country. For example, in cambodia and india, the number of undernourished people appears to have increased between 1995 and 1997, and 2001 and 20032. Nationalist sensitivity has often interfered with reason, as several policymakers have simply denied the existence of persistent hunger.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c6113087-32c7-487c-889c-49e4dbd648c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "c6113087-32c7-487c-889c-49e4dbd648c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Combating Hunger: A Seven Point Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "eda22372bc91a03035bf7efea21c129f637cd6e49532d4f15b94f71c5262a786"}, "2": {"node_id": "277f4542-3b64-420c-91ed-c7979af8d7e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "490573b4ffa9e2809729a9a2c3a883328d7e92634532992f7bec8c9ea06b560c"}}, "hash": "955e7d247ce79699e5584564b49b4ac0a76c0e8a98f96985d27ec47b44dcd20f", "text": "Furthermore, some have been too embarrassed to admit to this blot on their national success, despite overwhelming evidence.

There is a variety of causes under- lying these destabilising increases - drought in food exporting coun- tries such as Australia, substitution towards more profitable energy related crops, food subsidies and low prices in rich countries, which led to consumer gains in poor countries but discouraged food production and, thus, making these countries too reliant on the imports of very sensitive basic products. The rise in energy prices has played a crucial role in increasing prices of 2 inside asia-pacific transport and chemicals leading to knock on effects on food prices. These supply side shocks have been accompanied by pressures on the demand side, with rapidly rising incomes in poor countries leading to an obvious expansion in consumption. governments are scrambling for short term solutions to avoid major social and political upheaval. over the medium term, focus has returned to the forgotten hungry of the Asia-Pacific. Hunger was widespread before food prices rose, and the reasons for persistent malnutrition do not reside in price levels. Nonetheless, the rise in food prices will be felt most severely by the urban poor and those in rural areas who are net purchasers of food. The joint pressures of a food and energy price increase are already evident in higher subsidies and import bills. The strain on the political system, as well as on the fiscal and trade balance is particularly severe on the Ldcs (Least developed coun- tries) of the region. At a time when inequalities, within and amongst countries, are widening, the politi- cal and social consequences can be serious. governments have to cope with two major shocks which are not largely of their own making. yet, both the oil and food shocks need immediate management if turmoil is to be avoided. The rise in food prices however is not an unmitigated disaster across the Asia-Pacific. The likely impact can be divided into three catego- ries. The first are Asian countries who are likely to benefit, particu- larly the food exporters, such as Thailand and vietnam. The second category comprises typically of very large countries, on which the impact might not be too signifi- cant. This includes countries such as china, Pakistan and india that do not import large volumes of food. in these countries, the strains are likely to be localised, with specific communities under pressure, while at the macro level the imposition on budgets and the import bill might be relatively small. Further, for many farmers in the region, a rise in food prices will increase their incomes and provide market incen- tives to grow more food. A third category of countries com- prising Ldcs, countries in conflict and major importers of food and energy are likely to face the brunt of the price shocks. Ldcs, conflict and high importers often overlap, thus exacerbating the intensity of existing economic and political tension. 3 Combating Hunger: A seven Point Agenda A typology of the three categories of countries is illustrated in figures 1-3 with respect to rice. Figure 1 illustrates the case of food export- ers, who, like energy exporters currently, will benefit from rising food prices. Figure 2 illustrates the case of countries that are likely to be affected marginally, while figure 3 is the case of greatest concern. countries in this category face the unfortunate consequence that their inflation levels are also likely to increase much faster than oth- ers, imposing heavier costs on their poor and making these vulnerable countries even less competitive in export markets. rice is the staple diet for much of the world. it runs a close second to wheat in its importance as a food cereal in the human diet. World production of rice has risen steadily from about 136 million tons of rice (milled) in 1960 to 423 million tons in 2004. in the year 2006-07, the top six producers were china (30 percent of world produc- tion), india (22 percent), indonesia (8 percent), Bangladesh (8 percent), vietnam (7 percent), and Thailand (5 percent).

The global trade in rice is about 30 million tonnes. World\u2019s largest rice exporters are Thailand (31 percent), vietnam (16 percent), india (14 per- cent), Pakistan (11 percent), United States (9 percent) and china (5 per- cent). global shares of rice exports are captured in figure 5, confirm- ing the dominance of Asia, and a relatively small surplus in North America and Western Europe. 5 Combating Hunger: A seven Point Agenda A worrying trend is that rice stocks have declined for the seventh consecutive year, to 72 million tons, which is nearly 4 million below 2006-07, and the lowest since 1983-84. The global stocks- to-consumption ratio is projected at 16.9 percent, down from 18.1 percent in 2006-07, and the lowest since 1976-77. While the story of rice production and consumption is largely Asian, wheat patterns are very different. A substantial portion of global wheat production and exports comes from North America and Western Europe (see figure 6), whose farm- ers are currently reaping a price rise windfall. 6 inside asia-pacific As figures 7 & 8 show, the over- whelming brunt of food price increase will be felt in Africa. Africa faces the dual disadvantage of high import dependency for rice and wheat, as well as a 250 percent increase in maize prices in recent years, which is one of the staple food items in the continent. Widespread malnutrition persisted across Asia even when food prices were low. Food price shocks pro- vide an opportunity to refocus development efforts. Equity, justice and humanity demand urgent attention to hunger in societies that are tasting the first fruits of mass prosperity. virtually all countries are becoming more unequal, as Asia is overtaking Latin America as the epicenter of inequity. The elimination of hunger requires a commitment to a flexible set of inter-related measures. 7 Combating Hunger: A seven Point Agenda The seven elements of an agenda for eliminating hunger are based on global experience. it must be emphasised that implementation in any country has to be nuanced and, to bear in mind characteris- tics that make specific instruments more or less efficacious: 1. Focus on targeted interventions, such as school feeding programmes in several countries, these have afforded the dual benefit of pro- viding nourishment and encour- aged children, particularly girls, to come to school. There is extensive global experience that can assist in a sound design of school feeding programmes. Some of this experi- ence is reflected in Anuradha raji- van\u2019s article, \u201cCombating Hunger: A Case for Pre-school and School Feeding\u201d, in this bulletin. 2. Judge development outcomes through hunger impact in recent years, several Asia-Pacific countries have achieved high growth but virtually no reduction in hunger. Monitoring and assessing development outcomes through a rigorous monitoring of trends in hunger will increase accountabil- ity of policy impact over five year periods. A technical paper on how a system for hunger related moni- toring of development outcomes is being commissioned by the UN. 3. Revive public investment in agriculture, at both national and international levels Several Asian countries have decreased public investment in agriculture. on average, public expenditure on agriculture has declined by 1.5 percent in the Asia-Pacific region between 1990 and 20073. reviving public investment is central to increased productivity, through a mix of quality extension services, farm to market roads, and investments in other forms of phys- ical infrastructure and application of evolving scientific knowledge to increase productivity. Similarly, increased investment in agricul- tural universities will potentially reap rewards. These research and development issues are empha- sised in the contribution of M.S. Swaminathan, \u201cChallenge of a Hun- ger Free Asia-Pacific Region\u201d. Medium and long term increases in food supplies will be generated by investments in research and exten- sion. in this respect, two institutes, central to the green revolution, are worth noting. These are the world\u2019s leading research institute on rice, the international rice research institute (irri) in the Philippines and the international Maize and Wheat improvement center (ciMMyT) in Mexico, part of the consultative group on international Agricultural research (cgiAr)4.

Build a national and global coalition increased awareness amongst parliamentarians, civil society, media, civil servants, academics and other opinion formers has played a successful role in shap- ing policy. raising the profile of hunger as a key challenge requires pressure and accountability on behalf of the hungry. in support of national coalitions, international civil society organisations, focusing on hunger, can play a helpful role in transmitting practical, global lessons. Further, international development agencies can also support policy and resource allo- cation changes. The work being done by UN agencies such as iFAd (international Fund for Agricultural development), iLo (international Labour organization), WHo ( World Health organization), UNicEF (United Nations children\u2019s Fund) and WFP (World Food Programme) in the Asia-Pacific region is vital in achieving these objectives. The role of international civil society is noted in the article, \u201cHunger, Social 8 inside asia-pacific Equality, and Food Sovereignty\u201d by Kathleen McAfee. 5. Make primary education mandatory The absence of mandatory primary education in several Asian coun- tries is a major handicap to several objectives. countries that have invested early in primary educa- tion have better records on fertil- ity reduction, reduction in hunger and reducing child labour. The empirical evidence is overwhelm- ing. The work undertaken by UNi- cEF in mobilising political will and resources to help countries ensure a \u201cfirst call for children\u201d and to build their capacity to form appro- priate policies and deliver services for children has been an important contribution in promoting the right to a basic education. 6. Give subsidies to consumers for staple-foods There is an urgent need for gov- ernments to expand consumption subsidies for staple foods and for international organisations to increase their food aid in order to provide temporary relief to people who have been affected by the ris- ing food prices. To some extent this has been done already, with the US government, for example, increasing food aid. recently, the US congress approved a request for a $770 million increase in food aid to help those hardest hit by the global increase in food prices. other countries, including japan ($100 million), Britain ($59 million) and canada ($50 million), have also increased their food aid budgets 9 Combating Hunger: A seven Point Agenda in response to the growing global food crisis. While much of this relief will be targeted for Africa, Asian countries under strain might ben- efit too. The work undertaken by the WFP, as the food aid arm of the United Nations, in meeting emergency needs and supporting eco- nomic and social development in underdeveloped nations with severe food shortages, deserves acknowledgment. WFP works towards putting hunger at the top of the international agenda by promoting policies, strategies and operations that directly benefit the poor and hungry. The agency is seriously short of funds and has made appeals for it to be able to respond to increased emergency demands. 7. Rebuild global food policy in the long run, global food policy should move towards a regime that better reflects comparative advantage. currently, several oEcd countries dominate wheat production, partly due to subsidies. international food policy needs to be reviewed to examine the extent to which it is discouraging farmers in poor countries from producing food. Next Steps As the co chairs of the United Nations Regional Thematic Working Group on Poverty and Hunger, the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific and the UNDP Regional Centre in Colombo, with a variety of partners, are launching a year-long campaign to build a constituency for needed policy reform. This bulletin signifies the launch of a campaign that will be extensive, based on the seven point coalition of process, partnership and policy outlined above. 10 inside asia-pacific IN THE AsIA-PACIFIC REGION Food and agriCulture organisation rEgioNAL oFFicE For ASiA ANd THE PAciFic T he Asia-Pacific region con- tains 68 percent of the devel- oping world\u2019s population and 64 percent of its undernour- ished population.

Only 10 out of 18 countries reduced the number of undernourished people. To reach the World Food Summit (WFS) target by 2015, progress must be accelerated. The decline in the number of under- nourished in Asia and the Pacific was driven mainly by china, which saw a reduction from 194 to 150 million from 1990-92 to 2001-03 and the prevalence of undernour- ishment from 16 percent to 12 per- cent. india has the largest number of undernourished people in the world, 212 million - only marginally below the 215 million estimated for 1990-92 (Figure 1). No country in the region has yet achieved the WFS target. Two countries, Myanmar and vietnam, have reduced the number of under- nourished people by more than 25 percent. in addition to these, the most significant progress in rela- tive terms has been achieved by china, Thailand and indonesia. The most serious deterioration in food security has been experienced by the democratic People\u2019s republic of Korea1, where data show more than a doubling of the number of undernourished people - from 3.6 million to 7.9 million. in this report, the focus is on two countries that have achieved dra- matic reduction in hunger along with strong economic growth and two that have not succeeded in reducing hunger despite strong economic growth. This helps illustrate that in order to achieve dramatic reductions in hunger, something is needed in addition to strong economic growth: a focus on rural development which combines agricultural growth, with the development of rural non-farm industries. UNdERNOURIsHMENT 11 Although the number of malnourished people in china has been reduced by nearly 50 million in the last decade, during this same period, the malnourished population in india has been reduced by only 3 million. Furthermore, there has been a marked increase of undernourished people in both South and East Asia (Figure 1). Behind hunger reduction - successes and challenges in most countries of the region, the majority of the population is rural, and most of the poor and food insecure live in rural areas. A vibrant rural economy is there- fore a pre-requisite for reducing undernourishment. The agricul- tural sector is crucial for a vibrant rural economy. Economic growth originating in agriculture can have a strong positive impact also on the rural non-farm economy through expanded demand for locally produced, non-agricultural goods while also contributing to keeping food prices low to the benefit of food security. increasing the pro- ductivity of small-scale farmers is especially important as rural labourers are more likely to spend their additional income on food and basic non-farm products and services produced in rural areas. Agricultural growth thus generates a virtuous cycle in which agricul- tural and rural off-farm activities sustain each other. Such growth can provide a powerful contribu- tion to reducing the number of undernourished, especially when initial income inequality is not too marked, and population growth is moderate. china and vietnam exemplify this process. This was achieved through strong economic and agricultural growth, with real per capita gdP increasing at an average annual rate of 8-9 percent, while per capita agricultural gdP grew by 2.5 percent and per capita food production by 5.4 percent per year, respectively. At the same time, the annual population growth rate was only one percent. on the other hand, the rest of East Asia has seen an increase of five percent in its undernourished population (Figure 2). The rapid decline in hunger and poverty in china started much earlier, originating with two major agricultural reforms in 1978. Fami- lies were permitted to lease land from the collectives and state pro- curement prices for food grain, oil crops and hogs were raised.2 Agri- cultural output and incomes rose dramatically in response, with rural per capita income increasing by 90 percent between 1980 and 1985. in addition, from 1985, rural non-farm enterprises began to expand rap- idly.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "462fed71-e05c-4802-a335-c800f129eec5": {"__data__": {"id_": "462fed71-e05c-4802-a335-c800f129eec5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Combating Hunger: A Seven Point Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8b93347dc7fc214a5bbb368c0a4e36257ec75bb6445a8388eed6cdfc450f200"}, "2": {"node_id": "9028f7d0-680c-4acb-9976-0131fd142736", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45b94a5aba84ae2bdcf9ae16ad59d0102f1f57aea415e295b2af48f31f5ac84c"}}, "hash": "a6e15f75aa82f17b48eda87234eaed71892f52d7ea680f62eb637ddfd95cfc5c", "text": "By 2000, they absorbed about a quarter of the rural labour force and contributed about 30 percent to the national gdP, while farm 12 inside asia-pacific households were deriving almost 50 percent of their incomes from non-farm sources.3 The number of poor people in rural china fell from about 490 million in 1979 to about 90 million in 2002, using the World Bank\u2019s dollar-a-day poverty line.4 The number of undernourished people was reduced from 387 mil- lion in 1969-71 to the current 150 million.

The majority of the remain- ing undernourished people are located in relatively isolated and disadvantaged rural areas. The bulk of agricultural output comes from about 200 million very small farms - 0.65 hectares or less.5 recent steps by the government of china to revitalize the rural areas holds out the promise that hunger reduction can accelerate in the next decade. Between 1990-92 and 2001-2003, vietnam reduced the prevalence of undernourishment from 31 to 17 percent and the number of undernourished people from 21 million to 14 million. As in china, accelerated hunger and poverty reduction originated with market- oriented economic and agricultural reforms, which were implemented starting in the 1980s. Also as in china, the drivers were strong per capita growth in gdP (5.9 percent per year) and agricultural gdP (2.8 percent per year) as well as rapid expansion in food production. vietnam remains a low-income country, and keeping a strong hun- ger reduction rate is a formidable challenge. china and india have the highest number of undernourished people in Asia and the Pacific, with 150 million and 212 million people respectively (Figure 1). However, East Asia (excluding china) and South Asia (excluding india) con- tain a proportionally higher level of malnourishment with 13 percent and 26 percent respectively (Figure 2) as compared to the rest of the region. cambodia and india saw virtually no change in the total number of undernourished people despite strong growth in per capita income - 4 percent per year from 1993 to 2003 in cambodia and 3.9 percent per year from 1990-92 to 2001-03 in india. However, the good overall economic performance was not evenly spread among sectors and not underpinned by strong agricul- tural growth; per capita agricultural gdP increased at an annual rate of only 0.7 percent from 1993-2003 in cambodia and by 1.3 percent from 1990-92 to 2001-03 in india. Per capita food and agricultural production has stagnated in india since 1999. With the consequent stagnation in rural incomes, there was no progress in reducing the population of undernourished people, which on the contrary appears to have increased between 1995-97 and 2001-03 (Figure 1). 13 Undernourishment in the Asia-Pacific Region C H A l l E N G E of A Hunger free ASiA-PAcific region M S SWAMiNATHAN cHAirMAN, M S SWAMiNATHAN rESEArcH FoUNdATioN T he Asia-Pacific region is rich in natural resources but, ironically, it is also the home of millions of malnourished and under-nourished children, women and men. An analysis conducted by FAo in 2007, on the occasion of the mid-point towards achieving the UN Millennium development goal relating to reducing poverty and hunger by half by 2015, reveals that the proportionate progress made by most countries in the region, except china, is inadequate. How then can the countries in this region achieve the goal by 2015? Hunger in the Asia-Pacific region has three major dimensions - chronic hunger caused by inad- equate purchasing power; hidden hunger caused by the deficiency of micronutrients like vitamin A, iron, iodine, and Zinc in the diet, and transient hunger caused by dis- ruption in communication due to drought, floods, cyclones, and so on. Therefore, any hunger reduc- tion strategy has to accord concur- rent attention to the elimination of chronic, hidden and transient hunger. Also, the emphasis has to shift from food security at the aggregate level to nutrition security at the level of each individual. Nutrition security is best defined as physical, economic, environmental and social access to balanced diet, safe drinking water, environmental hygiene, primary health care and primary education. This implies that there is a need for integrated attention to the food and non-food components of nutrition security. in order to achieve the goal of avail- ability of adequate food in the mar- ket at affordable prices, it is essential 14 inside asia-pacific to pay attention to enhancing the productivity and profitability of major farming systems, on an envi- ronmentally sustainable basis.

Similar conditions prevail in the Haryana and Western UP region. Thus, the heartland of the green revolution is in grave ecological and economic trouble. These areas need conservation farming, which will help farm families to conserve and improve soil health, water quantity and quality and biodiver- sity. Some of the eco-technologies developed by the Punjab Agricul- tural University are bed sowing of wheat saving 20 to 25 percent water, leaf colour chart saving 15 percent Nitrogen application in rice, tensiometer-based irrigation scheduling, zero tillage technol- ogy for wheat, and integrated Pest Management (iPM) in cotton saving 40 percent pesticides. Thus, there is vast scope both to promote green Agriculture and to reduce the cost of production through enhanced factor productivity. A course on Sustainability Science should be introduced in all agricultural univer- sities. india will not be able to main- tain a stable food security system, if the \u201cfertile crescent\u201d (i.e. Punjab, Haryana and Western UP) region is not saved through adequate support for conservation farming. defending the gains already made in this region is an urgent task. This will require education, social mobilisation and regulation. Another area, which requires urgent attention, is adaptation to climate change. Every country in this region should develop a good Weather code to maximise the benefits of adequate moisture availability, a drought code to minimise the adverse impact of drought, and a Flood code both to prevent excessive distress and damage, and to promote a post- flood production plan. An example of the activity that can be under- taken under a good Weather code is the raising of nurseries of appro- priate plants, so that in years of excessive rainfall, an extensive tree planting and sand dune stabilisa- tion drive can be launched in arid areas. This will help to strengthen the ecological infrastructure of the desert, and gradually convert the desert into an oasis. The drought code should include the adoption of crop life saving technologies and contingency plans to change the cropping pattern according to moisture availability. \u201cBe prepared\u201d - both to take advantage of a good monsoon and to reduce the impact of adverse seasons - should be the motto in agriculture. To implement alternative cropping strategies, depending on weather conditions, a seed reserve of the substitute 15 Challenge of a Hunger Free Asia-Pacific Region crops should be maintained. just as grain reserves are essential for food security, seed reserves are necessary for crop security.

For example, Super Wheats capable of yielding about 8 t/ha are now in the breeders\u2019 assembly line. Such wheats have a complex pedigree and illustrate the importance of genetic resources, conservation and exchange. Super Wheats are semi-dwarf with robust stem, broad leaves, large spikes with more number of grains per panicle and more grain weight. The Super Wheat architecture, in the breed- ers\u2019 assembly line, is derived from a blend of Tetrastichon (yugosla- via), Agrotriticum (canada), Tetra- ploid Polonicum (Poland) gigas (israel), Morocco Wheat (Morocco) and semi-dwarf wheats, currently grown in india. if we are to achieve a green revo- lution in rain-fed areas, the first important requisite is opportunity for assured and remunerative mar- keting for dry land farm products like pulses, oilseeds, millets, veg- etables, fruit, milk and meat. The decision to purchase and include ragi, millet, sorghum and other 16 inside asia-pacific nutritious cereals and millets in the Public distribution System should be an integral part of the food security system. This will help to enhance nutrition security on the one hand, and productivity and economic sustainability of improved dry land agriculture, on the other. There is a large untapped reservoir of dry land farming technologies and we can see a drastic rise in the productivity and production of crops in these areas if farm families are supported by credit, insurance, fair price and assured market for their produce. 17 Challenge of a Hunger Free Asia-Pacific Region Knowledge and Technology in Villages to Raise Agriculture Production organisation is the greatest human invention of all time. organisation is the social technology through which human beings accomplish together far more than can be accomplished individually. The Asia-Pacific region has rich experience in organising agricultural production programmes based on a win-win situation both for the environment and food security. What policy makers should never forget is that if farm ecology and economics go wrong, nothing else can go right in agriculture. in most countries in this region, a famine of sustainable livelihood opportunities, rather than availability of food in the market, is responsible for household food insecurity. Therefore, a major effort is needed to create skilled non-farm employment opportuni- ties, which are market-driven. Starting from the industrial revo- lution in Europe, the rich-poor divide started to grow because of the technology divide. Today, the technological, genetic, digital and gender divides are widening among and within nations. if technology has been a prime-mover of economic divide so far, the challenge now is to enlist technology as an ally in the movement for social and gender equity. Social inclusion in access to relevant technologies should be the bottom line of technology develop- ment and dissemination policies. i would like to cite one example to illustrate how this can be done. Urban-rural digital divide can further deepen the prevailing economic divide. Therefore, in india, a national village Knowledge centre (vKc) movement was started at the begin- ning of this century. The vKc move- ment has three components: At the level of each Block (i.e. a cluster of villages) a village resource centre (vrc) is established with satellite connectivity by the indian Space research organisation. Each village Knowledge centre (within the vKr) with internet connection is estab- lished in every village. The vKcs are managed by local men and women. The information provided is demand driven, dynamic and location spe- cific. it is in the local language. The rural families have a sense of owner- ship, since they provide the space for the centre and identify the vil- lage Knowledge workers who will run the centre. Knowledge involves conversion of generic information into a location specific one. it covers all aspects of rural life - agriculture, commerce, weather, health and edu- cation.

Thanks to rapid advances in sci- ence and technology, we now have unprecedented opportunities for achieving the historic mission of a world without hunger and poverty. To take advantage of the opportu- nity, we need a fusion of political will and action, professional skills and peoples\u2019 participation. This type of initiative can be further strength- ened if a community or village cluster has a Sustainable Nutrition Security System (SNSS). There are some key actions that need to be taken in order to create an SNSS. They include reorganising the delivery of nutrition support programmes on a life-cycle basis with the participation of local communities and eliminating micro- nutrient-deficiency-induced hid- den hunger through an integrated food-cum-fortification approach as well as promoting the establish- ment of community Food and Water Banks operated by Women Self-Help groups, based on the principle \u2018Store Grain and Water Everywhere\u2019; spread- ing the growth of community man- aged water budgeting systems, which will help to ensure water secu- rity for agriculture industry, domestic needs and ecosystem maintenance. Through assistance to small and marginal farmers to improve the productivity, quality and profitabil- ity of farm enterprises and through the organisation of rural Non-Farm Livelihood initiatives, rural families will have multiple sources of income. This can be achieved through the introduction of support systems to Self Help groups (SHg) to make them economically and organisa- tionally sustainable. SHg capacity Building and Mentoring centres must be established for this purpose as well as a focus on developing Micro-credit Banks into Sustainable Livelihood Banks. Finally, the formu- lation of a National Food Guarantee Act that has the useful features of the Food for Work and Employment guarantee programmes can be a powerful tool in achieving the goal of a hunger-free nation. By increasing demand for food grain as a result of increased consumption by the poor, the economic conditions, essential for further agricultural progress, can be created. 18 inside asia-pacific KatHleen mCaFee dEPArTMENT oF gEogrAPHy, UNivErSiTy oF cALiForNiA, BErKELEy HUNGER, sOCIAl EQUAlITy, ANd FOOd sOVEREIGNTy A globAl civil Society PerSPective Producing Food or Producing Money? To address the Mdg challenge to halve hunger, we must face two facts: (1) most of the world\u2019s food is still produced by small-scale farmers for family subsistence and domestic markets; however, (2) a fast-growing proportion of farm- ing worldwide is carried out for the main purpose of making profits. in what scholars describe as the global corporate food regime, a handful of transnational firms dominate food production, processing, transport, and retailing.1 The WTo Agree- ment on Agriculture, the terms of some structural adjustment loans and bilateral and regional trade treaties require liberalisation of farm and food trade policies. This means that developing-country governments may not maintain farm programmes, price supports, or import restrictions designed to protect their own domestic food producers. Studies show a connection between trade liberalisation and hunger in marginalised communities in the Asia-Pacific region. in some cases, poor farmers have no choice but to sell their food before it can be eaten. For example, indonesia has become one of the world\u2019s largest importers of rice. debt is common for smallholder indonesian rice farmers who are unable to adapt to global competition and chang- ing markets. A recent study shows that many indonesian rice farmers sell their rice before harvest to pay back debt, which results in hunger and malnutrition.2 in other cases, specialisation, combined with rapid shifts in farm gate prices, can lead to hunger and malnutrition. For example, corn was sometimes 19 found rotting in the field in Min- danao, Philippines because the domestic price was too productive to warrant harvesting the crop, leaving the poorest families with- out the cash to buy other food.3 Hunger should not be accepted as an unfortunate externality.

At the local level, food sovereignty entails the rights of rural communities to remain on the land and to continue producing food for themselves and for domestic and other markets if they so desire. \u201cSovereignty\u201d, as conceived by these advocates, does not apply only to nations, but leaves room for various patterns of autonomy and interdependency at the community, regional, and global levels. Proponents of food sovereignty maintain that human rights, such as the right to food, recognised in the 1966 international covenant on Economic, Social and cultural rights, must take priority over WTo rules. While new rules enforce nar- rowly defined economic criteria for trade regulation, a food sovereignty strategy would advance the rights of governments and consumers to use broader, multiple criteria in trade and development planning. Food sovereignty would permit governments to take decisions about imports, exports, invest- ment, credit, and land and water use in ways that discriminate in favour of standards for ecologi- cal sustainability, humane animal treatment, gender equity, fair labour practices, maintenance of natural and on-farm biodiversity and other goals. it would provide a context for commodity supply management: multilateral negotia- tion to end the cycle of desperate competi- tion, gluts, and price crashes that has pulled farmers and countries into deeper debt. Food sovereignty is an alternative economic paradigm. its propo- nents contend that decentralised, diverse, and locally adapted farming systems can be more environmen- tally sustainable than a globalised food system. Where livelihoods and family goals are tied to the longer-term health and productivity of the land, they say, farmers have more incentive to conserve and improve soils, land- scapes, and water systems. By con- trast, in a globalised food system dominated by agribusiness, the competitive imperative to maxi- mise profits compels companies to externalise their environmental costs, shifting them onto the public and future generations. 20 inside asia-pacific \u00bb the elimination of food com- modity dumping (crops sales for less than the cost of production) and the right of countries to protect them- selves from predatory under- pricing and import surges. National and international policy changes, especially the banning of export subsidies, to limit overproduction and dumping are vital, as well. \u00bb the use of domestic reserves, national planning, and global supply management to ensure adequate but not excessive food production and access as well as raising farm-gate prices. land reform of a kind that \u00bb recognises the individual or collective rights of food pro- ducers, does not saddle them with debt, and puts neglected lands to productive use. \u00bb living wages and safe working conditions for agricultural and food-sector workers. The following rights must also be ensured: \u00bb those which would allow countries to prevent the ruin of domestic food producers and to foster rural development by means such as import controls - quotas, tariffs, or price band systems - and preferential agricultural credit. \u00bb access to water, regulating food and farming in the public interest. \u00bb requiring labels stating the origins and production meth- ods of foods and crops. \u00bb regulating food and farming in the public interest at the municipal, state and national governments. \u00bb deciding whether to accept genetically modified food imports or aid and whether and on what terms to permit the use of genetically engi- neered crops. \u00bb saving seeds for exchange, replanting and improving and making full use of patented crop varieties. There is currently little support for academic study and policy work in support of a food sovereignty approach. interest in such options has been inhibited by a set of myths that have gone unquestioned for too long: the myth that trade in itself, in an unequal world, will bring development benefits and the reduction of hunger; the belief that only high-chemical input industrial agriculture can feed the world\u2019s population; the illusion that small and medium-scale farms are necessarily less productive and less efficient; the notion that farmer- centered agriculture represents a turn away from science; and the idea that farmers care little about and are inevitably at odds with the natural environment. The \u201cfree\u201d trade myth is fading fast in light of the failures of two decades of trade liberalisation to reduce the numbers of hungry and poor.

Proposals to implement food sovereignty and realise the human right to food include: 21 Hunger, social Equality, and Food sovereignty Positive Alternatives and signs of Change in the midst of the crisis caused by globalised industrial agriculture, there are some very significant and promising counter-trends. People are looking for alternative principles, policies and practices. Policymakers and citizens around the world are questioning free- market fundamentalism as well as centralised \u201csocialism\u201d, looking for better ways to understand the global economy and manage the distribution of its resources. Major international declara- 1. tions and policies of some national, regional, and munici- pal governments now rec- ognise that food is a human right. The vital principles of economic and social human rights, potentially radical in their implications but, for long, mere abstractions in the fine print of international accords, are finally being elaborated in practical terms. Tangible alternatives for farm- 2. ers are emerging in the form of systems for fair trade and cer- tification (ecological and social good-practice labels), inter- national producer-consumer networks, local processing of crops such as coffee, chocolate, and fruits to add more value to farm exports, and planning for sustainable regional develop- ment.

While Asia\u2019s growth story of steadily declining income poverty in most countries, is enviable, hunger and malnutri- tion have proved to be resistant to change. The share of children in the region under five moderately or severely underweight is higher than the share of population living under the poverty line of a dollar a day (Figure 1). if micronutrient defi- ciencies, namely anaemia among women and adolescent girls, and other forms of adult malnutrition are added, the proportion of pop- ulation malnourished exceeds 50 percent. Malnutrition at both ends needs attention - under-nutrition due to a shortage of calories and malnutrition due to changing lifestyles. Progress can be seen in East Asia and the Pacific, where the numbers have more than halved in recent decades, yet shares across and within countries demonstrate wide nutritional inequalities (Figure 1). in South Asia, where almost half the children continue to be undernour- ished, the figures are comparable to or even worse than some of the poorest countries in the world: Burkina Faso (38 percent), Sierra Leone (27 percent). Malnourished children remain a cause of continu- ing concern as they are an indica- tor of the population condition as a whole. Malnutrition is an \u2018invisible emer- gency\u2019 often bypassed by the media and policymakers focused on headline grabbing communi- cable diseases and deaths. With widespread malnutrition, small body sizes, as a result of growth fal- tering, appear \u2018normal\u2019, becoming invisible to an untrained observer.

Besides governments, donors also look upon these investments unfavourably. So, if you feel that these investments are a waste of time and resources, you are not alone! in the next sections of this paper, we invite readers to reflect on evidence presented for a change on this position. For development programming, important policy questions around direct food interventions are on effectiveness, potential, limitations and examples of good practice. Problem areas to be considered are limited political will, inadequate resources, and governance gaps. Among developing countries, the indian case has relevance for other countries as direct food interven- tions have been used as a policy instrument with some success. With a population of 1.1 billion, india is akin to 25 developing coun- tries, displaying extreme contrasts. The case demonstrates that overall growth, including income poverty reduction, may not automatically translate into a reduction of mal- nutrition. While gdP growth rates have been high (9 percent in 2006) and national poverty share has declined, malnutrition is at least twice as much as the incidence of poverty. does Right to Food Make sense? conceptually, the right to food is significantly less clear than other rights like the right to information or to free speech. Who does one enforce it against and how? can parents be held liable? can society or the State at large? is it practical to punish poor parents? right to food is rather like the right to education - another right not well understood. yet, once it gets social legitimacy, it does come about. No one today questions children being in school full-time, not being part of the labour force, unlike the days of the industrial revolution. When people come to expect and demand it as a matter of course, state policies tend to respond, making it a de facto right. in india, the right to education has been incorporated into the constitution and, in 2008, there is renewed interest in updat- ing relevant legislation. right to food, however, is yet to be recog- nised as such. 29 Combating Hunger : A Case for Pre-school and school Feeding Nevertheless, in 2001, india\u2019s Supreme court responded to a public interest litigation and ordered all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide cooked midday meals for school students and pre- schoolers below six years old. Parents can demand meals and enforce them through courts if neces- sary, placing the onus on governments. None of the state governments in india liked it, as it was considered a budgetary and organisational nightmare. scaling up India\u2019s Pioneer state Experience: Tamil Nadu, a pioneer state. india\u2019s case makes an interesting study, not only because of its size and diversity, but also because it has been scaled-up from a single pioneer state, Tamil Nadu (TN). The case demonstrates key principles for success and can help identify limitations and continuing problem areas of relevance to help other countries of comparable popula- tion such as Nepal, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and Bangladesh4. More- over, TN is india\u2019s first state to have, in place an official policy crafted in consultation with UNicEF (2003) for making the state malnutrition free by 2020. This official policy is backed by budgets through a combination of state funding and central allocations. TN near-universalised feeding for the nutritionally vulnerable through public funding well before judicial intervention. While the state has a long history of providing food outside the home for young children and mothers, it was not until 1982 that for the first time, the hardest to reach group was included - preschoolers between two to five years old. At first, nutri- tion-oriented schemes and hun- ger-oriented schemes operated in parallel, but were later combined. Today, the nutrition-cum-child- development programme is well entrenched in the state. Food has become an integral part of the school and pre-school rou- tines in villages and urban wards. A midday meal is provided to chil- dren with supplementary feeding to those below 24 months. certain categories of nutritionally-vulnera- ble adults like pregnant and nurs- ing women, the destitute and old are also entitled to a hot midday meal every day. other links have been established, like health, such as growth monitoring, immunisa- tion, deworming, vitamin A, iron and folic acid supplementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d843c982-cfb6-4840-9d48-31be68cbcb32": {"__data__": {"id_": "d843c982-cfb6-4840-9d48-31be68cbcb32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Combating Hunger: A Seven Point Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8cad23a3c2d2ff99868591274edc208c88ff373038e9e64ab2bd87ad4bfb3fa1"}, "2": {"node_id": "55199a66-abec-46ef-b645-4c85d8d33edc", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6777f8aa10623293546a505b130d5572517b876e368c287e43312c9f4925fbb6"}}, "hash": "c84ad6179c9304dbe9d46b55aa32804fc5e67de2b5e5067429a7c38b76f5b17c", "text": "over 70,000 centres function every day, covering around 8,000,000 persons. in spite of its sheer scale, the programme has grown and stabilised.

Second, there has been pressure from below with the programmes becoming so well accepted that it is difficult to let a facility remain closed for any length of time with- out local reaction and enquiry. Third, pressure from beneficiaries, has in turn, contributed to the retention of political will over time regardless of the party in power. As public funding of the state-wide nutrition effort has come to stay, TN is on the verge of establishing child rights to nutrition security. However, the programme is not without its problems. issues have emerged such as population relo- cation, remote location access, staff motivation and training, and most importantly, the limited focus on prevention and participation of local communities, in design or implementation. What have been the changes in the state\u2019s nutrition profile? The sever- est forms of malnutrition seem to have almost completely disap- peared. Specifically, weight-for-age data among children participating in the World Bank Assisted inte- grated child development Service (WBicdS-iii) under 36 months of age5 show a steady decline in severe malnutrition from a little over 12 percent to half of one percent. Simultaneously, the percentage of normal children has increased from under 20 to over 50 percent. Percentages of moderate malnour- ishment have also declined. 30 inside asia-pacific Scaling up to the national level. it was public interest litigation, not political will, which resulted in gen- erating pressure at the top, at the national level (See previous section above). Most states missed the six- month deadline - they could not or did not comply. yet, this pressure from above contributed to a steady expansion of school lunches as most states, after some reluctance, began complying. While this was a victory of sorts, it soon became clear that judicial intervention needed to be supplemented by pressure from below to make it politically worth- while - linking midday meals to electoral prospects. Wider pressure is being generated through a nation- wide \u2018right-to-Food campaign\u2019 by an informal network of supporters. in some of the other states, the pic- ture was mixed due to factors such as inadequate political will, under- funding, infrastructure or manage- ment. in chhattisgarh, for example, cooking took place in soot covered classrooms, there were swarming pupils, utensils were inadequate, cooks struggled and got children to help. in rajasthan, although the political will was in place, the meal was identical every day (ghoogri - boiled wheat & jaggery) and the infrastructure was poor. Upper caste children had brought food from home, which could be the result of social discrimination or privilege, making social inequali- ties explicit. The potential of direct food interventions goes beyond the commonly understood benefits of basic survival and sustenance. Multi-dimensional effects include improvements in health status, greater demand for basic educa- tion, reduction of income poverty, decreased household expenditure for curative care, increased public savings and greater social equity, including gender equality. For example, a 2003 survey revealed that the TN model was effective in many ways as it: addressed intra-household \ufffd issues, removing existing \u2018social\u2019 biases against girls; \ufffd contributed to common dining and socialisation of children at a very early age due to univer- sal feeding; \ufffd was administratively efficient as the targeting took place automatically through location of the programme in govern- ment facilities which tended to exclude the well off; encouraged social equity \ufffd through a preference for dalits6 and widows among staff; \ufffd helped retain regularity and quality through community watch and participation. At the same time, limitations need to be recognised. Nutrition status is an outcome of a number of bio- medico-socio-economic processes interacting over time. Without understanding them, the effective- ness of food investments alone is limited. Sharing of entitlements among the non-target population, like the rest of the family, which happens with take-home dry rations, can also reduce benefits. complicated targeting in an effort to focus on the poor can add to administrative costs and vulner- ability to leakages. Area-based targeting, focusing on state funded schools and pre-schools can help. However, those out of school, the worst off, will be omitted unless separate provisions are made.

(Table 1) Main Components: 1) capital: one time costs for infrastructure and equipment. 2) recurring: ingredients, transport, conversion costs (from raw ingredients into cooked food), and administration. 3) Maintenance: for wear and tear. An estimate for recurring cost per capita based on India\u2019s example calculated locally: grains (100g) 1.11 Transport 0.08 conversion costs (daal, veg, salt, oil, condiments, fuel, staff) 2.00 Administration 0.02 Total (approx) Rs. 3.21 or Usd 0.07 as widely understood as hunger. The shift from a drug-based to a food-based approach has been a big improvement, as nutrition is not just a matter of excess or short- age of specific nutrients. countries now need to make the next shift - to a knowledge-based approach for people to make pro-nutrition choices while dispelling inaccurate beliefs (e.g. \u201cdaals are too heavy for children\u201d thus depriving them of protein, \u201ciron tablets in pregnancy result in \u201cdark\u201d children\u201d, \u201csoda cures gas\u201d). Hence, it is very important to provide nutrition education to the target population, to complement food inputs. in recent years, a new dimen- sion has been added in terms of increased consumption of fizzy drinks and processed foods amongst urban and rural poor. rural obesity and other lifestyle diseases have become increasingly common. The poor appear to have increased spending their incomes on more expensive but nutrition- ally inferior food. Even in TN, while improvements among participants are observed, other data indicate that the overall prevalence of malnutrition in the state persists. The third National Family Health Survey (2005-06) shows that among children under five, 30 percent are underweight, 31 per cent stunted and 22 percent of newborns are categorised as low birth weight. New batches of under- weight babies further contribute to the probability of ending up malnourished. While there is fairly efficient management of exist- ing malnutrition among babies, a critical concern is how does one minimise it in new batches? Unlike drugs or food, nutrition status can- not be \u2018delivered\u2019. Costs and Financing it is easier to secure funding for one time capital expenses, while com- mitting resources for recurring and maintenance expenses is harder. Financing of these expenditures in india has been done jointly by the centre and state governments. ongoing development schemes have been used to fund parts of the costs. Local contributions are also encouraged which help commu- nity buy-in. However, not all states are contributing their expected share as political will has varied. donor financing is also an option. But, by and large, for the present, the right to food is less accepted than that for education. There seems to be a willingness to sup- port education. To that extent, rather than, food per se, Food For Education (FFE) is considered more acceptable, which more or less rules out donor financing for pre- school ages. This is a fairly strongly held posi- tion within most governments as well. Hunger is expected to be in the household realm. Hence, longer term indirect interventions like income generation have been preferred instruments. But there is an argument for direct food investments as well, more so as poverty declines have not resulted in corresponding nutritional improvements. Finally, while money is important, money alone is not enough. com- plementary policies that include institutional changes like harness- ing inter-ministerial synergies and capacity development can maxi- mise the benefit per dollar.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb291f7c-ec09-471b-9434-01b90a39816e": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb291f7c-ec09-471b-9434-01b90a39816e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Combating Hunger: A Seven Point Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9bdf0b18a20215f15082225f973a081219dfe505bd042224563202b1e36a167f"}, "2": {"node_id": "e2168e4c-1371-41ed-b640-bc78007c518c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "130b3ee0538e355668c0d6400b8026713a52ad8186140cfe26c56d69ebde1a85"}}, "hash": "454386a817738f63a7be3f4f3326426cebf3c4c11a1331fb83dc02df718097ad", "text": "32 inside asia-pacific This paper has four overall messages: \ufffd direct nutrition interventions have the potential to address five important development concerns - poverty, hunger-nutrition, health, education and social equity; \ufffd benefits are not automatic - they depend upon the design and quality of implementation; criti- cal issues are: pressure from above and pressure from below \u2022\ufffd administrative and technical capacities \u2022\ufffd adequate budgets \u2022\ufffd \ufffd poor design and implementation can do more harm than good; \ufffd expectations should be realistic about effects as there are a number of other contributory factors to be addressed in parallel. in conclusion, we need to ask the fundamental ques- tion - should we really let people starve, in the interest of fiscal prudence when we have the technology and resources to prevent this? if not, then the recommen- dations are to follow a two-pronged strategy: prevention for those not yet malnourished; \ufffd management for those already malnourished. \ufffd in operationalising this,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f1046ef-7f94-42f1-8d1c-c5c9e7ee644f": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f1046ef-7f94-42f1-8d1c-c5c9e7ee644f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Combating Hunger: A Seven Point Agenda", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f1312e2387d32ccc85c4aa7e32625553e0c011390ba4a732e09dc22c15c760a1"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fe91f66-63f6-4161-a852-161236dbf2e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/combating-hunger-seven-point-agenda", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9de7c0287c037c121c3a83aaf8f1f905eee20416e2029333b41b92b7df1fd52f"}}, "hash": "58991c53059b46c48e336a0b211b14def58b252b0feed52bbe73e185b42e1cbf", "text": "we must customise inputs by socio-economic groups: \ufffd knowledge for the better-off to promote nutrition literacy; \ufffd subsidised inputs-cum-knowledge for the worse-off. Messages and Conclusion 33 Combating Hunger : A Case for Pre-school and school Feeding A s noted earlier in the bul- letin, hunger and malnu- trition comprise a serious threat, more deadly than malaria, tuberculosis and AidS combined. in recognition of its seriousness, the first Millennium development goal (Mdg) is devoted to halving the proportion of hungry people, by 2015.1 Ten years after the World Food Summit, the number of people afflicted by under-nutrition had risen by approximately 23 million.2 There are 854 million undernour- ished people in the world, with over 96 percent of these (820 million) in the developing World (Figure 1). The Asia-Pacific region contains the greatest proportion of undernourished population in the world (61 percent) (Figure 2). More specifically, half of all children in South Asia are suffering from malnutrition, as opposed to one in three in Sub-Saharan Africa - a more impoverished region.3 At the global level, attention to hunger has attracted greater cur- rency, although with a lack of urgency. only 24 percent of the countries are on track to achieve the nutrition target of the Mdgs. Although Asia as a whole may suc- ceed, South Asia will not. A failure to upscale the fight against hunger will impede overall progress and may \u201cderail\u201d other efforts from reaching the Mdg targets4. it is in the interests of developing nations to prioritise hunger alleviation in their poverty reduction strategies. Best practices for emulation are readily available at a small cost to governments and a supportive international community. despite the 70 percent rise in population over the past 30 years, COMBATING HUNGER A globAl PerSPective lara Brearley LoNdoN ScHooL oF HygiENE ANd TroPicAL MEdiciNE 34 inside asia-pacific agricultural produce now provides 17 percent more calories per head. As is well known, it is not an issue of availability that perpetuates hunger in the world; rather, it is the lack of access - due to ineq- uitable distribution, poverty and weak purchasing power. Nonethe- less, increasing food production should not be neglected on the complacency of sufficient global food. As emphasised elsewhere in this bulletin, several measures need to be taken to increase food production. The cycles of malnutrition are obvi- ous. Maternal malnutrition often causes low birth weight babies; correspondingly, roughly 60 per- cent of women in the region are undernourished.6 Malnutrition from conception to two years can have an irreversible effect on the child, impeding its productive capacity throughout life.7 Subse- quently, the mother\u2019s nutritional status and feeding practice for the infant are crucial. 13 As the President of Nigeria, chief o. obasanjo, aptly stated, \u201cWe have a saying in my country, when you take hunger out of poverty, poverty is halved.\u201d8 Nevertheless, hunger and poverty are by no means synonymous; interventions targeting both must be pursued in parallel. Furthermore, there are strong, pragmatic and economic incen- tives for the drive to eliminate hunger. diminished productivity, due to malnutrition, decreases an individual\u2019s lifetime income by at least ten percent. This can reduce a nation\u2019s gdP by as much as two to three percent.9 given their proven success and high returns, investments in micronutrients are relatively cheap. in the 2004 copenhagen consensus, eminent economists prioritised micronutri- ent initiatives: \u201cNo other technol- ogy offers as large an opportunity 35 Combating Hunger : A Global Perspective to improve lives at such low cost and in such a short time\u201d. 10 So why has this seemingly obvious opportunity not been seized? in some Asian countries, progress in reducing the prevalence of hunger has been alarmingly slow. This may, primarily, be attributed to political neglect. Failure to prioritise hunger alleviation in the national agenda has curtailed the allocation of sub- stantial resources to the cause. As the public sector plays \u201ca catalytic role\u201d in the fight against hunger, it is necessary for governments to revise their priorities.

We, as players, have all enjoyed being able to put something back into the local communities we visit whilst on overseas tours with England,\u201d affirmed Michael vaughan, England Test captain. Highly acclaimed sportsmen and women have the potential to pro- mote the plight against hunger. WFP has harnessed this potential by building a multitude of partner- ships - with the England and Wales cricket Board, the international rugby Board, first class footballer ronaldinho and marathon runner Paul Tergat, to name a few. As England\u2019s players often tour countries where widespread pov- erty and hunger prevail, they are in a powerful position to promote the plight of the hungry. \u201cWe are in the public eye, and we have an oppor- tunity to tell our fans and follow- ers about the scale of this problem and the work that WFP is doing to address it,\u201d asserted Alastair cook at the galle event. WFP School Feeding Pro- grammes were introduced to Sri Lanka in 2003 and were expanded after the devasta- tion caused by the indian ocean tsunami, exacerbated the problem of child malnu- trition. \u201cThe most rewarding part of working for the WFP is to see the smiles on the faces of the children who are about to have their mid-morning meals in Sri Lanka\u2019s 1588 schools. it is great that the cricket Against Hunger HUNGER FOR CRICKET FEEds 37 For further information, please contact: gregory Barrow, WFP London gregory.barrow@wfp.org selvi sachithanandam, WFP Sri Lanka selvi.sachithanandam@wfp.org mark ward, England and Wales cricket Board mark.ward@ecb.co.uk Photo credit: gettyimages England Cricket Captain Michael Vaughn and opener Alistair Cook at the Cricket Against Hunger event at the tsunami affected city of Galle, 2007 partnership gives the opportunity to the English cricket Team to work at keeping those smiles on their faces\u201d, stated Selvi Sachithanandam from WFP Sri Lanka.

Social Protection and the Urban Poor Social protection has become one of the key priorities in international development discourse in the recent years. By and large, increasing interest in the issues of social protection has emerged from the global reaction to various forms of economic or financial crises in the 1990s. It has gained momentum, particularly over the past decade, in light of the recent global financial crisis, rising energy and food prices, and risks of climate-related disasters. In this context, social protection has gained increasing significance in providing a systemic and inclusive response to manage multiple risks and reduce vulnerabilities. Concurrently, there is a growing consensus that social protection is the key to sustaining the gains towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) with equity.1 Despite various definitions and approaches to social protection in the Asia-Pacific region, two common issues are recognized: i) social and economic vulnerabilities and risks to the poor; and ii) the inherent dynamic and multidimensional nature of poverty.2 Countries in the region have increasingly responded to rising demands from citizens for better social protection, which comprise various types of instruments and include social insurance systems, labour market policies, and other social assistance or transfers. Different types of social protection schemes have already been implemented. However, they remain fragmented, inadequate and inequitable. They spread broadly but thinly, according to the latest ADB Social Protection Index (See Figure 1).3 There are very few comprehensive national social protection systems for the poor and the vulnerable. 1 UN General Assembly. 2010.

Viet Nam\u00a9 UNDP Asia-Pacific Urbanization and Climate Change Issue Brief Series No.4, March 2014 Experience across other countries and regions suggests that well designed, context specific social protection policies can be effective in providing minimum safety nets for all4. Simultaneously, while social protection schemes are developed in response to specific country needs and contexts, and greatly differ in terms of scope and sectoral focus, there are areas where countries can benefit from other countries and experiences in strengthening design and financing of social protection policies and programmes. UNDP\u2019s Africa Asia Drought Risk Management Peer Assistance Project (AADP) provides a good example. It aims to reduce the risks of drought and improve livelihoods in both continents through knowledge exchange and inter-regional transfer of expertise and technology.5 India \u00a9 UNDP The renewed interest in the social protection agenda reflects a move away from narrow conservative approaches characterized by structural adjustment programmes towards a more comprehensive and systematic approach to management of risks and vulnerabilities. In this regard, the boundaries and limitations of social protection schemes relative to general development policies and programmes must be recognized. While social protection initiatives cannot replace social infrastructure and basic services, the differentiation between the two is often complicated by the availability, accessibility, and quality of the latter6. Understanding these boundaries defined in specific national contexts helps to enhance monitoring and effectiveness of programmes, especially the use of targeting vis-\u00e0-vis universal approaches, conditionality, and accountability at all levels.7 4 For example, Thailand has instituted many pro-poor and equity-oriented measures to promote, fulfill, and protect people\u2019s right to health, particularly among the vulnerable. Some examples include: blanket coverage of people in the informal sector with the use of general taxation; a separate budget and special systems/provisions to ensure health service provision to and utilization by people living with HIV, who otherwise face denial of care due to stigma and discrimination; inclusion of civil society representatives in the decision-making board of the National Health Security Office. 5 UNDP. 2011.

Even though poverty rates in urban areas are lower than rural areas at the aggregated level, urban poverty and inequality has increased and is largely concentrated in smaller towns.8 According to the latest (2012) estimates from UN-Habitat, there are 850 million urban dwellers in slums and slum-like conditions globally, with almost 60 per cent of them in Asia-Pacific cities.9 Among the urban poor, women are more disadvantaged than men in terms of access to decent work, living conditions, income levels, health and education outcomes as well as representation in the urban governance.10 The particular characteristics of urban settings, including growing informality, increasing population density, high mobility as well as socio-economic diversity require more nuanced approaches to social protection policies and programmes in cities. One of the key challenges related to the design of social transfers is the need to take into account the differences between rural and urban poverty and how best to address them in combination with existing programmes and benefits. This includes ways to tackle increasingly complex issues of urban poverty, such as inequitable access to basic social services, drugs and crime, gender-based violence, environmental degradation, tenure insecurity and climate change. As poverty pervades Asia-Pacific cities, limited resources raise the question as to who should be targeted by social protection policies. For instance, India\u2019s urban system is one of the largest in the world and roughly 80 per cent of its urban population concentrate in 300 cities.11 The main challenge is whether the country can afford to expand the coverage of social protection to the urban poor without compromising its quality. On the one hand, there has been growing demand for universal coverage, on the other, increases in breadth seem to incur reduction in the quality of social protection programmes.

New Delhi: UNDP. 3 12 Specific vulnerabilities of the urban poor require changes and adjustments to the design of social protection programmes and choice of instruments. For instance, migrants and out-of-school youth may require different focus and type of interventions in the urban setting. In principle, effective targeting can help widen access to social protection among the most vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, in reality, it is often complicated by political and socio-economic considerations. A diverse demographic and socio- economic profile and high mobility of the urban poor are the major challenges. For programmes that depend on means testing for income verification, it is very difficult because a large number of the urban poor live in informal settlements or are employed in the informal sector. Geographic targeting is not always straightforward, because poverty and vulnerabilities may not coincide with the political divisions of cities and towns. In many cities, the most marginalized communities may live close to the wealthiest sectors. Furthermore, the design of social transfers can be very challenging due to specific risks and vulnerabilities faced by the urban poor, which may prevent their successful development and break away from intergenerational poverty. For example, the design of education-related social protection programmes has to take into account the underlying causes of school dropout, drug use, violence and crime as well as other non-productive activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3628889d-c22c-4015-bde0-603c105d7a95": {"__data__": {"id_": "3628889d-c22c-4015-bde0-603c105d7a95", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/designing-climate-linked-social-protection-asia-pacific-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Designing Climate-linked Social Protection in Asia-Pacific Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/designing-climate-linked-social-protection-asia-pacific-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7840987b62f4ebd9577d886a5f0878a2c5f1d8bacbd9ce09259982edc2065cee"}, "2": {"node_id": "aee0c8da-b17b-4ceb-a169-25b87e6b3b36", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/designing-climate-linked-social-protection-asia-pacific-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ef5c0ff6bc50e280bf783788233e469c5af21cd21f06769f39b826212064d109"}}, "hash": "ff7c6b197b176d5d7e779cf3ea33e0bfeebb5d800489e9178672d21b17dd1d95", "text": "In addition the size of the transfers may need to be adjusted to a different cost of living and opportunity costs associated with schooling and type of work in rural vis-\u00e0-vis urban areas.

As a result, increased demand often compromises the quality and access to these services, particularly among the urban poor and marginalised. Working with local governments can help strengthen the linkages between supply and demand, particularly to widen access to social services for disadvantaged groups.13 Additional challenges to social protection programme design and effectiveness include: horizontal and vertical coordination across involved agencies and between different government levels; monitoring and evaluation capacities and accountability; exit and graduation strategies; and delivery mechanisms. II. Urban Climate Resilience and Social Protection in Asia and the Pacific Climate change has both direct and indirect implications for the urban poor and for rural-urban changes, particularly in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region.14 The vulnerability of urban populations to climate change has received little attention compared to that of the rural poor. Growing literature on adaptation emphasizes the risks from climate change and its impact on agriculture and rural livelihoods more than on sustainable urban development. This does not imply that building climate resilience for urban dwellers should be prioritised over rural populations. Rather, more efforts are required to address the challenges in the urban context as well as its critical linkages to rural areas. Given the dependence of the urban centres on rural environments, the importance of urban economies, and the reliance of rural populations on urban areas for market access, goods and services, it would be misleading to consider rural and urban areas separately in the national development planning response to climate change. Across Asia and the Pacific, urban areas are growing quickly largely due to rural migrants, attracted by employment and the promise of a better life in the city. The region\u2019s rapidly growing cities are a concentrate of people and economic activity, creating an environment that is significantly exposed to environmental hazards associated with climate change. Increased frequency and intensity of disasters incur challenges for transport, energy and infrastructure, the provision of freshwater, and threaten the livelihood of entire communities.15 13 Decentralization policies and local government regulatory framework define mandates and functions of local governments, including the criteria for block grant allocation for local government. This has great implications for the role of local government in delivering social protection, which can be complicated in difficult geographic and demographic conditions, especially in the urban setting. For instance, the division in rural and urban local governments with different mandates, functions and budgetary allocations makes little sense in Bangladesh where the population density in rural areas is hardly different from urban one. In many countries, allocation criteria for local government grants are primarily based on the distribution of population size without consideration of issues related to geographic challenges, extreme poverty and the supply of basic health and education services.

Particularly worrisome is the situation of the urban poor, who tend to be the most exposed and least capable of coping.16 Rapid urbanization, increased density and unaffordable land force newcomers and lower income urbanites to settle in informal and unplanned communities, often in unsafe areas prone to flooding and landslides. In addition, the majority of the urban poor are employed in the informal sector and therefore have limited access to social assistance programmes and contributory social security schemes. These deficiencies are exacerbated by the lack of decent employment, tenure security, financial stability, and social networks and protection.17 Climate-related effects will vary between sub-sectors of the urban poor. For instance, women are more likely than men to work in home-based enterprises and will, thus, be disproportionately affected when floods damage their community and homes. In addition, women tend to have domestic and caretaking responsibilities that render them more vulnerable to disruptions in the provision of daily needs. For example, women and girls in urban areas may spend a long time queuing for water supplies. Similarly, children and the youth face particular vulnerabilities in face of extreme events and longer-term changes in climate; they are more susceptible to illnesses resulting from deteriorating air and water quality, as well as dwindling food supplies. Concurrently, the elderly are more vulnerable to fluctuations in temperature and less capable of adapting to environmental changes. Other vulnerable groups include minorities and migrants, who bear specificrisks. Thus, understanding how climate-change related events may affect incomes, assets, livelihoods, and particular urban poor sub-groups\u2019 specific vulnerabilities, will be critical for designing social protection schemes to build climate resilience for poor households in Asia-Pacific cities. 18 Linking social protection and climate change In recent years, climate-related risks have been incorporated in the design of social protection interventions. One of the prominent concepts that links social protection, disaster and climate change is called adaptive social protection. Its proponents argue social protection can, and should, address both short- and long-term sensitivities associated with climate change (see Table 1). It follows that in addressing risks faced by vulnerable populations, social protection should incorporate elements from and complement climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. 19 In engaging deprivations, vulnerabilities, and the underlying causes of poverty, social protection should aim at coping with the risks associated with climate change and their impacts on urban dwellers, particularly the most vulnerable.

Cash transfers (both conditional and unconditional) are the most well-known social protection instruments, which can contribute to urban poverty alleviation and increase household resilience and adaptive capabilities in the face of disasters. Directly providing cash to urban poor households, and thus complementing their income, helps protect poor urban households by increasing their adaptive capabilities and promotes resilience through increased security to withstand climate related shocks with negative effects on income.22 23 For instance, in 2010, the government of Pakistan instituted the Citizen Damage Compensation Programme, a cash transfer programme to provide financial relief in support of the recovery process of over one million households affected by devastating floods. 20 Ibid. 21 UNDP. 2012.

Despite the frequency and intensity of disasters in Asia and the Pacific, over the last three decades, on average, only 6 per cent of natural disaster losses were insured24. The Asia-Pacific region has been the most vulnerable to climate-related disasters and could be hardest hit by a changing climate.25 This includes a number of coastal cities, particularly the poor neighbourhoods within their boundaries.26 Proshika, a Bangladeshi NGO, addresses this gap by providing group-based climate-linked insurance schemes, which cover more than 2 million clients in 2,000 slums within the country. Established in 1991 in response to the massive floods of 1988, by 2004, the NGO programme covered 10 per cent of the population in Bangladesh for property insurance and 25 per cent for life insurance. The benefits paid to insurers for property losses due to cyclones, river erosion or tornadoes accounted for circa US$280,00027. Sichuan province, China \u00a9 Reuter Furthermore, livelihood promotion and diversification programmes can build climate resilience by promoting adaptive capacities, addressing underlying causes of poverty, and providing the urban poor with coping strategies in enduring potential risks posed by climate change. For instance, the comprehensive Urban Partnerships for Poverty Reduction Project in Bangladesh provides apprenticeships in a variety of professions, such as mechanics and beauticians, contributing to human capital formation and broadening the livelihood opportunities of the urban poor. Their six-month training programmes benefitted 6,146 women and 2,434 men in 2012 alone, totalling 47,300 beneficiaries since the start of the programme, in 200828. As noted earlier, certain groups among the urban poor are more vulnerable than others, and thus need specific programs to address their particular vulnerabilities.

Of the 15 countries at greatest risk in the world, nine of them are in this region.31 Hence, there is an urgent need to focus on expanding the coverage and quality of social protection with particular aim to enhance climate resilience for the urban poor. Nevertheless, designing climate-linked social protection must be done with caution. Given population density and limited social infrastructure and services, planning for climate change adaptation is extremely challenging, particularly when governments have limited capacity to address the risks associated with climate-related disasters. As this is an emerging area for social protection, there is still a need for enhancing evidence on the impact of instruments and key policy considerations to improve the design of climate-linked social protection that can help address various aspects of vulnerabilities. 29 World Bank. 2010.

Toward Inclusive Social Protection in Asia-Pacific Cities Rapid urbanization in Asia-Pacific has created a series of development challenges, as urban populations have been expanding faster than the capacity of cities to accommodate them. Increasing climate-related disaster risks adds an extra dimension to these challenges. The urban poor, particularly migrants, those in the informal sector, and women and girls are the most vulnerable. Stronger systems of social protection with a critical linkage to build climate resilience can provide crucial coping mechanisms to reduce social and economic vulnerabilities of the urban poor. Social protection for vulnerable populations in urban settings is an emerging area of work which requires more evidence on the profile of the urban poor, their vulnerabilities, and the best ways to design social protection interventions that address urban specific risks and vulnerabilities. There is a need for a more accurate picture of household comparison within the urban areas to establish stronger baselines, indicators for urban poverty reduction and social protection programmes. Similarly, it is important to increase awareness of governments that the urban and rural poor face different challenges which require context-specific policies and programmes. Social protection must complement efforts to manage disaster risks and climate change in order to promote sustainable development and resilient communities, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable in Asia-Pacific cities. Climate-smart social protection instruments should address the existing risks and socio-economic vulnerabilities likely to be exacerbated by climate change impacts. In this regard, climate-linked social protection can only be successful if it includes both short and long-term strategies with protective, preventive, promotional and transformative objectives (see page 6). This will enhance the impact of interventions that can potentially increase income security, livelihood opportunities, build resilience and empower the poor to break intergenerational poverty. 32 In face of climate change, urban specific social protection must aim to address unsafe living conditions with an understanding of underlying causes in order to promote long-term adaptation capabilities.33 The growing momentum and confidence around social protection has been accompanied by rising expectations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a79df34-1e26-4bf7-ab84-93fde60d40e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a79df34-1e26-4bf7-ab84-93fde60d40e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/designing-climate-linked-social-protection-asia-pacific-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Designing Climate-linked Social Protection in Asia-Pacific Cities", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/designing-climate-linked-social-protection-asia-pacific-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b565d6bea5a5d4429aa4301994ae28221fbb67c319d56c3f5ee4283814d2d1c"}, "2": {"node_id": "53a9a0fc-c721-4ace-9ea6-d067792f4781", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/designing-climate-linked-social-protection-asia-pacific-cities", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2412a7d9a8a5974cc950cd99827018bff75f9b77c220a69ab21013f0dc5ae332"}}, "hash": "0e34488172ded00514d769162823a2175142ebcf8181f70fb672afaa35f2852e", "text": "Social Protection will inevitably play an important role in the sustainable development agenda as it is a powerful redistributive measure, which can contribute significantly to address issues of rights, equity, and sustainability.

Effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report \u2013 SUMMARY 1 2 1. Introduction Over the past 20 years, disasters due to natural hazards have affected 4.4 billion people, claimed 1.3 million lives and caused 2 trillion USD in economic losses.1 These disasters not only brought death and destruction, they did so disproportionately to the poor and marginalized. Disasters have become one of the main threats to sustainable development on a global scale, yet they are preventable. Today, it is well accepted that the actions and decisions of individuals, communities and nations make a significant difference as to whether or not a natural hazard turns into a disaster. Choices made with the aim of reducing the human impact of natural hazards can be described as disaster risk reduction (DRR), in the broadest sense.2 There is widespread agreement that legal frameworks are a critical tool for governments to shape these choices, both for themselves and for others. This was recognized by 168 UN Member States in 2005 when they adopted the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA), and remains so today, as states and other stakeholders discuss its successor agreement. However, some DRR experts and activists have expressed doubts and disappointment with the legislative route, arguing that the many new laws and policies that have been developed to address DRR seem not to have made the difference they promised, citing in particular gaps in implementation at the community level. Numerous reports relating to HFA implementation have also indicated slow progress in reducing disaster risk at the community level, and a lack of clear information and analysis on the role of legislation. With this in mind, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) have collaborated on a multi-country report to assess legal frameworks for DRR in 31 countries. The purpose of this report is to support legislators, public administrators, and DRR and development practitioners and advocates to prepare and implement effective legal frameworks for disaster risk management (DRM) that are adapted to their own country\u2019s needs, drawing on examples and experience from other countries. Its four objectives are to: \u25cf present examples of DRR legal provisions from different country contexts and legal systems as a resource for DRM practitioners and legislators; \u25cf identify factors that have supported or hindered the implementation of DRR as a priority within DRM laws and selected sectoral laws; \u25cf make recommendations for legislators, practitioners and policy makers engaged in reviewing or drafting DRM laws and selected sectoral laws; \u25cf provide an analytical framework against which different DRM laws and selected sectoral laws can be assessed at the country level in terms of effective support for DRR. The report has examined aspects of different countries\u2019 legislation according to how they address relevant themes in the HFA, as well as issues identified by state parties and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in a 2011 International Conference resolution.3 This summary report provides a synopsis of the main findings and recommendations of the multi- country report, as well as the individual country case studies and legal desk reviews on which it draws. The report finds that in order to support a whole- of-society approach, legal frameworks for DRR should include institutional mandates, allocate dedicated resources, facilitate the participation of communities, civil society and vulnerable groups, and establish the responsibility and accountability of relevant actors. Effective frameworks facilitate the mainstreaming of DRR into relevant sectors, are sustainable within the available resources and capacity of government at national and local levels, and fit within the overall legal and institutional structure of the country. 1 UNISDR, Impacts of disasters since the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, (2012). 2 For definitions of all terminology used in this report please refer to the multi-country report and UNISDR terminology on DRR at www.unisdr.org/we/inform/terminology. 3 Resolution 7, 31st International Conference", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a761b343-fc89-47cf-9c94-eaceff46d0ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "a761b343-fc89-47cf-9c94-eaceff46d0ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d5a493ad6d62cae783cbeb273a0012419efa7f0b6f5cb2db79a3daebe9748198"}}, "hash": "d5a493ad6d62cae783cbeb273a0012419efa7f0b6f5cb2db79a3daebe9748198", "text": "of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, November 2011, convening all state parties to the Geneva Conventions, with the IFRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the 189 National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

Background Context The HFA served as an important starting point for the design of this report. The legal and institutional framework for DRM is highlighted in the first HFA Priority for Action, i.e. to \u201censure that DRR is a national and a local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation.\u201d However, it is also integral to the achievement of the other four Priorities for Action. In the years following the adoption of the HFA, a significant amount of new legislation aimed at strengthening the focus on DRR has been enacted in various parts of the world. However, important gaps still remained at the time of the Third Session of the Global Platform for DRR in 2011, particularly with regard to the impact of legislation at the community level. It was found that communities were not well enough informed, engaged or resourced to take an active part in reducing disaster risks, and that rules to deter risky behavior, particularly in construction and land use, often go unenforced. In November 2011, state parties took up this issue at the 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Resolution 7 of the Conference encouraged states, with support from their National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (National Societies), the IFRC, UNDP and other relevant partners to review existing legislative frameworks in light of the key gap areas identified in the IFRC report to the Conference and to assess whether they adequately:4 \u25cf make DRR a priority for community-level action; \u25cf promote disaster risk mapping at the community level; \u25cf mandate communities\u2019 access to information about DRR; \u25cf enable the involvement of communities, National Societies, other civil society organizations and the private sector in DRR activities at the community level; \u25cf allocate funding for DRR activities at the community level; \u25cf ensure that development planning takes into account cost-benefit analysis and local variability in hazard profiles, exposure and vulnerability; \u25cf ensure full implementation of building codes, land use regulations and other legal incentives; \u25cf promote strong accountability for results in reducing disaster risks at the community level. Together with the HFA, this 2011 Resolution set the framework for the country studies undertaken for the multi-country report, in particular by stressing the value of civil society and community participation, emphasizing the importance of building codes and land use planning to reduce underlying risks, and considering accountability and legal liability as potential legal incentives for DRR. 4 IFRC, Law and disaster risk reduction: background report for the 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, (2011). Effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report \u2013 SUMMARY 5 6 Methodology The report draws on research from a sample group of 31 countries, undertaken in the form of desk surveys, as well as case studies in 14 of these countries for a more comprehensive analysis of the laws and their implementation (see Figure 1). These desk surveys and case studies are available at www.drr-law.org. The sample countries were chosen for geographical representation, and to cover a variety of risk profiles, income and human development levels. The country studies focused on legal frameworks that support the reduction of risks that arise primarily from natural hazards and that affect the most vulnerable groups, including women, people who are socially excluded, the elderly, people with disabilities, children and the poorest people. The point of departure of the studies was that regulatory frameworks for DRR cut across sectoral laws and regulations, such that they constitute an ensemble of laws and rules beyond any dedicated DRM law or laws on a specific hazard or field of safety regulation. Within these parameters, the focus of the country studies was on: \u25cf laws that enable national and local DRM systems; \u25cf a selection of sectoral laws that underpin planning for development, i.e. on buildings and land use, including informal settlements, as well as environmental management. Ten themes that are essential for DRR implementation were investigated during the study. They were chosen based on key aspects of the HFA Priorities for Action as well as Resolution 7 of the 31st International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, as follows: 5 \u25cf level of priority given to DRR in DRM laws and the established", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8fe006bd-a3b6-403f-93ec-9e7d6c7cd225": {"__data__": {"id_": "8fe006bd-a3b6-403f-93ec-9e7d6c7cd225", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3eedfad6fcd10673eae3780da505d5260f055abf88288c0863949f5e9fc4a679"}}, "hash": "3eedfad6fcd10673eae3780da505d5260f055abf88288c0863949f5e9fc4a679", "text": "institutional structures and mandates, including resource allocation and local institutions; \u25cf level of DRR integration in hazard-specific regulations (such as for fires, floods, or earthquakes); \u25cf provisions on early warning systems (EWS) in DRM laws; \u25cf inclusion of community and school education and public awareness on DRR in legislative frameworks; \u25cf specific mention of DRR in urban settings, including building codes, land use planning, land tenure and informal settlements in legislative frameworks; \u25cf specific mention of DRR in rural settings, including references to agriculture and covering slow-onset disasters, environmental management, and the effects of climate change in legislative frameworks; \u25cf inclusion of rights, accountability, responsibilities and liability for DRR in legislative frameworks; \u25cf provisions on risk sharing and insurance in legislative frameworks; \u25cf reference in DRM laws to community and civil society participation, including National Societies as auxiliaries to government in humanitarian assistance; \u25cf recognition of the particular DRR needs of vulnerable groups.

Effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report \u2013 SUMMARY 7 8 3. Summary of f indings DRM laws How disaster risk reduction is prioritized in DRM laws DRM laws are dedicated to establishing the priorities, institutional mandates and a number of other aspects of a national DRM system. DRM laws vary in the extent to which they include themes such as national DRM policy and planning, local government responsibilities, resource allocation, community and civil society participation, EWS, and education and public awareness. In some cases, these issues are part of the dedicated DRM law, and in others, they are part of separate or companion laws that also form part of the legal framework. The analysis found that, although DRR is highly prioritized and integrated into DRM laws in some countries (e.g. Algeria, Japan, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, Philippines and Viet Nam), there is still considerable potential in many of the other countries to make DRR a higher priority in their respective legal frameworks and in their implementation. However, it was also noted that the role of DRM laws and institutions in leading a whole-of-society approach to DRR varies in different country contexts, so that those with lower exposure to natural hazards or higher disaster risk governance capacities may not require as much guidance on the implementation of DRR through their DRM laws. Although setting out detailed provisions for DRR in DRM law can be an important step for many countries in moving towards more effective DRR, it is not the only means of doing so. Depending on disaster risk levels and national and local governance capacities, disaster risk may also be managed effectively through sectoral laws and local government responsibilities. In terms of the process of legislative change, some countries face much greater challenges than others due to factors such as political instability, income levels and compliance culture. The evolution of DRM laws can also be driven by factors such as the occurrence of disasters, national and sub-national political and law reform processes, and international actors. Thus, it is evident that both the style of legislation and the process of reform need to be adapted to each national context. The typology of DRM laws in Figure 2 is based on the style and content of the DRM law and the role it plays in a particular country\u2019s legislative framework. It considers a country\u2019s current level of disaster risk, including exposure to natural hazards and the disaster risk governance capacities at the sectoral and local government level. TyPE 1: Preparedness and response law Focuses on emergency response to natural hazard events, although it may also include elements of immediate preparedness, early warning and recovery. Examples include: Iraq (1978), Madagascar (2003) and Nepal (1982). TyPE 2: Broad DRM law Covers the key DRM functions of prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery for multiple hazards.

Examples include: Brazil (2010), Nicaragua (2000) and Nigeria (1999). TyPE 3: DRR Priority law (high detail) Covers the same themes as the Broad DRM law, but in addition it gives clear priority to DRR, which may be expressed as enabling a \u2018whole-of-society\u2019 approach. It specifies local institutional structures and/or responsibilities, and usually covers a number of related areas in addition to the key DRM functions. Examples include: Mexico (2012), Namibia (2012) and the Philippines (2010). TyPE 4: DRR Priority law (low detail) Gives clear priority to DRR, but does not provide a comprehensive and detailed range of related subject matter, since this is covered by a number of other laws that may range from laws on specific hazards, to laws on natural resource management, building and construction, and local governance. Examples include: Japan (1961) and New Zealand (2002). Devising a DRM law that is fit-for-purpose in the respective country context is a considerable challenge, both in terms of addressing the most predominant DRR priorities, as well as ensuring the sustainability of the DRM system that it establishes. Importantly, it must operate in harmony with the country\u2019s overall legal and institutional framework and be able to complement existing disaster risk governance capacities, especially at the local level.

However, the interaction between law and policy, whilst complex, is often essential for successful implementation. Countries rarely tackle the fundamental reform towards DRR without a specific legal framework, since DRM laws are essential for setting the DRR priorities and mandates of implementing institutions. Even countries with successful DRR regimes that are based on policy only, eventually look to codify key elements through legislative provisions. However, they also use policy processes to advance new law reforms. Hence, policy can both set the agenda for the law reform process and be a key tool to guide the implementation of laws. Institutional frameworks for decentralized implementation in DRM laws In most of the sample countries, DRM laws established a single agency (such as a national disaster management agency or a civil defense office) as the central national focal point for cultivating a whole-of-society approach to DRR, and providing national leadership and policy direction. However, it was found that these institutions often need to strengthen their coordination with other sectors and stakeholders, especially those related to development planning and climate change adaptation. Most of the sample countries have established specific DRM institutions or mandates within their legislative and institutional frameworks, from the national to the local level. Some establish implementing institutions at the local level (e.g. in Guatemala and Namibia), while others supplement general governance functions at the provincial and local levels with DRM advisory committees (e.g. in South Africa and Algeria), and still others principally use existing local government institutions (e.g. in Iraq and Italy). In all cases, the key to effective local institutional structures to support DRR is that they have clear legal mandates and authority, matched with dedicated resources and capacity, which can also be enhanced through DRR training and education. Financing of disaster risk reduction in DRM laws Funding for DRR from the national to the local level has been a challenge that has hampered implementation in many of the sample countries. The issue is not only one of overall resource constraints for DRM. DRR is rarely separated from general support to DRM, so that it sometimes may not compete favorably with urgent matters of emergency response and recovery. In other cases, this combined method of financial support can result in a highly integrated approach to DRM and DRR, which would not be possible with separate accounting processes. Special funds established for either broader DRM and/or DRR are often intended not only for annual recurrent expenditure, but to build reserves for the future and to undertake longer- term DRR projects. It is clear that they need a sustainable funding basis, which in some countries will require support from external donors. Such external resources should be seen as a supplement to regular funding through government revenues at all levels, not as a substitute.

However, some of the country experiences indicate a need, within such resource streams, to designate specific resources for DRR. Participation of civil society and communities under DRM laws Some DRM laws make special provision for the participation of civil society and communities in the advisory and implementing institutions, often including a specific role for National Societies as an auxiliary to public authorities in the humanitarian field (e.g. in Nicaragua). Other DRM laws include more general obligations to be inclusive of non-government stakeholders without specifying how. Evidence from the case study countries indicates that these types of provisions are not always easily implemented and that there is often less participation than the law may intend. However, the presence of such provisions in the vast majority of countries represents an important recognition that the input of civil society organizations is a key part of DRR strategies. More particularly, it recognizes communities\u2019 rights to be involved in their own risk management. Overall, community and civil society participation in the DRM system at all levels could be greatly enhanced in many cases by more defined roles in the DRM laws. Inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in DRM laws The analysis found a variety of approaches to addressing legal provisions for the participation of women and vulnerable groups. Most DRM laws reviewed do have some kind of legislative mandates on this, but these are mostly general aspirational statements without specific mechanisms for implementation. They also tend to focus on the importance of addressing the needs of these groups without necessarily ensuring that they are represented in DRM institutions. Early warning and risk mapping in DRM legal frameworks EWS in the sample countries have been developed in a variety of ways: many are hazard- specific (e.g. in Ethiopia and Australia), some are regulated by law (e.g. in Guatemala, Dominican Republic and Italy), and others are governed by policy (e.g. in Nepal, Nicaragua and St. Lucia). Many of these are designed only for specific major hazards, so that not all relevant risks in a country are necessarily covered by their mandates. Some DRM laws include specific mandates on risk mapping, an essential underpinning of effective EWS. A few countries have achieved high levels of integration of various EWS and risk mapping through legislative mandates, but most have not used the potential of legal frameworks to clarify roles and responsibilities, or to integrate communities as givers as well as receivers of hazard and risk information. Even where laws have been established to support national and local EWS, it is a significant challenge to set up systems that provide timely information to communities for all relevant hazards in all vulnerable areas. Lack of resources and gaps in capacity are consistently recurring reasons given by stakeholders for the lack of comprehensive EWS that reach the local level. DRR education and public awareness in DRM legal frameworks Over half of the sample countries have legal mandates requiring public authorities to conduct community education on DRR, although many are expressed at a very general level without specific guidance for implementation. In a number of cases, the law also requires some efforts toward including DRR in school curricula or conducting disaster preparedness drills in schools. Many of these provisions are simple statements in the objective clauses of the DRM laws, while some are included in education laws or in both, the latter approach providing more specific mechanisms for implementation. Some laws also mandate the establishment of special training facilities or curricula aimed at adult professionals as a long-term strategy to build national capacity in DRR and DRM (e.g. in Mexico and Philippines). DRR education is recognized in the HFA as an essential element of a whole- of-society approach, and there is evidently still considerable scope for creating more specific legal mandates for DRR education in schools as well as for public awareness. Effective law and regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report \u2013 SUMMARY 11 12 Building, planning and environmental laws Some of the relevant sectoral laws selected for analysis in the report are those that regulate the physical planning aspects of development and settlements, including building codes, land use regulations, as well as environmental management and climate change laws. These laws are key pillars of disaster risk governance, since they address underlying vulnerability in both urban and rural areas, in particular by playing a central role in curbing", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cb808f7-c21f-4fbd-8b17-2a6520063324": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cb808f7-c21f-4fbd-8b17-2a6520063324", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6a6a9aae54be251acb1591626e2d30f85d9c7b495d73584c3922155ca238fc5"}}, "hash": "a6a6a9aae54be251acb1591626e2d30f85d9c7b495d73584c3922155ca238fc5", "text": "the creation of new risks through development. DRR in building and construction laws Most sample countries have extensive and legally enforceable building laws and codes that apply throughout their territories, whether nationally or at state level in federations. Some countries, however, have only partial codes or guidelines, revealing some gaps in coverage and relevance. Interestingly, only a few of these laws specifically mention a DRR function, and it is rare that they are linked with the DRM law or institutional arrangements. Responsibility for building code implementation is generally held by the local government. Insufficient capacity and resources at this level of government, combined with a lack of a \u2018culture of compliance\u2019 are identified as the two major challenges to implementation in many lower- and middle-income countries. Both education on building safety and the use of legal sanctions for large non-compliant developments are necessary in many cases to achieve higher levels of disaster risk reduction. Training programmes for masons and builders have also resulted in improved compliance in some countries. DRR in land use regulations Most sample countries have national or state legislation that governs development and land use planning. Some of the strongest laws integrate land use planning and building codes, and some take a further step by linking these areas with the DRM system (e.g. in India). In federations, land use planning laws are often a state responsibility, but in almost all sample countries, the primary responsibility for implementation lies at the local government level. A lack of explicit inclusion of language referring to DRR in the laws and over-stretched local government capacities were identified as the main challenges in implementation in the lower- and middle-income countries. DRR in regulations for informal settlements Urban informal settlements represent the most challenging aspects of building and planning regulation, especially in the lower- and middle- income countries, since by definition they fall outside the usual regulatory frameworks. Yet, they are centers of population growth in many countries which drive both an increase in hazard exposure and vulnerability. Since few of the sample countries have established specific legal frameworks for public safety or DRR in informal settlements, the default position is often to merely regard them as illegal. In the sample countries that have enacted laws regarding safety in informal settlements, the approach of gradual regularization seems most likely to be effective in the long term (e.g. in Brazil). However, when relocation is necessary, frameworks that provide for community consultation and respect for residents\u2019 procedural and substantive rights establish important safeguards against arbitrariness and abuse (e.g. in Kenya and Namibia). DRR in environmental management laws All sample countries have environmental management laws, and all but one also have laws providing for some form of environmental impact assessment (EIA) for major developments. However, few of them have specific criteria relating to natural hazard risks, and fewer still provide for community participation in assessment processes. Environmental laws appear in most cases to be administered entirely separately from building and spatial planning regulations and also from DRM laws, so there is little coordination between these sectors, even though all of them have a role in DRR. Mechanisms for cross-sectoral coordination with DRM systems and mainstreaming of DRR principles into environmental laws and institutions could greatly enhance the DRR potential of such laws. DRR in climate change adaptation laws DRR and climate change adaptation (CCA) share a common objective of reducing vulnerability to extreme hydro-meteorological events, and thus the need to pursue integrated approaches in policy, planning and implementation is gaining momentum. Only nine of the sample countries (Algeria, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines and Uruguay) have a specific legal framework for managing CCA (as opposed to mitigation). A further 15 have dedicated institutional structures for CCA often underpinned by a national DRM policy. A few countries have also developed laws that coherently integrate DRR, CCA and development planning (e.g. in Algeria, Mexico and Uruguay), however such approaches remain the exception rather than the rule. DRR in natural resource management laws The management of risks from forest fires, floods and droughts is inherently linked with the management of natural resources, since the degradation of forests, water and land exacerbates disaster risks. Laws related to forest management were most often found to be separate from DRM laws within the sample countries. They often include severe sanctions related to causing forest fires, but they tend not to be well enforced in lower- and middle income countries. For most of the sample countries where flooding is a regularly occurring hazard, floods are included as one of the risks to be managed under the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1d8cb51-886d-4f6b-a01e-b74a80e0fac4": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1d8cb51-886d-4f6b-a01e-b74a80e0fac4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Effective Law and Regulation for disaster risk reduction: a multi-country report", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06d69a4b553dc03fbbe73ac494fbde68441132da48f7c3d2bd959cc798ca4e95"}, "3": {"node_id": "3e7a85f4-b0b3-44e0-8ee0-cd6077d61ce4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/effective-law-and-regulation-disaster-risk-reduction-multi-country-report", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5863a27569f2d8e07d47e51d70ceb2ab38879c30fd128265f1c8d59ec5508442"}}, "hash": "57c12c66bc0fe923c4ab408152c17a10026eb160e29a7ecd529de8a5dac0dfa9", "text": "national DRM law and system, although in these laws the focus tends to be on shorter term mitigation measures and flood warnings.
