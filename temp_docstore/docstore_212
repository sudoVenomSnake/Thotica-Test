On May 16, 2007 the Emergency Powers Regulations 2006 was replaced by the new Emergency Powers Regulations 2007, which removed some powers that were given to the TPF and TDS under the old regulation (see example 4). The political situation in Tonga is still affected by the fallout from these riots. A 2007 report by a community task force on human rights revealed that 41% of individuals arrested since the riots experienced violence during their arrest, reportedly perpetrated by the TDS. Many claimed to have been interviewed with violence or intimidation and all reported overcrowded and unhealthy prison conditions.143 In addition, during the riots the integrity and image of the police force was damaged due to it being seen as unprepared to deal with such an extraordinary event. However, it should be noted that based on the evidence and complaints so far, the alleged unlawful actions were not widespread or an organised misuse of power. There was also glaring evidence that if the police had not called for the assistance of the TDS, the rioters would have done more destruction to the capital.144 In 2008 the Legislative Assembly passed the Constitution and Electoral Commission Act, with the commission given ten months to submit a report and recommendations to the Privy Council and the Legislative Assembly.

In November 2009, the Constitutional Reform and Electoral Commission submitted its final report to King Tupou V. For a summary of some of key recommendations (see box 23). In parallel, a number of other reforms have been initiated to improve governance, security and stability in Tonga: The establishment of an Anti Corruption Commission through the Anti Corruption Commission Act 2007, with extensive powers to investigate suspected corruption and prosecute civil servants of wrong doing; The organization of a conference in early 2009 on reconciliation and civic education was organised by the prime minister\u2019s reconciliation advisor, which brought together people from across Tonga to discuss an 18 month reconciliation program aimed at restoring and reinforcing Tongan heritage of respect and honour; and The police force has undertaken nationwide community consultations and a survey to develop a community policing concept unique for Tonga. Through this process, information was gathered from ordinary Tongans on what they perceive as the most important crime threats and how the police force can improve its services. This process will result in a TPF new strategic plan and four year business plan using the survey as a baseline for measuring any improvements in policing. Security Sector Governance Challenges The principal challenge facing Tonga is to restore confidence and capacity in the police to provide public security against the background of the national reconciliation process. There is no overall security policy in Tonga; this might be required to ensure coordination of the different security actors at a strategic level, to set security priorities and appropriate resource allocation. Sustaining mechanisms for civil society organisations to provide structured input to the law enforcement reform process, at a local level on citizens and communities\u2019 needs, as well as at the national level with government agencies and the Legislative Assembly. There is a need to address key resource allocation issues regarding budgeting for domestic security and justice agencies versus defence prerogatives. If police reform proves successful, the justice sector needs adequate capacity to deal with criminal and civil cases at a grassroots level. As part of ongoing reform efforts, recommendations will be made on the governance structure, which will impact on the type of policies the TPF and TDS will implement. The TPF is in the process of modernising its legislation, which will require looking at options to make the police commander operationally accountable. Currently, the minister of police has command of the force. This is a key way of protecting against the problem of wrongful political interference. In the context of the current Tongan political system, parliament has a limited mandate and only two committees exist that do not have a statutory security oversight role. There is a need to clarify the roles of the ombudsmen and public relations commissioner in order to determine the most appropriate mechanism for dealing with public complaints against the security sector. The King: Remain Head of State but no longer participate in the executive government. The Executive government shall be the Cabinet, which answers to the Legislative Assembly (Parliament). No longer choose his own Prime Minister and Ministers, but appoint the PM on the advice of the Legislative Assembly, and appoint the Minaisters on the advice of the PM. Only appoint judges to the Supreme and Appeal Courts on the advice of the Chief Justice (rather than the Privy Council). Retain the power to withhold assent to laws and dissolve Parliament, if necessary, as a safeguard against unlawful acts by the government. The Privy Council: Exist solely as an advisory body, with all executive, legislative and judiciary powers removed. While members are to be appointed at the King\u2019s pleasure, they should not include members of the Legislative Assembly (including the PM and Cabinet). The commission recommended the governors of Ha\u2019apai and Vava\u2019u, two nobles, a church leader, and the Secretary of the Traditions Committee be ex officio members. Parliament: The number of People\u2019s Representatives in Parliament would increase from nine to 17 (nine for Tongatapu District, three each for Vava\u2019u and Ha\u2019apai, one each for Niua and \u2018Eua), while the number of Nobles Representatives remain at nine (as elected by the 33 titleholders). The King would appoint a PM at the recommendation of the House of Representatives, and for this Prime Minister to advise the King on the appointment of Cabinet ministers, now limited to 10. Cabinet ministers would be appointed from the MP\u2019s but will remain as representatives at the same time.

Legislative Assembly Against the background of ongoing political reform, there is a need to increase the role of the Legislative Assembly in security oversight with the aim of improving transparency and accountability of security policy and programming, especially the police. There is a clear interest in developing the number and work of the committees in step with the agreed format of the reform process itself and the need for more active public consultation on legislative policy matters and scrutiny, particularly in the law enforcement field. To do this, however, the parliamentary support staff will require extra training and skills. The existing staff and new committees\u2019 capacity development would ideally focus on security oversight norms and good practices, relationships with the government, executive, civil society and the security sector, as well as policy development and consultation processes. Ombudsman/Public Relations Commissioner The ombudsman and public relations commissioner could benefit from the experiences, lessons learned and good practices being shared across the Pacific. Civil Society Given the valuable inputs civil society organisations have already given as part of the constitutional, electoral and police reform processes, opportunities exist to support civil society to maintain an effective platform for interaction with the Legislative Assembly, the security sector and government agencies. Tonga Police Service The ongoing police reform process provides an opportunity to discuss: how to improve the interaction between citizens and communities; ways of dealing with complaints against police behaviour, i.e. Police Complaints Authority and Code of Conduct; and mechanisms for engagement between the police and governance institutions. This approach would help ensure solid oversight of the law enforcement sector and improved feedback loops for citizens to help shape policy and practice. National Priorities Overall, the Tongan delegation agreed with the recommendations of the UNDP and DCAF scoping mission report and had a number of specific inputs: Support is needed for institutional strengthening of the executive and parliament for the management and oversight of the security sector. There is a need to clarify the role of ombudsman and public relations commissioner because of lack of understanding of its role within the public. It was stressed that this should not become a monitoring body. Civil society oversight and input on security issues is important. There is the need to regulate private security services. Currently there is no legislation to hold private security companies accountable. This issue needs to be reviewed and explored as part of the ongoing security reform process. In terms of police reform, it was noted that it is ongoing and the emphasis is on ensuring that it continues and is fully implemented. Finally, the Tongan delegates expressed the need for continued and sustained support for civic education for political reforms, through enhanced public awareness throughout the country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3e472d3-0735-44bd-9deb-19187ab4c642": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3e472d3-0735-44bd-9deb-19187ab4c642", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27b51ad001dd88ac073a327834a6e3d2d069507bcd4dc958355887a6bade1ef0"}, "2": {"node_id": "000a6190-5c48-48f1-b282-dd0726b03625", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "764f5f493ef8b4dd368379261e40ae0d3a14b7d265adf141ca632de4c858f977"}}, "hash": "56e922c61f9a953fb4625ab1405a5754cb562a40d9ab97659837ecd0e4c9353a", "text": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 136 137 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Vanuatu PART 2 Vanuatu Population 2008: 231,142 Political System: Parliamentary Republic GDP (US dollars at current prices) 2008: $574 Million GDP Growth Rate 2008: 6.6% GDP Per Capita (PPP US$) 2007: 3,666 \u2013 Rank 122nd Human Development Index 2007 : 0.693 \u2013 Rank 126th Human Poverty Index: 23.6 \u2013 Rank 83rd MDG Progress 2009: One of five countries in the region which is on track Actors in the Security System Core Security Actor: Vanuatu Police Force (VPF); Vanuatu Mobile Force (part of the VPF); Vanuatu Department of Customs and Inland Revenue (DCIR); Department of Immigration Management and oversight bodies: Vanuatu National Parliament \u2013 Standing Committees: the Publics Account Committee (PAC); Police Service Commission; Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Ministry of Finance and Economic Management; Ministry of Internal Affairs; Ministry of Justice, Culture and Women\u2019s Affairs; Vanuatu National Audit Office (VNAO) Law and Justice Sector: The Ombudsman\u2019s Office; Office of the Public Prosecution (OPP); Islands Courts, Magistrates Courts, Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, Custom tribunal system; The Leadership Commission;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "657de5ed-a7c2-4e44-a763-ee772f8a0c56": {"__data__": {"id_": "657de5ed-a7c2-4e44-a763-ee772f8a0c56", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c416153de66f01adcab3dc46bda421a12047cb9c26a39d68b00d2839b70c12f"}, "3": {"node_id": "ead3ab5d-7d2a-47b5-ac79-4ca97bee88e1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b41ad5281e91a960eede3e9f436ff815c08db788d2827a583bb75ad9807fef3"}}, "hash": "d078e4f94e4d3327e669fd4b0dba18163e05682f7c6277f6e39327c3917d5694", "text": "Malvatumauri, or National Council of Chiefs (NCC) Personnel Vanuatu does not have a military force but it has a paramilitary wing within the Police Force.

It is one of the five least developed countries in the Pacific. Vanuatu\u2019s economy is built on agriculture, fisheries and tourism resources. Since 2002 when the economy contracted by -7.9 percent, it has improved significantly with estimated growth of 7.43 percent in 2006. Growth has been driven by foreign investment in tourism and land development, attracted by the liberal tax regime, relative political stability, sound macroeconomic management and successful institutional reforms.145 This situation was facilitated by the Comprehensive Reform Programme (CRP) that focused on good governance and came during a backdrop of political instability and low public confidence. The key features of the CPR were: renewal of the institutions of governance; a redefined role for the public sector; improved public sector efficiency, private sector- led growth (including small businesses and the rural sector) and; improved equity between sections of the population. However, it has been argued that growth is not improving the lives of most ni-Vanuatu. Vanuatu is one of six countries in the region that are \u201cslightly off track\u201d and/or demonstrate \u201cmixed progress\u201d towards the achievement of the MDGs (see figure 21). The government has made progress in reducing poverty, which dropped from 40 percent in 1998 to below 16 percent in 2008. Poverty in Vanuatu is defined in terms of lack of opportunity to access health and education services, the labour market and life opportunities.147 In Vanuatu poverty is concentrated in urban areas affecting 33 percent of people in Port Vila, the capital.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ead3ab5d-7d2a-47b5-ac79-4ca97bee88e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "ead3ab5d-7d2a-47b5-ac79-4ca97bee88e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c416153de66f01adcab3dc46bda421a12047cb9c26a39d68b00d2839b70c12f"}, "2": {"node_id": "657de5ed-a7c2-4e44-a763-ee772f8a0c56", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d078e4f94e4d3327e669fd4b0dba18163e05682f7c6277f6e39327c3917d5694"}}, "hash": "7b41ad5281e91a960eede3e9f436ff815c08db788d2827a583bb75ad9807fef3", "text": "Situation Analysis 10.00% 8.00% 6.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -2.00% -4.00% -6.00% -8.00% -10.00% Figure 20: Vanuatu GDPtftGrowth Rate from 1998 to 2009146 GDP Growth Rate *1998 *1999 *2000 *2001 *2002 *2003 *2004 *2005 *2006 *2007 *2008 *2009 With formal employment under 15% and a micro- business sector that is heavily overcrowded, most ni- Vanuatu have little opportunity to participate directly in the formal economy.

With Vanuatu\u2019s high rate of population growth, achievement of optimistic forecasts for economic expansion would imply a medium-term decline in per capita income, increased unemployment and underemployment, and little alleviation of hardship in rural areas.151 Vanuatu\u2019s political system has rarely been stable since independence, with governments falling through the use of no-confidence votes in the parliament on multiple occasions.152 There were no fewer than 16 changes of government in 13 years leading up to the 2004 election. This situation has not changed since with the current government having faced six votes of no-confidence. These intra-executive conflicts have led to considerable national instability. It has been argued that this has led to chronic short- termism that undermines any sustained approach to development.153 The formal accountability institutions \u2013 parliament, the Auditor General, the Ombudsman \u2013 have proved to be largely ineffective. Parliament currently has no role in developing legislation; it is only being asked to pass bills by the government. Whilst private members\u2019 bills can be advanced, there is no parliamentary legal counsel in place to draft legislation independently. The committee system is not functioning; the only two committees that meet regularly are Standing Orders and Privileges, dealing with internal matters. The Public Accounts Committee met only once, in 2003. Additionally, there is a high turnover of parliamentarians at each election and they receive little substantive research support. Since the government in the late 1990s reduced the Ombudsman\u2019s powers to bring action under the Leadership Code there have been concerns about lack of effectiveness in curbing abuses. The Public Prosecutor is a political appointee, and lacks the resources for the complex prosecutions required for corruption cases. The Auditor-General has not been active in recent years.154 By contrast, customary and informal institutions at local level are seen as legitimate and relevant to people\u2019s lives. However, their capacity to support community development is limited. Whilst the chiefs are seen as the \u2018back-up\u2019 of both the police commissioner and parliament on key issues, the primacy of elected institutions is somewhat unclear as a result.

Ultimately, the lack of capacity among state institutions in any case necessitates an ongoing reliance on traditional dispute resolution mechanisms. In recent years, significant law and order problems have emerged in Vanuatu. In 1988 there were riots, looting and destruction of businesses in Port Vila. In 1998 there were riots due to concerns surrounding the Vanuatu National Provident Fund. There was also confusion in command causing delays in response by the Vanuatu Mobile Force (VMF). In 2005 the Eric Wong Store, Air Vanuatu building and UNELCO power plant was held. The VMF was involved in a hostage rescue mission. In 2007, there were riots in Port Vila triggered by disputes between different sets of islanders and exacerbated by a growing young and unemployed population in the urban centres. Sixty percent of Vanuatu\u2019s population is under twenty- five years old. Because of the lack of employment opportunities in both rural and urban areas, young people are feeling disenfranchised. This is unlikely to lead to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "543bb312-85d1-472a-89a5-a87cab950798": {"__data__": {"id_": "543bb312-85d1-472a-89a5-a87cab950798", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "80b9df1aede781edcf6d26038e92dbe17fcdb9a8e48b94c015041a6f9dde3d8c"}}, "hash": "80b9df1aede781edcf6d26038e92dbe17fcdb9a8e48b94c015041a6f9dde3d8c", "text": "civil conflict but it has certainly contributed to worsening crime rates in recent years.155 Again, there were concerns of confusion in command between the Vanuatu Police Force (VPF) and the VMF, which caused a delay in response to the situation. Historically, there have also been problems with the security forces.156 The security forces abducted President Jean Marie Leye in 1996 during a dispute over salaries. While he was returned safely to the capital, almost half of the defence force was arrested and charged with kidnapping, carrying weapons and unlawful assembly,157 ultimately provoking riots in 1998.158 Secondly, during the political crisis of March- April 2001, it was alleged that the then prime minister approached the police to facilitate a coup but that the approach was rebuffed. Thirdly, in 2002, a group of young men from the island of Tanna were recruited initially as auxiliaries while the VMF conducted an operation to arrest a number of VMF officers on mutiny charges, however, they refused to disband.159 However, Vanuatu\u2019s security services have not played a significant political role in the last few years and during the 1990s the police and VMF also played a constructive role during constitutional crises, acting as a guarantor of constitutional process.160 Many stakeholders voiced a common sentiment about the current status of security governance in Vanuatu. They acknowledged a growing set of public security problems, that solutions are not immediately available to solve them and that new tools are needed to address them. Vanuatu faces key choices in how to develop, manage and control its security sector and stakeholders are currently receptive to guidance on implementing good practices in what is a crucial window of opportunity. At this juncture in Vanuatu\u2019s development, there is a strong case to develop the oversight roles and capacities of democratic institutions and civil society and to assist the security sector in focusing on its law enforcement role. Security Sector Governance Challenges Consequently, there are a number of key security sector governance challenges in Vanuatu: There is currently no comprehensive security policy in place. There is a concentration of considerable responsibilities in the hands of the police commissioner without requisite oversight by parliament. Vanuatu\u2019s participation in regional and international peacekeeping and stabilisation missions beyond their domestic riot control mandate is seen as raising Vanuatu\u2019s international profile. At the same time, the role of the Vanuatu Mobile Force in these missions poses management problems for the Vanuatu Police Force and questions concerning proper resource allocations when extensive domestic challenges need to be addressed. Parliament currently plays a very limited role in developing, debating and scrutinising legislation this is particularly acute in the security field. There is the need to professionalize and revitalize the current national security apparatus because there is currently a lack of analysis and reporting; Currently, the independent Police Service Commission does not have sufficient capacity to ensure police accountability and oversight. The level of civil society engagement on security sector oversight issues is currently at a low level. There is a lack of women in leadership positions, particularly in parliament and the public services. Opportunities Entry points exist with several sets of stakeholders on security sector oversight issues to improve the current level of security governance in Vanuatu. Government In 2009, the Ministry of Internal Affairs introduced a paper to the Council of Ministers on the future role of the Vanuatu Mobile Force. Discussions remain ongoing. The ministry is also in the process of reviewing the Police Act Cap 2.5 and other relevant national security legislation to identify gaps and draft relevant legislation. In October 2009, the Ministry of Internal Affairs held its first ever policy direction conference on security and good governance. From that conference, the security policy direction for 2010 \u2013 2020 was to create a National Security Council within the PM\u2019s Office in liaison with the minister of internal affairs, minister of justice, speaker of parliament and the president. Approval will be sought through the Council of Ministers for its establishment. Under this there was a key security policy priority to provide effective security and border control services throughout Vanuatu. This was supported by a number of key activities: Conduct legislative review, amendment and creation of new security legislation; Review the organisational and human resources management structure of the Vanuatu Police Force, immigration and passports: Create a new Ministry for Security, Border Control and Labour Services; Strengthen the capacity of the Police Service Commission; Conduct a scoping study on the cost-benefit analysis of whether Vanuatu should have a unified or separate police and VMF; Develop and implement a human security resource development plan; Conduct remote and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03bfceb0-6e51-4c7e-94c2-3bfe928e0355": {"__data__": {"id_": "03bfceb0-6e51-4c7e-94c2-3bfe928e0355", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f25071d4470946aeef7e956382ae4b9f9ff0f825a9d362a35f47e586e19061e"}}, "hash": "5f25071d4470946aeef7e956382ae4b9f9ff0f825a9d362a35f47e586e19061e", "text": "community police initiatives. In addition, there was a policy priority on good governance for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Security Forces to establish links with community CSOs, the Vanuatu Association of NGOs, and Chiefs and Churches to provide security to the people of Vanuatu where there is no police.161 The Ministry of Justice has undertaken a comprehensive review of Vanuatu\u2019s legislation to ensure access to justice and the upholding of fundamental freedoms and human rights. This takes the form of an extensive review of existing laws, the promulgation of new legislation and a comprehensive approach to managing the interaction of the formal and informal law systems. The ministry seeks to work constructively with CSOs and the parliament but plans remain at an early stage and linkages to the provision of public security by the VPF also need to be explored. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 142 143 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Vanuatu PART 2 These separate activities and stakeholder awareness provides an enabling environment to discuss the following: How will the proposed security policy be developed, implemented and coordinated, including the level of public consultation; What security legislation needs to be revised and updated; The most appropriate legislative frameworks and oversight mechanisms; The capacity building needs of civil servants to develop and coordinate security policy; and The capacity building needs of security personnel to implement the policy. Parliament As the parliament creates new committees in 2009, there will be the need to train MPs and committee secretariat staff to scrutinise legislation and budgets. With the ongoing discussions of the need for an overarching security policy, the future role of the VMF and the Ministry of Internal Affairs developing policy direction on security and good governance, discussions will need to take place on the appropriate role of parliament in scrutinising any new policy and legislation and monitoring its implementation. Civil Society Some NGOs have already been able to work with government ministries on policy issues, including violence against women, corruption, transparency and accountability, and others have scrutinised new legislation. The ongoing discussions about the role of the VPF and VMF would greatly benefit from insights by civil society organisations that work at the community level. In order to do this, support needs to be provided to improve their research, analysis and advocacy capacities. National Priorities During the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference, each country delegation was given a chance to discuss their key priorities. The Vanuatu delegation endorsed the opportunities identified by UNDP and PIFS and provided some additional comments: Introduce an SSG concept to key stakeholder groups and undertake media discussion awareness raising; Financial and technical assistance to hold a national conference on SSG to discuss possible action plans is needed; Conduct a national conference on SSG to develop a comprehensive national SSG strategy (held in October 2009). There is a need to look at the role of the police and VMF. What are Vanuatu\u2019s needs and what constitutes \u2018security\u2019 in Vanuatu? This process can benefit from the sharing of experiences, lessons learned and good practices from within and outside the region. There is a need to mobilize support for any designed SSG strategy, in order to create the political will necessary for its effective implementation. There is a need to implement a comprehensive national SSG strategy with a potential implementation date of 2010 \u2013 2015. There is a need to support ongoing capacity development for chiefs, churches, people in rural areas, counsellors, women and youth, as well as for training for SSG implementers. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 144 145 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Preamble Ministers, Members of Parliament, Ombudsmen, civil society representatives and security sector officials from Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu, where brought together in Nuku\u2019alofa, Kingdom of Tonga from 27 \u2013 30 April 2009 for the Pacific Regional Security Sector Governance Conference. The Conference was organized by UNDP in cooperation with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat to provide countries with an opportunity to discuss key Security Sector Governance priorities. The conference heard that the Pacific faces a complex set of interrelated development, security and governance challenges as addressed through the Honiara, Nasonini, Aitutaki and Biketawa Declarations of the Pacific Islands Forum. Further, it was recognised that Pacific Islands Forum Leaders have identified Security and Good Governance as two of the four pillars of the Pacific Plan adopted in 2005. Those pillars were developed from Pacific Islands Forum Leaders vision statement which collectively committed", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e1a7dd1-379f-4ad4-b1a0-7ba2c458b0f2": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e1a7dd1-379f-4ad4-b1a0-7ba2c458b0f2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c1737b874b07ae215b9049c9de602afdd0c25a88dd673c6d0abc355362e4fdb3"}}, "hash": "c1737b874b07ae215b9049c9de602afdd0c25a88dd673c6d0abc355362e4fdb3", "text": "the nations of the Pacific region to a set of principles to ensure the prosperity and stability of our region to the benefit of all its peoples. Fundamentally, security is essential to providing the necessary stable foundation for economic development which is the key to the people of the region being able to live what Pacific Leaders described as \u201cfree and worthwhile lives\u201d in their vision for a peaceful, harmonious, secure and prosperous region. In pursuing this vision, Leaders have sought partnerships within the region and beyond. This conference has been consistent with the spirit of the Leaders\u2019 vision in ensuring that international good practice and lessons learned are brought to the Pacific and that Pacific experiences can be shared at the global level. Presentations from country delegations highlighted that Human Security is a crucial issue in the Pacific region. Insecurity remains a recurrent theme affecting many communities. All the Pacific Islands face the common challenge of providing services to communities and access to public institutions, as well as finding solutions within financial and human resource constraints. Presentations from a wide range of international and Pacific experts in the field, gave national delegations a comprehensive understanding of international good practice and global norms on security sector governance. This provided a key opportunity for detailed exploration of the relevance and applicability for Pacific security sector governance programmes and the possibility of pursuing complementary regional activities. On this basis, the Co-Chairs recognise that in facing the complex security environment and challenges in the Pacific, international norms of security sector governance have some usefulness and relevance in the region. Nevertheless, it was important that national ownership be achieved and the diverse character of the Pacific be recognized. There could be no rigid models or \u201cone size fits all\u201d approaches and sensitivity and recognition of national circumstances needs to be exercised in approaching the issue. In partnership with executive, legislatures, judiciaries, accountability institutions and security forces, it was important to encourage and facilitate the development of well trained and skilled civil society bodies to monitor, advise and hold to account security sector institutions. Fundamentally, the protection of human rights must be recognized as underpinning collective and individual efforts to ensure effective security governance. Noting that security is different for men, women, boys and girls, security needs to be provided in a gender responsive way, in accordance with international obligations and with due regard given to existing national gender priorities. Annex 1: Regional Conference Co-Chairs\u2019 Outcome Statement The Co-Chairs would like to highlight the importance of external accountability and oversight mechanisms including an effective Parliament with adequate resources and capable and independent accountability institutions including Ombudsman, Leadership Code Commission, Human Rights Commission and Independent Commission against Corruption. The integrity and independence of officials engaged in such institutions needed to be supported and protected by all arms of government. Further, it is necessary to recognize the importance of security institutions having internal accountability mechanisms to ensure efficient and transparent delivery of security as a basic service to the population and to allow security institutions to retain public confidence and support for their vital work. The Co-Chairs also note the importance of strategic security policies being based on country needs and priorities, taking into consideration international good practice in the security sector governance field. Flexibility and appropriate scaling of possible solutions, reflecting the limited resources available to countries, are key in creating sustainable and credible outcomes. Executive Level Priorities Participating Ministers expressed their support for this conference and saw value in initiatives to improve Security Sector Governance. Ministers have undertaken to report back at Cabinet-level on the SSG Conference and saw value in adding Security Sector Governance to the agenda of the 2009 Forum Leaders\u2019 meeting. In addition, specific recommendations provided by the Ministers included: a) the development of a focal point to co-ordinate activities related to Security Sector Governance in the respective countries\u2019 Prime Ministers\u2019 office; b) the development of a national conference on Security Sector Governance supported by international partners including UNDP and PIFS; and c) raising the profile of security sector governance utilizing relevant regional mechanisms. This includes the Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) and the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police Meetings. Key Country Priorities National delegates facilitated by relevant international and regional resource people identified the following: Development of strategic security policies and strategies; Capacity-strengthening programmes for civil society; Provision of support to improve parliamentary oversight; Development of gender-sensitive policies and programmes; and Strengthening the capacity of Ombudsman institution to improve accountability of the Security Sector.

Conclusion Based on these identified priorities, development partners stand ready to support national actors and civil society to develop appropriate strategies to respond to priorities identified through regional assistance. Following the Regional Conference, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and UNDP proposes to jointly present a paper of the results of the scoping missions and outcomes of the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference at the FRSC. This is to enable full consideration by all Forum Member Countries on how PIFS, in cooperation with other key stakeholders and partners, such as UNDP can support the Security Sector Governance agenda in the region.

A number of investigations were conducted by the police following the 2000 coup: one of them involved the resignation of the then President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, on 29 May 2000 and the abrogation of the constitution by the Interim Military Government of Commodore Frank Bainimarama which took over. Police opened an investigation into whether Ratu Mara\u2019s resignation had been forced. There were also legal challenges to the actions taken by the military in assuming executive authority, removing the constitution and appointing an interim civilian government (Republic of Fiji vs. Prasad).

The HDI provides a composite measure of three dimensions of human development: living a long and healthy life (measured by life expectancy), being educated (measured by adult literacy and gross enrolment in education) and having a decent standard of living (measured by purchasing power parity, PPP, income). The Human Poverty Index (HPI-1) focuses on the proportion of people below certain threshold levels in each of the dimensions of the human development index - living a long and healthy life, having access to education, and a decent standard of living.

The HPI-1 measures severe deprivation in health by the proportion of people who are not expected to survive to age 40. Education is measured by the adult illiteracy rate. And a decent standard of living is measured by the unweighted average of people not using an improved water source and the proportion of children under age 5 who are underweight for their age.

DesInventar1 methodology.2 The RP has been established in response to the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, and is managed by the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok\u2019s Crisis Prevention and Recovery Team. DesInventar is based on a relational database structure and a disciplined expert assisted structure for data collection and classification that permits the homogeneous capture, analysis and graphic representation of information on disaster occurrences and losses. This report is divided into four sections: \u2022\ufffd The first section provides step-by-step guidelines for developing a disaster loss database, based on the RP\u2019s experience. \u2022\ufffd The second section identifies and documents the processes adopted in each of the tsunami affected countries during the implementation of the disaster loss database. \u2022\ufffd The third section discusses and draws key challenges, lessons and good practices from the implementation of disaster loss database in each of the tsunami affected countries. \u2022\ufffd The fourth section gives the background on UNDP and the RP, and discusses disaster loss databases in the context of disaster risk reduction (DRR). In the first section, two options are proposed for the implementation of disaster loss databases. The first option is its implementation within government. The second is a transitional option of implementation by a non-governmental organization endorsed by the government. The government- managed option is the preferred option but should only be selected when a number of essential conditions are in place relating to government\u2019s institutional arrangements and legislation. The second option involves the establishment of a disaster loss database \u2018outside\u2019 of government structures. Reasons for selecting the latter option could be that the government does not have policy frameworks in place 1 DesInventar is developed by the Network for Social Studies on Disaster Prevention in Latin America (LA RED) in late 1993 and used by more than 25 countries. 2 This report is not intended as an evaluation or review of the impact and effectiveness of these databases or the RP. to support the implementation and use of a disaster loss database and/or cannot see the full value in such an initiative. Both options follow five generic steps as follows: Step 1 \u2013 Create an enabling environment for disaster risk reduction Step 2 \u2013 Find an appropriate 'home' for the database Step 3 \u2013 Establish the disaster loss database within disaster risk reduction framework Step 4 \u2013 Collect, enter and validate data Step 5 \u2013 Conduct analysis, manage data and ensure sustainability In the second and third sections, key lessons learned from the implementation of the disaster loss database are identified for future UNDP operations beyond the tsunami affected countries. They include the type of environment required to enable successful deployment and institutionalization, and the various steps that need to be taken and issues to consider for start up, data collection, entry and validation, and ensuring sustainability. The findings from this review of database implementation concludes that disaster loss databases with validated data and inventories are essential for identifying and tracking patterns of disaster risk, and that they are a fundamental requirement for implementing efficient and effective DRR policies and programmes. From the RP experience, establishment of the disaster loss database has had mixed results as a consequence of a considerable number of both direct and indirect factors as follows: Direct Factors \u2022\ufffd Approach to implementation at the country level \u2022\ufffd Speed of which the RP was established \u2022\ufffd Recruitment and staffing issues (at the regional and country levels) Indirect Factors \u2022\ufffd Status of legislation to support disaster management \u2022\ufffd Capacity issues including those of national disaster management institutions 3 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY \u2022\ufffd Priorities of the host government and priorities of the UNDP Country Office (CO) \u2022\ufffd National ownership issues \u2022\ufffd Competing priorities for both the government and UNDP CO in response to tsunami recovery efforts (initially less importance was given to data collection) \u2022\ufffd Level of support for the establishment of enabling environments for DRR \u2022\ufffd Quality of analysis and subsequent perceived value of the database Until now both Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu are the most advanced in rolling-out the disaster loss databases, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ff302cd-bfe4-4a72-a483-2e4dcbf04596": {"__data__": {"id_": "6ff302cd-bfe4-4a72-a483-2e4dcbf04596", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ecf8a3a29b0bfc9ded061ad65cd5adbe7560d059a8524078b67874b31931d43f"}}, "hash": "ecf8a3a29b0bfc9ded061ad65cd5adbe7560d059a8524078b67874b31931d43f", "text": "the best lessons can be gathered from both these cases. In short, both countries have recordings of disaster events for the past 30 years available online, and the databases are institutionalized in relevant government offices, with commitment from government to continue collecting and validating data, and using the database for risk analysis. In Sri Lanka, the disaster loss database was used by the Disaster Management Centre to develop the National Disaster Management Plan. In India, requests from neighbouring states (Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Pondicherry) for support in the implementation of disaster loss databases are testimonies to its relevance and usefulness. In fact, a number of other states in India have developed or are developing disaster loss databases using the DesInventar platform including Orissa, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. Detailed description of the implementation process in Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu is available in Annexes II and III, respectively. Important lessons and experiences are also available from the implementation in Indonesia, Maldives and Thailand. All of these countries are at very different stages of implementation. In Indonesia, the database was launched in July 2008 but has been rapidly adopted and is being used for guiding the ongoing process of developing a National Disaster Risk Management Plan and for monitoring the impact of crisis to poverty at the community level. In Maldives, progress has been slow due to institutional restructuring, high staff turnover, and inadequacy in staff capacity. In Thailand, the Department of Disaster Mitigation and Prevention that \u2018houses\u2019 the disaster loss database is also developing a GIS/MIS system, similar to DesInventar, for capturing information about disasters and losses, thus slowing progress. The development of an interface between DesInventar and other systems to be able to import and export data is currently being considered. While the ultimate goal, beyond a professionally populated database and clear analysis, is the full institutionalization of the system that enables government decision makers to plan, prepare and mitigate future disasters, the single major lesson learned so far is that implementation started too late in the tsunami affected countries. As the attention of the countries was focused on immediate priorities (safe grounds, evacuation routes, etc.) after the tsunami disaster, this meant that respective governments were not in a position to optimize the use of loss data for disaster recovery, mitigation and preparedness, in the aftermath. Only recently is there a growing understanding of the importance of DRR and of disaster loss databases as a necessary component for effective DRR. The key lessons learned from the RP experience in implementing disaster loss databases are listed below. These lessons have been derived from review of related documentations, discussions with technical specialist concerned, and from various missions to the tsunami affected countries. 1. Disaster loss databases must be developed as an integral part of DRR initiatives. In the absence of a nationwide risk assessment in these countries, the database is a central tool for governments to better understand the disasters and threats in order to effectively mitigate and prepare for them. 2. An enabling environment makes the system work. The enabling environment that needs to be created is one under which government ownership and understanding of DRR initiatives is clear, and the link between these initiatives and the need for validated data to be able to plan and mitigate future disasters is in place. Where necessary, UNDP support should focus on strengthening government systems and capacity where DRR capacities are either not in place or inadequate. 3. Recognize the need for advanced planning, assessment and appropriateness with regards to identifying counterpart nodal agencies and human resources at regional and country levels. They are key determinants of the successful implementation of disaster loss databases. Implementation outside of the government system should only be considered as a last option. 4. The process of disaster loss database implementation needs to be participatory and inclusive, involving governments and other partners to promote government ownership of the system and its institutionalization. 5. Government must own the database from the outset and be self-driven to produce the analysis to assist it with planning and management. 6. Build on corporate investment made in developing expertise in the implementation of disaster loss databases and utilization of the DesInventar methodology, for the benefit of effective DRR. Support from the RP has played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the 4 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases disaster loss databases and continued support has been deemed necessary. 7.

The data collection process must be structured and have cross checks within it. Data records should be from \u2018agreed and accepted\u2019 sources and must be kept and easily accessible. Data collection staff must be trained to understand disaster terminology and the use of the data, and know exactly how to collect it. 9. Division of duties, clear documentation, strict quality assurance and complete records of documentation (data card and photocopy or digital copy of the source of data) kept on file are essential for data validation. 10. Analysis must be professional, clear, understandable and relevant to the target audience. Different levels of analyses should be prepared depending on the audience of the analysis. But in general, they should comprise quantitative and qualitative information that is user- friendly and supports the decision-making process. 11. Ongoing training and professional development for staff and counterparts are essential for effective and coordinated processes towards successful implementation of the disaster loss database and DRR. UNDP should support capacity development efforts for staff, government counterparts and implementing partners through technical advice, specialist training and re-training. 12. Multi-skilling of the personnel involved adds greater depth to the quality of the outputs, which require knowledge of several disciplines. As such, a team effort is essential to bring together an all-round interpretation and profile of the data collected. 13. Without customization, databases could be a wasted investment. There is a need to provide support in customizing the database to meet the needs of the government, and to ensure that it complements existing government systems and requirements, so that at the end of the day it is actually used. 14. Locally customized manuals need to be developed with the target group in mind. 15. More effort needs to be placed in advocating for the importance of disaster loss databases. UNDP support should assist in providing government with a better understanding of the use and benefits of a disaster loss database for DRR policy development, planning and programming. The RP has developed substantial in-house expertise since its establishment in 2005, contributing significantly to UNDP\u2019s decade-long experience in DRR and seven years of experience in implementing disaster loss databases in Asia. This expertise includes not only the physical development of disaster loss databases, but also the creation of an enabling environment required to manage disasters, the detailed technical knowledge of the system and experience in its customization. This report is primarily intended for UNDP COs trying to assist the governments in identifying and reducing disaster risks, but others trying to establish databases would also find it useful. In the fourth section, the RP\u2019s efforts in implementing disaster loss databases as part of a broader mandate in DRR are documented. 5 Introduction The Indian Ocean tsunami disaster of 26 December 2004 was one of the most devastating natural disasters in history. Within a matter of minutes, approximately 200,000 lives were lost, populations were displaced, and livelihoods, homes and infrastructure were ruined. A massive humanitarian response focusing on both relief and reconstruction was undertaken. UNDP through its Country Offices (COs) supported both national and local authorities by providing humanitarian and recovery assistance to the affected population. At the regional level in Asia, the UNDP Regional Programme on Capacity Building for Sustainable Recovery and Risk Reduction (RP) was conceptualized in response to the 2004 tsunami to support UNDP COs efforts. Strategies are focused on strengthening capacities of tsunami affected countries in disaster risk reduction (DRR), and are in line with the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA). Risk identification is one of the five priority areas of the Hyogo Framework for Action: The starting point for reducing disaster risk and for promoting a culture of disaster resilience lies in the knowledge of the hazards and the physical, social, economic and environmental vulnerabilities to disasters that most societies face, and of the ways in which hazards and vulnerabilities are changing in the short and long term, followed by action taken on the basis of that knowledge.3 In addressing this priority, one of RP\u2019s strategies is to enhance institutional systems for building risk knowledge through the development of disaster loss databases. At the core of any risk knowledge efforts is the need for reliable and easily accessible data on hazards, vulnerabilities and risks. Disaster loss databases provides for systematic collection of relevant data, and their validation and sharing, for the historical analysis and potential future disasters based on past evidences. 1.1 Disaster Loss Databases UNDP through BCPR has been making significant efforts in analysing losses due to natural disasters.

Similarly, the Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) maintains a global database4 of natural disasters that provides useful information and analyses on various parameters of past disaster events. Munich Re also maintains a database \u2018NatCatSERVICE\u20195 for natural catastrophes. The database allows analysis of regional and global hazards as well as trends. While these databases provide very useful information about regional and global losses and hazard trends, they provide little information on the occurrence and impacts of natural disasters at subnational levels for national governments to better understand the past and potential risks faced in different parts of the country. A nationally-owned disaster loss database built using the data collected and validated by national and subnational agencies provides useful information to key stakeholders in a country to better analyse the disaster trends and impacts, allowing policy makers and planners to make informed decisions. 1.2 DesInventar DesInventar6 is based on a relational database structure and a disciplined expert assisted structure for data collection and classification that permits the homogeneous capture, analysis and graphic representation of information on disaster occurrences and losses. DesInventar was created by the Network of Social Studies on Disaster Prevention in Latin America (LA Red) in 1994. Over the past 15 years, the DesInventar database and methodology have further developed and been customized to meet the emerging needs of countries, and is now being used in more than 25 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In Asia, seven countries\u2013India, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, Iran, Sri Lanka and Thailand \u2013 have adopted the DesInventar methodology. The database software is able to generate reports, charts and maps based on the information that has been entered 4 http://www.em-dat.net. 5 http://www.munichre.com/en/ts/geo_risks/natcatservice/default.apx. 6 For further details on DesInventar see http://undp.desinventar.net. 1 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases 6 into the database. The database is very flexible and in Asia the DesInventar software has been customized to meet the needs of the different countries, including the use of local languages, disaster types and non-disaster categories. The successful customization has played a vital role in developing a sustainable system and initiative. The RP has built on UNDP\u2019s experience in assisting countries develop disaster loss databases since 2002, and the use of the DesInventar methodology since 2005 in advocating and implementing the disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries. The focus of the RP is in the five tsunami affected countries in Asia \u2013 India, Indonesia, Maldives Sri Lanka and Thailand \u2013 but by request, support has also been extended to other countries, and a number of regional activities have included the participation of non-tsunami- affected countries. 1.3 About this Report This report documents the RP\u2019s efforts in implementing disaster loss databases using the DesInventar methodology, and captures the lessons learned and good practices that can be applied by other countries. To adequately document the key lessons and practices, a study was commissioned involving the review of relevant documentation and missions to the target countries. The analysis and information presented in this report are based on the information collected during 2008. Two workshops were also organized. The first workshop in May 2008 focused on the process and formulation of the documentation required to draw out the key lessons learned, and the second workshop in September 2008 aimed to finalize and develop consensus on the lessons for the benefit of future programmes in the \u2018non-tsunami\u2019 countries. Based on these lessons, a step-by-step guide for disaster loss database implementation was also developed.

Project managers could also look at either the delayed implementation of the database, or endorse the second option to initially run the database independently of government, but with the medium-term goal of fully integrating the database into a government system. The second option involves the establishment of a disaster loss database \u2018outside\u2019 of government structures. Justification for doing this may include that fact that the government cannot at the time meet the conditions required for implementation (e.g. the government does not have policy frameworks in place to support the implementation and use of a disaster loss database and/or cannot see the full value in such an initiative). The second option must have the approval of government and be designed in such a way that through capacity building and skills transfer it has every opportunity of eventually becoming part of the government structure. The ownership and management of the data collected should of course remain in government hands. The key issues and conditionality for the establishment of the database system are described in Section 4 of this document.

Initial work and support from UNDP or other agencies should focus on assistance needed by the government in developing appropriate policies, laws, regulations, structures and capacities for the disaster loss database system to be implemented effectively. Support for such activities should not be stand alone but should be part of a wider DRR initiative. Advocacy for DRR and the need for historical disaster loss data should be at the forefront of this step. Step 2: Finding an appropriate \u2018home\u2019 for the database It is imperative to ensure that the database is located in the appropriate nodal agency (usually the disaster management agency/centre or possibly the department dealing with statistics) so that a quick start up of operations is feasible. This step also means that the government will take ownership of this initiative. While the UNDP CO is best placed to describe the local political context and level of government support, where necessary, advisors in regional offices can assist the UNDP CO with in-country assessments of government structures and capacity with regards to disaster management. The UNDP CO also needs to ensure that the government fully \u2018buys in\u2019 to the importance of data and inventories on disasters to better identify and track", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8f89cd0-d9ee-446c-b668-b8889d37905d": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8f89cd0-d9ee-446c-b668-b8889d37905d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c3faa43970ac0c176b58b10bfc24ea89ab9db4117de1f52ba72ace562bc07ea9"}}, "hash": "c3faa43970ac0c176b58b10bfc24ea89ab9db4117de1f52ba72ace562bc07ea9", "text": "patterns of disaster risk and effectively manage and respond to disasters. Government ownership can be expected through cost sharing and/or allocation of full-time staff to support the implementation and the long-term maintenance of the database. Step 3: Establishing the disaster loss database This involves the selection of the type of database and the physical Implementation of the database and will involve the following: \u2022\ufffd An assessment of local conditions, existing databases and special requirements with regards to customization options that needs to be undertaken with the government. Based on this assessment the software fields will be customized with support from UNDP (or other agencies) and the Disaster Inventories Associate (employed to set up and maintain the disaster loss database), with preference being given to the use or adaption of existing government systems. \u2022\ufffd Procurement of equipment will then be required followed by the recruitment of staff (either by UNDP or partner) and the training of staff by UNDP or appropriate specialists. Step 4: Data collection, entry and validation This step involves the actual data collection and validation/ verification process with the government. Prior to data collection, the government needs to identify sources of relevant and reliable data that will be collected and inputted in the database. Personnel involved in collecting the data also need to be cleared with the government. Once verification and data sources are agreed upon, UNDP and the government will embark on the data collection and verification processes as described in Section 4 and the Annexes of this report. As mentioned in Section 4, the separation of the historical data collection and ongoing data collection should be considered. Step 5: Data analysis, data management and sustainability This step should be approached with the utmost caution \u2013 if not well managed it can result in delays in the institutionalization process and even possibly the discrediting of the database itself. Managed well, this will be the foundation for the institutionalization and long-term sustainability of the disaster loss database. The quality and completeness of the data are critical to the usefulness of the database system. The analysis must also present information that is relevant and can be used by governments to make decisions. While the successful analysis and use of the analysis by the government and partners of the government will signal the initiation of the exit strategy for UNDP support, it is desirable that UNDP offers to maintain ongoing quality assurance and training support to these important facilities. As the database is part of a wider DRR initiative in the country, the analysis and findings should feedback into the umbrella DRR programme and be used to guide DRR activities of the UNDP CO and host government. 9 DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE Option 2 \u2013 Non-Governmental Implementation This second option for implementation could include NGOs, research centres, academic institutions or even UN agencies, but essentially it should be considered an interim option/ solution with the medium-term goal of institutionalization within government structures. This option involves the following steps/considerations: Step 1: Creating an enabling environment for DRR Where supporting policies, laws, regulations and DRR structures are very limited or not in place, an assessment and identification of these gaps needs to be undertaken. Based on this assessment, initial interventions and support from UNDP should focus on putting in place appropriate legal and institutional arrangements for DRR, and strengthening capacities of the future long-term \u2018home\u2019 of the disaster loss database. Support for such activities should not be stand alone but should be part of a wider DRR initiative. Advocacy for DRR and the need for historical disaster loss data should be at the forefront of this step. Step 2: Establishing an appropriate \u2018temporary home\u2019 for the database It is crucial to ensure correct positioning of the database in the appropriate NGO, and that a quick start up of operations is feasible. It is very important that the quality and respectability of the non-government implementing partner be high, as without this, the handover in the medium term to the government may be difficult, and the database and analysis and even personnel from it may not be accepted by the government. The UNDP CO is well placed to describe the local political context and level of government support towards the proposed implementing partner, and based on this, a decision should be made as to the medium- and long- term implications and sustainability of this using a non- government implementing partner. Advisors in regional offices can assist the UNDP CO with the assessment of implementing partners and their DM capacity.

Step 3: Establishment of the disaster loss database This step involves the selection of the type of database and the physical Implementation of the database and will involve the following: \u2022\ufffd An assessment of local conditions, existing databases and special requirements with regards to customization that needs to be undertaken (and while this option is being implemented outside of government, relevant government stakeholders should still be consulted in this process). Based on this assessment, the software fields will be customized with support from UNDP (or other agencies) and the Disaster Inventories Associate. \u2022\ufffd Procurement of equipment will then be required followed by the recruitment of staff (either by UNDP or partners) and the training of staff by UNDP or appropriate specialists. Step 4: Data collection, entry and validation The data collection and validation/verification process should be confirmed with the relevant government agencies before data collection is initiated. Ideally, the government should confirm the sources of data that are considered appropriate for the database. Personnel involved in collecting the data also need to be confirmed with the government. If government agreement on these issues is not possible, endorsement should be obtained by a credible and neutral agency such as UNDP. Once verification and data sources are agreed on, UNDP and the implementing partner will embark on the data collection and validation processes as described in Section 4. Separation of the historical data collection and ongoing data collection should be considered and this may in fact be the basis for selecting this second option (to operate outside of government). For this second option, it is vital that the processes involved in this step are endorsed by the relevant government agencies as they will be the end users of the database and information generated from the database. The quality and completeness of the data are crucial and important prerequisite to the successful implementation of step 5. Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases 10 Step 5: Data analysis, data management and sustainability This step should be approached with total professionalism using internationally acceptable standards, and it should be managed in such a way so as not to result in delays and the discrediting of the database. Implemented effectively with verified data, this will be the foundation for the eventual institutionalization and long-term sustainability of the disaster loss database. The analysis should provide information that is relevant and can be used by governments to make decisions. Upon the successful analysis and use of the analysis by the government, acceleration of the institutionalization process of the system can be expected. It also signals the initiation of an exit strategy for UNDP or other supporting agencies. However, the provision of ongoing technical quality assurance monitoring, general technical support and training should be considered. As the database is part of a wider DRR initiative in the country, the analysis and findings should feedback into the umbrella DRR programme and used to guide DRR activities of the UNDP CO and host government. 11 This section describes the process of setting up and institutionalizing disaster loss databases in five target countries of the RP \u2013 India (in Tamil Nadu State), Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The process involves not only the physical set up and customization of the databases, but also the creation of an enabling environment for DRR, within which disaster loss databases are used to generate analyses for making informed decisions. Challenges faced, factors that influence the success and failure of the implementation, and lessons learned from the process are documented below by country. Section 4 reviews the experiences in the countries, and presents some key lessons and good practices that can be applied in other countries that are planning to set up disaster loss databases.

The counterpart government department at the state level responsible for DRR is the Revenue Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu (GoTN). At the district level it is the district magistrate office, and at the subdistrict level the subdistrict office. Other government agencies closely involved in the implementation of the disaster loss database include the Fire Department, Meteorological Department, Geology and Mining Department, and Forestry Department. The online database and website is hosted by the GoTN and is physically located in the premises of the State National Informatics Centre (NIC) located in Chennai. UNDP has strategically positioned itself directly with the Joint Commissioner (JC) for Disaster Management and Mitigation (DMM) (see Figure 3).

BNPB replaces BAKORNAS PB (National Coordinating Agency for Disaster Management) to provide DRR guidance and support to line ministries, provinces and districts. BNPB will have counterpart agencies at the provincial and district levels in the near future to enhance coordination and cooperation. The organigramme below shows the government structure in which the database sits (showing location support from UNDP). Figure 5: District Level Meeting in Tamil Nadu 15 DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN TSUNAMI AFFECTED COUNTRIES Figure 6: Organigramme for DRR in Indonesia Figure 7: Screenshot of DiBi The first attempt at the implementing the database was met with a number of difficulties, the most difficult one being that the government DRR framework was being restructured and development of a disaster loss database was not considered a priority for the government. In the absence of required support and guidance from the government due to evolution of new institutional and legal frameworks, the Indonesian database was populated with data from the media and the Internet that were not validated by the government. The database was until very recently hosted by the UNDP CO in Jakarta and data was collected by a Disaster Inventories Associate working from the Jakarta office. Very limited customization was initially offered to the government, and as a result, the government perceived this to be a UNDP initiative/database and not a government one. With the establishment of BNPB and the conceptualization of the multi-year Safer Communities Through Disaster Risk Reduction in Development Programme as part of the Joint UN Strategic Plan on Disaster Reduction for Sustainable Development, the implementation of the database picked up pace. By mid\u20132008 the situation in Indonesia is very different from when the database system was first established.

BNPB has also been leading the process of collecting and validating disaster data through the Communications Forum that meets regularly to discuss, consult and decide on issues related with DiBi. At the same time, BNPB has been organizing a series of training and socialization events on DiBi. The database is now being used for guiding the ongoing process of developing a national DRR plan and for monitoring the impact of crisis to poverty at the community level. Figure 8: Launch of DiBi on 29 July 2008 by Head of BNPB Lessons Learned A number of important lessons have been learnt with regards to how the first phase of implementation was done and the implications of the approach that was undertaken. These include the following: \u2022\ufffd Assurance of government ownership must be of the highest priority \u2022\ufffd Socialization and understanding of the database by government counterpart is of great importance \u2022\ufffd Government structures, policies and legislation should be in place to create an enabling environment for implementation \u2022\ufffd Sustainability is dependent on government ownership and at least initially, perceived need, use and value of the database \u2022\ufffd Housing the database within the UNDP CO can make it difficult for the government to take ownership and for the activities to be seen as anything more than just a UNDP activity for UNDP. It can however, support and promote continuity in the long term when the government is ready to take on the database \u2022\ufffd Use of non-government validated data will be questioned when analysis is done and when the database is handed over to the government. Repopulation of the database with government validated data may be required \u2022\ufffd Limited flexibility in the customization of the database to meet government needs should be avoided and the UNDP CO must be as flexible as possible The transition during mid\u20132008 that led to government ownership of the database was a result of: \u2022\ufffd The introduction of the Indonesia Disaster Management Law and the creation of BNPB \u2022\ufffd The renewed understanding from UNDP CO on the importance of data and inventories of disasters as being vital to identifying and tracking patterns of disaster risk \u2022\ufffd Sustained advocacy efforts by both the RP and UNDP CO over a long period to get the government to own and build the database \u2022\ufffd The understanding from the government that a disaster loss database is a fundamental requirement for implementing efficient and effective DRR programmes and policies, and for enabling the government to plan and make decisions based on a full understanding of the impacts of disasters \u2022\ufffd The flexibility from the UNDP CO in the customization of the database to meet government needs 3.3 Maldives Name of the database: DesInventar URL of the database: http://www.ndmc.gov.mv http://localhost:8081/DesInventar/ Source(s) of data: Government records, websites and newspapers Period of data: 1978\u20132006 Host agency: National Disaster Management Centre Staff: 2 junior government staff Data collection: Collected at national, atoll and island level (ongoing) Data entry: Based on customized paper- based data cards Data validation: Validated by government, data cards checked against government records Analysis: N/A 17 DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN TSUNAMI AFFECTED COUNTRIES The Ministry of Planning and National Development (MPND) was initially the host agency of the disaster loss database before it moved to the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC). The reason for it being, MPND was the focal agency for data and information management during the 2004 tsunami emergency. Additionally, the ministry had the in-house capacity for data management. Immediately after the tsunami and prior to the establishment of the RP, UNDP supported the initial establishment of the disaster loss database to record loss from the tsunami. During that time, the database was extensively used by the government and donors, and was considered the best reference material on disaster loss from the tsunami. As the focus moved towards recovery and reconstruction, attention to the collection and entry of loss data gradually dwindled down. This resulted in diminished support for the database and its updating. A year after the 2004 tsunami, the NDMC was established under the Ministry of Defence and National Security. It was declared as the nodal agency for disaster management and risk reduction through a Presidential Directive No. 2006/17. The creation of the NDMC is part the national government\u2019s effort to strengthen the DRR capacity of institutions. Over the past two years since NDMC took responsibility for management and maintaining the DesInventar, a number of modifications have been made as part of the customization", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3433fa1c-ca49-4a7d-ac51-d1e752a0dfb0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3433fa1c-ca49-4a7d-ac51-d1e752a0dfb0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "848a6c3b99716371e027b77fe703085c0b79aa1336a5ee57f3e4346a12b721ce"}}, "hash": "848a6c3b99716371e027b77fe703085c0b79aa1336a5ee57f3e4346a12b721ce", "text": "of the database, making it more country specific and attractive to the government. Concerns Great challenges were faced in locating the sources of historical information as official government records were very limited. Initially the MPND organized a stakeholders meeting in May 2006 to identify potential sources of data from different ministries and departments, however the physical collection of data has been very difficult. Data has been sourced from selective government departments and local media. As the Maldives has only Figure 9: Map of Maldives Figure 10: Aerial Shot of an Island in the Maldives 18 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases one state-owned local newspaper, the media source is considered to be reliable and mirroring government records. Staffing to support implementation of the database has also been a challenge. The turnover of staff has been very high while the capacity of the staff recruited has been at a lower level compared with other target countries of the RP. The high turnover of staff has had a negative impact on the collection of data and the general implementation and support of the disaster loss database. Lessons Learned A number of lessons and challenges have been learnt from the implementation in the Maldives and these include: \u2022\ufffd Ownership and administration challenges \u2013 Greater ownership from the government counterpart is required with further allocation of government staff and the release of staff to travel to the different atolls. As limited records are available on historical data the best way to collect information is to visit the different atolls, and this process is very time consuming and expensive. \u2022\ufffd Technical challenges \u2013 These include mapping issues (because of the geographical spread of the islands), and thematic analysis also due to the geographic nature of the Maldives, as well as the local customization. \u2022\ufffd Staffing challenges \u2013 Staffing as mentioned above has been a challenge in Maldives and it has been difficult for UNDP to attract appropriate staff to this initiative. When staff members were recruited it has been difficult to retain them. To date the majority of work in country has been done by one staff member, who decided not to extend his contract after July 2008. This rendered the position for Disaster Inventories Associate once again vacant. In the meantime, the government has deputed its 2 junior staff to carry forward the work on disaster data collection and entry. \u2022\ufffd Institutional challenges \u2013 Socialization within government has been limited and this has resulted in limited communications between relevant government departments and the NDMC to ensure the data available is collected. The absence of a focal point in most of the government ministries and departments further posed limitations on effective and timely coordination. Strengths \u2022\ufffd Positive relationship with government counterpart (NDMC) \u2022\ufffd Strong Support from UNDP CO and the RP \u2022\ufffd Increased visibility for UNDP and strengthened role in disaster-related activities Overall, the status of progress in the Maldives is best described as moving forward and ongoing. To date much has been achieved, but much still remains to be done. Hopefully, with the quick recruitment of new staff and training of the staff, the process can start moving forward at a faster pace. NDMC has a new staff recruited to assist in data management. The government staff members have been coached by the Disaster Inventories Associate on data uploading and some basics of the DesInventar system. 3.4 Sri Lanka Name of the database: Sri Lanka Disaster Information System URL of the database: http://www.desinventar.lk Source(s) of data: Print media, government, NGO and research organizations Period of data: 1974\u20132008 (and ongoing) Host agency: Disaster Management Centre under the leadership of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights Staff: 1 Disaster Inventories Associate, research and data entry staff as and when needed.

The initial UNDP support to a disaster loss database in Sri Lanka started prior to the 2004 tsunami and although it was not implemented before the tsunami struck, the methodology and socialization process was well under way. The Sri Lanka Disaster Information System was used by the government to provide information and reports on damages to infrastructure during the early months after the tsunami. With the enactment of the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act No.13 in May 2005, the National Council for Disaster Management (NCDM) was established as the highest authority responsible for the management of disasters. This was followed by the establishment of the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) to function directly under the NCDM. Thereafter, a separate Ministry responsible for Disaster Management and Human Rights (M/DM&HR) was formed. Presently, the DMC is functioning under the Ministry and is the main authority for disaster management activities covering the whole of Sri Lanka under the guidance of the NCDM and the M/DM&HR. The implementation of disaster loss database in Sri Lanka has been guided and supported by the DMC since the beginning. The UNDP Disaster Inventories Associate is based and works within the DMC. The organigramme below illustrates the government structure in which the database sits (showing location within government, administrative agencies at the national, provincial and district levels, as well external support from UNDP and UNV). 20 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Data was collected from different government organization, as was identified by the DMC, including the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, Department of Wildlife Conservation, National Building Research Organization, and other government organizations including two government newspapers. All data entry was done at the DMC, and detailed quality control mechanisms were put in place and data was validated. Lessons Learned and Challenges A number of key lessons and challenges can be drawn from the Sri Lanka case. \u2022\ufffd It is critical to understand the legal capacity, status as well as the organizational structure of government organizations relevant to disaster management. Awareness of present database systems in operation is also important. \u2022\ufffd There needs to be clarity and a common understanding among stakeholders on the type of data to be collected, the source of these data, and the forms in which the data exist. The data must suit the country context, and their accuracy, reliability and acceptability by the government must be established. \u2022\ufffd Customization of the software to the local context will assist in the institutionalization process. \u2022\ufffd Sufficient attention must be paid to capacity issues and capacity development requirements within the host agency.

Like all implementing countries under the RP, a number of challenges were faced as detailed above, but Sri Lanka has so far progressed well with regards to institutionalization, analysis and sustainability. With government support, a number of events, training sessions and data collection were swiftly undertaken. Initial technical issues were quickly resolved, especially with support from the RP.

According to the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2007, DDPM is the secretariat of the National Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Committee and is by law tasked to coordinate with other government agencies, local administrations and NGOs to manage DRR, including recovery activities. This makes DDPM an appropriate location for the disaster loss database. 22 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases In the initial stages of the disaster loss database implementation, DDPM established a multi-ministerial taskforce for overseeing the initiative. At the first taskforce meeting, several recommendations were made to guide the implementation process. The DDPM made available its server for installation of the online version of DesInventar that was used by the Disaster Inventories Associate. The database was then customized to adapt to local conditions and now has both an English and Thai interface, as well as other country specific customization. A number of formal and informal meetings were held with DDPM officials, however, no data was made available to the Associate to proceed further. To demonstrate the analytical abilities of DesInventar, data from the 2006 floods was entered into DesInventar. DDPM has an existing in-house database system to record disaster inventories. This system is online and is used as part of their routine work. In late 2007, the DDPM introduced an online GIS/MIS system with abilities to capture information about disasters and losses. This system, developed by a Thai university is similar to DesInventar, and is used for recording natural disaster impacts, road accidents and details of chemical risks. DDPM is, however, still very interested in DesInventar and wish to link it with the GIS/MIS system so that reports and analysis can be provided in English as well as in a format that will be easier to share with other countries. Thailand is a pilot country for regional ASEAN activities and as such will need to have information in English. The DesInventar system will be able to fulfil this function. However, it is a second priority until the in-house Thai GIS/MIS system is fully established.

Lessons Learned A number of key challenges and lessons can be drawn from the implementation to date in Thailand. \u2022\ufffd It is essential for all stakeholders to have a clear understanding of DRR and the DesInventar methodology. \u2022\ufffd The importance of historical data for disaster management has to be developed and accepted within participating government agencies prior to the implementation of DesInventar. \u2022\ufffd In cases where a database system already exists, it is important to build and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2847939a-7959-48ed-9a13-1a6dc577d2e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2847939a-7959-48ed-9a13-1a6dc577d2e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7ed36bef4f09170c0fd8d525b340b35279fd636f05c263ff5c30f1f87c26f085"}}, "hash": "7ed36bef4f09170c0fd8d525b340b35279fd636f05c263ff5c30f1f87c26f085", "text": "improve on the existing system rather than impose a new system. \u2022\ufffd It is crucial that systems developed are open and interoperable to allow for easy exchange of data and information between the different systems. \u2022\ufffd For new institutions such as DDPM, it will take time to develop authority and influence. \u2022\ufffd Host agency of the database system finds coordination with other government agencies in data collection complex and challenging. Capacity of the host agency needs to be strengthened to promote cooperation and coordination, improve communication, facilitate participatory processes and multi-stakeholder dialogue, and resolve conflict. \u2022\ufffd It is very important for the UNDP CO to continue to provide support and work closely with the counterpart government department to ensure that all issues are addressed and implementation is undertaken smoothly by addressing all issues. Strengths \u2022\ufffd As an emerging donor, it is important to note that Thailand did not request for financial support in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, but did accept technical support for tsunami recovery-related activities. The recent status of Thailand as a donor has created some issues with the support that could formally be requested by the DDPM to support this initiative. \u2022\ufffd Government structures within Thailand are well defined and have strong capacity. With the enactment of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Act of 2007, they became even better defined. The DDPM is clearly mandated under the law to house such a database and support from them has been strong and positive. \u2022\ufffd Customization was undertaken in Thailand and it is believed that this has resulted in the maintained interest from DDPM as the system has become a \u2018Thai\u2019 system and not a foreign one. The flexibility to adapt and customize the database in Thailand has been one of the strong assets. Overall, the progress in Thailand, especially related to the institutionalization and customization aspects, has been successful. However, with development of a parallel GIS/ MIS system, the next stage of DesInventar implementation will have to wait until the GIS/MIS system is fully installed. In the mean time, the finalization of the interface function could be proceeded with. Figure 15: Meeting with DDPM Officials chaired by Deputy Director-General 23 The subsections below detail areas of importance drawn from the experiences of disaster loss database implementation in the tsunami affect countries. These key lessons learned have been identified by UNDP and government staff members that have been working with the RP. 4.1 Nodal Agency / Implementing Partners The selection and capacity of the Nodal Agency/ Implementing Partner is crucial to the successful implementation and sustainability of the disaster loss databases. The agency/partner should be mandated as the lead disaster management authority in the country. In both Indonesia and the Maldives, there were changes to the responsible agencies/partners due to institutional restructuring during the set up of the disaster loss databases. In both countries, the 2004 tsunami led to a review of policies and institutional frameworks by the respective governments, which resulted in establishment of new legislations and institutions for DRR. These changes did impact the implementation adversely and caused delays, but these are positive changes that helped to find a \u2018home\u2019 for the disaster loss database in the countries. Continuous engagement with the countries have helped to move forward and make progress that otherwise would not have been possible to achieve in the highly dynamic post-tsunami environment. Key Lesson: Recognize the need for advanced planning, assessment and appropriateness with regards to identifying counterpart nodal agencies and human resources at regional and country levels. They are key determinants of the successful implementation of disaster loss databases. Implementation outside of the government system should only be considered as a last option. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd An assessment of the proposed implementing partner with respect to its mandated functions and linkages with sources of reliable disaster data is essential to determine its ability as a potential host. An informal capacity assessment identifying strengths and weaknesses of the selected implementing partner, and its ability to perform the required functions for collection and hosting of the database should be undertaken. The project work plan should address the strengths and weaknesses of the implementing partner. \u2022\ufffd The implementing partner should be part of the government system and has the authority needed to be able to collect and validate data, disseminate the analysis, and ensure effective management and use of the data analysis. \u2022\ufffd Institutionalization should occur when the full benefits of the system are realized, customized to government needs, and ideally, integrated with other systems that are already in place and/or adapted to also include information outside the traditional fields of a disaster", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eee2ccf6-110a-477f-9fab-49cb4129f42f": {"__data__": {"id_": "eee2ccf6-110a-477f-9fab-49cb4129f42f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a62aa31da8990f2bc5d50b25d49fce8a71e285643e9b90c3ce8506a64d835327"}}, "hash": "a62aa31da8990f2bc5d50b25d49fce8a71e285643e9b90c3ce8506a64d835327", "text": "loss database. \u2022\ufffd Where national legislation and structures are not in place, implementation of the disaster loss database should be carried out in parallel with other UNDP programmes and initiatives, to support and build disaster management capacities, systems and structures in the target country. 4.2 Government Ownership (and Government Staff) It must be very clear that the government in each country is the owner of the database and not UNDP nor the agency operating the system in the case where the government has agreed to the engagement of an NGO or private company. Government ownership of the database, as well as the implementation and analysis processes is vital with regards to sustainability and use of the findings from the database. Sustainability will only occur if the system is tailored to the government\u2019s specific requirements and needs, and is provided with useable information for planning and decision-making. There are two main processes/outputs \u2013 the historical data collection and the collection of current data. While these are traditionally done with the same government department they can also be undertaken by different entities. Key Lesson: Government must own the database from the outset and be self-driven to produce the analysis to assist it with planning and management. Key Lessons Learned 4 24 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Recommendations \u2022\ufffd The socialization of the benefits and value of a disaster loss database should be systematic and thorough. \u2022\ufffd The request from the government for support from UNDP should be very clear and based on a full understanding of the need and benefits of such a database. \u2022\ufffd Government ownership should involve the appropriate disaster management agency and other relevant agencies within the government structure7 that will use the data and analysis to make important decisions. \u2022\ufffd Customization of the database should be made in every country to specifically meet the direct and indirect needs of the government. \u2022\ufffd The function and responsibilities of historical data collection and ongoing data collection should be separated. 4.3 Database for Disaster Risk Reduction At the core of DRR is the identification of the likelihood of disaster events and both the degree of exposure and vulnerability. One of the best ways to identify potential future disasters is by tracking previous disasters and their impact in some form of a database so that analysis can be undertaken. The identification of the risks and disasters allows risk levels and risk factors to be mitigated. Key Lesson: Disaster loss databases must be developed as an integral part of DRR initiatives. In the absence of a nationwide risk assessment in these countries, the database is a central tool for governments to better understand the disasters and threats in order to effectively mitigate and prepare for them. Recommendation While benefits can be drawn from a standalone disaster loss database, its implementation as part of a broader DRR initiative in any country would increase its effectiveness. 4.4 Support / Specialist Technical Backstopping from UNDP The RP has developed a great amount of in-house expertise in DRR. This expertise includes not only the physical development of disaster loss databases but also the creation of an enabling environment required to manage 7 Such as an inter-ministerial body involving the key infrastructure and social services ministries. disasters, the detailed technical knowledge of the system and experience in its customization. For the tsunami affected countries the RP has provided substantial financial support to the UNDP COs to recruit specialist staff, procure equipment and implement the activities associated with the disaster loss databases. This support from the RP has played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the disaster loss databases in the target countries. Ongoing technical support from the RP should be continued for the benefit of the target countries. It will also enable UNDP to build its niche in this area and be identified as the UN agency specializing in the establishment, customization and institutionalization of disaster loss databases. Key Lesson: Build on corporate investment made in developing expertise in the implementation of disaster loss databases and utilization of the DesInventar methodology, for the benefit of effective DRR. Support from the RP has played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the disaster loss databases and continued support has been deemed necessary. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd Ongoing technical support provided by the RP has played a crucial role in the successful implementation of the databases. Continued regional support is required to ensure the full benefits of the databases. \u2022\ufffd A regional hub that provides technical and non-technical support to multiple countries should be given priority as a cost", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdba667a-6579-4565-ba37-4d29a21e058c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdba667a-6579-4565-ba37-4d29a21e058c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38cf753059af005f20d702c4dc812d5c6691f44c1accd5ed1b57f794bb0df47a"}}, "hash": "38cf753059af005f20d702c4dc812d5c6691f44c1accd5ed1b57f794bb0df47a", "text": "efficient way for UNDP to implement such initiatives and to consolidate its position as the lead agency in this field. \u2022\ufffd UNDP should continue to support disaster loss databases as an integral part of DRR programming. 4.5 Data Collection Methodology (Including Data Cards) The data collection methodology should be agreed upon from the outset and should take into account a number of factors including: lessons from previous data collection process in the country of implementation, the definition of the end use of the data (how the information will be used should drive the data that is collected), the process of data collection, the sources of data, the validation process and the analysis that will be undertaken. Based on all of these variables, customization of the process and the tool will need to be undertaken: The customization should include: \u2022\ufffd End use of the data 25 KEY LESSONS LEARNED \u2022\ufffd Sources of data (government, NGOs, media, research institutions, universities) \u2022\ufffd Validation process \u2022\ufffd Country specific data cards (customized) \u2022\ufffd Country specific definitions defined (customized) \u2022\ufffd Country specific hazards defined (customized) \u2022\ufffd Type of analysis to be undertaken based on data Examples of key definitions/lists of hazards are provided in the glossary in Annex I. Key Lesson: Understand why the data is being collected and what the end use of the data will be. With this understanding the process and methodology can be put in place. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd There should be a clear understanding of the end use of data, the type of analysis and applications that will be required by the government, and any other issues that may arise with the official validation of the data. \u2022\ufffd The supporting documents in Annexes II and III should be used as clear examples of how data has been collected and how customization has been undertaken. 4.6 Data Collection Process and Sources The data collection process and sources of data are very important with regards to the information that will be collected, then validated and entered into the database. The \u2018RIMRO\u2019 principle (rubbish in means rubbish out) starts here. If poor data is collected then poor data is entered into the system, resulting in poor and even meaningless analyses. The sources of data must be reliable and government-/ counterpart-approved. As a general rule of thumb, direct sourcing of data from official government records is preferred as they are usually reliable and consistent. Media sources do not always provide the level of detail required and can sometimes over estimate the impact of the disaster \u2013 they should be sourced with caution. The data collection process must be very systematic and structured, have strict quality assurance with checks in place, and records available for different levels for quality control, cross checking and final validation. This process will often involve the recruitment of short-term and temporary staff. All staff collecting data will need to be trained in data collection, and briefed about DRR in general, including types of disasters and disaster management. Data collection personnel should also have a clear understanding of the value of the data they are collecting and how the data will be used by the government. The process must take into account customization of the database and the level down to which the database will record (province, district and subdistrict). In Sri Lanka8 for example, some initial data was collected at a higher level than what was later required and further collection was then undertaken at a lower administrative level. While this makes for interesting cross checking, it is best for the government counterpart to decide at the beginning what level they require data at. Key Lesson: The data collection process must be structured and have cross checks within it. Data records should be from \u2018agreed and accepted\u2019 sources and must be kept and easily accessible. Data collection staff must be trained to understand disaster terminology and the use of the data, and know exactly how to collect it. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd Prior to the collection of data, the benefits of the different data sources (from government, NGOs, media, research agencies, etc.) should be assessed with the government, and based on the assessment, agree on a list of reliable data sources. \u2022\ufffd The government should determine the disaggregation of data at which past and future disasters will be recorded. \u2022\ufffd The data collection process should involve the recording and storage of the source of data, and a copy of the data source should be kept on file for future cross checking. \u2022\ufffd Data collection staff should be trained in disaster terminology and precise data collection methodology. 4.7 Data Validation (Systems) Data validation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3af6286-34e4-4b03-8a1d-b27039af31d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3af6286-34e4-4b03-8a1d-b27039af31d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4595e8c8e5612a84d793d12b71bdefa232e3d3f0aa7e119555a42732f078eab9"}}, "hash": "4595e8c8e5612a84d793d12b71bdefa232e3d3f0aa7e119555a42732f078eab9", "text": "is an important step in database implementation. The data must be validated prior to any form of analysis \u2013 should the analysis provide findings that are new or different from standard expectations then these will be questioned, and the source and validity of the data should be reviewed. All data must be verifiable at any point in time and as such, systems must be in place to ensure the quality and validity of the data. 8 Sri Lanka is a good example where the process was very systematic. Electronic copies of all data cards with attached copies of the source of data (either media or official government record) are kept on file, and based on reference numbers can be recalled and crossed checked at any time. Separation of duties for the data collection and data entry processes also enables further cross checking and oversight. 26 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Key Lesson: Division of duties, clear documentation, strict quality assurance and complete records of documentation (data card and photocopy or digital copy of the source of data) kept on file are essential for data validation. Recommendations Validation or quality control mechanisms should include: \u2022\ufffd Separation of duties between data collection and data entry. \u2022\ufffd Verification that the information on the data card corresponds with the copy of the data source attached to the data card. \u2022\ufffd Verification that the same disaster has not been recorded based on different sources of data from different organizations. \u2022\ufffd Sampling of the data, and checking data cards and source of data should automatically be done once data is in the system. \u2022\ufffd Future version of the DesInventar platform will include a new validation tool that will enable a hidden function for data that has yet to be validated. 4.8 Analysis To date, both Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu have undertaken analysis and produced reports. The analysis that is undertaken from the database must be of high quality and provide information that will assist the government in planning and preparedness, and in making decisions. The scope of the disaster loss database, including types of disasters and the level of detailed information to be provided (provincial, district, subdistrict, village) should be discussed and agreed to by all key stakeholders at the outset and before the system becomes operational. The GIS/ mapping function is a very useful tool for displaying analysis.9 Key Lesson: Analysis must be professional, clear, understandable and relevant to the target audience. Different levels of analysis should be prepared depending on the audience of the analysis. But in general, they should comprise quantitative and qualitative information that is user-friendly and supports the decision-making process. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd The standard template for analysis could be used to generate basic results from the database. 9 Examples of standard mapping functions, tables and graphs are displayed in Section 4.15. \u2022\ufffd Analysis should be tailored to meet the needs of the host government. \u2022\ufffd The quality and completeness of the data are crucial for useful analysis, and where data is weak the analysis should state this clearly. 4.9 Training Training is required in technical database issues, data collection and entry, data analysis, DRR issues and disaster- related terminology. Training to date has taken place at two levels \u2013 at the regional level by the RP in the training of Disaster Inventories Associates in-country; and at the national level by the Associates to other local staff. Key Lesson: Ongoing training and professional development for staff and counterparts are essential for effective and coordinated processes towards successful implementation of the disaster loss database and DRR. UNDP should also support capacity development efforts for staff, government counterparts and implementing partners through technical advice, specialist training and re-training. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd Formal training materials based on the experience of this programme need to be further developed, refined and adopted as standard documents. \u2022\ufffd Ongoing technical refresher training should be part of any commitment made by UNDP to continue technical support. \u2022\ufffd Customized in-country training and training materials need to be developed based on the guidelines provided in Section 2. These guidelines provide the basis for the further development of cross-referenced training materials for the region. \u2022\ufffd At the regional level, specific guidance and training on data analysis needs to be undertaken with target countries. 4.10 In-country Technical Support and Staffing Technical support for the implementation of the databases in the target countries has been provided by the RP, and in- country by a range of variously skilled professionals. Sample terms of reference (TOR) for personnel in the RP and in- country (Disaster Inventories Associates,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4037a190-b896-4e46-a3d6-a3cb6fb181e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "4037a190-b896-4e46-a3d6-a3cb6fb181e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4133105221f2b7085a0cd49ed9fece1b09694f2ace5116d533290c7f5b410df"}}, "hash": "c4133105221f2b7085a0cd49ed9fece1b09694f2ace5116d533290c7f5b410df", "text": "data collection staff, data entry staff) are provided in Annex VI. The TOR for new recruits should be reviewed and modified in light of the competencies of existing staff members, in order to create a strong team with skills and experiences that are diverse but complement each other. 27 KEY LESSONS LEARNED Key Lesson: Multi-skilling of the personnel involved adds greater depth to the quality of the outputs, which involve knowledge of several disciplines. As such, a team effort is essential to bring together an all-round interpretation and profile of the data collected. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd The current TOR for positions involved in the programme would benefit from a review based on the actual work experience of the current team members. \u2022\ufffd In the future, recruitment of staff skills and experience in the following key areas should be considered: experience in working with the government, level of computer skills, ability to manage data collection, knowledge of disaster management/risk reduction, and multi-disciplinary skills and understanding. 4.11 Customization and Local Adaptation Customization and local adaptation are fundamental to implementing a sustainable database that meets the requirements of a particular country\u2019s needs. It also helps to ensure that the database becomes part of government systems and not a standalone one. In the tsunami affected countries, customization has included, among other things, changes to local language scripts, modification of definitions based on local understanding and types of disasters, and development of local manuals and different mapping functions. Detailed examples of the different customization undertaken at the country level are provided in the country specific documentation in Annexes II and III. Key Lesson: Without customization databases could be a wasted investment. There is a need to provide support in customizing the database to meet the needs of the government, and to ensure that it complements existing government systems and requirements, so that at the end of the day it is actually used. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd Current government systems and the database need to be independently assessed so that there can be effective dialogue with government to make the system complementary to the current government systems. \u2022\ufffd Customization should meet the needs and requirements of the government and be able to interoperate with other government systems. 4.12 Need for Tools / Manuals Standard tools and manuals are vital in the establishment of the disaster loss databases. Annexes II and III include information on the locally developed disaster database technical and non-technical manuals. The DesInventar manual (now version 7.9) has been updated and local manuals have been produced at the country level. A quick five-step guideline has also been developed by the RP (see Section 2). Key Lesson: Locally customized manuals need to be developed with the target group in mind. Recommendations \u2022\ufffd The Disaster Inventories Associates should be familiar with the manuals of the disaster loss database. \u2022\ufffd Local versions of the manual in local languages should be developed as well as versions specific to different target groups. \u2022\ufffd Existing manuals need to be updated. \u2022\ufffd There is currently scope to further develop these manuals based on inter-country exchanges and experiences, and this should be given priority. 4.13 Advocacy Tools / Support A number of standard advocacy tools have been developed at the regional level and localized at the country level. The greatest advocacy tool is the production of analysis from country specific database that meets the needs of government and is able to result in decision being made based on this knowledge. The GIS and mapping function in taking samples of country specific database provides clear, visual examples for the development of local advocacy tools. Brochures on the DesInventar databases in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand can be found in Annex XI. Specialist advisors from the RP can also advocate for disaster loss databases, and if requested by the UNDP CO, presentations can be made to governments on all aspects of the disaster loss database. Key Lesson: More effort needs to be placed in advocating for the importance of disaster loss databases.

Additional resources from the regional and country level need to be allocated to advocacy. 4.14 Examples of the Use of DesInventar for Decision- making As can be seen from the country specific sections above and country specific documentation in the annexes of this report, the implementation of the disaster loss databases and the integration of the databases into government systems have not yet been fully achieved, although in countries such as Sri Lanka the process is very close to fruition. The use of the information from the disaster loss database will only occur when the correct and complete analysis of data from within the database is undertaken and provides the government with the information they require to make decisions. The importance of clear analysis is key to the institutionalization of the system, and this is based on the use of the information from the database by the government and other entities to make informed decisions. The Maldives, Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu databases have all been used by the government and donors for generating information and reports detailing the impact of the tsunami and other more recent disasters. However as an institutionalized tool supporting the development of government policy and decision-making, this has yet to be achieved. 4.15 Mapping and GIS The mapping function of the disaster loss database being implemented in the tsunami affected countries has a strong interface. Digital maps can be imported into the disaster loss database using standard formats such as ArcView and Mapinfo. Some knowledge of mapping (GIS) is required to import and adjust the maps within the database and can be done relatively easily; the Maldives, however, has had some issues as a result of the large number of islands/atolls and the distances between each island. The GIS mapping function is a useful tool and a clear way to display information for analysis and advocacy purposes. The maps and charts in Figure 16 are taken from the Tamil Nadu database and are very much a standard function of the disaster loss database being implemented in all countries under the RP. They are an excellent way of presenting the data and analysis from the database. There is also scope for the GIS components of these databases to be better integrated into the GIS/MIS systems of other UN agencies such as for food security and poverty mapping. The Vulnerability Analysis Mapping System of the World Food Programme has useful data as does the Food and Agricultural Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Bank with their in-country databases that could be linked to. Possible links or interfaces with other UNDP specific databases such as the Development Assistance Database would also provide interesting analysis. 4.16 Benefits of a Disaster Loss Database The key benefits of a validated disaster loss database are without doubt that it empowers the host government to clearly identify and follow patterns of disaster risk, thus, contributing to the implementation of efficient and effective disaster risk management programmes and policies. The populated database can identify disaster prone areas and destructive hazards by a number of different variables including financial cost (loss), damage to infrastructure, loss of life and many other variables depending on the customization of the database. The disaster loss database can also be used to monitor progress on DRR initiatives. For example, the impact of policies aimed at reducing the destruction of houses can be measured using the database. Based on information from the database, the governments are then able to prioritize future DRR activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80a0a0ad-d8a9-498a-8918-7ab6ab1efaf2": {"__data__": {"id_": "80a0a0ad-d8a9-498a-8918-7ab6ab1efaf2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "989e4ccd44e4446e3123fd1531f08060c636eb961439609b27429224bc63c9de"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a1cccb7-a5c1-45b9-8b21-0f8c0a5f2920", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ae9ebd4c5725e57ba3613513b7b82a394510fdaecafd7ce4a783e5808ea27050"}}, "hash": "338128bad923bdf66156b68bf1cb3bb7c501e2ae6278d4319d55b5835a232abe", "text": "Based on information from the database, the governments are then able to prioritize future DRR activities. 29 KEY LESSONS LEARNED Figure 16: Maps and Charts Generated from Indisdata Taluk-wise Impact of All Hazards (1976\u20132006) DROUGHT 2% EPIDEMIC 9% FIRE 42% ACCIDENT 16% TSUNAMI 1% TIDAL WAVE 1% STRUCTURE 8% STORM 1% SPATE 1% RAINS 7% LIGHTING 5% FLOOD 6% FLASH FLOOD 1% Hazard Profile -

In the Asia-Pacific region, the Crisis Prevention and Recovery (CPR) Team based at the UNDP RCB supports UNDP COs and their national partners in conflict prevention, natural disaster reduction, and post-crisis recovery to bridge the gap between emergency relief and long-term development. The RCB assisted in the response to the 2004 tsunami disaster, and continues to help countries strengthen their DRR capacity through the RP. 5.2 Efforts of UNDP in Disaster Loss Databases Prior to the establishment of the RP in November 2005, UNDP initiated its first disaster loss database pilot project in the region in 2002 in the state of Orissa (India), and later in Nepal and Sri Lanka, using the DesInventar methodology and its customizations. All these efforts were then supported by the Bureau for CPR\u2019s office for South and South West Asia located in New Delhi. During the implementation of disaster loss database in the tsunami affected countries, there has been demands expressed by other countries and states, including \u2018non- tsunami\u2019 affected countries, for technical support in such programme activities. In India, disaster loss databases are in various stages of development in several northern and southern states. Although the RP\u2019s activities in India is focused on the state of Tamil Nadu, disaster loss databases are being established in the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry and Kerala by the United Nations Team for Recovery Support using the experiences and lessons learned from setting up disaster loss database in the state of Tamil Nadu. New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal in India are also implementing the disaster loss database using the DesInventar methodology as part of the joint Disaster Reduction Programme of the Government of India and UNDP India. Iran has also implemented a disaster loss database. While these \u2018non-tsunami\u2019 states/countries have been involved in various regional activities of the RP, the programme has not always been involved in the implementation process. Nonetheless, exchange of experience and lessons with other programmes have contributed to building the knowledge base for disaster loss database implementation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0d3137f-a26e-440c-b8f6-8cfead1ff088": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0d3137f-a26e-440c-b8f6-8cfead1ff088", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f486b9b59f4ccaa00a2331e608ee2f4d24915457ac3bf6164d6f708b27d748a7"}, "2": {"node_id": "df5fe7fd-cedf-4afb-98b1-49d9ffadb391", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e74901c036b0b04371504f6f51abb1dcd70c111d2101cd106e9654454a7b8bfb"}}, "hash": "c3110e725acc441551ef084866f732f68409504f40818d9dcb08bb8e09ad326b", "text": "For instance, the Nepal implementation is an interesting example as it has been managed by an NGO, and the database and systems have been established within the NGO itself (the National Society for Earthquake Technology).

The Role of UNDP in DRR and Disaster Loss Database Implementation 5 32 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases 5.4 UNDP Regional Programme on Capacity Building for Sustainable Recovery and Risk Reduction The RP implements its activities under three outcome areas: 1. Enhanced institutional systems for building risk knowledge and application in planning and decision making for risk reduction, response and recovery. 2. The effectiveness and coherence of end to end early warning systems are enhanced. 3. Within the context of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) System, the capacities of national institutions for DRR are strengthened. These are the recently realigned outcomes to reflect the holistic approach to DRR that the programme implements, and the RP\u2019s responsiveness to the specific requirements and requests from countries in the region for support. To date, the RP has provided demand-driven technical advice, facilitated cross learning events and initiated partnerships that have led to positive progress in developing DRR capacities. These include improved information management capacity, better early warning and risk assessment practices, and enhanced skills of managers and personnel in different aspects of DRR. Relating to disaster loss databases, the RP has moved to support all of the following five steps identified for their implementation in tsunami affected countries: 1. Establishing an enabling environment for DRR 2. Finding an appropriate \u2018home\u2019 for the database 3. Establishing the disaster loss database within DRR framework 4. Collecting, entering and validating data 5. Analysing and managing data, and ensuring sustainability The RP works with UNDP COs, national disaster management agencies and other counterparts at the national and local levels to support and enhance the enabling environment required to implement disaster loss databases and broader DRR initiatives. The RP has contributed significantly to a coherent and consistent approach to DRR in the region, and has promoted knowledge sharing across countries, providing opportunities for countries in the region to learn from each other at regional forums and training events.

The DesInventar Manual is a handy reference technical guide for disaster loss database managers, aimed at providing details of various functions of the DesInventar too, including explanations of data fields and terminology, entering, storing and editing data, set up and administration of the database, user access control, etc. The Guide on Preliminary Analysis provides step-by-step instructions on analysing data and producing spatial and temporal outputs for specific disaster events and selected administrative areas. All in all, the capacity, expertise, local knowledge of the region and experience in DRR that the RP has developed in more than three years of implementation, is a significant contribution to UNDP\u2019s knowledge base. Disaster loss database implementation is also an important niche UNDP has built up where government counterparts are now recognizing UNDP as the UN agency specializing in the establishment, customization and institutionalization of disaster loss databases. There is a strong demand from target countries as well as other countries in the region for the RP to continue providing technical support in implementing disaster loss databases. The RP\u2019s support to the five tsunami affected countries in implementing disaster loss databases has included financial support for equipment, provision of full-time staff, training for the staff, opportunities for sharing and exchanging experiences, technical backstopping in database customization, assistance in the development of work plans, and guidance on the implementation process. UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok through its Crisis Prevention and Recovery team will continue to build on its niche in providing technical support to the development and institutionalization of disaster loss database. In addition, the RP will continue to support and document ways in which loss databases are being used to support decision-making in each country. Currently in 2008, these databases have been used to support analysis of disaster and poverty linkages. 34 Figure 18: Steps for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Conclusion 6 This report is intended to provide a road map for the replication of disaster loss databases in Asia and the Pacific. It is clear from the review of the RP\u2019s work associated with disaster loss databases that having easily accessible information on previous disasters and their impact is the most efficient way to conduct analysis of disasters, and plan and mitigate future disasters. It is also clear that the RP has guided and driven the implementation of disaster loss databases and DRR initiatives in the tsunami affected countries in Asia. Based on demand, the RP has developed this report to document the process, challenges and lessons learned from the experience of implementing disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries, including the type of environment required to enable successful deployment and institutionalization; the various steps that need to be taken and issues to consider for start up; data collection, entry and validation; and ensuring sustainability. The RP\u2019s effective implementation of disaster loss databases has benefited partners that are engaged in early warning systems, building and applying risk knowledge to reduce the impact of disasters, strengthening disaster preparedness and enhancing post-recovery management. Obviously, each country will offer quite different challenges and among these challenges will be those that UNDP can influence and those that it cannot. It is therefore essential to have a clear understanding that the successful implementation is contingent on a number of factors beyond the physical database itself, and requires the allocation of substantial resources and time. Otherwise, any investments may well be at considerable risk. To summarize, key factors identified in this report for consideration when implementing disaster loss databases include the following: \u2022\ufffd Promote a clear understanding that data and inventories of disasters are vital for identifying and tracking patterns of disaster risk, and that they are a fundamental requirement for implementing efficient and effective DRR programmes, policies and planning. \u2022\ufffd Recognize that the establishment and support of an enabling environment for DRR to assist with the institutionalization and long-term sustainability of a disaster loss database must either be in place, or fully resourced or provided", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d40d57b4-9714-418c-b0c9-1bfb123ea078": {"__data__": {"id_": "d40d57b4-9714-418c-b0c9-1bfb123ea078", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "765e8121c7e7a774981760634d3cef42d508640b7af0cce031f11cc697a3ffb3"}}, "hash": "765e8121c7e7a774981760634d3cef42d508640b7af0cce031f11cc697a3ffb3", "text": "for in such an initiative. \u2022\ufffd Aim to create a database initiative in conjunction with other disaster-related capacity building activities and within government structures to ensure local ownership and management of the data. \u2022\ufffd Customize the system to meet national conditions including language, definitions of disasters and the local situation. \u2022\ufffd Ensure that data collection and validation are from agreed and accepted sources, and involve government counterparts in this process. \u2022\ufffd Produce high quality analysis from the database that can assist governments in disaster planning and preparedness, and in making informed decisions. \u2022\ufffd Ensure that technical support is in place for the system even after the disaster loss database has been successfully implemented. \u2022\ufffd Follow five key steps to successfully implement a disaster loss database: Step 1\u2013 Create an enabling environment for disaster risk reduction Step 2 \u2013 Find an appropriate 'home' for the database Step 3 \u2013 Establish the disaster loss database within disaster risk reduction framework Step 4 \u2013 Collect, enter and validate data Step 5 \u2013 Conduct analysis, manage data and ensure sustainability 35 Acknowledgements UNDP greatly appreciates the cooperation and support of the Government of India (Tamil Nadu State Government), Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand, and their dedicated personnel in the preparation of this report. This documentation process would not have been possible without the full support of the UNDP Country Offices and Regional Centre and their specialist personnel who have led the way in designing and commissioning UNDP-supported and government-managed disaster loss and analysis systems in the countries affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. The findings in this report provide programme designers and planners in disaster-prone countries with lessons and fundamental steps that need to be taken to effectively implement a disaster loss database system. This report has been compiled by UNDP consultant Justin Shone and is very much the result of a team effort by a number of UNDP and government personnel including: Sanny Ramos Jegillos, Rajesh Sharma, Dinesh Rajapaksha, Muhammed Akram, Pairach Homtong, Ridwan Yunus, Shuhaad Ibrahim, Kingkarn Sangwanich, Kalika Mohapatra, Sreeja Nair and Julio Serje.

Capacity may include physical, institutional, social or economic means as well as skilled personnel or collective attributes such as leadership and management. Capacity may also be described as capability (ISDR). Capacity Development The process through which individuals, organizations and societies obtain, strengthen and maintain the capabilities to set and achieve their own development objectives over time. On the other hand, capacity building commonly refers to a process that supports only the initial stages of building or creating capacities and alludes to an assumption that there are no existing capacities to start from. Capacity building can be relevant to crisis or immediate post-conflict situations where existing capacity has largely been lost due to capacity destruction or capacity flight (UNDP). Capacity Assessment An analysis of current capacities against desired future capacities, which generates an understanding of capacity assets and needs, which in turn leads to the formulation of capacity development strategies (UNDP). DesInventar A data collection and analysis methodology that uses open- source computer software to record and assess disaster losses and trends. This methodology and software has been used by UNDP in the implementation of disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries (DesInventar). Disaster A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses that exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. A disaster is a function of the risk process. It results from the combination of hazards, conditions of vulnerability and insufficient capacity or measures to reduce the potential negative consequences of risk. Disaster Loss Database A database that records and stores information about occurrences and impacts of disasters and allows retrieval of information based on a defined criteria. It allows analysis of occurrences and impacts of disasters over time and space in a systematic manner to support preparedness, mitigation, early warning systems and response. Disaster Risk Management The systematic process of using administrative decisions, organization, operational skills and capacities to implement policies, strategies and coping capacities of the society and communities to lessen the impacts of natural hazards and related environmental and technological disasters. This comprises all forms of activities, including structural and non-structural measures to avoid (prevention) or to limit (mitigation and preparedness) adverse effects of hazards.

The process of conducting a risk assessment is based on a review of both the technical features of hazards such as their location, intensity, frequency and probability; and also the analysis of the physical, social, economic and environmental dimensions of vulnerability and exposure, while taking particular account of the coping capabilities pertinent to the risk scenarios. Events The following events are defined by DesInventar as a phenomenon, whether natural or not, which, once triggered, produces adverse effects on human lives, health and/or social and economic infrastructures. Flood Water that overflows rivers or streams and runs slowly or quickly on small or large areas. ANNEX I - GLOSSARY 37 Urban Flood Storm water that gets collected in city or urban areas after heavy rains due to blocking or under capacity of storm water drains. Flash Flood The sudden overflowing of a river, violent water flow in a river or stream, or unexpected violent water flow on drainage path or land. Flash floods can be caused by rain, a reservoir dam overflowing/bursting/breaching, or abundant landslides on a watershed or basin. Flash floods usually carry tree trunks and/or fine to bulky sediment. Surge On land \u2013 This can be a surge of water mass due to overflowing or breach of a reservoir dam. This would be synonymous with flash floods. Sea surge \u2013 Sea tides breaking on the shore and flooding the coastal areas. It can result in erosion of beaches and sand banks. Alluvium Torrential water flows dragging large amounts of solid material (pebbles, stones, and rock blocks) common in dry regions or river beds produced by heavy rain. Landslide All mass movements other than surface erosion of a hillside. This event includes terms such as precipitation of earth, settling, horizontal land thrust, mass movement, displacement and detachment of soil masses on watersheds or hillsides. Rock Falls Movement of rocks on hillside or watersheds slowly or rapidly. Land Subsidence Subsidence, collapse of caves or mines due to a vacuum/ void formed under the ground surface, naturally or as a result of human activities. Drought Unusually dry season, without rain or with shortage of rain. As a whole, these are long periods (months and even years). Epidemic An infectious disease attacking many individuals in a community during short terms (days, weeks, months maximum) such as cholera, typhoid, bubonic plague, etc., which already exists in the region or the population concerned; or the appearance of an infection previously absent. Earthquake All movements in the earth\u2019s crust causing any type of damage or negative effect on communities or properties, such as the collapse of buildings and destruction of life and property. The event includes terms such as earth tremor, earthquake and vibration. Sometimes there can be cracking of the crust of the earth. Storm/Gale Rain accompanied by strong winds and/or lightning. There is no difference between \u2018storm\u2019 and \u2018gale\u2019. The term wind storm is also used. Gale is a very strong wind. The term is synonymous with gust. Lightning (Thunderstorm) Electrical Storm \u2013 Concentration of atmospheric static discharges (lightning), with effects on people, cattle, domestic properties, infrastructure (mains, for example, causing blackouts), and industries. It is different from \u2018storm\u2019 in that thunderstorms are not accompanied by rain and gusty winds. Tornado Tornados are winds whirling around a small area of extremely low pressure, usually characterized by a dark funnel-shaped cloud causing damage along its path; usually without rain or little rain. The term is synonymous with whirlwind. Cyclones High speed whirling winds moving in a circular path (of about 100\u2013300 km diametre) in an anticlockwise direction around an extremely low pressure area at the centre. Strong whirling winds accompanied by rain. They are originated in the Bay of Bengal. Forest Fire Forest fire includes wild fire, bush fire or grass fire. The event includes all open-air fires in forests, natural and artificial forests, plains, etc. Urban or Industrial Fire Urban or industrial fire, but not including forest fires, covering extensive damage.

Contamination/Poisoning of Air/Water Poisoning or contamination of atmosphere or water courses due to industrial sources (Industrial Poisoning). Snowfall Anomalous fall and accumulation of snow, especially when it occurs in zones not subject to seasonal changes. This term refers to events where precipitation exceeds the average multi-annual values, causing especially serious effects. Volcanic Eruption Volcanic eruption with disastrous effects, eruption and emission of gas and ashes, stone falls (pyroclast), flows of lava, etc. This event includes eruption of sludge volcanoes found in some Caribbean regions. Avalanche Rapid and sudden sliding and flowage of masses of usually unsorted mixtures of rock material, snow and ice, or they could be solid waste, in case of massive dumps; same meaning as slide. La Ni\u00f1a (\u2018little girl\u2019 in Spanish) It is essentially the opposite of El Ni\u00f1o. The ocean becomes much cooler than normal. Although, La Ni\u00f1a is not as well understood as El Ni\u00f1o, it is thought to occur due to an increase in the strength of the trade winds. This increases the amount of cooler water that upwells toward the West Coast of South American and reduces water temperatures. Hazard A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation. Hazards can include latent conditions that may represent future threats and can have different origins: natural (geological, hydro-meteorological and biological) or induced by human processes (environmental degradation and technological hazards). Hazards can be single, sequential or combined in their origin and effects. Each hazard is characterized by its location, intensity, frequency and probability. 40 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Hazard Analysis Identification, studies and monitoring of any hazard to determine its potential, origin, characteristics and behaviour. Mitigation Structural and non-structural measures undertaken to limit the adverse impact of natural hazards, environmental degradation and technological hazards. Natural Hazards Natural processes or phenomena occurring in the biosphere that may constitute a damaging event. Natural hazards can be classified by origin namely: geological, hydro- meteorological or biological. Hazardous events can vary in magnitude or intensity, frequency, duration, area of extent, speed of onset, spatial dispersion and temporal spacing. Preparedness Activities and measures taken in advance to ensure effective response to the impact of hazards, including the issuance of timely and effective early warnings and the temporary evacuation of people and property from threatened locations. Prevention Activities to provide outright avoidance of the adverse impact of hazards, and means to minimize related environmental, technological and biological disasters. Depending on social and technical feasibility, and cost/ benefit considerations, investing in preventive measures is justified in areas frequently affected by disasters. In the context of public awareness and education related to DRR, changing attitudes and behaviour contribute to promoting a \u2018culture of prevention\u2019. Risk The probability of harmful consequences or expected losses (deaths, injuries, property, livelihoods, economic activity disrupted or environment damaged) resulting from interactions between natural or human-induced hazards and vulnerable conditions. Conventionally, risk is expressed by the notation: Risk = Hazards x Vulnerability. Some disciplines also include the concept of exposure to refer particularly to the physical aspects of vulnerability. Beyond expressing a possibility of physical harm, it is crucial to recognize that risks are inherent or can be created or exist within social systems. It is important to consider the social contexts in which risks occur and that people therefore do not necessarily share the same perceptions of risk and their underlying causes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2893db5a-e366-4607-80ce-0c76a2c96bc7": {"__data__": {"id_": "2893db5a-e366-4607-80ce-0c76a2c96bc7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "404a2b923b49f11d16513a7cebf5dd7f230233d083fb12e025f21b49155ff1e1"}, "2": {"node_id": "64bd6137-042b-4e9f-a772-a7b9e47618de", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9e643e55a93ef019e0879d85717f646a5d19a492b6f68963b136857c3e0d5901"}}, "hash": "eba977bbdf21c9a0a3beed561616bd14bb87c8327cd0f4858028da3481e7bd4d", "text": "Sustainable Development \u201cDevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.\u201d Sustainable development contains within it two key concepts: the concept of \u2018needs\u2019, in particular the essential needs of the world\u2019s poor, to which overriding priority should be given; and the idea of limitations imposed by the state of technology and social organization on the environment\u2019s ability to meet present and the future needs (Brundtland Commission, 1987).

Solutions For example, a flood-related accident was reported by both the Revenue Department and the Fire Department. The number of deaths was the same from both sources, but the Fire Department also provided information on the number of people rescued. A single entry was made with the information on death from the Revenue Department and rescue from the Fire Department. 18. Analysis: Type of analysis undertaken Preliminary analysis undertaken by a local university (VIT). How the analysis was done Using the database and referring to disaster-related journal and reports. Analysis undertaken by Centre for Disaster Management and Mitigation \u2013 Vellore Institute of Technology Dissemination of analysis Analysis results will be published as a booklet with consent from all involved. Use of analysis (by decision makers for planning activities/allocating funding for disaster planning/ preparedness) This can be determined with the publishing of the analysis report. Period of analysis and frequency Data is available from 1975 onwards. A good amount of data is from 1996\u20132006 so this period can be considered for analysis. 19. Use of analysis by government: By decision makers In the course of time things may move in this direction based on the acceptance of the analysis report by key government stakeholders. Use by NGOs Government agencies do wish for NGOs to adopt the system, and an action plan is being developed for engaging NGOs in the process. 20. Sustainability: Key elements of sustainability Government ownership and acceptance is vital for sustainability. Continued updating of the database from selected agency is required. Issues specific to government sustainability Advocacy is required for the acceptance of the system and its sustainability. Issues specific to UNDP support for sustainability Both RCB and CO to support the government in all acts for sustaining the initiative. Political issues Government reluctant to put the database online due to political issues. Government ownership issues Government reluctant to accept the system as it cannot dedicate its workforce to this initiative. Human resources Training the users in data entry and maintenance of the system. Future direction/use of data and database Institutionalizing the entire system will be the right direction. 45 ANNEX II - DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN TAMIL NADU, INDIA 21.

Implementation strategy/arrangements \u2013 Government Ministry, Nodal Agency/Department, Partner Agencies/Stakeholders (at country/ provincial/district/subdistrict level) Activities pertaining to the Sri Lanka Disaster Information System are performed by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) under the leadership of the Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights (M/DM&HR), with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). b. Which agency is implementing the loss database and the relationship with other departments/ agencies/ministries Activities pertaining to Sri Lanka Disaster Information System are implemented by the DMC with the assistance of UNDP. c. Other agencies involved in data collection/ provision of data There are specialized state organizations responsible for different hazards and they take the leadership in collecting disaster-related data through their district offices and district administrations. Information on disasters occurring within the district is reported to the Divisional Secretariat by the Grama Niladhari (GN) Officers, and from there, it is related to the District Secretariat. Other organizations that are within the district may assist them in this process. At the time of disaster, information related to the damages caused in each sector is collected directly by these particular state organizations within the district with the assistance of other organizations, as required. d. Background on government ownership/ reorganization/adaptation With the enactment of the Sri Lanka Disaster Management Act No.13 of 2005 in the Parliament of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in July 2005, the National Council for Disaster Management (NCDM) was established as the highest authority responsible for the management of disasters. This was followed by the establishment of the DMC to function directly under the NCDM. Thereafter, a separate ministry (M/DM&HR) was formed. Presently the DMC is functioning under the Ministry. Accordingly, the DMC is the main authority for disaster management activities covering the whole island of Sri Lanka under the guidance of the NCDM and the M/DM&HR. In this manner the establishment and updating of the Sri Lanka Disaster Information System are done as regular activities within the programmes of the DMC, with the active participation of other relevant organizations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1caa6553-afb5-48ff-b394-179466d6269b": {"__data__": {"id_": "1caa6553-afb5-48ff-b394-179466d6269b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0f1d12c427bdb70f53768b2c151909cfd3460ce416dec4ff6ececbce5b327e68"}, "2": {"node_id": "9b03f458-9ede-42c3-9c43-bbdc508393ff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9980744235b16b1334d6c6ed05732c7ed0ca54dcf1d2964a00cd323ebfa97b62"}}, "hash": "a18b7082347aa8ab4818ef16a73c0adcf44222b38a8c0bb4b80268920e25da60", "text": "e.

More information on the benefits the government will have from the disaster loss database As the Sri Lanka Disaster Information System has relevant information on each disaster that is provided by specific organizations, they could use the information to suit their needs. In the same way, anyone can have access to the relevant information freely. The DMC can use this information for the following requirements: \u2022\ufffd To identify most disaster prone GN division in each Divisional Secretariat division (in the multi-hazard context). \u2022\ufffd To identify most disaster prone GN division in each Divisional Secretariat division (for one specific hazard event). \u2022\ufffd To identify most destructive hazard in each GN division based on historical data. \u2022\ufffd To minimize the damages caused by disasters based on the above information. \u2022\ufffd To plan, prepare and activate programmes pertaining to early warnings and prior preparations to suit each district based on the above information. \u2022\ufffd To prioritize and give preference to select future disaster management activities depending on areas that are more vulnerable. \u2022\ufffd To identify disaster risks prevalent within the districts and accordingly, strengthen the capacity of relevant governments and NGOs in planning appropriate disaster management activities. 4. Key definitions: Including complete list of hazards used in database/ disasters/causes/variables/fields and effects All interpretations (definitions) related to disasters have been done with the coordination of respective government organizations to suit the country context. All prevalent hazards have been considered. 5. Resources in the establishment of DesInventar: Staffing A Disaster Inventories Associate has been appointed for this activity under the guidance of UNDP. Research Assistants were recruited on many occasions in order to collect and enter data into the computer system. They were university undergraduates studying various computer programmes as well as technical courses. At the beginning, they were employed through a private company. Later, they were recruited directly by UNDP on a short-term contract. The group of officers attached to DesInventar is functioning in an office housed in the DMC and are attending to all activities under the direction and guidance of the Director General, and the Director of the Disaster Mitigation and Information Technology Unit. The Disaster Preparedness and Planning Unit, Training and Public Awareness Unit, and Emergency Operations Unit give necessary advice and assistance continuously to conduct these activities. In addition, UNDP directs and supervises the entire programme of activities. 6. Equipment: Budget/funding Total financial assistance for the required equipment is provided by the UNDP RCB to establish the Sri Lanka Disaster Information System. 7. Description of database: Location \u2013 In government or authentic (include physical/URL/domain) As the DMC does not possess the required initial resources such as high-speed Internet connection and server machine to host the database, it has been hosted online with the support of another organization. Sri Lanka Telecom, leader in providing Internet facilities in Sri Lanka, provided the required technical infrastructure for database hosting. Further, Sri Lanka Telecom is providing assistance to maintain the security of the database while resolving some technical problems in the system. The updating of the database is done remotely from the DMC. Sri Lanka Telecom has made a monthly payment for installing the database on the Internet, and the financial commitment for this is made by UNDP.

Background of database implementation: Key activities and achievements The initial collection of the data was carried out from August to September 1996. The collection of data at the national level from the relevant government organizations was carried out from January to March 1997. Validation of the data collected earlier was done and data found missing from the previous data collection exercise was included in the latter exercise. Gathering of data at the district level was carried out in two stages. At the first stage, 12 districts were selected and data was collected from November 2006 to March 2007. In the remaining 13 districts data was collected from October 2007 to June 2008. The Sri Lanka Disaster Information System was made available on the Internet in June 2007 and preliminary data analysis report was launched on the same day. The first training programme for a selected group of officers from the national and district levels was conducted in October 2006. A second training programme for district level officers from nine selected districts was conducted in June 2007. 9. General challenges encountered during implementation: Technical (such as issues of map importing, using of different server version, databases etc) At the beginning, there were minor problems in the software but they were rectified later. There is a problem with obtaining the latest updated maps for the Divisional Secretariat and GN divisions. 10. Addressing of general challenges encountered during implementation: Technical UNDP and the DMC are providing the relevant assistance. Others \u2022\ufffd Involvement of different stakeholders (Department of Agrarian Services, Department of Wildlife Conservation, National Disaster Relief Services, NBRO, etc.) in collecting information related to the various disasters can be observed in Sri Lanka. Therefore, no one agency has access to all information related to different disaster occurrences. This situation is a challenge for sustaining, maintaining and updating DesInventar as it will require coordination of several organizations. \u2022\ufffd Lack of exchange of relevant data between the respective organizations. \u2022\ufffd Data has been collected to suit the requirements of individual organizations, and data is available in various types of formats. 11. Organization of database-related events: Events The first stakeholder consultation workshop was held in October 2006. \u2022\ufffd The workshop was held to enable the sharing of progress on the development of the database and discuss the findings of the preliminary analysis on disaster trends and impacts, and to agree on the strategy for institutionalization of the system in the country. \u2022\ufffd More than 100 participants representing the government, NGOs, UN agencies and universities participated in the workshop. The second stakeholder workshop was held in June 2007.

A workshop was held in January 2008 at the DMC. Trainings First DesInventar training workshop was held in October 2006. \u2022\ufffd More than 50 officers selected from national and subnational level government agencies were trained at the workshop. Second DesInventar training workshop was held in June 2007. \u2022\ufffd Nearly 50 government officials selected from nine districts, DDMCU staff, UNVs and Data Entry Operators were trained. \u2022\ufffd Computers and the DesInventar database were given to nine districts after completion of data validation and training. 12. External support provided from UNDP CO and RCB: Financial support has been provided for the human resources required (Disaster Inventories Associate since February 2006, and data entry operators from time to time). Arranging stakeholder and training workshops at the national level, data collection at district level, development of infrastructure facilities at the national and district levels, hosting database online, provision of computers for 25 districts, and other required logistics, were among the key contributions for developing DesInventar in Sri Lanka by RCB. Technical support has been provided by RCB for the development and customization of software to suit the country context, and for capacity building of the Disaster Inventories Associate. 13. Planning of data collection and level (provincial/ district/subdistrict/village): Location of data sources (Media/Agencies/ Government/etc. please detail) Organizations have been identified as sources for obtaining disaster-related information. They are print media, government, NGOs and research organizations. Newspapers Various systems and methods have been used in collecting and maintaining the data in governmental organizations from a very long period. As a result it was noticed that there are various difficulties in the collection of disaster data since 1974. Examples \u2022\ufffd Except for the data related to communicable diseases, all other disaster-related data were only available for a period of less than 10 years since they had commenced accumulating such data. \u2022\ufffd The available data was limited only to special situations and they were present only as summarized reports. Accordingly, it was decided to collect the relevant data by using print media, right from the inception. The main reasons for identifying the print media as the first source for this purpose was that the reports of most incidents that had taken place since the year 1974 were available. Also based on such information and data collected from the print media, it became easier to obtain further detailed information through government organizations. Two newspapers published in Sinhala (Dinamina) and English (Daily News) were selected for this purpose. These newspapers have been published by the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd., which is a state organization.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c846540-e90e-4a45-9510-dab67c21a13d": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c846540-e90e-4a45-9510-dab67c21a13d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b81f34e1bd5bdf59162a5e9e6fbf3f2501769ab5a847aa827e4554d9bbdf91e9"}, "2": {"node_id": "82c70611-06b7-4381-b1ba-e5e6071c00dd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6ad9efe48aca4668e2c09906944ac830cb7df6444131a3d6ea00f0dc6c16436"}}, "hash": "db4770f3b4142913f38f881459d986dc44d533b56799a4c5bd1b548962b62be3", "text": "The newspapers that had been published from the year 1974 to 1976 were obtained from the Department of National Archives, and those from the year 1976 onwards from the National Library Documentation Centre.

Collection of data possessed by NGOs and research organization has not been done up to date. Data collection methodology (electronic/hard copy/ others) The data from government organizations was available in the form of reports. It was not possible to bring those written reports out of the premises nor was it possible to take photocopies. Likewise, with newspaper from the relevant organizations. As a result, all copies of past newspapers and reports of the government organizations had to the photographed. 14. Data source: Government The DMC has identified responsible organizations who take appropriate action for various types of disasters, and also those who collect and store the related information at the national and district levels. The following organizations have been linked and associated to collect the data at the national level: \u2022\ufffd Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health \u2022\ufffd Department of Social Services \u2022\ufffd Department of Wildlife Conservation \u2022\ufffd Department of Fire Services of the Colombo Municipal Council \u2022\ufffd National Building Research Organization The following organizations have been linked and associated to collect the data at the district level: \u2022\ufffd District Secretariats \u2022\ufffd Divisional Secretariats \u2022\ufffd Agrarian Services Department \u2022\ufffd Wildlife Conservation Department \u2022\ufffd Provincial Councils/Local Authorities Media The two newspapers Daily News and Dinamina published by Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd. have been identified and selected. Advantages of different sources of data There was no database in Sri Lanka where past disaster data and information have been collected and maintained before the initiation of the Sri Lanka Disaster Information System. Initially, it was believed that data collection at the level of Divisional Secretariats would suffice for disaster management. Later, it came to be understood that the data maintained even at the level of Divisional Secretariats was not sufficient. Also, when the data is collected it should cover all disasters as far as possible. In consideration of the above-mentioned points it was revealed that the following results could be obtained by collecting data from various sources: The government organizations have data only on the recent past, but it is possible to obtain basic historical disaster data that dates back many more years with the assistance of newspapers. The reports in areas that had been affected as a result of disasters are published in the newspapers correctly at the level of Divisional Secretariat or GN. The data that government organizations had collected had been for the purpose of granting assistance to the affected, i.e. information of those who were eligible for aid and those who provided assistance were recorded. In these instances, it is possible that there is a difference between the recorded data and the actual data. However, the newspapers do the reporting of these news items without any basis for aid and assistance. When information on past disasters was gathered from government organizations, researchers found that the dates of the disasters were not recorded correctly. In certain instances, only the date of the incident, the date on which relief aid was requested and the date on which relief aid was given were recorded. And in the same way, there were instances where the year or the month and the year were recorded, but the correct date or the most near date of the incident could be found in newspapers. The data cannot be entered into DesInventar unless the year, month and day of the disaster event are known. Various government organizations collect the data on one disaster but respond separately in the affected sectors. In the same manner, various organizations collect the information of effects of the same sector and respond to them separately. Only under these circumstances, the information has to be collected from all concerned government organizations. Problems faced while collecting relevant data from various sources In newspapers: \u2022\ufffd Data on damages caused by disasters is given only at the district and the national levels. 53 ANNEX III \u2013 DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN SRI LANKA \u2022\ufffd Some calamities are reported inadequately in the news print. In the majority of instances, the newspapers report only the damages caused to people, properties and crops. \u2022\ufffd When there are minimal effects and when such incidents are taking place continuously, such news are sparingly reported in newspapers. \u2022\ufffd The same incident is reported in the newspapers for only a couple of days. \u2022\ufffd Government organizations have data only for a very short period of time (less than 5 years). \u2022\ufffd There are instances where the effects of disasters are not being reported as the collection of data is based", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e300a233-3023-465a-829a-9300408e18ea": {"__data__": {"id_": "e300a233-3023-465a-829a-9300408e18ea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "57d99a321c7f5fefde1ffd9da8bec954e869c8ce27f6d2325a398dab55a10fc8"}}, "hash": "57d99a321c7f5fefde1ffd9da8bec954e869c8ce27f6d2325a398dab55a10fc8", "text": "only for the purpose of relief aid. There are problems in summarizing all the information as every individual organization have been collecting the effects of one single disaster in various types of formats, and also only as relevant to one\u2019s own field of interest. And in some of these instances, the damages caused by each disaster have not been identified separately. Example 1 If there had been floods along with landslides and some other calamity on the same day, all the incidents are reported as either floods or that of landslide, or as both. Disaster data is not collected at the level of either the Divisional Secretaries Division, GN Division or by all the concerned organizations. In certain cases, only the place of occurrence is mentioned. In such occasion, the DMC has to find out the Divisional Secretaries area where the incident had taken place. Example 2 For damages caused by wild elephants, only the addresses where the incidents had taken place are reported. Similarly, in case of a fire, the fire brigade that attended to it reports the address of the place of incident only. Certain organizations base their collection of data on their subject area only, and as required by their administrative units. As a result, there are problems in separating such data at the level of Divisional Secretaries. Example 3 The information on communicable diseases is reported based on the requirements of the Ministry of Health Units. Lessons learned While considering the existence of original information and the data preserved with them in respect of past disasters to make proper use of the original information, both the government organizations and newspapers are very important and valuable. If the DMC wants to make use of the data for effective management, it is very important that such data is collected at the level of the GN divisions, as it is the lowest level in the administrative set up. The basic data on all the incidents is very valuable in the analysis of correct data and information during the particular period along with how such incidents had an impact on various fields. For this purpose the data has to be collected through many original sources. The government organizations as well as the district level organizations should pay more attention when collecting original data and information. Certain districts have disaster data that is inherent for those districts only, and there are instances where such data and information are not available at the national level. After conducting an extensive survey, it is very important to trace the original source to explore as to which is the most suitable before collecting the required data. Example The DMC collected information on contagious diseases with the assistance of past newspapers, and the relevant data had be collected again by going through the end of week reports prepared and maintained by the unit that has been established for the control of contagious diseases by the Department of Health. 15. Data collection process: From daily newspapers. The collection of data was carried out from the beginning of August 2006 to the end of September 2006. Ten Research Assistants were recruited for this exercise, and they were all graduates. They were given substantial training at the beginning about disaster management, types of disasters and the methods adopted in data collection. As the newspapers could not be taken out of the premises where they have been preserved for the collection of the required data, all extracts of reports found in the above- mentioned daily newspapers were photographed with digital cameras and thereafter, all such news extracts photographed were printed. A form was designed and the Research Assistants had to fill in the form accordingly, taking all the facts appearing in every newspaper report, facilitating the collection of the required data. All the forms that had been duly filled were filed along with the extracts of the particular news report. The research assistants were recruited by UNDP through the private organization named \u201cB Connected\u201d and they were paid a monthly remuneration. 54 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Government organizations The collection of data through government organizations was carried out on two occasions. They were done separately taking national organizations first and the district level organizations thereafter. Collection and the recording of data from the national level organizations were carried out from November 2006 to January 2007. In this connection, national level organizations were earmarked by disaster type: \u2022\ufffd Communicable diseases \u2013 Epidemiological Unit, Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition \u2022\ufffd Human and wild elephant conflicts \u2013 Department of Wildlife Conservation \u2022\ufffd", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5f2e4a98-9b97-4679-9612-33794aa13a30": {"__data__": {"id_": "5f2e4a98-9b97-4679-9612-33794aa13a30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "48a6419f5795f0908b1dac882967e0eec4f2902484780713f8878d23475d6b7b"}}, "hash": "48a6419f5795f0908b1dac882967e0eec4f2902484780713f8878d23475d6b7b", "text": "Fire hazards \u2013 Fire Service Department of Colombo Municipal Council \u2022\ufffd Provision of Relief Aid \u2013 Department of Social Services (up to the year 2004) All these organizations were coordinated by the DMC. Each of these organizations had in their possession the related data in all types of formats, and all such documents were available in written form, but permission was not granted to take the original documents out of the government offices. Three Research Assistants were engaged in this activity and they photographed all original documents in each organization, and the DMC had them printed subsequently. The Research Assistants thereafter filled up the relevant forms based on the information printed out, and were filed along with the related forms that had been completed. The data collected from the national level organizations was in different formats, while the names of the related Divisional Secretaries divisions had not been included, except for the addresses of the places of incidents. Example \u2022\ufffd The data on fires was in existence only in relation to the address of the place of the fire. \u2022\ufffd Incidents of damages caused by wild elephant were indicated by the place of the incident, or the address of the place of resident of the person subjected to damage. Government organizations at the district level Collection of data from government organizations at the district level was carried out in two stages with the assistance and cooperation of the following: \u2022\ufffd Office of the District Secretary \u2022\ufffd Office of the Divisional Secretary \u2022\ufffd Department of Agrarian Services \u2022\ufffd Fire Brigade Unit of the Local Authority \u2022\ufffd Office of Wildlife Conservation Department \u2022\ufffd DDMCU Stage 1 The first stage was conducted in 12 districts from January to May 2007. \u2022\ufffd Initially, a programme was conducted to educate all the District Disaster Management Coordinators as to how the data had to be collected and the manner in which relevant ideas and facts could be obtained. \u2022\ufffd Thereafter, the District Disaster Management Coordinators trained a group of persons selected from the district unit. \u2022\ufffd A form evolved for the collection of data. It was prepared and printed, and given to the respective DDMCUs to be sent to the respective Divisional Secretary\u2019s offices for the officers there to collect the necessary information. \u2022\ufffd The data of the Divisional Secretariats was given by the Social Service Officers and the GN Officers and this information was certified as correct by the Divisional Secretaries. \u2022\ufffd Travelling expenses were paid to those who were sent to Divisional Secretaries Divisions to obtain the required data with the assistance of UNDP through the District Secretary. \u2022\ufffd The District Secretary directed the collection of data within the district and the DDMCU gave their fullest cooperation in this exercise. \u2022\ufffd The collection of data was coordinated by the DMC and UNDP. Stage 2 Data collection in the second stage was carried out in 13 districts from October 2007 to March 2008. \u2022\ufffd Programmes to raise awareness of those in the selected organizations within every district were conducted. \u2022\ufffd With the concurrence of those organizations, one officer was selected to represent the respective organizations within every division, and the forms for the collection of data were given to that particular officer. \u2022\ufffd In this exercise, Social Service Officers represented the District Secretaries Offices, and the District Agricultural Officers represented the Department of Agrarian Services. Two Social Service Officers were selected to represent the Central Government as well as the Provincial Councils in a few of the districts. 55 ANNEX III \u2013 DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN SRI LANKA \u2022\ufffd All documents indicating the information required were directed to the DDMCU through the District Secretary with his/her certification. Challenges in data collection process The existence of data in varied formats in the national level organizations. Examples \u2022\ufffd Data on fire hazards is maintained in accordance with the address of the place of incident. The Fire Brigade does not maintain the details of damages and losses caused. \u2022\ufffd Data on wild elephant hazards includes only address of the person who had been subjected to the danger. Data on the damages caused and those who were subjected to the perils are not reflected, but only mentioned as either loss of life or damage to property. On certain occasions, a rough estimate of the damages is mentioned and only the sum of money received in respect of that damage is indicated. Some organizations are in the habit of collecting the data based on their administrative unit requirement and connected to their subject matter.

Several organizations have been collecting the effects of one single disaster in various types of formats, and the data is only relevant to one\u2019s own field of interest. Example \u2022\ufffd The wildlife conservation offices maintain the data as reported to them in respect of harm done to lives of people and damages to property. The data on the damages to crops by elephants is directed to either the Provincial Councils or National Relief Services Centre. If such agricultural crops have been insured, the information is reported to the Agriculture Insurance Department. The majority of government departments collect and maintain the data only for the purpose of giving relief aid. Therefore the details of those who do not qualify to receive relief aid, but are adversely affected, are not reported or recorded. Detailed information in government organizations at District and Divisional Secretaries\u2019 areas on the damages and adverse effects caused to the people during previous disasters is present only for a period of five years or less. According to the normal system followed in government departments, information beyond the five years is sent to the Department of Archives or is destroyed. All information exists in the form of written reports in various types of formats, and annually the files are changed. Accordingly, when it is required to refer to information pertaining to former incidents, these officers are compelled to search for them in all the files, which is very time consuming. These officers are not bound legally to supply these data directly to the DMC, and further, they require additional time for such an exercise. When indicating the date of an incident, in some instances only the year is mentioned, and on other occasions, the month and the year only. If in a district other disasters occurs along with floods such as landslides, adverse effects of these other disasters are presented as from floods only, and data has not been collected on the other incidents. 16. Data validation: Data entry process Data entry was done at the DMC. For this exercise three Data Entry Officers were employed. They were recruited by UNDP on a short-term contract, and worked under the supervision of the Disaster Inventories Associate. The data was entered through a computer network installed at the DMC. The main database was established in one computer and the data was entered through other computers at the Centre. No effort was made to maintain the database separately at any instance, and to enter all the data later and put them together. Accordingly no problems were encountered while entering the data. However, it will be very important to set up a mechanism to enter the data separately while using it, and to collect it together subsequently. All organizations at the national and district levels possess low technological facilities, and as a result, use of the Internet as well as computer network facilities are not possible. Process of validation The information on disasters and their effects are recorded in a two-fold system. \u2022\ufffd The Grama Seva Officer conveys the information on disasters and their adverse effects in his division to the Divisional Secretary who in turn refers the information to the District Secretary. During this process the Divisional Secretary or the District Secretary refers the same information to any other responsible organization in the area. \u2022\ufffd In certain instances the information is reported directly to the state organization. 56 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases Examples \u2022\ufffd Information on communicable diseases or any other such diseases are sent to the health-related, authorities, and road accidents to the hospitals or police stations. \u2022\ufffd Impact on different sectors is conveyed to the following organizations: \u2013 Telecommunications \u2013 telecom organizations \u2013 Highways \u2013 District Councils/Provincial Councils/ Central Government \u2013 Water supply \u2013 National Water Supply and Drainage Board \u2013 Fisheries \u2013 Department of Fisheries \u2013 Education \u2013 Department of Education \u2013 Health \u2013 Ministry of Health The information on specific disasters and their adverse effects are reported through a few relevant organizations. \u2022\ufffd Wild elephant damage \u2013 Loss of life and damage to property to the Department of Wildlife Conservation; damage to agricultural crops to the Provincial Council or National Relief Services Centre. \u2022\ufffd Communicable and non-communicable diseases \u2013 Relevant information to hospitals and health centres; relief/aid to the National Relief Services Centre. \u2022\ufffd Fires \u2013 Fire brigade units of local authorities or police stations;", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a9565b6-6369-4a12-a39a-241506897f86": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a9565b6-6369-4a12-a39a-241506897f86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16e88ed16b769ce5476b5d5aec39da540e97b9afad80166ce9f0798c165388cb"}}, "hash": "16e88ed16b769ce5476b5d5aec39da540e97b9afad80166ce9f0798c165388cb", "text": "the damages caused to District Secretary\u2019s office or any other relevant organization. Similarly, many organizations collect information of adverse effects on the same field through various disasters. \u2022\ufffd Damages caused to agricultural crops \u2013 Where crops are insured data is sent to the Agricultural Insurance Board; crops not insured to National Disaster Relief Services Centre; and small category disasters are dealt with by the Provincial Councils. The accumulation of information on disasters and reporting are done with the intention of expecting aid or to grant aid. Aid or assistance will be granted only if the required conditions are fulfilled (the circular letter 2007/10 issued by the National Disaster Relief Services Centre gives further details). According to this circular there are many instances where the information of those who have been subjected to disasters and those who did not receive any aid or assistance are not revealed. When aid is granted, the following requirements have to be fulfilled by the recipients: \u2022\ufffd The family\u2019s monthly income should be less than Rs. 3,000 to be eligible for relief aid under small-scale and out spread disasters. \u2022\ufffd Relief aid is awarded to those living in temporary centres irrespective of the family income. \u2022\ufffd Aid is granted on behalf of the deceased even if their income is a little above Rs. 3,000 per month. \u2022\ufffd In granting aid to damaged housing, the monthly income should be less that Rs. 3,000. No aid is given for business premises and for public buildings. After considering all the above factors and the correctness of the data, the following course of action was followed: \u2022\ufffd Identifying the organizations at national and district levels from where complete information could be collected, giving preference for the data collected from those organizations in respect of disasters. Examples \u2022\ufffd Communicable diseases \u2013 Epidemiology Unit, Ministry of Health \u2022\ufffd Kidney diseases \u2013 Kidney clinics \u2022\ufffd Relief aid \u2013 National Disaster Relief Service Centre \u2022\ufffd Floods, landslides, lightning strikes, high winds \u2013 GN Officers, Divisional Secretaries and District Secretaries Preference is given to organizations that are responsible for obtaining data connected to various hazards. Examples \u2022\ufffd The effects on the lives of people at the time of a disaster could be obtained from GN Officers and Divisional Secretaries, through District Secretaries. \u2022\ufffd Granting of relief/aid \u2013 National Disaster Relief Services Centre and Provincial Council. The DMC has been compelled to obtain data from various organizations depending on the nature of the disaster and the sector, and resulting damages. Obtaining information from newspapers is being carried on a continuous basis and it is very useful to identify the incident right at the beginning. Quality control mechanisms put in place \u2022\ufffd Before the data is entered into the computer they were recorded in a specially prepared form called a data card. \u2022\ufffd Initially, the forms were filled and completed with the data collected from the newspapers, and thereafter, such data was entered in the computer. \u2022\ufffd Again new forms were filled with the information collected from national level government 57 ANNEX III \u2013 DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN SRI LANKA organizations. And thereafter, that data was compared with the data already computerized, and entries were updated or entered as new data as appropriate. \u2022\ufffd While collecting data from the organizations at the district level the particular form was used directly. Information obtained by using the format was compared again with the data in the database and they too were updated as necessary or entered as new data. \u2022\ufffd All these forms were filed along with the initial reports according to the year of the incident of disaster. The accuracy was established in the data as mentioned above by obtaining the required data from various selected original sources. The field (variable) used for the collection of data on the effects of disasters in different areas was designated to suit the country context. Example \u2022\ufffd The people who were affected by epidemics were entered as affected; but in other countries such people had been entered as injured. Examples of issues with data \u2022\ufffd A disaster that took place on one particular day was given in different original sources of information as happened on various dates. In this respect, prominence was given to the most suitable original source of information. \u2022\ufffd In certain original sources, the data on the very same occurrence had been given at the district and divisional levels. In such instances, the data pertaining to District Secretary divisions was entered into the computer separately from those of the district.

And in the same way, the numbers of families had been mentioned without indicating the number of persons affected. In such instances, it was considered that a family consisted of five members. \u2022\ufffd There were cases where data on several disasters that had taken place on the very same day in two locations in the same Divisional Secretary\u2019s division was recorded in one single report. In such instances, the adverse effects due to each calamity were identified separately. When such separation was not possible only the data on the location of each disaster was entered separately in the database. \u2022\ufffd The information received at the time of a disaster or immediately after such an occurrence, was not entered in the database immediately after the receiving such information. Entering of such data in the database was carried out only after confirming the accuracy and after comparing the information received once a full assessment of the damage had been conducted. 17. Analysis: Type of analysis undertaken A preliminary data analysis report was presented in June 2007. The principle intention of this presentation was to provide an understanding of existing data and their analysis to those employed in the organizations at the national and district levels. How the analysis was done The analysis was done at the national and district levels on a few selected disasters and their effects. The basic analysis tool found in DesInventar was used in this exercise. The data connected with the disasters that had taken place from the year 1974 to 2006 was the basis of this analysis. Analysis undertaken by UNDP and the DMC. Dissemination of analysis The presentation of the analysis report was ceremonially performed by the Secretary of M/DM&HR in 2007. At the same time, the database was made available online. Use of analysis (by decision makers for planning activities/allocating funding for disaster planning/ preparedness) This analysis available on the Internet was made use of by various organizations for obtaining various information that are related to their disaster management activities, but to date, the data and the information prepared have not been used for planning or prioritization of related programmes. Further, the data has not been made use of to identify the most disastrous calamities and the areas that have been affected by these disasters in the immediate past. The following factors have been identified as the reasons for not using this information practically and in a useful manner: \u2022\ufffd Data collection is not complete and not all data validated. \u2022\ufffd The lack of a perceived need for an analysis of the data in the level of GN Officers or Divisional Secretaries. 58 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases \u2022\ufffd Non-existence of required guidelines for identifying \u2013 \u2013 The areas affected by regular disasters in Divisional Secretary divisions and GN divisions. \u2013 Divisional Secretary\u2019s divisions or GN divisions that are prone to given disasters. \u2013 The most devastating disaster in a given District and Divisional Secretary\u2019s area. \u2022\ufffd The database has not been introduced separately to the relevant organizations at the national and district levels. 18. Use by government and non-government agencies: \u2022\ufffd All districts do not succumb to the same disaster, and there are disasters that are inherent to each district. If there is more than one disaster to which a given district is prone, the particular disaster that brings about the largest amount of damage must be identified. All Divisional Secretary Divisions in a District are not subjected to danger in the same level and they vary in different areas. \u2022\ufffd It is important to identify the areas that are subjected to heavy damages and uncertainty while attending to give assistance in respect of each of disaster. In the same way it is important to identify the adverse effects of disasters if concentrations for relief activities are confined only to pre-determined areas. 19. Sustainability: This programme of activities is performed by the M/ DM&HR and the DMC, including the maintenance of the database. UNDP provides the required financial and technical assistance. The maintenance and updating of the database is done by the DMC while coordinating with the organizations at national and district levels. DDMCUs have been established in all districts of Sri Lanka. They coordinate the disaster management activities of the district under the direction of the District Secretary. Further these units will conduct the collection and updating of the database within that particular district.

DMC has increased accessibility to the database by making it available online on the Internet. The DMC is also agreeable to providing necessary assistance to any organization preferring to maintain a database of its own. The DMC has established in its premises an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) that is functioning on a 24/7 basis, i.e., all 7 days of the week and 24 hours every day. This EOC coordinates with all DDMCUs during emergencies. Also, it is the responsibility of these units to update the database in the future at the national level. The first training programme to train a group of national and district level officers on building the database was held in 2006. The second training programme was held in June 2007 for selected officers covering those using database and updating it at the district level, District Secretariat and the DDMCUs. Selected officers from nine districts participated in this programme. Thereafter, a computer and the database were provided to each of these district units. The DMC introduced a common form for data collection that could be used at the time of disasters in the districts through the District Secretary, as various organizations use different types of forms at such times. Now these responsible organizations submit the information within 24 hours of the disaster in the presented form. The Centre conducts various types of informative programmes at the district level at present, in order to further strengthen the system of reporting the information about disasters. At present, the DMC is contemplating the use of school children to report minor but frequently occurring incidents, with the assistance of the GN Officers. These types of incidents are underreported in the present system. The centre has plans to conduct another training programme for a selected group of officers covering all districts, and to provide those districts with computer facilities and the Internet with access to the database system. Trained personnel in all districts are expected to participate in the preparation of reports and other related activities at the district level. 20. What enabling factors contributed to successful implementation of the database? Identifying relevant government organizations and providing appropriate guidance and support. \u2022\ufffd Technical and financial assistance provided by UNDP CO and RCB. \u2022\ufffd Collection of data to suit the country context in proper stages and establishing their accuracy. \u2022\ufffd Plan activities after identifying the actual requirements to suit the country context and making use of them appropriately. 59 ANNEX III \u2013 DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASE IMPLEMENTATION IN SRI LANKA 21. What factors contributed to delays in the implementation of DesInventar? \u2022\ufffd Various organizations responsible for collecting disaster data, but not delivering outputs in time. \u2022\ufffd Inadequacy of exchange of relevant data and insufficiency of coordination between the respective organizations. \u2022\ufffd Existence of the available data in different types, as such data has been collected to suit the requirements of individual organizations. \u2022\ufffd Spending a long time to collect the data with the assistance of government officers, as this is not a part of their regular duties. \u2022\ufffd Non-existence of a direct and efficient system to report the related news at the instance of disaster. \u2022\ufffd Receiving information that is different from one another that have been recorded from various sources. 22.

How has this database increased UNDP and the governments\u2019 role in disaster loss coordination/ disaster mitigation/disaster planning/ preparedness? With the use of a database of this nature, the DMC, UNDP and other organizations could obtain the required information for various activities of disaster management: \u2022\ufffd Planning of disaster management programmes after identifying the disasters prevalent in each and every district and also the area that are most prone, and give such areas preferential attention. \u2022\ufffd Identifying areas that have been subjected to more calamities for the purpose of identifying mitigation activities. \u2022\ufffd Conducting pre-disaster and preparedness programmes and workshops depending on the information of damages caused as a result of past disasters and in accordance with the disaster patterns of such areas. \u2022\ufffd Planning of long-term programmes after identifying the pattern of each and every disaster taking place in each and every area along with their period of time. \u2022\ufffd Identifying disasters that occur as a result of modern tendencies and the areas that have been subjected to tragic circumstances as a result of such disasters, and arrange programmes to prevent them. 25. What do you feel are the key lessons that have been learnt in the establishment of the database? \u2022\ufffd Identify and understand the legal capacity and status, as well as the organizational set up when selecting government organizations to manage disasters. \u2022\ufffd Identify ways in which data can be used to suit the requirements of the country and its disaster management activities. \u2022\ufffd Obtain an accurate understanding right at the beginning about the data to be collected, in respect of disasters and their definitions. \u2022\ufffd Plan the collection of relevant data only after identifying the original sources, the form in which the data exists, and the present systems in operation. \u2022\ufffd Decide on the administration unit for the purpose of data collection, taking into consideration the capacity of the lowest unit formed for the purpose as well as the most important administrative unit in the use of this data. \u2022\ufffd Prepare and draw up a proper system in order to establish the genuineness to suit the original sources of information from where the data is being collected. \u2022\ufffd Prepare the analysis of data in such a manner that suits the requirements prevailing in the country. \u2022\ufffd Collect the data from selected original sources accepted by the government. The data should also be suitable to the country. \u2022\ufffd Customize the database to suit the requirements of the country. 26. What aspects of the implementation of the database could be replicated in other countries? In deciding the administrative unit for the purpose of collecting the data, every consideration has to be made on the ability of the unit to collect the data through the lowest unit as well as in the usage of this data. \u2022\ufffd At the beginning, the District Secretary\u2019s division was selected as the lowest administrative unit taking into consideration the way in which the data is presented as well as technical reasons, but later it was decided to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "326a0a79-69b4-4630-b40e-ee0902b4d3fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "326a0a79-69b4-4630-b40e-ee0902b4d3fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "504b432d9d4464a11d7e4acee47212e2cb087f0bf03e1269d105ccbae884cf78"}, "3": {"node_id": "86e04dc4-05d9-44db-bfea-9130de84a3c9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dbaf08160c7fa7a81f33c4e14578641fadfa7c892cf901875186350538706c11"}}, "hash": "583ecce0b02fa78f9aea2ecd92103adcef8d3a960132bb38358d2672d3fa6c31", "text": "collect and enter the data at the level of the Grama Seva Officers depending on the requirements of the usage of such data. 27.

Background Over the past few decades, disaster losses worldwide have grown exponentially. In parallel with this there has been a growing awareness within the disaster management community for greater impetus on comprehensive disaster risk management rather than just post-disaster relief or better response preparedness. However, this growing awareness has yet to adequately translate into tangible action that is focused on systematic risk management across all sectors and across all geographic levels. On the ground in actual implementation, post-disaster relief and response (and at the most better response preparedness) for big disasters (rather than small, medium and large disasters) remains the dominant paradigm.

These approaches are very useful and rigorous. However, in most situations, this can be very expensive and time consuming. While an inductive approach carried out to its last step, will be extremely valuable (and neat), experience shows that it takes four to five years to yield results that can be used for risk reduction planning on a large scale. In such a context, analysis of a systematic geo-referenced inventory of small-, medium- and large-scale disasters could help provide surrogate indicators for disaster risk. Systematic tracking of occurrence of small and medium disasters along with the large disasters will provide the necessary disaster intelligence to keep a tab on the emerging patterns of disaster risk and then look at the underlying causes. Such a deductive approach could corroborate the inductive approaches outlined in the previous paragraph. One of the objectives of the Government of India\u2013UNDP Disaster Risk Management Project is networking knowledge on effective approaches, methods and tools for disaster risk management, developing and promoting policy frameworks at State and National levels. The project, launched in 169 multi-hazard prone districts of 17 states is being executed by the Ministry of Home Affairs with UNDP\u2019s support. The implementation of the project in these states would be the responsibility of the respective state government. Under this project, the Ministry of Home Affairs and UNDP plans to prepare Vulnerability and Risk Reduction Reports to facilitate integration of vulnerability reduction into development programmes, and appropriate and effective allocation of resources to the needy states. Better understanding of the vulnerabilities of various areas and the developments that have led to the increase/decrease of it would give an indication of the areas that the government will have to focus. The Ministry of Home Affairs and UNDP propose to undertake this exercise in collaboration with the state nodal agencies and research institutes in various states, with the involvement of other stakeholders. On a pilot basis, an effort towards building an inventory was undertaken at Tamil Nadu, and 30 years of data has been collected at present. The analysis of the database will contribute to a comprehensive report on vulnerabilities in the State. There is a need to upscale this initiative and do similar inventorization and analysis for the whole country. Under the UNDP-GoTN Disaster Management Programme, Indisdata methodology is adopted for the analysis of temporal and spatial distribution of the disasters and its effect on life, livelihood, economy, etc. and to establish its linkage with development. III. Objectives The broad objective of the Indisdata Project in Tamil Nadu State, is to create systematic disaster inventories for the last 30 years (1977\u20132007) to facilitate an analysis of existing hazards, vulnerabilities and risks experienced across space and time. This analysis of past trends will also have prospective implications that can be projected through analyses of trends and variable patterns. The final purpose is to utilize the disaster inventories collected through the Indisdata system, to build a platform for risk management activities that address the disaster management cycle; from mitigation to post-disaster response and recovery. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of vulnerability and risk growth requires a sound basis in documents and records including past and present disasters. In view of this, the key objectives of this project are to: \u2022\ufffd Identify the key hazards in the state of Tamil Nadu \u2022\ufffd Develop a continually updated database of losses from disasters \u2022\ufffd Obtain data in a quick, efficient and cost-effective way \u2022\ufffd Identify the pattern, frequency, distribution and effects in space and time and its linkage with development \u2022\ufffd Analyse the response mitigation measures taken in the past and its effect on the pattern Apart from the above-mentioned objectives at the state level, it is proposed that a vulnerability report should be prepared using the data collected. The next steps could be the institutionalization of the Indisdata system through GoTN.

General Background The Indian Ocean Tsunami disaster of 26 December 2004 was one of the most devastating natural disasters in recent history. Within minutes, almost 200,000 lives were lost, populations were displaced, and livelihoods, homes and infrastructure were destroyed, setting back hard-earned development gains for decades. UNDP through its country offices and disaster reduction and recovery experts has since the Tsunami\u2013in support of national and local authorities \u2013 provided humanitarian and recovery assistance to the affected population. In support of these country interventions a UNDP-BCPR Regional Tsunami Recovery Programme has been technically assisting UNDP Country Offices in mainstreaming risk reduction into the recovery process. The Regional Programme (RP) under the auspices of the Regional Centre in Bangkok has been providing technical assistance to the Tsunami affected countries in the areas of \u2018Information Management, \u2018Training & Learning\u2019 and Early Warning Systems, since November 2005. The Information Management component of the Regional Programme was designed to achieve \u2018Increased capacity for analysing disaster trends and their application in decision-making.\u2019 To meet this outcome, the RP has been advocating and supporting development of disaster loss databases using DesInventar11 tool in the five tsunami affected countries, viz. India (Tamil Nadu state), Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. 11 DesInventar was developed in late 1993 by the Network for Social Studies on Disaster Prevention in Latin America (LA RED). The Regional Programme has extended its support to the 5 countries by way of supporting a full time staff, imparting technical training to the staff, providing opportunities for sharing and exchanging experiences, and technical support in developing work plan and the implementation of activities. There has been mixed progress in each of the 5 countries on account of various factors such as \u2013 enactment of legislation and establishment of national disaster management institutions after the 2004 tsunami, competing priorities in response to tsunami recovery according less importance to compilation of disaster inventories, capacity of institutions, etc. While there has been a clear acknowledgement of the usefulness of the disaster loss databases for disaster risk reduction, its role and integration with the existing legal and institutional frameworks is yet to evolve to ensure its institutionalization and sustainability. Prior to the launch of the Regional Programme in November 2005, first disaster loss database in Asia was developed in the state of Orissa (India) in 2002, and later in Nepal. However, it is to be noted here that such a coordinated and coherent effort of building disaster loss database across the five tsunami- affected countries has been undertaken in Asia for the first time by UNDP to support disaster risk reduction and there have been rich experiences gained, important lessons learnt and notable progress made in the tsunami-affected countries. During the implementation of disaster loss database in the tsunami-affected countries, there has been need and demand expressed by other non-tsunami countries such as Nepal, Pakistan and Iran for technical support and participation in the programme activities.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bc4c022-33bd-49fd-b852-5c46760d78e4": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bc4c022-33bd-49fd-b852-5c46760d78e4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "537d61723ff5cd51eaa39e470c7f91b3a7a9312144d07a0239839bda90a4b70f"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca30a375-027f-4935-a722-b19aa28b1e16", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d7728d2b6691a062ec9c2652c8862364cdb1e6126d137195969a21006f313ba6"}}, "hash": "07a378b1dfb21d7e137dfa305787c241cf6783a94f410b82c332205e045b7ac5", "text": "Within India, disaster loss databases are in various stages of development in several states in northern and southern part of India, while the Regional Programme\u2019s support and activities are limited to the state of Tamil Nadu.

Overview of Progress The following provides an overview of the basic set-up and progress in each country. A. Country Level India: The disaster loss database in India is being implemented in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, which was hit by the 2004 tsunami. The Revenue Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu, the government agency for disaster risk reduction in the state, has been engaged since the beginning to guide and to support the implementation of the database. As per the instructions of the Tamil Nadu government, the two DesInventar Associates contacted a number of agencies in the state and all the 30 districts to collect data on the disasters and their impacts in the state. Numerous visits were made to the districts to collect historical disaster data from the official records. The data collected has been entered in the system and it can be used for understanding and analysing disaster trends and their impacts in space and time. Since the beginning of the implementation of DesInventar in Tamil Nadu, the following events were organized: 1. Stakeholders\u2019 Consultation Meeting, 29 March 2006, Chennai: To present the methodology to the stakeholders and to identify the sources of historical disasters data. 2. State Level Training Workshop, 27\u201328 September 2006, Chennai: The workshop was aimed at imparting training to the district officials on using the DesInventar tool. 3. Stakeholders\u2019 Meeting, 29 September 2006, Chennai: Preliminary finding from the analysis of data was shared at the meeting. The database has been further cross-checked and updated with various relevant sources within Government of Tamil Nadu. As of January 2008, about 13,000 data cards were entered in the system. An analysis of the historical disaster database is underway. Indonesia: The Indonesian database was developed and hosted by UNDP Jakarta office. A DesInventar Associate working from the Jakarta office collected the past historical data primarily from media sources. Due to the institutional restructuring for DRR in Indonesia, there was lack of clarity on the host of the disaster loss database and with the agreement of Bakornas PBP (National Coordinating Board for Disaster Management) the UNDP Jakarta supported the development of the database. The completed database with about 5,000 data cards was hosted at http://202.155.137.102/DesInventar. A National Workshop on Risk Knowledge was organized in Jakarta on 7 November 2006 to share the analysis of the data. About 40 stakeholders attended the workshop. Maldives: Following the tsunami of December 2004, initially the Ministry of Planning and National Development (MPND) was the host agency of the database. There were challenges in locating the sources of historical information. The MPND organized a Stakeholders\u2019 Meeting in May 2006 to identify potential sources of data from different ministries and departments. Simultaneously with the implementation of disaster loss database in the country, institutional restructuring for disaster risk reduction was going on which resulted in creation of National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) under the Ministry of Defense and National Security. The departure of the Associate in August 2006 negatively affected the data collection process and it also took significant amount of time to find a replacement. Overall, the progress in Maldives was slow due to institutional restructuring and lack of a full-time staff to undertake the work. 75", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3eb417ef-1a20-4194-ad06-a5e164e9dfc2": {"__data__": {"id_": "3eb417ef-1a20-4194-ad06-a5e164e9dfc2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b08867aa4aa71da263535a9f5bcc17f781daecd2907569fd0fbff8ac8aeddda"}, "3": {"node_id": "842f502f-2021-4e77-8ab8-3861d0687e90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "386c8ce08009651211e9e0d87a4eb11881df19f9923f281c871a25521a3624dc"}}, "hash": "16e61a67453d6c3a82e73d8e1076db565eb84c60387ac639cbe5e46335249964", "text": "ANNEX VIII \u2013 CONCEPT NOTE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOL-KIT AND DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASES Sri Lanka: In May 2005, the Government of Sri Lanka enacted a new legislation for Disaster Management and created the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) under Ministry of Disaster Management & Human Rights. The implementation of disaster loss database in Sri Lanka has been guided and supported by the DMC since the beginning. The Associate has been operating from the premises of the DMC. Sri Lanka had a disaster loss database developed by the National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) under Ministry of Social Welfare. After the training of the Associate in February 2006, the work in Sri Lanka started by undertaking a massive review and validation of the database. Significant amount of time was devoted in validating the database and a huge number of data cards were removed due of incomplete or incorrect information. Afterwards the Associate systematically started collecting data from various agencies and districts and it took significant amount of time to collect and enter data. Sri Lanka became the first country to publish a preliminary analysis of the database. The database provided inputs to the National Disaster Management Plan being developed by the DMC. The entire process was fully supported by the DMC. During the implementation, the following events were organized: \u2022\ufffd Stakeholders\u2019 Workshop in October 2006 \u2022\ufffd National Training Workshop in October 2006 The database was formally launched in June 2007. The database can be accessed at http://www.desinventar.lk. Thailand: The Department of Disaster Prevention & Mitigation (DDPM) of the Royal Thai Government has been the designated focal agency for the implementation of the disaster loss database in Thailand. Initial meeting with DDPM resulted in the need of a Thai version of the DesInventar tool. This prompted addition of Thai language interface to the DesInventar tool and helped it to become Unicode compliant. The Associate in Thailand worked closely with DDPM and as a result the DDPM constituted a Task Force for Overseeing the Implementation of disaster loss database in Thailand. The first meeting of the Task Force was convened in July 2006 and several recommendations were made to guide the implementation. The DDPM also made available it server for installation of the on-line version of DesInventar which was used by the Associate. Several rounds of formal and informal discussions were held with DDPM officials, yet no data was made available to the Associate to proceed further. Data collected from 2006 flood was entered to demonstrate the analytical abilities of the DesInventar tool, yet no further data was made available. B. Regional Level Since November 2005, the Regional Programme has organized the following events to help build disaster loss databases in the five countries: 1. Regional DesInventar Training Workshop, 6\u20139 February 2006, Bangkok: This was aimed at providing training to each of the DesInventar Associates implementing DesInventar in each country. 2. Workshop to improve the Compilation of Reliable Data on Disaster Occurrence and Impact, 2\u20134 April 2006, Bangkok: The workshop was organized jointly with Centre for Research on Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED), Belgium and Global Risk Identification Programme (GRIP) of UNDP. The workshop aimed at compiling and synthesizing experiences in Asia in the development, enhancement and maintenance of historical database development and disaster losses. 3. Regional Workshop on Improving Risk Knowledge, 14\u201316 November 2006, Bangkok: This workshop focused on discussing ways of improving risk knowledge and how risk knowledge is helpful is decision-making in recovery, risk reduction and development programmes. 4. Regional Workshop on Building Risk Knowledge: Enhancing Applications of Disaster Loss Databases, 2\u20134 July 2007: The workshop focused to provide 8 \u2018clinics\u2019 on the analysis and applications of the historical disaster data compiled by the countries. 5. Regional Technical Refresher Course on DesInventar, 4\u20135 December 2007, Bangkok: The Refresher Course was aimed at training the participants on some of the advance features of DesInventar and addressing the common issues faced by the countries. 6. Regional Inception Workshop on Extensive Risk, 6\u20137 December 2007, Bangkok: The objective of the Inception Workshop was to deepen understanding of and to analyse the trends and patterns caused by frequently occurring but localized disaster events, thus providing better understanding of human and physical losses using the historical disaster database developed by the tsunami affected countries.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "842f502f-2021-4e77-8ab8-3861d0687e90": {"__data__": {"id_": "842f502f-2021-4e77-8ab8-3861d0687e90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7b08867aa4aa71da263535a9f5bcc17f781daecd2907569fd0fbff8ac8aeddda"}, "2": {"node_id": "3eb417ef-1a20-4194-ad06-a5e164e9dfc2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16e61a67453d6c3a82e73d8e1076db565eb84c60387ac639cbe5e46335249964"}}, "hash": "386c8ce08009651211e9e0d87a4eb11881df19f9923f281c871a25521a3624dc", "text": "76 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases A Manual on DesInventar Server 7.0 was developed and also a Guide on Preliminary Analysis was made available. 4.

Deriving from the experiences of the Regional Programme, the following needs to be documented: \u2022\ufffd Process Documentation \u2022\ufffd Products, services and tools to support the disaster loss database \u2022\ufffd Role and functions of the Regional Programme \u2022\ufffd Guidelines for new countries intending to develop disaster loss databases Each one of these is discussed below. 4.1 Process Documentation Based on the extensive experience of implementing disaster loss database in the five countries, it is proposed to document the entire process of the implementation to share the experiences and lessons learned. Broadly the following specific areas are identified for documentation of the processes: 4.1.1 Enabling Environment: To pursue systematic and long-term disaster risk reduction, it is vital to have institutional and legal frameworks in place with clear roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders. A functioning national DRR agency with clear mandate and functions along-with appropriate budgetary support and technical staff are pre-requisite to implement long-term risk reduction measures. 4.1.2 Recruitment Process: Internal to UNDP (SSA/SC/ UNV) There have been different recruitment modalities pursued in each of the five countries. Although internal to UNDP system, it is important to review it with a view to drawing lessons with respect to different contract modalities at UNDP building disaster loss database. 4.1.3 Qualifications of the Associates: Based on the experience in the countries, it was noted that there are three important qualities required in the Associates for successful implementation of the disaster loss database: a. Appropriate level of IT skills to be able to effectively and efficiently understand the DesInventar methodology used for building the disaster loss database. This was required as an essential skill without which it would have been difficult for them to understand and manipulate the data and manage the database. Of course, persons with advance IT skills contributed to further development of the DesInventar tool. b. Ability to organize, coordinate and manage the data collection and entry process. Since all countries underwent the data collection and entry of several thousand records, these processes could have been better managed. c. Experience in working with government institutions. As government in each country in the primary owner of the data for disasters and their impacts, a good understanding of the functioning is required on the part of the Associates to get across various government departments at different levels. 4.1.4 Ownership of the Disaster Loss Database: There has been mixed experiences in the countries due to the evolving nature of the institutional systems for disaster risk reduction after the tsunami. Lack of clear mandated institution for disaster risk reduction has adversely affected the entire process of building the database as the ownership is not associated with an existing institution. 4.1.5 UNDP CO and National Government Partnership: This has played an important role in providing overall support to the development of disaster loss database. In countries where there has been good on-going partnership between national government DRR focal agency and UNDP CO, the collaboration has contributed positively to the development of the disaster loss database and also the usefulness of the database has been recognized. 4.1.6 Capacity and Support of UNDP CO: Since the development of disaster loss database has been supported and implemented through the UNDP COs in the five tsunami affected countries, the available capacity and support from the CO has been crucial in guiding the entire process of the database development. Where there was lack of available capacity and poor support, the sufficient progress has not been made. 4.1.7 Source(s) of Disaster Loss Data: There has been sufficient discussion about government versus media data, both at regional and country levels. Depending upon each country\u2019s context and the commitment and support from the government, each 77 ANNEX VIII \u2013 CONCEPT NOTE ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOL-KIT AND DOCUMENTATION OF DISASTER LOSS DATABASES country was encouraged to identify what it considered reliable and credible data. 4.1.8 Data Collection and Entry Process: Both data collection and entry have been significant time- consuming processes. Data collection has been paper-based where the data cards were filled for each lowest identified geographical unit and later they were complied centrally to allow entry after careful scrutiny. Data entry has been centralized requiring data entry operators to enter data simultaneously. 4.1.9 Data Validation and Quality Control: Even when the source of data is from government records, there have been inconsistencies in terms of reported losses. At times, careful discretion was required to arrive at the most accurate data. 4.1.10 On-Line Hosting of the Database: Although perceived to be less important, yet it was considered useful to host the database on the web for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a09e35b1-c811-4d87-8a63-542866b2959c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a09e35b1-c811-4d87-8a63-542866b2959c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc0e3b2944e5a94d518b360df7db8ca1524784567d70bff7511cb27973eb8861"}}, "hash": "cc0e3b2944e5a94d518b360df7db8ca1524784567d70bff7511cb27973eb8861", "text": "two reasons \u2013 it allows public access to the database and secondly it allows data entry from a number of remote points. Of course, the remote data entry feature was underutilized although it could have resulted in significant reduction of data entry time. 4.1.11 Analysis of the Disaster Loss Database: Preliminary analysis of historical disaster data was carried out in Sri Lanka and was published. The Analytical Report was formally launched by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of the Government of Sri Lanka. The DMC now plans to undertake a new version of the analysis since it has completed collection and verification of data for the entire island. Similar efforts are being made in Tamil Nadu where the process of data collection and entry is over. 4.2 Review of Products, Services and Tools to Support Processes There have been a number of products and tools required for supporting the processes involved in the implementation. It is also proposed to review these products and tools with a view to assess their efficacy in supporting the processes and to receive feedback to further improve them. 4.2.1 Training on DesInventar Tool There were 2 technical training courses organized under the Regional Programme. Feb 2006: Regional Training on DesInventar Methodology Dec 2007: Advance Technical Course on DesInventar The first course aimed at the newly recruited Associates to familiarize them with the DesInventar methodology and on-line data entry and analysis tool. The second training course was organized to impart training on some of the advance features of DesInventar tool. 4.2.2 Training Products The following training products have been produced: 1. User Manual for DesInventar Server version 7.0 2. Quick User Guide These were disseminated to the Associates. 4.2.3 Analysis Tools A Guidebook on undertaking Preliminary Analysis was developed and shared with the Associates. The Guidebook provides detailed account of various analytical features of the DesInventar tool. Necessary training and technical support for analysis was provided remotely and also during the training and missions. 4.2.4 Development of DesInventar Tool Prior to the Regional Programme, DesInventar software tool existed as a stand-alone tool. During the course of the implementation of the Regional Programme, a web version 7.0 was launched, it was made Unicode compliant and as a result Thai and Arabic languages were added to the web interface. There were several bugs identified and fixed. Need for more customization of the interface was noted and technical support was extended to address the needs of the countries. 4.2.5 Applications of Disaster Loss Database Integration of the disaster loss database in the overall disaster risk reduction framework of each country has yet to happen. In Sri Lanka, the loss data has been used in providing inputs to the National Disaster Management Plan also it has been used for reporting the disaster impacts in the aftermath of a flood disaster. However, its application as a tool to support policy and decision-making is yet to be achieved. 4.3 Role and Functions of the Regional Programme As stated earlier, this has been an undertaking of its first kind by UNDP to promote and support disaster loss databases 78 Risk Knowledge Fundamentals: Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases in the five tsunami-affected countries in Asia. The Regional Programme has supported these databases by providing technical support, opportunities for sharing and cross- learning, and by enhancing the DesInventar tool. A further assessment of the existing role needs to be made with a view to improving it, identifying the gaps and also strengthening its linkages with global programme such as GRIP. During the course of the implementation of the disaster loss databases, there have been new opportunities which need to be reviewed and analysed to address the needs of the disaster prone countries in Asia. The following factors play role in defining new role and function of the Regional Programme: \u2022\ufffd Rich experience of the implementation of the disaster loss database in the five tsunami-affected countries \u2022\ufffd Presence of experienced and trained Associates in the countries \u2022\ufffd Excellent working relationship with the UNDP COs in the region \u2022\ufffd Emerging needs and demands of non-tsunami countries for technical support \u2022\ufffd New opportunities to systematically implement disaster loss databases in the countries to better implement coherent and standardized databases 4.4 Guidelines for development of disaster loss databases by other countries (\u201cnon-tsunami\u201d) There has been participation by non-tsunami countries in the regional cross-learning and sharing events. The Regional Programme has not been able to attend to the requests from non-tsunami countries purely due to the inherent nature of the programme. The needs of the non-tsunami countries exist in the form of training,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f1672014-9363-4889-b32a-29c00b1386a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "f1672014-9363-4889-b32a-29c00b1386a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Guidelines and Lessons for Establishing and Institutionalizing Disaster Loss Databases", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c23a0df8814098cd7dc9e36d3dc56baac06acdddfaa844164b25417e7e0445c"}, "3": {"node_id": "e6cab11c-3643-4235-9038-f10b975efcf5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/guidelines-and-lessons-establishing-and-institutionalizing-disaster-loss-databases", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77d88d08087f26b299c74b08423b9d198ecb26febf3c2039312d47cd2181ac17"}}, "hash": "295b0d881e4cfb210e9d6a3fdfab811b2ee27f67958d3e9e68902b8322d2845c", "text": "orientation to the methodology and access to documentation, training materials, technical expertise, and support for customization of the DesInventar tool to each country\u2019s unique national context, etc. It is proposed to develop simple step-by-step guidelines to help the \u201cnon-tsunami\u201d countries. The guidelines will provide step-by-step process to assist a country develop its own disaster loss database. Such guidelines will be useful for the DRM staff of UNDP CO to help them better understand the entire process of building the disaster loss database, instead of undertaking a fragmented piece-meal approach. 5. Methodology for Undertaking Process Documentation The UNDP Regional Centre proposes to hire a consultant to undertake the documentation of the processes outlined above and develop guidelines for use by other countries planning to develop their own disaster loss databases. It is envisaged that two workshops attended by the Associates will be organized \u2013 first to introduce and to get feedback on the entire process of documentation and to capture commonalities and specificities of each country. The second workshop will allow the countries to review and discuss the final outputs. 6. Expected Outputs: The process documentation is expected to produce the following: \u2022\ufffd Documentation of the process in each of the 5 countries capturing the commonalities and specificities of each one of them \u2022\ufffd Analysis of the processes in each country with a view to drawing lessons and discuss the potential options/ issues with respect to institutionalization, sustainability and integration with the on-going DRR work in the country \u2022\ufffd Identification of the role of the Regional Programme in implementing and supporting the development of disaster loss database and propose the potential/ emerging role of the Regional Programme in support of the implementation/ facilitation and application of disaster loss database in the countries of Asia \u2022\ufffd Identification of the linkages with GRIP and outline potential areas and opportunities for collaboration \u2022\ufffd Development of list of reference materials for use by countries planning to implement disaster loss database \u2022\ufffd Step-by-step guide for the implementation of disaster loss database in \u201cnon-tsunami\u201d countries References: 1.

Working towards the outcome of \u2018Increased capacity for analysing disaster trends and their application in decision-making\u2019, the Regional Programme has been advocating and supporting development of disaster loss databases using DesInventar15 tool in the five tsunami affected countries, viz. India (Tamil Nadu state), Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Responding to the need of other countries and to continue to support disaster risk reduction, the Regional Programme has undertaken the documentation of the experiences with the view of helping the other \u201cnon-tsunami\u201d countries to build their respective disaster loss databases.16 It is hoped that the documentation will greatly help to capture the experiences from the tsunami-affected countries and to help develop simple guidelines for development of disaster loss databases. Attended by the focal points implementing disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries, this Scoping Workshop aims to start the process of the documentation. 14 Organized to document the experiences of disaster loss database implementation. 15 DesInventar was developed in late 1993 by the Network for Social Studies on Disaster Prevention in Latin America (LA RED). 16 For further

The following databases are available online: Tamil Nadu (India): http://www.indisdata-tn.gov.in Sri Lanka: http://www.desinventar.lk Indonesia: http://dibi.bnpb.go.id Starting in May 2008, the Regional Programme started the process of documenting knowledge and experiences of building disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries with the goal of developing simple guidelines for building disaster loss databases. A Scoping Workshop was organized in Bangkok on 29\u201330 May 2008 to discuss and identify key aspects of the implementation of disaster loss databases that need to be documented and to develop an outline of the Tool-Kit for disaster loss database. An International Consultant was hired by the Regional Programme to capture the experiences and analyse them to derive key lessons learned and challenges and produce steps for building the disaster loss database. Based on the collection of information and missions to the tsunami affected countries, a draft document has been prepared for review and finalization at the workshop scheduled on 25\u201326 September 2008. It is expected that the Regional Workshop will help to review and finalize the documentation by seeking inputs from the 17 Organized to finalize and validate the documentation of the experiences of disaster loss database implementation. 18 DesInventar was developed in late 1993 by the Network for Social Studies on Disaster Prevention in Latin America (LA RED). tsunami countries and other participating \u201cnon-tsunami\u201d countries planning to build their respective disaster loss databases.19 The workshop will be attended by the focal points implementing disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries. In addition selected \u201cnon-tsunami\u201d countries will also attend the workshop with a view to learning from the experiences of the tsunami affected countries and to know more about the processes involved in building a disaster loss database. Objectives of the workshop: The following are set as objectives of the workshop: \u2022\ufffd Review the draft documentation of implementation from each country/ state, including challenges and lessons learned \u2022\ufffd Share the experiences of the implementation of disaster loss databases in the tsunami affected countries with other countries attending the workshop \u2022\ufffd Review the consolidated implementation outline for new countries \u2022\ufffd Based on the experiences of the implementation, identify additional support that would improve the development of disaster loss database in other countries \u2022\ufffd Finalize documentation of the implementation in the tsunami countries and documentation for development/ printing of toolkit.

Only the loss caused by these events can be prevented. Information and Communications Technology (ICT) can be used to minimize this impact in many ways. ICT is used in almost all phases of the disaster management process. In the disaster mitigation and preparedness process, ICT is widely used to create early warning systems. An early warning system may use more than one ICT media in parallel and these can be either traditional (radio, television, telephone) or modern (SMS, cell broadcasting, Internet). As demonstrated by AlertNet, on-line media play an important role. In the immediate aftermath of a disaster, special software packages built for the purpose can be used for activities such as registering missing persons, administrating on-line requests and keeping track of relief organizations or camps of displaced persons. In addition, geographic information systems (GIS) and remote sensing software are being effectively used in all phases of disaster management. It is essential that ICT is given its due place in disaster management but it should also not be taken as panacea for all ills. ICT, like any other tool, can deliver its best when the other necessary ingredients are in place. W Whhyy DDiissaasstteerr M Maannaaggeem meenntt?? Disaster management (also called disaster risk management) is the discipline that involves preparing, warning, supporting and rebuilding societies when natural or man- made disasters occur. It is the continuous process by which all individuals, groups and communities manage hazards in an effort to avoid or minimize the impact of disasters resulting from hazards. Effective disaster management relies on thorough integration of emergency plans at all levels of government and non-government involvement. Activities at each level (individual, group, community) affect the other levels. Events over the last two years have shown that there is no country that does not stand the threat of a disaster. Countries like China, Indonesia, Iran and Pakistan are prone to earthquakes. Small Islands States in the Pacific region and countries like Maldives are prone to various types of threats from the sea. Bangladesh and parts of China and India experience floods each year. Therefore, disaster preparedness is no longer a choice; it is mandatory irrespective of where one lives. DDiissaasstteerr M Maannaaggeem meenntt aanndd tthhee M MDDG Gss It is somewhat surprising that no Millennium Development Goal1 (MDG) directly addresses the issues related to disaster management. Perhaps it is because it is so obvious that building a safer world is a prerequisite for the achievement of all the eight MDGs. Poverty eradication, freedom from hunger, primary education, freedom from disasters, and building a sustainable world etc. are all key aspects of the disaster management process. It has been shown that any nation should have effective disaster reduction and recovery processes in place to achieve the MDGs by the expected deadline of year 2015. 1 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) are eight goals to be achieved by 2015 that respond to the world's main development challenges. The MDGs are drawn from the actions and targets contained in the Millennium Declaration that was adopted by 189 nations and signed by 147 heads of state and governments during the UN Millennium Summit in September 2000.

These four phases usually overlap. ICT is being used in all the phases, but the usage is more apparent in some phases than in the others. IICCTT ffoorr DDiissaasstteerr M Miittiiggaattiioonn aanndd PPrreeppaarreeddnneessss The importance of timely disaster warning can never be underestimated. When the tsunami in 2004 hit several countries in the Asian region, it caused a loss of hundreds of thousands of human lives, because there was no timely disaster warning. The history repeated in Northern Pakistan in the Kashmiri earthquake nearly a year later. On the other hand, the US was relatively well prepared and could evacuate the population of New Orleans, and thus, minimized the number of deaths as a result of the hurricane Katrina in 2005, which was no less damaging than the Asian tsunami or Kashmiri earthquake. An early warning system involves several players and has many links. At one end there is the central authority that monitors and issues the warning. At the other end are the communities to whom the warning message is intended. In between, one or more channels are linking these two ends. This is where ICT plays the most crucial role. However, in this case it is not a question of one medium against another. The requirement is to pass the warning as quick and as accurate as possible. Any one - or a combination - of the following ICT and media tools can be used for that purpose. Radio and television: Considered the most traditional electronic media used for disaster warning, radio and television still have a valid use. The effectiveness of these two media is high because even in developing countries and rural environments where the tele-density is relatively low, they can be used to spread a warning quickly to a broad population. The only possible drawback of these two media is that their effectiveness is significantly reduced at night when they are normally switched off. Telephone (fixed and mobile): Telephones can play an important role in warning communities about the impending danger of a disaster. There were many examples of how simple phone warnings saved many lives in South Asian countries during the 2004 tsunami. Perhaps the most famous was an incident that occurred in one small coastal village of Nallavadu in Pondicherry, India. A timely telephone call - warning about the impending tsunami - was said to have saved the village\u2019s entire population of 3,600 inhabitants, as well as those of three neighbouring villages. Short Message Service (SMS): During the 2005 hurricane Katrina disaster in the US, many residents of affected coastal areas were unable to make contact with relatives and friends using traditional landline phones. However, they could communicate with each other via SMS more easily when the network was functional. This is because SMS works on a different band and can be sent or received even when the phone lines are congested. SMS also has another advantage over voice calls in that one message can be sent to a group simultaneously. Cell Broadcasting: Most of today's wireless systems support a feature called cell broadcasting. A public warning message in text can be sent to the screens of all mobiles devices, which have such a capability in any group of cells of any size, ranging from one single cell (about 8 kilometres across) to the whole country if necessary. GSM, D-AMPS, UMTS and CDMA3 phones have this capability. Satellite Radio: Satellite radio can play a key role during both the disaster warning and disaster recovery phases. Its key advantage is the ability to work even outside of areas not covered by normal radio channels. Satellite radio can also be of help when the transmission towers of the normal radio channels are damaged in a disaster. Internet and Email: The role Internet and email can play in disaster warning depends entirely on their penetration within a community. These media can play a prominent role in a developed country where nearly half of all homes and almost all offices have Internet connections. In many developing countries, however, less than five percent of the population uses the Internet and even those who are users, do not use it on a regular basis.

Amateur Radio and Community Radio: For almost a century, amateur radio operators have assisted their communities and countries during disasters by providing reliable communications to disaster relief organizations at a moment\u2019s notice \u2013 especially when the communication infrastructure breaks down. In such a situation, amateur radio operators transmit emergency traffic on voice mode about the well-being of survivors as well as information on casualties to friends and relatives.

It is a humanitarian news network based on a popular website that aims to keep relief professionals and the wider public up-to-date on humanitarian crises around the globe.\u201d (AlertNet, 2007) AlterNet has been in operation for more than a decade now. It was born in the aftermath of the Rwanda crisis of 1994, when the Reuters Foundation became interested in media reports of poor coordination between emergency relief charities on the ground. Reuters Foundation surveyed charities to determine what could be done to remedy this. AlertNet now attracts more than three million users a year, it has a network of four hundred contributing humanitarian organizations and its weekly email digest is received by more than 17,000 readers. For more details please visit http://www.alertnet.org IICCTT ffoorr DDiissaasstteerr RReessppoonnssee aanndd RReeccoovveerryy The most difficult period of a disaster is the immediate aftermath. This period calls for prompt action, within an exceptionally short period of time. In the aftermath of any disaster, a significant number of individuals will be injured and/or displaced. Many of them might still be living with the trauma they have encountered, including loss of loved ones. Affected individuals might also be without food or other essential items. They might be waiting in temporary shelters, with no idea of what to do next. Some might need immediate medical attention, while the disaster aftermath environment also creates ideal breeding grounds for possible epidemics. ICT can play a key role in such an environment in managing the available resources. A good example of this is Sahana, a free and open source software (FOSS)-based disaster management system that grew out of the events during the 2004 Asian tsunami disaster. This system was developed in http://www.apdip.net/apdipenote/16.pdf 3 Sri Lanka - one of the countries hardest hit by the tsunami - by a team of ICT volunteers to help track families and coordinate work among relief organizations during and after the tsunami disaster. Subsequently, Sahana has been deployed to manage the earthquake disaster in Northern Pakistan (2005), the Guinsaugon landslide in the Philippines (2006) and the earthquake in Yogjakarta, Indonesia (2006). Sahana provides four main solutions: \u2022 Sahana Missing Person Registry: This is an on- line bulletin board of missing and found people. Information about the person seeking another person is also captured, which increases the chances of people finding each other. \u2022 Sahana Organization Registry: This registry keeps track of all the relief organizations and civil society groups working in the disaster region. It captures not only the places where they are active, but also information on the range of services they are providing in each area. \u2022 Sahana Camps Registry: This registry keeps track of the location of all the camps in the region and provides basic data on the facilities they may have and the number of people in them. It also provides a GIS view to plot the location of the camps in the affected area. \u2022 Sahana Request Management System: This is a central on-line repository where all relief organizations, relief workers, government agents and camps can effectively match requests of aid and supplies to pledges of support.

Descriptive attributes in tabular form are associated with spatial features. Spatial data and associated attributes in the same coordinate system can then be layered together for mapping and analysis. GIS can be used for scientific investigations, resource management and development planning. Remote sensing is the measurement or acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon, by a recording device that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object. In practice, remote sensing is the remote utilization (as from aircraft, spacecraft, satellite or ship) of any device for gathering information about the environment. Thus, an aircraft taking photographs, earth observation and weather satellites, monitoring of a foetus in the womb via ultrasound, and space probes are all examples of remote sensing. In modern usage, the term generally refers to techniques involving the use of instruments aboard aircraft and spacecraft. Disaster Management and ICT 4 GIS and remote sensing are examples of ICT tools being widely used in almost all the phases of disaster management activities. In the planning process GIS can be used to identify and pinpoint risk prone geographical areas, as a GIS-based 3D map provides much more information compared to an ordinary 2D map. Earth observation satellites can be used to view the same area over long periods of time and as a result, make it possible to monitor environmental change, human impact and natural processes. In the mitigation phase, GIS are helpful in monitoring. GIS play several roles in the recovery phase too. It can identify the damage, assess it and begin to establish priorities for action (triage). GIS can also ensure uniformity in the distribution of supplies (medicine, food, water, clothing, etc.) to emergency distribution centres. They can be assigned in proper amounts based on the amount and type of damage in each area. CCoonncclluussiioonn It is essential that we look at disaster management from the development angle. Disaster management is no longer either a one-off or stand alone activity. Despite the fact that disaster preparedness has not been identified as one of the MDGs, it is apparent that proper mechanisms for disaster awareness and means of disaster recovery are essential to achieving the MDGs. One obvious challenge faced by the Asia-Pacific region is the low ICT penetration levels in most of the region\u2019s developing countries. According to the UNDP Human Development Report of 2005 the tele-densities of Cambodia, Nepal and Bangladesh in 2003 were 38, 18 and 15 per 1,000 people, respectively. The situation is not different when it comes to radio and television. The irony is that while a limited section of households might have all these ICT-based media, the majority does not have any of them. With such low penetration levels it is extremely difficult to establish an effective disaster warning system. For these communities it is essential to think of other means (such as community radio or public address systems) for effective disaster warning. Unless the telephone, radio and television penetration can be reasonably increased it is difficult to guarantee that any community can be free from the risk from disasters irrespective of the efficiency of the disaster monitoring systems. Another big challenge is the reluctance of some national governments to implement ICT-friendly policies. There are many governments that do not see investments in ICT or even building infrastructure as priorities. The result invariably will be that ICT and technology in general take a back seat to presumed priorities such as ensuring good governance practices, providing healthcare facilities and addressing gender barriers come under the spotlight. The examples highlighted in this APDIP e-Note make it obvious that as far as disaster management is concerned, there is no reason why ICT should take a secondary role. ~ Chanuka Wattegama, UNDP-APDIP DDiissaasstteerr M Maannaaggeem meenntt O Orrggaanniizzaattiioonnss aanndd NNeettw woorrkkss Asian Disaster Preparedness Center. http://www.adpc.net Asian Disaster Reduction and Response Network. http://www.adrrn.net Asian Disaster Reduction Centre. http://www.adrc.or.jp Duryog Nivaran (South Asian Network for Disaster Risk Reduction). http://www.duryognivaran.org Global Disaster Information Network. http://www.gdin.org International Charter \"Space and Major Disasters\". http://www.disasterscharter.org Pacific Disaster Center. http://www.pdc.org Partners in Technology.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "44025487-15f1-4c89-9fbe-e6bed9142f84": {"__data__": {"id_": "44025487-15f1-4c89-9fbe-e6bed9142f84", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-disaster-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ICT in Disaster Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-disaster-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f63d7f71ef3467060ac7280bba87087f26bc20b7845656ccfd6213d0b1d67c6"}, "2": {"node_id": "f0e4dc34-ac5c-4a07-8a29-f690c7c26cc8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/ict-disaster-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a68262f40969f2333eb1a740fa378d1b6b2ea4c3f27170333d4fb126a6442acb"}}, "hash": "85821a97dedc2507d38ff3fa3d0604012d7ce49a4e158519857e9e8c1824904c", "text": "http://www.pdc.org Partners in Technology. http://www.pactec.org Relief Web. http://www.reliefweb.int UN International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR). http://www.unisdr.org AAddddiittiioonnaall RReeaaddiinngg Wattegama, C. forthcoming.

The TLC aims to strengthen the capacity of training institutions and universities by reviewing existing and developing new learner- centred learning materials and methodologies. The TLC enhances learning through South-South knowledge and solution exchanges, with a focus on addressing systemic gaps and topics in training and education that would benefit from a sector-wide approach. All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI) is promoting and facilitating the formation of TLC in India, and Asia, together with the ProVention Consortium, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), the Centre for Disaster Preparedness (CDP) in the Philippines, and the UNDP's Special Unit for South-South Cooperation. iii Table of Contents Why Create a Knowledge Product on Making Schools Safer?

As part of wider efforts to expand local options for disaster risk management, AIDMI recently conducted a review of training materials used by agencies participating in the TLC network. The range of materials now available demonstrates important progress in the past five years but a number of gaps remain. Based on these gaps, AIDMI is developing a series of knowledge products that can be used by training institutions in the network to address key issues of CBDRR, as suggested by the TLC's key objectives, activities and outcomes. CBDRR for safer schools was identified as one of the key gaps in terms of training materials; AIDMI has produced this module to address this unmet need. Much of the content for the module has emerged from AIDMI's experience with the Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign. This experience began in 2001 after the Gujarat earthquake and has now seen wider acceptance in India and in other countries. These experiences and good practice have been consolidated into this module to increase the level of disaster education amongst teachers, children and the community. Unsafe schools are a reality. In developing countries like India, schools are often located in vulnerable areas and unprepared to respond to emergencies. In recent years, India's schools have sustained many catastrophic incidents: a fire led to the deaths of over 400 people \u2014about half of them students\u2014 at a school's prize giving ceremony in Haryana in 1995; the Bhuj earthquake caused the deaths of 971 students and 31 teachers in Gujarat in 2001; a fire at the Lord Krishna School in Tamil Nadu took the lives of 94 children in 2004; thousands of students and teachers were killed, injured or otherwise affected in the 2004 South Asia tsunami; and 15 children and 3 teachers died in a boat accident during a school picnic at Kerala in 2007. These tragic events represent a few major hazards to which school children are susceptible; these and other hazards pose a regular threat. The promotion of disaster awareness, preparedness and mitigation in schools across Asia has enormous potential for diminishing the occurrence and impact of such emergencies. In the end, it is parents and school children that can make schools safer. It is our intent this knowledge product will help trainers across the region extend safety with teachers and households in poor and disaster-prone areas. Mihir R. Bhatt All India Disaster Mitigation Institute vii Foreword The Special Unit for South-South Cooperation (SU-SSC) in United Nations Development Program (UNDP) aims to promote and support cooperation between and among developing countries. From its inception, it has been actively engaged in supporting initiatives to create a body of knowledge based on lessons learned and rich practice of Southern partners. In 2005, the SU-SSC began to get involved in assisting efforts on community based disaster risk reduction and since then, it has published several knowledge products derived from the experiences of organisations working with communities. One major initiative that it has supported is the setting up of the Training and Learning Circle (TLC) on Community Based Disaster Risk Management in India and the Philippines in 2007. The SU-SSC thanks its core partners, the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI), Center for Disaster Preparedness (CDP) and Provention Consortium for initiating the development of this knowledge product The TLC aims to strengthen the capacity of trainers, training institutions and educational institutions (primarily, but not limited to, universities) by developing new learner-centered materials and methodologies to propagate community based disaster risk management. It is along this line, that the AIDMI conducted a review of existing training materials from its TLC partners in India and found that one of the gaps is in Community Based Disaster Risk Management for Making Schools Safer. Based on AIDMI's substantial experience in its campaign on Children's Right to Safer Schools, it was able to develop a Training Manual on Making Schools Safer. The manual would be most useful for school administrators and teachers in India and other countries in the South, particularly in earthquake prone countries. This manual is even more relevant today after the earthquake that hit the province of Padang in Indonesia on the first of October 2009, which destroyed many buildings. This knowledge product covers: 1) The importance of reducing risks in schools, 2) The necessity of conducting a School Safety Audit, 3) Successful school safety initiatives that can be replicated, and 4) Ways to integrate disaster risk reduction into", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b777fe89-0380-4e4c-84c2-94288ea86b9a": {"__data__": {"id_": "b777fe89-0380-4e4c-84c2-94288ea86b9a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "38d64955ed8326aca0fa678132ff122c8114423c8c5a06b8f0f673870d187e0d"}}, "hash": "38d64955ed8326aca0fa678132ff122c8114423c8c5a06b8f0f673870d187e0d", "text": "school curricula to empower children in promoting safer communities. The SU-SSC sees the publication of this material as a milestone in keeping schools safe for our children. Schools nurture the light of the future, the children. It is our hope that this material would be widely disseminated and embraced with enthusiasm by school authorities in vulnerable countries. This material, if widely adopted and customised to the specific situations of a country, would bring us closer to realising the aim of building a culture of safety and resilience. Yiping Zhou Executive Director Special Unit for South-south Cooperation in UNDP viii Making Schools Safer Overview of the Making Schools Safer Series The \"Making Schools Safer Series\" has been developed by the All India Disaster Mitigation Institute as one of the key activities of the Training and Learning Circle. This module uses the experience of many different actors across Asia, including NGOs, INGOs, CBOs and Government. This experience has been consolidated into guidelines and methods for teachers to include scientific and practical knowledge for DRR within curricula, as well as fun ways of getting children to play an important role in reducing risk in school and the community. This module aims to turn disaster and safety knowledge into action that can save lives and create safer schools, thus encouraging the attendance of children, especially girls. How to Use this Course Material The four modules in the knowledge product may be used in isolation as singular training seminars, or alternatively used together within a daylong training session. Each module is designed to last 1h 30mins, so a daylong session of 4 modules will last at least 6h, plus at least 1h in breaks. The modules are designed for delivery to a group of teachers, whether they are from just one or a variety of different schools. Additional information on how to implement each module can be found in each module's Facilitator's Note. There is also optional guidance material for trainers wishing to hold a daylong session, including opening and closing activities. Outline of Modules Module 1 - Introduction to School Safety in India The module has the following aims: \u2022 Introduce CBDRR \u2022 Train teachers in natural and manmade hazards, as well as safety issues \u2022 Allow teachers to learn lessons from past examples of disasters and safety hazards that have affected children This module uses the experience of AIDMI's Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign, as well as its experience in teaching about hazards and disasters. The aim is to provide teachers with a strong knowledge base about why CBDRR is relevant to them, their school and their students. This will then be enhanced with training about the basics of natural disasters and safety matters. The findings of AIDMI's School Safety Audits of 60 schools across 6 states of India show that teachers do not possess sufficient knowledge about the risks children face at school, the risks and effects of disasters, and the means to protect the children from them. It will not be possible to equip children with practical knowledge about disasters (such as Do's and Don'ts before, during and after) if their teachers do not possess such knowledge. ix Module 2 - Conducting a School Safety Audit The module has the following aims: \u2022 Explain the purpose of a school safety audit \u2022 Share the findings of AIDMI's school safety audits \u2022 Provide teachers with the tools to design and conduct their own school safety audits This module uses the experience of AIDMI's School Safety Audit system to enable teachers to assess their own school's safety. This includes assessments of disaster and safety knowledge and awareness, as well as physical and organisational means of increasing safety and preparedness. The goal of the school safety audit is to identify areas that require improvement, so this training will empower teachers as disaster managers in their community. A more concise version of the assessment methods used in the School Safety Audit system will be provided to teachers in the form of a checklist. The module will also provide teachers with ideas about how to tailor the audit to their school and community. Module 4 will provide information on how to turn deficiencies into action. Module 3 - Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India The module has the following aims: \u2022 Provide teachers with examples of successful CBDRR in Indian schools \u2022 Encourage the development of ideas for action This module uses the experience of NGOs and INGOs working on safer schools in India. By providing teachers with examples of good practice, this module provides an introduction to preparedness and mitigation", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b44bd9b-391c-4ccd-8e89-0b6ff52ec86b": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b44bd9b-391c-4ccd-8e89-0b6ff52ec86b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e16fa1b5ef9261636ab1feb57509d8b7f285392c79d2ef94f0c8e8b38f90d0f9"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6b8bcd3-addc-4a35-bd9a-f44c7a652f58", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "20f93c9fd5ee3672c72277f1d09df5481bece12669d445efba51f188e2892a22"}}, "hash": "ac88e04a164f0e00235604df40ff3fe5720842cc2b4c97bd575ec5eae269e26d", "text": "solutions.

More important than the classification of disasters is the concept that lies behind a disaster. A disaster is not just the occurrence of an event such as an earthquake, flood, conflict, health epidemic or an industrial accident; a disaster occurs if that event/process negatively impacts human populations. Disasters combine two elements: hazard, and the vulnerability of affected people. \"A disaster occurs when a hazard exposes the vulnerability of individuals and communities in such a way that their lives are directly threatened or sufficient harm has been done to their community's economic and social structure to undermine their ability to survive.\" 1.2 Disaster Risk: The Relationship between Hazard, Vulnerability, and Capacity1 Risk is commonly used to mean the probability or likelihood of meeting danger or suffering harm and loss. Risk is sometimes taken as synonymous with hazard but risk has an additional implication of the chance of a particular hazard occurring. It is also the exposure of something of human value (life, property, and the environment) to a hazard and is often regarded as the probability of loss. Disaster Risk can be represented as: Disaster Risk = Hazard \ufffd Vulnerability \ufffd Capacity Hazard is an event or an occurrence that has the potential for causing injuries or damage to property or the environment. The magnitude of the phenomenon, the probability of its occurrence and the extent and severity of the impact can vary.

Vulnerability can be physical/material like the geographical location and the socio economic resources of the people. For example, poor people who have few physical/material resources usually suffer more from disaster than rich people. People who are poor might live on marginal lands, might have no savings or insurance and may be in poor health. These factors make them more vulnerable to disasters and mean that they have a harder time surviving and recovering from a calamity than people who are better off economically. Vulnerability can also be social and organisational. Experience shows that people who have been 'marginalised' in social, economic or political terms are highly vulnerable to disasters, 1 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 Introduction to School Safety in India 5 whereas groups which are well organised and well resourced suffer less when catastrophes strike. Vulnerability can also be attitudinal and motivational. Experience also shows that people who do not have confidence in their ability to affect change and feel defeated by events they cannot control are harder hit by disasters. This is in contrast to those who have a sense of their ability to bring about the changes they desire. Capacity is the degree to which a community can intervene and manage a hazard in order to reduce potential impact. The higher the capacity of a school to cope with disaster the less it is vulnerable to disasters. This implies that based on the people's perception of their disaster risk, they are able to make decisions to adapt to, modify or ignore the risk. Like vulnerability, capacity can be physical or material, social or organisational, attitudinal and motivational, and can be found on different levels. Therefore schools or communities are not helpless victims but have 'coping' mechanisms on which to build for emergency response and recovery. A viable track to reduce vulnerability for schools can be increasing their social and organisational capacities. These resources exist in households, schools and communities and enable them to prepare for, mitigate, withstand, and quickly recover from disaster. Capacities of schools include, among other things, building safety, emergency planning, and knowledge of school staff and students. Social relations and school culture may also contribute to the capacity of a school to minimise the impact of a hazard. 1.3 Hazards and their Classifications2 There are many kinds of disasters and various classifications. Traditionally a distinction is made between natural and man-made disasters. Identifiable human actions are the principal, direct causes in man-made disasters or emergencies. This mainly involves situations in which civilian populations suffer causalities, losses of property, basic services and means of livelihood as a result of war, civil strife, other conflict or detrimental policy implementation. Natural disasters can be classified according to the type of natural force: biological events such as plague and malaria; water and climate related events such as cyclone, flood and drought; and geophysical events such as earthquake, volcanic eruption, tsunami and landslide. Extreme climatological, hydrological or geological processes are one cause of natural disasters. Technological disasters include industrial accidents, server pollution accidents, nuclear accidents, air crashes, major fires or explosions that affect a large amount of people, property, infrastructure, or economic activity. The speed of onset is an important criterion for disaster managers. A disaster can develop slowly until it reaches a point where survival is ultimately jeopardised, as with droughts, or it can start suddenly and immediately affect human lives and social structures, as with cyclones. 2 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 Making Schools Safer 6 Hazard Classification* Phenomena / Examples \u2022 Floods, debris and mudflows \u2022 Tropical cyclones, storm surges, wind, rain and other severe storms, blizzards, lightning \u2022 Drought, desertification, wildland fires, temperature extremes, sand or dust storms \u2022 Permafrost, snow avalanches \u2022 Earthquake, tsunamis \u2022 Volcanic activity and emissions \u2022 Mass movements, landslides, rockslides, liquefaction, sub-marine slides \u2022 Surface collapse, geological fault activity \u2022 Outbbreaks of epidemic diseases, plant or animal contagion and extensive infestations. Hazard A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity, which may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. Natural Hazards Natural processes or phenomena occurring in the biosphere that may constitute a damaging event. Natural hazards can be classified according to their geological, hydrometeorological or biological origins.

Technological Hazards Danger associated with technological or industrial accidents, infrastructure failures or certain human activities which may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation, sometimes referred to as anthropogenic hazards. Examples include industrial pollution, nuclear release and radioactivity, toxic waste, dam failure, transport, industrial or technological accidents (explosion, fires, spills). Environmental Degradation Processes induced by human behavior and activities (sometimes combined with natural hazards) that damage the natural resource base or adversely alter natural processes or ecosystems. Potential effects are varied and may contribute to an increase in vulnerability and the frequency and intensity of natural hazards. Examples include land degradation, deforestation, desertification, wildland fires, loss of biodiversity, land, water and air pollution, climate change, sea level rise and ozone depletion. * From UNISDR publication on Living with Risk (2004). Introduction to School Safety in India 7 1.4 Disaster Effects on Schools3 Disasters can have several negative impacts on schools. Not all disasters strike the schools directly and immediately. Sometimes schools are affected indirectly through students, staff and their families. Schools can be affected also in short or long term phases. An example of direct effect of disaster event on a school is an earthquake that damages the school building. Damages to the school infrastructure are directly related to reduction in school hours, and consequently, to a decrease in the quality of education. If a school is unusable, the children will have to go to other schools, often in shifts, and their education suffers. School hours may also be cancelled because teachers are busy helping their communities meet recovery needs. If students have been left anxious, uprooted, out of classrooms for long periods or relocated to other facilities, this disrupts their education and increases their stress. An indirect effect of disasters on schools can be seen in increased dropout rates of students in the wake of earthquakes, droughts or communal riots. It is a common for students to leave school after a disaster event, either because their parents need them to work for their livelihood, or because they are afraid of sending their children back to an unsafe school environment. Additionally, children may feel unable to attend classes or have problems concentrating because they are suffering from psychosocial impacts of disasters. In Ahmedabad, municipal schools were closed for several months following the earthquake in 2001. After the communal riots of 2002 some schools were used as refugee camps. During the 3 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 2 Select School Disaster Incidents in India \u2022 December 23, 1995. Nearly 425 people, many of them school children, perished as they tried to escape the flames during a school prize giving ceremony in the town of Dabwali, Haryana. \u2022 January 26, 2001, Gujarat earthquake. 971 students and 31 teachers died. \u2022 July 18, 2004, Kumbhkonam fire tragedy.

Thus vulnerability of school facilities must not be seen only in terms of the need to prevent catastrophic damage that may destroy the buildings and cause injuries. It is also necessary to prevent situations that may affect the continuity of the services that schools provide.

For most of the day, they house children, teachers and school staff. In addition to their role as learning centres, they may serve as gathering places for community events and fundraisers, meeting places for clubs and religious organisations, storage places for books and technical equipment, and public shelters in emergencies. The communities identify with schools because they are key institutions for development. When a school building is vulnerable to natural hazards, the welfare of the entire community is at risk. The safety of educational institutions contributes directly to the quality of education. To protect students is to protect one of the most important resources of communities. As vulnerable as schools are they offer a broad range of opportunities to mitigate and respond to disaster for the whole community. As a gathering place for different members of the community, schools can disseminate information on disaster and create awareness of risks. Teaching disaster preparedness to children in schools works as a multiplier as children may transfer acquired knowledge to their families. This helps to build capacities for the whole community. When an extreme natural event is expected, emergency shelters, often school buildings, may be opened to house the local population and keep them out of harm's way. Schools are used as emergency shelters after a disaster strikes, to temporarily house populations whose homes have been destroyed or are no longer safe because of damage from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, or riots. Water, food and other needed items can be distributed in schools. In these situations, the structural soundness of the building is depended on to protect the population from the elements. 4 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 2 Introduction to School Safety in India 9 Building safer school environments in urban and rural areas is part of creating safer and disaster resistant communities, and part of general disaster mitigation. Safer schools help guarantee continuity of education. School safety should be a part of village/city planning. Disaster plans should include provisions for damaged school buildings, occupied school buildings or displacement of students, all of which disrupt educational activities. Alternative arrangements to provide a suitable place with adequate facilities for students to continue their education are necessary until the original building is safe for use. 1.6 Hazards Affecting Schools in India5 The potential hazards in India are numerous. India's location and geographical features render it vulnerable to a number of natural hazards including cyclone, drought, floods, earthquake, fire, landslides and avalanches. Apart from natural hazards India is vulnerable to numerous man-made disasters as current trends in industrialisation, level of economic development, rapid population growth, patterns of human settlement and environmental degradation increase the region's vulnerability. In addition, parts of India are affected by conflicts and riots. Regions in India may be exposed to multiple hazards in very small time. The disaster situation in India is worsening for many. The Central Water Commission, a nodal government agency, has noted that 11.2 per cent of India is flood prone. In 1998, floods inundated 37 percent of India. The country's 7,516-km coastline is continuously whipped by high velocity winds that pummel the east coast states of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh every year, causing widespread damage. Earthquakes raze the northern Himalayan region and the Deccan plateau in southern and central India. It is estimated that 57 per cent of India is earthquake- prone. Compounding the variety of natural disasters is the heterogeneity of man-made disasters. Communal and caste riots pepper the country. The virtual militant-security forces siege in the Kashmir valley and the northeastern states has engendered hardships and casualties among large numbers of civilians. In India, the number of internally displaced people caused by 'development' projects was over 21.3 million in 1990 and is probably 30 million today, according to the Indian Social Institute. As for non-conventional disasters: the cost of road accidents is equivalent to 1 per cent of country's Gross National Product. The number of four- wheeled vehicles increased 23 per cent to 4.5 million between 1990 and 1993 and it has been forecast that 267 million vehicles will be on the roads by 2050. The country's disaster situation is, on the face of it, a challenging picture. With mounting human costs and a barrage of criticism, experts agree today that a shift of emphasis towards disaster preparedness and better advance work at the grassroots level is imperative. A multi- sectoral approach, involving the government, NGO's, academics and the affected communities is slowly gaining currency in India.

In 2004, 94 children perished in a fiery blaze in Kumbhakonam and 931 students where crushed to death from the Gujarat earthquake in 2001. These numbers show us how vulnerable our school children are. What actions must be taken to ensure this does not happen again? What programmes have been developed to stop these tragedies? What are other countries, the international community and NGOs doing to offer a safe learning environment to children? What best practices can we draw from these experiences? India is a country with diverse range of disaster risks: 70% of the cultivable land is prone to drought, 60% of the land is prone to earthquakes, 12% to floods, and 8% to cyclones. Overall, 85% of the land area is vulnerable to numerous natural hazards and 22 states are categorised as multi hazards regions. In the decade of 1990 - 2000 an average of about 30 million people have been affected and 4,344 people have died in India every year due to disasters. In 2001 alone, disasters have affected 36,536,831 people and killed 20,814. Nearly three million people worldwide may have been killed in the past 20 years due to natural disasters such as landslides, earthquakes, floods, snow avalanches, and cyclones. 90% of death caused by the natural disasters and 95% of the all disaster related deaths worldwide occur in developing countries. India accounts for the second largest share in these numbers (source: Disaster Management in India; A Status Report, GoI Ministry of Home Affairs, 2004). With a large percentage of the Indian population living in poverty (36% living below the official poverty line) and with a literacy rate of just over 50%, it is imperative for the future development of India that children have access to education. Over 78 million children are currently in need of schooling. To meet this great demand, may schools are overburdened and compromise on safety. More and more children go to schools that are exposed to risk from fire hazards, earthquakes, floods, cyclones, pollution, food poising, stampedes and other hazards. Below are details on some of the most significant. 1.6.1 Earthquakes6 Earthquakes strike suddenly, without warning. Earthquakes can occur at any time of the year and at any time of the day or night. On a yearly basis, 70 to 75 earthquakes occur throughout the world. An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth caused by breaking and shifting of rock beneath the earth's surface. For hundred of millions years, the forces plate tectonics have shaped the earth as the huge plates that form the earth's surface move slowly over, under, and past each other. Sometimes the move is gradual. At other times, the plates are locked together, unable to release the accumulating energy. When the accumulated energy grows strong enough, the plates break free causing the ground to shake. Most earthquakes occur at the boundaries where the plates meet; however, some earthquakes occur in the middles of the plates. Ground shaking from earthquakes can collapse buildings and bridges; disrupt gas, electric, and phone service; and sometimes trigger landslides, avalanches, flash floods, fires, and huge, 6 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 and 5 Introduction to School Safety in India 11 destructive ocean waves (tsunamis). Building foundations resting on an unconsolidated landfill and other unstable soil, and trailers and homes not tied to their foundations are at risk because they can be shaken off their mountings during earthquake. When an earthquake occurs in a populated area it may cause deaths and injuries and extensive property damage. Where earthquakes have occurred in the past, they will happen again. Learn whether earthquakes are a risk in your area by contacting your local emergency organisations. Expect aftershocks. Aftershocks are smaller earthquakes that follow the main shock and can cause further damage to weakened buildings. After-shocks can occur in the first hours, days, weeks, or even months after the quake. Be aware that some earthquakes are actually foreshocks, and a larger earthquake might occur. Ground movements during an earthquake are seldom the direct cause of death or injury. Most earthquake-related injuries result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects as a result of the ground shaking or people trying to move more than a few feet during", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b9d82daa-767f-4689-b6ad-5d6b9d96efaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "b9d82daa-767f-4689-b6ad-5d6b9d96efaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4503a5f38817b5227e82e6b9448e40c8281138a90007e1ae231f3307c2c7f651"}}, "hash": "4503a5f38817b5227e82e6b9448e40c8281138a90007e1ae231f3307c2c7f651", "text": "the shaking. Much of the damage is predictable and preventable. Earthquakes unleash energies on the scale of nuclear explosions. While they rarely announce their arrival in advance, even moderate earthquakes can leave behind death and destruction that occupy victims and caregivers for years. Earthquakes occur when the plates of the crust are moving in different directions. The rocks in the crust begin to bend because of the pressure, just as a stick bends if you press on it. When it cannot take the pressure anymore, it snaps and breaks. The resulting vibrations of waves in the solid crust travel outwards from the centre of disturbances as one main shock with fore and aftershocks. The point at which the shock occurs is known as the origin of focus, or the epicentre. Earthquakes occur mostly along the edges of the largest plates of the earth's crust. Most of the world earthquakes occur in two belts. One runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean, the other stretches from Southern Europe to Southern Asia. About two-thirds of all large earthquakes are located in the so-called 'Ring of Fire' around the Pacific. Within the Asia Pacific region, earthquakes occur at the junctions of the Pacific plate with the Indo-Australian plate. At these plate borders, many countries in the region, including India suffer from earthquake. Earthquakes raze the northern Himalayan region and the Deccan plateau in southern and central India. 57% of land area in India is considered Earthquake prone. The main seismic regions in India are Kashmir and the Western Himalayas, the Central Himalayas (including Nepal Himalayas), Northeast India, the Indo-Ganetic basin and Rajasthan, Combay and the Rann of Kutch, Peninsular India (Deccan Plateau) and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Earthquakes strike suddenly without warning, and are unpredictable. On the 26th of January 2001, the day of the fatal earthquake, schools were closed because of the public holiday. But as it was the country's 51st Republic Day many schools were conducting parades and were hoisting the national flag on school grounds. An earthquake measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale struck at 8:46 AM local time, according to the United States Geological Survey. Two particularly telling incidents occurred in Ahmedabad's schools. The Swaminarayan School was closed for classes, but exams were conducted for the 11th standard science students when the earthquake struck, leading to a great rush among students. Many of them could escape, but 50 students and 3 teachers were trapped in the rubble of the collapsing building. At another affected school where students had gathered to celebrate Republic Day, they just had Making Schools Safer 12 hoisted the flag and were moving into the classrooms when a slab from a 70-foot parapet wall fell off leaving 10 students dead and 70 injured. In the Gujarat town of Anjar, about 400 school children and their teachers were covered by tons of falling masonry while walking in a Republic Day parade. Eight were pulled out alive. In general School buildings suffered severe damage, thousands of schoolrooms were destroyed and damaged by the earthquake. Up to five million children were affected by the earthquake in India. According to UNICEF between 1.5 and 2.5 million children under the age of 14 lost family members, their homes or their schools in the worst hit parts of Gujarat. State-wide, about 15,000 primary schools - half the pre-quake total- were damaged or destroyed by the quake. The state Government of Gujarat reported in April 2001 that more than 9,500 schools had been destroyed in the January 26 earthquakes, along with 300 hospitals and 800 early childhood development centres. Many schools in Ahmedabad are located in crowed areas amidst tall buildings. They lack safety evacuation systems and emergency plans, which could have saved lives during the earthquake- and will be needed to save lives for disasters that may occur in the future. Classrooms and schools are overcrowded. The corridors and the staircases are too narrow. Many access roads to the school are narrow, making it difficult for police and the fire fighters to reach the school. The experiences in Gujarat and especially in Ahmedabad have revealed high vulnerability in schools. The School of Building Science and Technology (SBST) and Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology conducted a survey on school building vulnerability and school preparedness in Ahmedabad. They investigated the following aspects: general conditions (e.g. accident history), architectural conditions (e.g. location of staircase), structural conditions (e.g. building shape), functional/operational conditions (e.g. condition of electronic panels), external conditions (access for fire fighters), and school preparedness (e.g. records of mock drills, emergency plans).

Although the study cannot be generalised, the results are striking. On the additive index for school vulnerability, 16 schools were rated dangerously vulnerable, 16 schools mostly vulnerable, 4 schools highly vulnerable, and only one school was rated moderately vulnerable. The SBST study offered several criticisms of school administration in Gujarat: \u2022 The Gujarat secondary education board does not lay down any specifications for the way in which the school building or the staircase have to be constructed. It only says that each pupil of std. 8th, 9th and 10th should have 8 sq.ft. of space or that a classroom with no more than 50 students should be built on 20sq.mt. \u2022 Despite all this, out of 451 secondary schools, 396 have been receiving financial grants regularly from the educational departments and inspectors of Ahmedabad district education office have been issuing all clear certificates every year after physical verification or sometimes even without verification. \u2022 There is no model suggested by the education department for the school design and layout. Introduction to School Safety in India 13 \u2022 The building bylaws should not provide varying width of staircase put to different use like commercial, educational or residential. The staircase should be treated during construction in a manner that will lend more stability to it by arming it with shear walls. \u2022 Even after the Prakash school incident, the state government continues to permit schools to function from commercial high rises, even from shopping plazas that do not have the ground or an open space. \u2022 Some accidents could have been avoidable and lives could have been saved if the administration and municipals had more capacities to control and sanction schools and make emergency plans, and drills compulsory for schools. 1.6.2 Cyclone/Hurricane7 The term 'cyclone' denotes all tropical storms. It is known as a \"hurricane\" in the Atlantic and the Eastern Pacific, and a \"typhoon\" in the Western Pacific. Cyclones are usually located approximately 30 degrees above and below the equator. They vary in diameter from 50 km to 320 km, but their effects dominate thousands of square kilometres of ocean surface and the lower atmosphere. The perimeter may measure 1,000 km, but the powerhouse is located within the 100 km radius. Nearer the centre, or \"eye\" of the storm, winds may hit 320 kmph. Tropical cyclones spin clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter clockwise in the southern hemisphere. Between five and 20km tall when fully formed, cyclones are like leviathans-emboldened by contact with warmer seawater and air, they become self-sustaining and bloat until they hit cool land or ocean. Tropical cyclones generally move to the west-northwest initially and north- eastward later. Being of oceanic origin they generally hit the east coast of the continents. Soon after crossing the coast, they begin to dissipate, de-energised by friction with land and the lack of moisture. The atmospheric pressure at the eye rapidly rises and normalises. They may continue to blast more than 160 km inland, but damage is limited to 50-60 km beyond the coastline. Sometimes, rebuffed by a cool sea or land surface instead of a warm one, cyclones reverse, return to sea to breath deep, and come ashore at unpredictable locations. Cyclones do most damage to structures, fatalities come from rain and flooding that follow. In shallow water, tropical cyclones whip up low waves that translate into long and powerful shore currents. Cyclones are associated with strong winds, torrential rains and storm surges. Storm surges or tidal waves occur when the level of the sea is raised by direct wind-driven water combined with an uplift of the sea surface induced by the low pressure at the cyclone centre. Cyclone formation requires warm seas and still air. In the Bay of Bengal, these are the conditions normally occur in the months of April-May and October-November. The frequency of tropical cyclones is the lowest in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea and they are mostly moderate in intensity. But the storm surges make them ferocious when they cross the shoreline. Some 15% of the world's tropical cyclones originate in the Bay of Bengal and cause severe flooding and devastating tidal surges to the East Coast of India and Bangladesh. On an average six cyclones form in the Indian seas out of which the distribution in the Bay of Bengal and the 7 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 Making Schools Safer 14 Arabian Sea is in the ratio of 4:1.

Its 7,516-km long coastline is vulnerable to the impacts of tropical cyclones that develop in the north of the Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea). Among the states in the East Coast the frequency of the cyclone crossing the coast is more in Orissa followed by Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and finally West Bengal. Orissa and Andhra Pradesh are struck every year, causing incalculable damage. There are two cyclone seasons for India. The first is the Pre- monsoon Season (April and May) and the second is post-monsoon season (October to December). The cyclones of the Post-Monsoon season are more intense than those of the Pre- monsoon season. There are 3 main physical characteristics of cyclones/ hurricanes that effect populations: \u2022 High wind speeds o Batter and destroy buildings - putting human life at risk o Pick up debris - causing significant damage to buildings and risk to human life \u2022 High precipitation intensity o Causes widespread flooding, with the related effects of damage to buildings and property, risk of drowning, water contamination, etc \u2022 Storm Surges o Wind and low pressure causes a swell in sea water, resulting in large waves that inundate the coast o These cause further flooding and damage, having an increased negative effect on coastal communities 1.6.3 Tsunami8 Tsunamis, also known as seismic sea waves, are a series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. A tsunami can move hundreds of miles per hour in the open ocean and smash into land with waves as high as 100 feet or more. From the area where the tsunami originates, waves travel outward in all directions. Once the wave approaches the shore, it builds in height. The topography of the coastline and the ocean floor will influence the size of the wave. There may be more than one wave and the succeeding one may be larger than the one before. That is why a small tsunami at one beach can be a giant wave a few miles away. Earthquake-induced movement of the ocean floor most often generates tsunamis. If a major earthquake or landslide occurs close to shore, the first wave in a series could reach the beach in a few minutes, even before a warning is issued. Areas are at greater risk if they are less than 25 feet above sea level and within a mile of the shoreline. Drowning is the most common cause of death associated with a tsunami. Tsunami waves and the receding water are very destructive to 8 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 5 and From: University of Birmingham - Tsunami lectures. Introduction to School Safety in India 15 structures in the run-up zone. Other hazards include flooding, contamination of drinking water, and fires from gas lines or ruptured tanks. In the past, tsunamis were often referred to as \"tidal waves\" by many English-speaking people. The term \"tidal wave\" is a misnomer. Tsunami is a Japanese word represented by two characters: \"tsu\" and \"nami\". The character \"tsu\" means harbour, while the character \"nami\" means wave. An average of 12 tsunamis occur every year. Since 1850 alone, tsunamis have been responsible for the loss of over 420,000 lives and billions of dollars of damage to coastal structures and in habitats. There was plenty of time for evacuation in Hilo, Hawaii, as the Chilean tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean on May 22, 1960. At 6:47 p.m. Hawaiian time, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey issued an official warning that waves were expected to reach Hilo at about midnight. Around 8:30 p.m., coastal sirens in Hilo sounded and continued to sound intermittently for 20 minutes. When the first wave, only a few feet high, arrived just after midnight, hundreds of people were still at home on low ground in Hilo. Others, thinking that the danger had passed, returned to Hilo before the highest wave of the tsunami struck at 1:04 a.m. on May 23. The December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had the following results in India9: 252 schools in Tamil Nadu were left in need of complete reconstruction, 19 in need of major repairs and 49 in need of minor repairs.

Ahmedabad: AIDMI 10 From: AIDMI - southasiadiasters.net Issue 16 and From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 Making Schools Safer 16 boarding on the boat but none paid much attention to it. Overloading was clear, but everyone was in such a hurry to go back with the private boat without government license at such a late timing. The school authority and local government has reposed immediately after the accident but lives lost could never return. Too many tragedies have demonstrated the importance of promoting school safety and taking every measure to insure children's security when they are studying in school. Apart from disaster preparedness, we must address other safety issues: Is there anything sharp or dangerous that can cause injuries in the classroom? Are there poisonous chemicals in the laboratory, within reach of children? Do children play games safely? Do they know how to get on and get off buses safely on the way to school? Do they know how to cross the road? Do they know how to deal with strangers? Fires have more localised effects but the frequency of fire incidents is rising, leading to huge losses. Fires are very common in slums and squatter settlements in large cities and in high-rise buildings. Incidents of Fire occurring in rural areas during summer season are also high and are compounded by the wind. A fire at a private school at Kumbhakonam in Tamil Nadu killed 90 students. The school was not built according to fire safety rules, making escape for the students impossible when the fire broke out. The Statesman writes, July 20, 2004: \"The school building had a thatched roof - a tinder box waiting to go up in flames. Fire extinguishers were not in sight, the lane of the school building was so narrow that fire- tenders had problems getting to the spot. About 900 children were crammed into the three-storied building with only a single narrow staircase serving as both entrance and exit.\" Another major criticism went to the teachers, who according to the witnesses did little to help the students. The city of Kumbhakonam is located in the Tanjavur district of Tamil Nadu, 320 kilometres from the city of Chennai. Saraswathi Public High School is at the centre of Kumbhakonam and has a student body of around 800 children and employs a meal scheme in support of children of low- income families. This offers many poor children access to education, but if schools lack building and fire codes it can turn into a disaster quickly. This is what happened in Kumbhakonam, where a deadly fire killed 94 children. This could have been avoided if proper instruction had been given to the children. On the July 16th 2004, major ignorance was the main factor causing this unfortunate disaster. When a fire broke out in the kitchen, the teacher in a classroom on the third floor instructed the children to remain calm while they investigated what was the cause of the smoke. The teacher, discovering what the cause of smoke was, could not make it back to the children to help them evacuate the building. The classroom, which was designed to be an open space, had been covered with a thatched roof and added walls, which allowed the fire to spread from the walls to the roof. While the roof was burning the children were helplessly sitting on the floor. The only evacuation door in the classroom was closed and the children, too young to open it, couldn't escape from the blaze. The faulty construction of walls could not support the burning roof, which ended up collapsing onto the children. The fire brigade responded to the accident immediately but it was difficult for them to access the school because of the narrow roads and a crowd that had gathered to see what the commotion was. They were able to rescue some children, but 14 of those rescued died later in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6712d01b-bc87-4aee-b961-f423396a1b75": {"__data__": {"id_": "6712d01b-bc87-4aee-b961-f423396a1b75", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "01d415ebfa6b83dd735b603d7e4b95051a28ff8501101aef9afe6497b013f882"}}, "hash": "01d415ebfa6b83dd735b603d7e4b95051a28ff8501101aef9afe6497b013f882", "text": "hospital. The Introduction to School Safety in India 17 education department authorities immediately took action and arrested the principal and some schoolteachers. 1.6.5 Floods11 Floods are among the most frequent and costly natural disasters in terms of human hardship and economic loss. Flooding occurs in known floodplains when prolonged rainfall over several days, intense rainfall over a short period of time, or an ice or debris jam causes a river or a stream to overflow and flood the surrounding area. Melting snow can combine with rain in the winter and early spring; severe thunderstorms can bring heavy rain in the spring and summer; or tropical cyclones can bring intense rainfall to the coastal and inland states in the summer and fall. Flash floods occur within six hours of a rain event, or after a dam or levee failure, or following a sudden release of water held by an ice or debris. You will not always have a warning that these deadly sudden floods are coming. So if you live in areas prone to flash floods, plan now to protect your school and family. As land is converted from fields or woodlands to roads and parking lots, it loses it ability to absorb rainfall. Urbanisation increases runoff two to six times over what would occur on natural terrain. During periods of urban flooding, streets can become swift moving rivers, while basements and viaducts can become death traps as they fill with water. Several factors contribute to flooding. Two key elements are rainfall intensity and duration. Intensity is the rate of rainfall, and duration is how long the rain lasts. Topography, soil conditions, and ground cover also play important roles. Most flash flooding is caused by slow- moving thunderstorms, thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area, or heavy rainfalls from hurricanes and tropical storms. Floods, on the other hand, can be slow- or fast- rising, but generally develop over a period of hours and days. Floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, destroy buildings and bridges, and scour out new channels. Floodwaters can reach heights of 10 to 20 feet and often carry a deadly cargo of debris. Flood-producing rains can also trigger catastrophic debris slides. Floods are the most frequently occurring and most destructive forms of natural disasters in the South Asia region. Floods include seasonal flooding, flash flooding, urban flooding due to inadequate drainage facilities, and those associated with tidal events induced by typhoons in coastal areas. In India 11.2% of the area is flood prone. 40 million hectares of agricultural land are at risk of flooding. Seventy five percent of rainfall is concentrated over four months of monsoon (June-September) and as a result almost all the rivers carry heavy discharge during this period. The problem of sediment deposit, drainage congestion and synchronisation of river floods compound the flood hazard with sea tides in the costal plains. Brahamputra and the Gangetic Basin are the most flood prone areas. The other flood prone areas are the northwest region of west flowing rivers such as Narmada and Tapti, central India and the Decan region with major east flowing rivers like Mahandi, Krishna and Cavery. The most flood prone states are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Orissa. Floods are also serious in Andrha 11 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 and 5 Making Schools Safer 18 Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Areas affected by floods can also be affected by drought. Origins of Flood Hazards12 The principle cause of flooding in most cases is prolonged or intense rainfall. Floods may be described by their various causes, speed of onset and potential damage. The following broad categories can be adopted for flood classification: \u2022 Flash floods, which build up rapidly as a result of surface runoff. \u2022 Floods due to snowmelts. \u2022 Floods due to the failure of flood defence infrastructure, e.g. dams \u2022 Floods arising from the raising of natural ground water levels. \u2022 Floods from inadequate surface water drainage in urban areas. \u2022 Tidal surges and other marine conditions leading to coastal flooding. The National Disaster Management Authority in India has released its first guidelines on Management of Floods.

Although topography is the primary cause, human activities such as deforestation, cultivation and construction destabilise already fragile slopes. Landslides are a serious geological hazard common in the hilly regions of India. The Himalayas, North Eastern Hill ranges and the Western Ghats and Nilgris experience considerable landslide activity of varying intensities. River erosions, seismic movements and heavy rainfalls cause considerable 12 From: University of Birmingham - Floods Lecture 13 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 and 5 Introduction to School Safety in India 19 activity. Heavy monsoon rainfall, often in association with cyclonic disturbances, results in considerable landslide activity on the slopes of the Western Ghats. Mudflows (debris flows) are common types of fast moving landslides that occur during intense rainfall, rapid flows of water due to melting of snow occur in steep hill slides. Some landslides move slowly and cause damage gradually, whereas others move so rapidly that they can destroy property and take lives suddenly and unexpectedly. Gravity is the force driving landslide movement. Factors that allow the force of gravity to overcome the resistance of earth material to landslide movement include: saturation by water, steepening of slopes by erosion or construction, alternate freezing or thawing, earthquake shaking, and volcanic eruptions. Landslides are typically associated with periods of heavy rainfall or rapid snow melt and tend to worsen the effects of flooding that often accompanies these events. In areas burned by forest and brush fires, a lower threshold of precipitation may initiate landslides. Debris flows, sometimes referred to as mudslides, mudflows, lahars, or debris avalanches, are common types of fast-moving landslides. These flows generally occur during periods of intense rainfall or rapid snow melt. They usually start on steep hillsides as shallow landslides that liquefy and accelerate to speeds that are typically about 10 miles per hour, but can exceed 35 miles per hour. The consistency of debris flows ranges from watery mud to thick, rocky mud that can carry large items such as boulders, trees, and cars. Debris flows from many different sources can combine in channels, and their destructive power may be greatly increased. They continue flowing down hills and through channels, growing in volume with the addition of water, sand, mud, boulders, trees, and other materials. When the flows reach flatter ground, the debris spreads over a broad area, sometimes accumulating in thick deposits that can wreak havoc in developed areas. Wildfires can also lead to destructive debris flow activity. Learn whether landslides or debris flows have occurred in your area by contacting local officials, state geological surveys or departments of natural resources, and university departments of geology. 1.6.7 Avalanches14 Avalanches constitute major hazards in the higher reaches of the Himalayas. Severe snow avalanches occur in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and the Hills of Western Uttar Pradesh. 1.6.8 Technological Accidents15 Rapid industrialisation in the region increases the risk of technological accidents. The 1984 Bhopal accident in a town of over a million people in India is cited as the world's worst industrial disaster. Accident rates in the Gas, Fire and Explosive Sectors are quite high. 14 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 15 From: AIDMI - School Safety Trainings Module 1 Making Schools Safer 20 1.6.9 Riots and Conflicts16 Communal and caste riots pepper the country. In 2002, local riots broke out between Muslim and Hindu populations in Gujarat. Over 1000 people were killed, and many more displaced. While the number of conflicts arising from liberation movements have been on the decline in the 1990s, ethnic conflicts continue to rise. Some conflict areas in India include Punjab, Kashmir, Nagaland (between India and Myanmar) and Assam. 1.6.10 Drought17 Drought is among the most serious problems that India faces. From time to time major droughts are experienced in India. Nineteen percent of India's total area, with 12% of its total population, is considered drought prone. An estimated 28% of its total cultivable area is drought prone. Droughts may lead to large-scale losses of assets and livestock, and high mortality due to starvation.

Suggestions for Facilitators Prior to Training Although the most effective trainers are able to address the emerging needs of trainees in a flexible manner, the following notes offer a basic outline of activities that TLC facilitators may use to lead trainings. To prepare for training, facilitators may find it useful to: \u2022 Review the Module Learning Objectives listed above, \u2022 Review the Suggested Methods and Activities listed below, \u2022 Assess the anticipated knowledge needs, interests, and constraints of trainees, \u2022 Identify additional potentially effective activities suitable for their particular trainees, \u2022 Review related background literature on School Safety in India, this can include but is not limited to the reference material listed at the end of this document and the modules, o Prepare your own notes so that you may convey the relevant information in a way that is comfortable for you. o Do not feel constrained by the information on the slides-this is merely a guide for you. \u2022 Prepare materials for the training, including: o Powerpoint or other presentation materials including revisions if desired o Print-outs or any other necessary handouts o Tools and props needed for activities o Rewards or treats to encourage involvement and participation 2. Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials Needed: PowerPoint presentation, whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, module materials, your own notes based on those materials, a pack of hazard handouts for the teachers 3. Suggested Methods and Activities Introduce the module using the Title and Objectives pages. This should only take a matter of a few minutes. Move on to explain the Contents of the presentation, topic by topic, so that the teachers understand what will happen in the next hour and a half. Making Schools Safer 30 Activity 1: 5-10mins Reveal the title of the slide \"What is a Disaster?\" and ask the teachers to introduce themselves to the person next to them (name, school, specialist subject, favourite ice cream, etc), and then ask them to spend the next few minutes discussing what a disaster is. After a few minutes, get them to stop. You should then ask around the room and get suggestions from pairs as to what they came up with. Write these on the board for everyone to see, until you have about four or five different ideas. After this, you should reveal the content of the slide, to show the real definition of a disaster, as well as disaster risk.

Where appropriate, get them to also give an example of a time when that hazard has occurred in India, in school, or both. Correct any suggestions that are not legitimate, and at the end reveal the next slide that shows the full list and their classifications. (NOTE: Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear hazards are listed under the heading 'CBRN') Use the following slide to better explain the terms 'natural' and 'man-made' then get the teachers to suggest how a disaster may be both of them at once. With the help of the next few slides, go on to describe the effects of disasters on schools and their role as actors within community based disaster risk reduction. Move on to explain that you will cover the 5 most prominent dangers to schools in India: Earthquake, Cyclone/Windstorm, Fire and Accidents, Flood, and Tsunami. The coverage of each of these hazards includes: a scientific explanation of the hazard, which areas of India are at risk, the effects of the hazard (either in general or on schools) and in some cases a related example of the effects. Give the hazard handouts for the teachers and explain that each page summarises each hazard in a way that children should be able to understand, and that it should help to refresh their own memory in future. The sets of slides for each hazard will include information as to whether it is a rapid onset, slow onset or rising tide disaster. As the accompanying material partly explains: rapid onset disasters do their damage quickly over a short period of time and have little warning, e.g. earthquake; slow onset disasters cause their initial damage over a longer period of time and give more warning, e.g. cyclones and volcanoes; and 'rising tide' disasters are a type of slow onset disaster in which the situation gradually gets worse over a period of time, e.g. drought and some flood situations. Introduction to School Safety in India 31 Earthquake For up to 10 minutes, go through the material on earthquakes, explaining the scientific cause and characteristics, which areas of India are most at risk, and describing the effects of the 2001 Gujarat Earthquake. Cyclone Similarly, for up to 10 minutes, use the next 3 slides to explain about cyclones. The first slide concentrates on the scientific basis and its physical nature. The second slide shows which areas of India are affected. NOTE: please mention that the dark area over Kashmir is a mistake - it is not cyclone prone. Go on to explain the 3 main effects of cyclones with the help of the third slide. Tsunami Continue as before, explaining the hazard of tsunami and its effects. The second page contains the most technical information related to the characteristics of the waves. It may be necessary to pay this special attention, as many people believe tsunami to be simply bigger than average waves. Use the graph from the 1960 Chilean Tsunami, to show the measurement of wave height at the effected town of Hilo in Hawaii. Note the unpredictability, the location of the biggest wave amidst the others, and the recession of the water level before the largest waves. The worsening factors are all related to the dissipation and concentration of the energy of the wave. Fire and Accidents Spend the same amount of time explaining about fire safety and general health and safety in schools. A key point is that non-disaster effected areas have better knowledge and systems in place for general safety, but do not possess as much disaster knowledge. The theme of accidents and general health ad safety is often overlooked and includes aspects such as child protection from abuse and the provision of adequate toilet facilities. Similarly to the Gujarat Earthquake in 2001, the Kumbhakonam Fire Tragedy in 2004 was a starting point for many school safety initiatives. Also briefly mention the Kerala boat tragedy - a school trip in which 15 children and 3 teachers drowned. Flood Use the following 3 slides to explain the risk of flooding in schools. Flooding can occur due to many different factors, and it is important that the teachers understand the differences. The main difference is usually the speed at which it occurs. Flash floods, failure of defences, and some coastal effects occur very quickly, whereas the other types emerge more slowly. The grey shaded areas on the map are those that are at risk from flooding.

Presentation Guidelines Making Schools Safer 44 2.1 School Safety Context in India1 With the spread of education, more and more children go to schools that are vulnerable to fire hazards, earthquake, pollution, cyclone, food poisoning, stampede and so on. The Kumbhakonam school fire tragedy that killed 93 children is not an exception but a harsh example of this reality. The Saraswati school in Kumbhakonam, Tamil Nadu, had cooking arrangements next to an inflammable roof that covered four makeshift classes that opened to a single narrow exit to the only staircase. Fire engulfed the roof, which fell on the children who were subsequently trapped in their four classrooms. There were 93 fatalities and many more were injured. As a timely response to the Kumbhakonam tragedy, the President of India, a scientist of the highest order encouraged the nation on July 24, 2004 to apply scientific measures to prepare schools against any disasters by promoting safety. Similarly, the Minister for Human Resources Development of the Government of India directed the Chief Ministers on July 28, 2004 to actively promote school safety emergency preparedness. The focus will be on scientific awareness of school safety; for which they will need IEC material, methods to demonstrate drills in schools, and wider involvement of the Civil Society, especially from the low-income communities where schools are most often at risk. The National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the Government of India also puts direct and full emphasis on \"providing universal access to quality basic education\". Unsafe schools adversely affect the quality and reach of education in schools in poor and low-income areas. Education itself should include safety awareness. Small preparedness measures can make a great difference in areas that are at risk. Today the world is facing disasters on a record scale. Since the 1990s, disasters have killed on average 58,000 people each year, and have affected another 225 million people. When a natural hazard strikes, children are among the most vulnerable groups, especially those attending school in times of disaster. Disasters such as the October 2005 Kashmir earthquake where over 17,000 children died in schools that collapsed in Pakistan and India, or the recent mudslide on Leyte Island in the Philippines, where more than 200 school children were buried alive, are just a few tragic examples of why more needs to be done to protect our children during catastrophic events. During disaster response at any phase, schools have not served at institutions for building capacities, but rather as vulnerabilities themselves. Many programmes are implemented after disasters strike, but they often lack proper research and are implemented without appropriate studies of local needs. School safety is the responsibility of everyone \u2014 staff, students, parents, the community and government. An audit is one tool that, if used effectively, can provide a snapshot of the school's safety situation and identify areas that need improvement. This proactive process will help ensure that students can achieve their learning potential within a safe and secure environment. 1 Information in this module is adapted from AIDMI - \"School Safety Audit: Towards Making Schools Safer\", September 2008. Conducting a School Safety Audit 45 There are many case studies to demonstrate vulnerability in Indian schools. A few specific tragic incidents can emphasise the importance of a school-based safety audit. The following incidents represent catastrophes in India made worse not only by lack of safe buildings but also lack of school based DRR practices. \u2022 December 23, 1995. Nearly 425 people, many of them school children, perished as they tried to escape a fire during a school prize giving ceremony in the town of Dabwali, Haryana. \u2022 January 26, 2001, Gujarat earthquake. 971 students and 31 teachers died in Bhuj Earthquake. 1,884 school buildings collapsed, 11,761 school buildings suffered major to minor damages, 5,950 classrooms were lost, 36,584 rooms became unfit for use. 300 children marching in Republic Day Processions in narrow lanes were killed when buildings collapsed into the street from both sides.

A deadly fire raged through Lord Krishna School killing 93 children, all below the age of 11 years. \u2022 December 26, 2004 South Indian tsunami. 252 schools in Tamil Nadu were left in need of complete reconstruction, 19 in need of major repairs and 49 in need of minor repairs. In Andoman and Nicobar Islands, 78 teachers were listed as dead or missing, 25 percent of primary schools, 33 percent of upper primary schools and 31 percent of senior secondary schools were seriously damaged. \u2022 February 20, 2007, Kerala boat tragedy. 15 children and 3 teachers died while crossing a river with a tattered boat on their way back from a school picnic. \u2022 April 16, 2008, Baroda bus tragedy. 47 students died travelling to a school in Baroda when the bus fell into the Narmada canal. Lessons from the above incidents with the school staff and students demonstrate that each school has different capacities and vulnerabilities, and needs are based on school location, type and many other factors. The school safety audit can guide stakeholders to prepare and implement school based safety initiatives according to vulnerability and capacity of the schools. 2.2 The School Safety Audit 2.2.1 Introducing the School Safety Audit Objectives of the School Safety Audit: \u2022 To assess the level of understanding and knowledge of school safety in teachers and administration staff in schools located in disaster prone and affected areas. (Linked with Hyogo Framework for Action, Priority for Action 2) \u2022 To conduct an audit of school safety in 60 schools in 6 states of India. The audit will not only focus on the school building, but also relate it to policies, data collection system, and staff development activities specific in school, staff and student safety. (Linked with Hyogo Framework for Action, Priority for Action 3) Making Schools Safer 46 \u2022 To assess types of structural and non-structural mitigation measures taken by agencies in schools after disaster and/or to prepare schools against future emergencies in disaster prone areas. (Linked with Hyogo Framework for Action, Priority for Action 5) 2.2.2 Coverage The study was conducted in six states of the India. These states are highly disaster affected and/or disaster prone. The majority of covered schools were selected based on their location in disaster prone and disaster affected areas. Assam: This state is highly prone to flood and is located in earthquake Zone V. However, due to security reasons, this study could only covered schools in the city of Guwahati; rural areas of Assam state are not safe for state outsiders. Guwahati was an appropriate area to conduct the audit as the city faces a recurring flood situation, and as it is a useful city for studying urban risk. Gujarat: Due to the state's multi-hazard scenario, several districts were covered - Ahmedabad, Anand, Gandhinagar, Anjar, Radhanpur, and Kutch. This is a state not only highly prone to natural disasters such as flood and earthquake, but also with a history of manmade disasters such as riots and bomb-blasts. Schools located in areas affected by recurring floods and the 2001 earthquake were covered from both urban and rural areas Jammu and Kashmir: Rural schools in this state, recently affected by the 2005 earthquake, have still not recovered from the disaster's impact. Geographical challenges make it difficult for schools and agencies to implement programmes in these areas, as many schools are isolated, difficult to reach by road, and located near the conflict-affected LoC with Pakistan. Maharashtra: Audit activities in this state only covered Mumbai, India's largest metropolis. Mumbai was badly affected by flood in 2005; other school concerns expressed during the course of the audit conduct included man-made disasters such as bomb blasts, and road accidents. Rajasthan: This is a state prone to slow onset disasters such as drought, which are often neglected by intervening agencies. Government and private schools were covered in both urban and rural areas. Tamil Nadu: Due to the 2004 tsunami, this state has had a very high level of interventions in recent years and still as a significant NGO presence. Because coastline villages were especially affected by the tsunami, a majority (9) of the schools identified for audit coverage were from rural areas. Government schools are the main source of education in rural areas; private schools are generally limited to urban areas. 2.2.3 The School Safety Audit Process To enhance accuracy and participation, the process used for conducting School Safety Audits is very important. From the beginning, the process needs to integrate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "688fd447-dcd3-4c62-8988-1b1696f57157": {"__data__": {"id_": "688fd447-dcd3-4c62-8988-1b1696f57157", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1d5294d53a6a7b642e7bb5433cad4752051f4014286052cfc25029a34a14ec95"}}, "hash": "1d5294d53a6a7b642e7bb5433cad4752051f4014286052cfc25029a34a14ec95", "text": "several key aspects such as stakeholder participation, duration, coverage, and various information regarding the schools.

Guideline for Schools 2.2.4 Data Collection and Analysis Throughout the study various research tools should be used for gathering crucial information at the grassroots level. \u2022 Questionnaires: Questionnaires can be divided into four sections based on the study objectives, o to collect data and measure teachers knowledge on disaster management; o to collect data related to safety measures; o to collect data related to implementation work done by outside agencies and on linking activities to the Hyogo Framework for Action. \u2022 Focus Group Discussions: FGD outline can be designed and conducted with specific issues on school safety with teachers, students and parents. \u2022 Meetings: Individual meetings can be organised with the school management and administrative staff, local and state agencies; individual professionals to collect information regarding existing policy, system, capacities and vulnerabilities as well. \u2022 Interviews: Interviews with the state and local agencies can be conducted to get their view on local situations; work on school safety, and other issues related to the study. \u2022 Study Subject Materials \u2014 Literature Review: Over the course of the study different materials can be studied from time to time by the team with different objectives. School Safety Audit Objective 1: Collect Data to Measure Teacher Knowledge of Disaster Management An initial step in the audit will be an assessment of teacher perception and understanding of subjects of disaster management and school safety. Information gathered will help inform development of manuals and guidelines for schools. Making Schools Safer 48 Questions can be divided into four sections. More information on each of the four aspects is provided below: i. Disaster Knowledge Quiz ii. Disaster and Experience iii. School and Disaster Preparedness iv. Government and School Safety Building the knowledge of teachers is a critical initial step towards making schools safer. This assessment of understanding helps schools, agencies and other concerned groups to design effective activities for school safety and capacity building. Disaster Knowledge Quiz Questions can be asked with the intention of assessing teachers' knowledge of disaster management and school safety. Most questions should be of a basic level, testing teacher knowledge on history of disaster in their area, government disaster structure, causes of disaster, etc. Disaster management courses should be offered to schools, and should be integrated into teacher syllabi. Disaster and Experience Questions assessing teacher experience with disasters should be assessed. This can include numbers of people trained in first aid. School and Disaster Preparedness Questions can also be asked about teacher views on whether children are at risk in schools. Many schools operate without basic safety facilities, even when located in disaster prone areas. Government and School Safety The audit may find out what training or support has been provided to teachers by the government in the area of school safety. School Safety Audit Objective 2: The Content of an Audit The school safety audit is based on information gathered about several indicators. There are various factors included in the audit such as safety of school buildings and grounds, disaster risk and preparedness levels in schools, knowledge of school staff and students, water and food security in schools, atmosphere within and outside of schools, community participation, etc. A School Safety Audit report can be consolidate findings by the following sections: i. School Profile ii. Safety and Security of Building iii. Data Collection Systems Conducting a School Safety Audit 49 iv. Staff and Student Capacity Building Activities v. Level of Community Involvement vi. Role and support from Government vii. Disaster Preparedness and Disaster Response Plan viii. Comments from Respondents School Safety Audit Objective 3: Impact of Activities To identify effective strategies for improving school safety, an audit should assess the success of prior safety programmes. This portion of the assessment can also draw out teacher and administrator views on safety and opportunities to link with the Hyogo Framework for Action. Example - Impact of Activities by Outside Agencies in Jammu and Kashmir High vulnerability of schools has been noted, especially since the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir. Private schools in urban areas (Srinager) are implementing their own safety measures, but there is need for more intervention. New schools constructed recently incorporate safe construction measures. Rural schools remain without basic facilities, even without a physical school building.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c990cf75-06c6-4449-b2f5-95d5dde219b1": {"__data__": {"id_": "c990cf75-06c6-4449-b2f5-95d5dde219b1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e7d7ec2e183337bd3fe8cba57c856cda121a411af8bcbbbb64bcfd635e2c1b23"}}, "hash": "e7d7ec2e183337bd3fe8cba57c856cda121a411af8bcbbbb64bcfd635e2c1b23", "text": "The earthquake affected schools remain neglected due to their location along the LoC. Agencies are also reluctant to work with these schools because of the distance from towns and the high cost of transportation. These schools have low attendance and some agencies may therefore view them as a lower priority. Nonetheless, there are agencies working with schools and implementing school specific programmes \u2014 but not as many as are needed. 2.3 Some Key Findings from a School Safety Audit in India A critical aspect of managing a School Safety Audit is communicating the results to stakeholders with interest in education, safety, and child development. When your Audit is complete, you may want to summarise key findings for specific target audiences such as the local or state media. A selection of key findings are listed below from AIDMI's School Safety Audit that was conducted in six states of India. 1. Findings varied based on school type: private vs. government, rural vs. urban, primary vs. middle and high school. For example, private schools demonstrated higher levels of construction safety than government schools, largely due to their financial capacities. Many rural schools had unsafe buildings or no buildings at all \u2014 educational activities took place in a vulnerable or damaged structures \u2014 whereas several urban schools were housed in sound structures. 2. There was a clear difference in activities and awareness levels between recent disaster affected and disaster prone areas. Many schools located in affected regions had implemented mitigation measures such as distribution of awareness materials, execution of mock drills, training for staff members, and knowledge building for students. Schools in Gujarat and Tamil Nadu demonstrated higher levels of awareness than schools in the other four covered states. Making Schools Safer 50 3. In states not affected by disaster recently, communities demonstrated higher emphasis on accidents and injuries than on disasters. Schools have effectively spread knowledge of traffic safety, but have so far neglected to teach simple tips or \"Dos and Don'ts\" for disaster situations. This indicates that we do not always learn from past emergencies and do not use lessons from disaster experience of other states of the nation. This reflects a lack of effort toward disaster preparedness and long-term sustainable work. 4. In Tamil Nadu, many agencies have been involved in tsunami recovery, but very few have worked directly with schools. In cases where relief and rehabilitation agencies did work with schools, their focus was largely limited to construction of new school buildings, with little regard to school safety and disaster preparedness. Furthermore, construction was often undertaken without input from school staff regarding needs. Teachers indicated that within a few years of construction, buildings began leaking during the monsoons. New schools had enough classrooms for proper educational activities, but very few schools had adequate toilet facilities. 5. None of the students or teachers from the surveyed schools were covered by school-based insurance, with the exception of Gujarat state primary schools, which receive insurance coverage from the government. Many staff of rural schools lacked awareness and understanding of the concept of insurance. 6. Safer schools have not shared their experiences with schools that need to be rebuilt. 7. Most of the schools surveyed undertook efforts to create hazard-free grounds, including removing weak tree branches and checking electrical wiring before the monsoon season. This shows a proactive interest in school and child safety efforts. 8. The majority of schools surveyed were structurally unsound due to both old construction and lack of structural regulation for new construction. Several newly constructed private schools were structurally sound. 9. School safety is not a high priority for either public or corporate officials. 10. Several schools possessed safety equipment such as fire extinguishers and first aid kits, but in many cases staff lacked the skills to operate or use the equipment. Many of these schools also lacked the resources to replace exhausted or expired equipment. Private schools possessing safety equipment managed it through their own resources, and government schools possessing such equipment generally received it through support from community- based organisations. 11. Where DRR programmes and activities were implemented, follow-up activities were absent, diminishing the impact of their investments. 12. Processes and methods that reduce disaster risks were rarely considered, even after the occurrence of a major disaster. 13. The focus on reconstruction has been on new and big buildings, but not on safer buildings. 14. Teachers and administrators have high levels of interest in making schools safe. Current constraints in time and resources inhibit their capacity for action. Conducting a School Safety Audit 51 15.

Agencies are less likely to respond to slow-onset disasters such as drought, and schools in areas affected by such disasters are often neglected. Preparedness steps against those disasters can be taken in schools, such as rainwater harvesting. 17. Outside agency DRR work with schools placed greater emphasis on need-based projects than on demand-based efforts\u2014school input is lacking. As seen in Tamil Nadu reconstruction projects, many schools were built with enough classrooms, but without kitchens or toilets. This reflects an absence of school staff and student participation in the DRR process. 18. The absence of insurance protection and lack of insurance knowledge in schools was observed in all states. Only several tsunami-affected schools were found with student insurance policies. This policy support was given by NGOs initially and after that school operated by their own support. For them insurance protection is highly important and has emerged as a crucial tool for student safety. Several insured schools have coverage against natural hazards and man-made incidents such as road accidents involving students. 19. Most buildings are not sturdy enough to withstand severe cyclones or earthquakes. Many school structures are not designed to face these hazards. Many structures were also poorly maintained, with deteriorating materials causing visible corrosion and cracking. 2.4 Opportunities for Schools to Enhance Safety 1. Schools running school safety activities should invite local authority representatives to increase their involvement and promote expansion of such activities. 2. When outside agencies intervene, school representatives should proactively provide detailed school information regarding its profile, existing risk, vulnerabilities, and current needs. 3. Schools staff should be involved in every activity implemented by outside agencies, including needs assessment, programme design, implementation and evaluation. 4. Teachers have the highest level of local knowledge and understanding of students and their needs; they should proactively provide input to government and NGO programmes. 5. Schools should consider what roles their staff and students can play in DRR, and solicit outside agency support for developing activities. They should also solicit community involvement. 6. Schools should keep comprehensive records of student information, accident history, disaster history, and other emergency incidents to help inform future activities and interventions. 7. School should take the initiative to keep emergency contact numbers on site, and to teach critical numbers to students. Making Schools Safer 52 8. Schools should develop strategies for sustaining knowledge and safety measures after intervening agencies have left. 2.5 Sharing Audit Results with Other Local Schools \u2022 Encourages them to conduct their own audit and share their findings \u2022 Produces a culture of competition between local schools concerning safety \u2022 Allows them to share experiences of successful safety initiatives and measures \u2022 Builds strength in numbers \u2014 can work together to overcome obstacles and to secure financial and technical support from Government and Non-Government agencies References AIDMI - \"School Safety Audit: Towards Making Schools Safer\", September 2008 Useful Additional Resources 1.

Suggestions for Facilitators Prior to Training Although the most effective trainers are able to address the emerging needs of trainees in a flexible manner, the following notes offer a basic outline of activities that TLC facilitators may use to lead trainings. To prepare for training, facilitators may find it useful to: \u2022 Review the Module Learning Objectives listed above, \u2022 Review the Suggested Methods and Activities listed below, \u2022 Assess the anticipated knowledge needs, interests, and constraints of trainees, \u2022 Identify additional potentially effective activities suitable for their particular trainees, \u2022 Review related background literature on School Safety in India, this can include but is not limited to the reference material listed at the end of this document and the modules, o Prepare your own notes so that you may convey the relevant information in a way that is comfortable for you. o Do not feel constrained by the information on the slides-this is merely a guide for you. \u2022 Prepare materials for the training, including: o Powerpoint or other presentation materials including revisions if desired o Print-outs or any other necessary handouts o Tools and props needed for activities o Rewards or treats to encourage involvement and participation 2. Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials needed: PowerPoint presentation, whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, module materials, your own notes based on those materials, Audit checklist handout, handouts of examples of filled-out checklists for activity, 3. Suggested Methods and Activities Spend the first 5 minutes introducing the topic of the session, explaining the objectives of the session and making the contents of the presentation clear. The purpose of the slide entitled \"School Safety Context in India\" is to explain the reason why projects such as the School Safety Audit have come into existence - schools are inherently Conducting a School Safety Audit 59 unsafe. With the help of the materials, talk about the listed examples and how they call for more work to be conducted on school safety. This should take no longer than 10 minutes. Introduce the findings of AIDMI's School Safety Audit report by explaining the 3 main objectives and activities conducted within the project. Go on to explain the coverage of the project, and how it attempted to cover many different circumstances, such as: type of school, disaster-proneness, multi-hazard and school location (in terms of state and urban/rural). When describing the processes involved in conducting a School Safety Audit, be sure to make it clear that the teachers themselves will not be in the position to use all of the tools and methods, and that their individual audits will be on a smaller scale, as will be explained later on in the presentation. The process steps should be quickly explained but not dwelled upon; the tools of the audit are more important. These 3 slides should take no longer than 10 minutes. The following 3 slides should be used to present examples from each of the 3 objectives. This will give the teachers a taster of the results and will also inform them of what the national levels are like.

Again, this should take around 10 minutes. Go on to share the overall findings of the audit in the next couple of slides, paying particular attention to the implications for schools - this concerns the teachers the most. This section can take up to 10 minutes also. If you find in practice that you have spare time, feel free to include relevant recommendations for other bodies. The second half of the presentation is concerned with familiarising the teachers with the questions used in section B of the Audit. The checklist handout should be given to each of the teachers. For a few minutes, explain how the checklist is to be filled out, and what possible results might indicate. This includes the list of \"Do's\", in the presentation. Activity 1: 20-25mins Once they are familiar with the contents of the checklist, ask them to get into groups of 3 or 4. Hand out a number of checklists that have been filled out by schools for the School Safety Audit. For the next 15 minutes, the groups should discuss their example and come up with ideas for how the school can improve their safety, based on its deficiencies. These ideas should not simply be statements such as 'get an insurance policy'; they should give details about the strategy of achieving these goals. Once the time is up, get each group to share their ideas with the other groups. Make sure that they do not waste time worrying about how they are going to present it - this is not important. Note down the ideas and strategies on the board as they emerge. Invite the groups to comment on each other's ideas, so that some critical evaluation of potential methods can take place. Be sure to also note down the results of this discussion, and any obstacles that are present. During the discussion, you may wish to ask groups for additional ideas about some of the other criteria in the checklist, and how they would go about turning a 'No' into a 'Yes'. Alternatively, you could also use the Disaster Vulnerability and Coping Capacity Matrix as shown below to design your exercise for this session. You can design a rating scale to receive feedback on key School Safety Audit issues from the participants as shown below.

This is only a sample questionnaire for explaining and practice. You can modify it to suit your school's specific vulnerabilities and coping capacities. 2. Please put a tick mark on your response. The Likert Scale is used for evaluation. The values increase in ascending order i.e. 1 for response on the left and 3 for next response on the right, 5 for next and so on up to 9. 3. In case if a particular question is not applicable to your school / institution, write explanatory notes. The model can be used not just for schools but also for any set up / organisation housed in a building or premises.

Sharing results with NGOs and other agencies is also beneficial, and the emphasis of such actions will be increased if many schools do so. Finally, give details of two national bodies: Sarva Shiksh Abhiyan (SSA) and the GoI's National Common Minimum Programme. Encourage teachers to approach these bodies for financial and technical assistance once they have provisional ideas for a strategy to improve their safety, based on their audit results. 4.

As such, they should be resilient to disasters. To promote a culture of disaster safety in schools, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society (SEEDS) India has pioneered a \"School Safety Initiative\". The idea is it to reach parents and eventually the community at large, through school students. The Initiative sought to build the capacity of communities and school students and teachers, and help them develop school disaster management plans. Activities included raising awareness among school students and teachers, training students on various skills, developing evacuation plans, and conducting mock drills. Seismic retrofitting of school buildings was undertaken in some areas. Throughout the western state of Gujarat, teachers were trained, and a school curriculum and a text book on disaster management developed. 3.1.1 The Initiative The Initiative, called \"School Safety Initiative\", sought to promote a culture of disaster safety in schools by developing capacity among communities and school students and teachers, and helping them develop school disaster management plans (SDMPs). Its activities included: raising awareness among school students and teachers; training student task forces on fire safety, emergency search and rescue, first aid, developing emergency evacuation plans, conducting earthquake evacuation mock drills, and preparing school disaster management plans.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2ae4b101-4670-4dcf-8bdc-2f1653d64752": {"__data__": {"id_": "2ae4b101-4670-4dcf-8bdc-2f1653d64752", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d869f8e04bc6703d75ac8aae457746297bbb23bd031a8619340b370ba21e8b1"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4818156-be96-4177-9c14-5f3f61c7fd5a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "556d5ae2f2743dfabeeb19aac1999327d3cfd623ad5c511c365019ae3777c9d4"}}, "hash": "243d46e81d097707d47e9927670c701c7c8e548bea249125009ff7f0f6cd7ca2", "text": "The Initiative has been implemented since 2005 in the following areas: Delhi, the capital city of India; the state of Gujarat in western India; and Andaman in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands off the eastern coast.

The training of a first batch of 45 teachers was completed in March 2007 as a Pilot Project. All the above-mentioned activities were carried out over the last two years, after SEEDS pioneered school safety initiatives in India in 2005. The main beneficiaries are students and teachers from over 200 schools. The Initiative was supported by various donors including national and state governments and international donors. Funding was provided by the following donors: \u2022 Geo Hazards International and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) - for the Delhi Earthquake Safety Initiative; \u2022 The Government of Gujarat - for the Gujarat School Safety Initiative; \u2022 Christian Aid and Dan Church Aid - for the Andaman School Safety Initiative and; \u2022 Christian Aid - for the Global Open Learning Forum on Risk Education (GOLFRE). 3.1.2 Impacts and Results A visible impact of the Initiative is strong awareness of disaster safety issues and involvement in the basics of disaster preparedness among the targeted schools and communities. Over 200 schools have been covered by the Initiative in the last two years of its implementation, and 2,500 teachers and some 100,000 students have benefited. Overall success was achieved despite the fact that some of the schools were so busy with their academic activities that they could not concentrate on school safety activities. Many schools were found to be repeating the activities from their own initiative after the Initiative activities were completed. The positive impact and results of the Initiative have led, in Gujarat State, to plans for another phase of the Initiative. 3.1.3 The Good Practice This Initiative can be considered a good practice because of its pioneer character in seeking to promote a culture of disaster safety in schools, which are the most suitable areas for sowing enduring good habits and practices. To this end, the Initiative, for instance, had a four-pronged approach in earthquake-prone areas: 1. structural retrofitting of school buildings to prevent their collapse in future earthquakes; 2. implementing non-structural mitigation measures to avoid injuries from falling hazards in schools; 3. education on safe infrastructure for school management staff and construction workers; and 4. preparing school disaster management plans and training school communities in immediate response, evacuation and first aid. Making Schools Safer 72 SEEDS believes that disaster education focusing on the school community should follow Dr. Daisaku Ikeda's proposal, found in the challenge of Global Empowerment: Education for a Sustainable Future, for environmental education. The approach should consist in helping school students, teachers and management To Learn, To Reflect and To Empower: \u2022 To Learn: Students deepen their awareness about hazards and risks when they understand realities and know facts. Recent natural disasters are well documented and shared. These serve as case studies for teachers as well as students. Wherever needed, disasters are simulated with the help of portable models. The learning process is strengthened by curriculum change. \u2022 To Reflect: Students analyse factors leading to human casualties and injuries in disasters, so that they can recognise development practices and human actions that can cause disasters or prevent them. Students are connected to their own local communities and families and share their learning with them. \u2022 To Empower: Students take concrete action toward reducing risks in their environment. Classroom and school exercises are introduced to help them take small definitive actions that can become a precursor to bigger investments for disaster risk reduction. School students, teachers and management developed disaster management plans for their schools. In the process, they came to know existing structural and non-structural weaknesses. Efforts were made to ensure that the school community took ownership of the plan and made the necessary updates in the future. It is to be noted that involving teachers is essential for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c322a2f1-29d2-4a22-af34-c24de3e618bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "c322a2f1-29d2-4a22-af34-c24de3e618bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "92bc264dfca8d03ff0e4146209462ae21839f87737ae65f1b1703cbe33b29899"}}, "hash": "92bc264dfca8d03ff0e4146209462ae21839f87737ae65f1b1703cbe33b29899", "text": "the success of any activity with students. Students were trained to identify hazards inside their schools through a \"hazard hunt\" exercise. They were also provided with a similar checklist for doing \"home work\" \u2013 to identify hazards in and around their homes. The DRR message disseminated as the students shared information and knowledge with their parents, relatives, friends, and neighbours. 3.1.4 Approach The main objective of the various projects involved is to develop a school disaster management plan (SDMP). A community-based disaster management approach is followed, involving the following steps: \u2022 Raising awareness of disaster issues among the targeted stakeholders (students, teachers, school management and others) through lectures, discussions, posters, drama (street play) and demonstration. \u2022 Identifying and listing hazards and vulnerabilities outside the school as well as structural and non-structural hazards inside the school. \u2022 Identifying and listing ways of reducing vulnerabilities. \u2022 Identifying the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders. \u2022 Training teachers on how to prepare a school evacuation plan and preparing a school evacuation plan. Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India 73 \u2022 Building emergency response capacity, focusing on skills such as rescue and first aid (training provided to student groups). \u2022 Listing, in the school disaster management plan, the contact information of all facilities and resources for emergency management. \u2022 Conducting a mock drill, at the end of the school safety activities, to demonstrate the evacuation, rescue and first aid skills acquired by the students. \u2022 Keeping targeted schools informed through a newsletter. \u2022 Promoting School Safety Clubs to sustain risk education. 3.1.5 Lessons Learned A key lesson learned from the Initiative was that school management should be sensitised to the importance of risk education before implementing such an initiative. Another key lesson was that master teachers among teachers need to be trained first so that they can train other teachers. This model was used in the state of Gujarat State and it worked well. First, some 100 master trainers from all districts of Gujarat were given orientation training. Then the trained master trainers trained teachers in each of the districts. All the trained teachers can help provide further training in the future. 3.1.6 Potential for Replication Replicating this practice would be very easy. The approach used is similar to the one used for communities. Here, a school is considered as a community. The activities carried out to raise awareness, build capacity and develop disaster management plans are all similar to those used in the community approach. 3.2 Case Study 2: AIDMI \u2013 Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign2 3.2.1 Introduction and Background In the past 20 years we have seen an increase in disasters and the affects they have on children. More and more children go to schools that are at risk to fire hazards, earthquakes, floods, cyclones, pollution, food poising, stampedes and so on. At least 17,000 school children died when 6,700 schools were destroyed in North-West Frontier Province and 1,300 in Pakistan- administered Kashmir as children attended morning classes. In 2004, 94 children perished in a fiery blaze in Kumbhakonam, Tamil Nadu and 931 students where crushed to death during the Gujarat earthquake in 2001. India is a country with diverse range of disaster risks: 70 % of the cultivable land is prone to drought, 60 % of the land is prone to Earthquake, 12 % to Floods, and 8 % to Cyclones. Overall, 85 % of the land area is vulnerable to numerous natural hazards and 22 Indian states are categorised as multi hazards regions. In the decade of 1990 \u2013 2000, an 2 Case Study from: AIDMI - \"Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign: A National Campaign - Project Completion Report\" Making Schools Safer 74 average of about 30 million people were affected and 4,344 people have died every year in India due to disasters. With a large percentage of the Indian population living in poverty (36% living below the official poverty line) and with a literacy rate of just over 50%, it is imperative for the future development of India that children have access to education. Over 78 million children are currently in need of schooling. To meet this great demand, many schools especially in low-income areas are overburdened. The result is that these school - out of lack of resources or awareness - compromise on the safety of the school. A world without poverty is not possible without the poor having access to education through schools - safe schools. The poor have the right to life, their children have a right to life and that includes a right to life in safe schools.

But school safety is not possible without scientific awareness and preparedness. Lack of basic scientific knowledge on safe (seismic) construction and building materials, adequate exits and staircases are often shockingly missing. It is difficult to understand why schools that teach science in their classes fail to notice these hazards. Science has remained a subject in books that has not entered into day-to-day awareness. Unsafe schools are a reality. It was proposed to cover targeted schools with: a. disaster risk insurance, b. installation of direct micro mitigation measures (fire extinguishers), c. school safety measures displayed in public areas, d. school safety included in course work, and e. school safety training for teachers/ administrative staff of the targeted schools. 3.2.2 Objective, Duration and Coverage The key objectives of Campaign has been to provide direct support action to the victims, schools, school boards, and city authorities primarily serving the children of the poor; and to spread awareness about children's right to safer schools across various stakeholders in India. With inputs and suggestions from various education authorities and education experts, AIDMI has supported five schools in Gujarat with all the activities of the project. The project supported five schools in Gujarat state namely: Danilimda School # 1, Sheth C. N. Vidhyalay of Ahmedabad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Vidhyalay of Baroda, M. U. Patel Technical High School of Vallabh Vidhyanagar and Shantinagar (Shivnagar) Primary School of Bhuj. 3.2.3 Overview of Activities The Campaign covered targeted schools through the following activities: Installation of Micro Mitigation Measures (fire extinguishers): To increase physical safety and security of schools, school staff and children through preparedness measures. Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India 75 First Aid Kits: To mitigate impacts of accidents and events from which school staff and children have risk of physical damage and threat to life. Disaster Risk Insurance: To provide non-physical measures to make schools safer through financial risk transfer. School Safety Measures Displayed in Public Areas: To generate awareness among school administration, teachers, parents and students on school safety. School Safety included in Course Work: To promote school safety guidelines through information, education and communication material to inform the child that it has a right to a safe school and that its parents should demand that schools are safer and secure. School Safety Training for Teachers/Administrative Staff: To make school safety plans which could be implemented with support from school administration, school board, parents, AIDMI and other agencies. 3.2.4 Outputs and Outcomes Fire Safety Equipment Demonstration: Before the installation of the fire safety equipments in the schools, it was essential that the target group was capable of operating them. Taking this preparedness into action, demonstration on using fire safety equipment (fire extinguisher) was organised in all of the five supported schools. A technical expert led the demonstration and gave guidance on how to use the equipment. After this, school staff members and students were encouraged to demonstrate their knowledge of using fire safety equipment. Installation of Micro Mitigation Measures (fire extinguishers): Immediately after the demonstration, fire safety equipment was installed in the schools. Their locations were decided with inputs from the school administrators and the technical expert. All the fire safety equipment was installed where they were easily reachable and accessible and in knowledge of all the staff members and students. 20 fire extinguishers in each of the five schools were installed. First Aid Kits: First aid kits were also handed over to the schools. All the five schools were supported with one first aid kit. Coverage of School Children and Staff with Disaster Risk Insurance: Four out of the five supported schools received an insurance policy that covers accident of students and staff. The risk coverage is not limited to school hours, but includes before and after the schooling time.

Along with these posters, a Preparedness Pocketbook Series on Disaster First Aid and Science in the Service of School Safety, issue of Afat Nivaran, Experience Learning Series on Disaster Preparedness for Schools and Experiences of Children after the 2001 Earthquake were also given to the school. School Safety Training for Teachers/Administrative Staff: AIDMI conducted a training on Disaster Preparedness for School Safety in September 2006, in Ahmedabad. Two participants from each of the five supported schools attended this training. 3.2.5 Recommendations for the Expanding School Safety Long-term Plan for School Safety: Based on the experiences from this project, the Safer School Campaign should be expanded. AIDMI recommends that in order to achieve the desired impact at the project level, a long-term approach should be developed to sustain and advance the achievements. AIDMI has organised a round table to get ideas of participants involved in education sector from different locations of India and abroad. Expansion/ extension of the School Safety Insurance: Many of the schools covered in this project are located in multi hazard prone and low income areas. AIDMI recommends renewing their insurance coverage for one more year. Similar low income area schools are also sending their requests to extend the project activities into their schools, hence it is recommended to expand Safer School Campaign to such needful schools. Outreach to Additional Disaster-Prone Schools: AIDMI has received numerous demands for preparing similar training programs for other teachers and school children. Many of them have already worked in disaster situation and all of them want to work more actively for school safety in their respective schools and nearby schools. Refresher Courses: AIDMI would also recommend a series of tailor-made courses for the participants trained for school safety. By giving feedback, the participants themselves could explain in which area they would like more information or clarification Hazard Assessment of Schools: Hazard, vulnerability and capacity assessments should be periodically conducted. This can raise awareness and help maintain targeting of Campaign activities. Fire Safety Drills: As suggested by some supported school staff members, AIDMI recommends including fire safety drills for school teachers, administrative staff and senior students. Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India 77 Publication to Promote the School Safety Campaign: Experiences, case studies and learning should be disseminated by various means of learning tools, publications and trainings. AIDMI has developed a kit of various publications on school preparedness and safety. During a round table organised by AIDMI participants explained that they found it very useful and suggested to disseminate it to more schools to generate awareness. Hazard Mapping of Schools through Geographical Information System: GIS is a useful tool to combine information related to hazard and vulnerability derived through various sources. It is recommended to make GIS map of the schools covered and utilise them for risk reduction of the schools and to make safety plans. 3.3 Case Study 3: Government of India \u2013 School Safety Programme3 The School Safety Programme was led by the National Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India. The goal of the Programme is to - \"promote a culture of disaster preparedness in the school community\". Basic Components: \u2022 Promoting Awareness and Education Activities \u2022 Demonstrating Disaster Risk Management \u2022 Training and Capacity Building \u2022 Annual Safety Assessment This Programme works on two operational fronts: district level and school building level. The district-wide programme targets education departments, administrators, emergency officials, teachers, students and the wider community. The school building-level programme focuses on school specific measures. The main activities of the Programme are as follows: \u2022 Place school safety on the education agenda \u2022 Create a School Safety Advisory Committee at the district level \u2022 Develop a District-wide School Safety Plan and individual plans for each school \u2022 Appoint a Building-level School Safety Team in each school \u2022 Each school prepares a School Building-Level Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan \u2022 Establish a district-wide incident reporting system \u2022 Develop a literature database on school safety issues \u2022 Develop safety policies and amendments to ensure adherence to safety norms and regulations 3 Government of India - \"School Safety - Draft, Series 1.0\" Making Schools Safer 78 \u2022 Establish disaster management clubs in schools \u2022 Support 'Preparedness Month for Schools' The Hazard Hunt and Evacuation Plans are for use on the school building level. The Hazard Hunt activity is a simple form of risk assessment within schools. It would be worthwhile to educate students on the concepts and practice of risk assessment within class before setting them the Hazard Hunt task.

However, it is possible to involve the students to a higher degree, by allowing them to design the displays and getting input from them on revisions of the plan. In the Hazard Hunt exercise, children go around the school looking for hazards. Hazards they might find include open electricity panels and live wires, slippery floors, obstructions to escape routes, badly placed or secured furniture, and structural cracks. Many of these can be mitigated simply within existing capacity and the risk of ill effects of disasters can be reduced. Evacuation Plans are produced for each floor and are devised by building-level School Safety Teams consisting of teachers, parents, community members, local emergency services and authorities. These plans are then displayed all over the school in corridors, and mock drills are conducted soon after to test their effectiveness. Key Aspects of the School Safety Programme: \u2022 Aims to mainstream disaster management training within education \u2022 Helps schools to become self-sufficient in terms of disaster preparedness \u2022 Children's knowledge transfers to parents and wider community - recognises schools effectiveness at disseminating information \u2022 Regular activities throughout the year maintain momentum and ensure follow-up activities \u2022 Recognises the important role of schools within the community and their potential impact on the future of the country 3.4 Case Study 4: Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Project \u2013 Disaster Management Activities in Schools4 3.4.1 Background The Indian sub-continent is highly prone to natural disasters. Floods, Wind, Cyclones, Droughts and Earthquakes are recurrent phenomena. As per the latest damage risk zoning map of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) over 65% area of India is prone to earthquakes of considerable intensities. Some of the most intense earthquakes have occurred in India and its adjacent areas in the past. India has highly populated mega cities including the capital in New Delhi situated in zones of high seismic risk. Geologically Kolkata falls within Moderate Earthquake Damage Risk Zone (Zone-III) within very close vicinity of High Earthquake Damage Risk Zone (Zone-IV) of North and South 24 Parganas districts. The same area falls under Very 4 From: Kolkata Municipal Corporation - KolkataMyCity.com Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India 79 High Wind and Cyclone Damage Risk Zone also. Beyond this, some human induced factors as unsafe buildings, unplanned urbanisation, dense population and habitats have increased its vulnerability to disasters to considerable extent. Apart from natural disasters, human induced disasters like fire, gas leak, flood due to blockage of drainage system, terrorist attack, accidents etc. are common in urban areas. Disasters lead to erosion of development gains and restricted options for the affected people. Physical safety - especially that of the vulnerable groups, which include children, old and physically handicapped people, is threatened. The Orissa cyclone of 1999, the Gujarat earthquake of 2001 and the Tsunami of 2004 have very clearly illustrated that we need pre- disaster mitigation, preparedness and response systems at all levels (including schools) so that the threat to human lives and property is minimised. Schools are critical institutions influencing development of a country and so damage/loss of lives or property of schools badly affects the development of a whole nation. Students are the future citizens of the country and the teachers are makers of a nation. Both are vulnerable to great physical and psychological sufferings caused by a disaster - natural or human induced. Most of the schools operating in urban areas are built in congested places and many of those have structural inadequacies. These factors combined with ignorance and lack of preparedness measures can have disastrous consequences in the event of earthquake in this region. The Disaster Risk management Programme (DRMP) is a national initiative jointly launched by Govt. of India and United Nations Development Programme to reduce vulnerabilities of communities in some of the most hazard prone areas of India (17 states and 169 districts). The programme aims to contribute to the social and economic development goals of the national and state governments, enable them to minimise losses to development gains and to reduce their vulnerability to disasters. For sustainability, it relies upon a community based approach and seeks to build capacities of all sections of the society and all the other stake holders in disaster management. The Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Programme (UEVRP), a sub-component programme of DRMP for urban areas, is being implemented by the city municipal authorities under state government monitoring in 38 populous vulnerable cities in India. States involved include Kolkata and Asansol in West Bengal with the objective", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e7df1154-9b11-4041-ab1e-949567617f4c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e7df1154-9b11-4041-ab1e-949567617f4c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b6099dd1aed56cb43c5765570b89732470002875a52cccfc1292b0d6dd176df"}, "3": {"node_id": "cb9a8ca2-73dc-48bc-8447-fd5dee0e3d7c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "03e2e8125c6796023f9ca4eccb0e1afeec7e41d23e10e76136112eefbfec3d37"}}, "hash": "abe2a4576c2391de52ad6d14f338a9c3993c592af86073f233f6dcb36cc13b0a", "text": "of sustainable reduction in disaster risks (with focus on earthquake) across the country. 3.4.2 Activities UEVRP envisages the following broad activities: 1. Awareness Generation. 2. Development of Preparedness and Response Plans at the Community as well as Administrative levels. 3. Training and Capacity Building at all levels. 4. Development of Techno-Legal Regime (e.g. Amendment of Building Rules, Guidelines etc.). 5. Networking of Knowledge and Best Practices both Nationally and Internationally. Making Schools Safer 80 The step-wise programmed activities for School Safety are: \u2022 Centralised Activities: Awareness Training of School Teachers (one/two representing each School depending on the number of students and staff in the school) to be organised by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. \u2022 Decentralised Activities (for each school): Following activities are to be initiated, organised and coordinated in a school by the teacher/staff who represented that school in the above centralised awareness meeting. In fact, proper implementation of the school safety programme has been materialised in many schools without making hindrance to their normal functioning. Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation Activities in a School - Step-wise activities for a school: 1. Sensitisation meeting for Teachers, Management, Staff and Students of the School on probable natural and human induced disaster threats in the area and measures required for minimising losses. 2. Formation of Disaster Management Committee in the school. 3. Formation of School Disaster Management Teams comprising of senior students, teachers and non-teaching staff. 4. Hazard Identification and Safety Assessment. Preparation of a checklist (see below) on the basis of which the present safety of the school can be examined and actions can be planned in the future to make the school a safer place. 5. Making Inventory of resources that may help in crisis management (immediate response, emergency relief, emergency shelter etc.). 6. Training and capacity building of School Disaster Management Teams in respective subjects e.g. Warning and Information, Emergency Evacuation, Search and Rescue, Fire Fighting, basic First Aid etc. 7. Preparation of Disaster Management Plan for the School showing coordination with all emergency services (e.g. Municipal Corporation, Fire, Civil Defence, Police, Health, Local NGOs/CBOs etc.) and local people. 8. Display Floor wise evacuation route maps on every floor in the school. Put up signs for exits on walls and roof etc. 9. Dissemination of School DM Plan to everybody in the School (also to the guardians). Call a meeting and discuss the plan with all staff members. 10. Mock drill at regular intervals to acquire skill and keep practice. 11. Adoption of Structural and Non-structural Mitigation measures for the school building(s) 3.4.3 Expected Outcomes After proper implementation of the School Safety Programme, it is expected that the schools will be equipped to mitigate disasters and efficiently cope up with any disaster situation collectively in a well planned, disciplined, well organised manner.

He came to the state of Tamil Nadu and took refuge along with many other families in Mudaliyarkuppam Village. After some time he married Vijayalakshmi, a girl from his community. Their family grew quickly, with four sons born in a relatively short period. Francis began working as a labourer at a church three kilometres from his new village while Vijayalakshmi took care of the children and household responsibilities. On December 4, 2006, Francis took his family to visit his mother. The children had grown\u2014the youngest son, Gana, was now studying in 4th standard.

Gana was looking forward to buying some chocolate, one of his favourite treats. While returning to their village they saw a shop across the road and Gana asked his father if he could go to purchase chocolate for himself and his brothers. As he ran across the street a speeding car struck him, knocking him off the road. The driver fled the scene. Gana was covered in blood. Francis and his wife, in a state of panic and intense distress, rushed Gana to a local hospital, the Puducherry Institute of Medical Science. Gana was under observation and treatment for two days as he battled for life. He underwent all kinds of tests, scans and treatments. In his state of grief, Francis also had to struggle for money; medical bills were approaching 20,000 Rupees. Borrowing from relatives, friends and others, he managed to obtain the money at a total yearly interest rate of around 10%. But after two days Gana was dead. With his wife and remaining three sons mourning and crying, Francis was joined by other community members to cremate the body. After his son's death, Francis spent another 10,000 Rupees on various formalities and preparations. The now 30,000 Rupee total was an enormous debt that he would be unable to pay with his present salary. He found it difficult to focus on his work, as did his wife, and his three sons, all of them excellent students, lost their ability to concentrate on their studies. Gana had been a student at the Panchayat Union Primary School of Mudaliyarkuppam village. This school is one of the 30 tsunami-affected schools in Tamil Nadu covered under the Student Safety Insurance Policy arranged by AIDMI's Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign. The policy covers students and teachers alike for harm inflicted by any type of accident or disaster. It covers them in and out of school, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. After being informed of Gana's death, AIDMI immediately initiated the claim process. As per the insurance plan, Francis was entitled to 27,500 Rupees for life insurance and medical expenses reimbursement. Nobody can alleviate the immense sorrow brought about by the death of a family member. Yet the insurance plan\u2014which covered Gana for a premium of just 17 Rupees per year\u2014protected Francis and his family from a financial burden that would likely have kept them impoverished for the rest of their lives. It gave them the means to keep Gana's brothers in school, rather than forcing them to drop out and work to support the family. While we cannot put a price on life or health, we can recognise the pertinent financial issues that stem from death and injury, and their potential to have significant impacts on the lives of loved ones. All students in India are vulnerable to accident and disaster. It is important that we mitigate these risks to promote the welfare of vulnerable communities and families throughout the country. Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India 83 Annex 2: Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Programme Government of India and UNDP Disaster Preparedness and Mitigation Activities in a School Step-wise activities for a school (These activities are simple and can be done without hampering the normal functioning of the school): 1. Sensitisation meeting for Teachers, Management, Staff and Students of the School on probable natural and human induced disaster threats in the area and measures required for minimising losses. 2. Formation of Disaster Management Committee in the school. It may be resolved to enable the School Development Committee to act as School Disaster Management Committee. 3. Formation of School Disaster Management Teams comprising of senior students, teachers and non-teaching staff. At least 5 teams will be formed for different purposes as below and each team should have around 15 members: a. Awareness Generation, Warning, Information Collection and Information Dissemination Team b. Emergency Evacuation and School Security Team c. Search and Rescue Team d. Fire Prevention and Control Team e. First aid Team 4. Hazard Identification and Safety Assessment. Preparation of a checklist (see below) on the basis of which the present safety of the school can be examined and actions can be planned in the future to make the school a safer place.

Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials needed: PowerPoint presentation, whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, module materials, your own notes based on those materials, SDMPs handouts, disaster risk insurance story, SWOT sheet handouts. 3. Suggested Methods and Activities Spend the first 5 minutes explaining the purpose of the module and introducing the titles of the four case studies. 20 minutes should be spent on the presentation of each case study (so approximately 5 minutes per slide). Case Examples of School Safety Initiatives in India 87 1st Case Study: The Gujarat School Safety Initiative, run by SEEDS India and supported by the Gujarat State Disaster Management Authority. Use the supporting documents about the initiative to explain the activities and the areas of good practice. This example has a strong focus on methods that are student centred. Special attention is given to the creation of School Disaster Management Plans (SDMPs). Explain the process and give out the SDMPs handouts (http://www.preventionweb.net/ english/professional/trainings-events/edu-materials/v.php?id=6933. These will be useful for teachers to take with them, so that they may consider similar plans in their own school. Another useful guideline on preparation of the School Disaster Management Plan can be downloaded from http://www.preventionweb.net/files/5449_SchoolDisasterManagementPlanIndia.pdf 2nd Case Study: All India Disaster Mitigation Institute's Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign is supported by the American Jewish World Service. The first slide will describe the overview of their campaign, in the same way as in the first case study. The activities of the campaign should be described with the help of the second slide. Be sure to note that since 2007, AIDMI has extended its coverage and range of activities extensively, from 5 schools to over 300. In this case study, special focus has been placed on Disaster Risk Insurance. After explaining how the insurance works, read out the true story that has been provided, as an example of success. 3rd Case Study: The School Safety Programme is run by the National Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs of the Government of India. This Programme works on two operational fronts: District level and School Building level. The Activities detailed on slide 2 are those conducted within the district level programme. These resemble many of the methods that are used in the presentation's other examples, but they are organised within one programme on a larger scale. The detailed example of the Hazard Hunt and Evacuation Plans are for use on the School Building scale. The Hazard Hunt activity is a simple form of risk assessment within schools. It would be worthwhile to educate students on the concepts and practice of risk assessment within class before setting them the Hazard Hunt task. Members of staff, administrators, members of the local community and local emergency and support agencies have produced the Evacuation Plans in this example. However, it is possible to involve the students to a higher degree, by allowing them to design the displays and getting input from them on revisions of the plan. 4th Case Study: Disaster Management Activities in the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, under the Urban Earthquake Vulnerability Reduction Project (UEVRP) of the Government of India / UN Development Programme. Making Schools Safer 88 The project focuses on the disaster risk to schools in 'mega-cities'. Building the capacity of urban schools will make the local community more prepared against disasters such as earthquakes, which can cause the most damages in overcrowded cities. Activities were divided into those that were Centralised and Decentralised. The initial Centralised activities consisted of awareness raising, capacity building and training of teachers. This then allowed teachers to conduct the Decentralised activities in their own schools themselves, with little further outside help required. This gives each school a sense of ownership of the project in their area. The activities listed on the 2nd slide of this case study are the Decentralised activities. The case studies should consume all of the allotted time for this module. If, however, you find that you were able to cover the examples in good time and you find yourself with a spare 10 minutes, there is a short activity you can lead. End Activity \u2013 Strength Weakness Opportunities Threats (SWOT) analysis: Form the teachers into 4 groups and allocate one of the case studies to each of them.

Suggestions for Facilitators prior to Training 2. Facilitator Requirements during Training 3. Suggested Methods and Activities 4. Presentation Guidelines Making Schools Safer 100 4.1 Why Teach DRR in Schools?1 The Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-15 identifies core activities that can lead to resilient communities. It broadly identifies five priority actions that nations and organisations can pursue to support this resilience. While all five areas are important for school safety, the 3rd Priority for Action may be the most relevant and encourages users to make \"use of knowledge, innovation and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels\". Further, the Hyogo Framework encourages promotion and implementation \"of programmes and activities in schools for learning how to minimise the effects of hazards\". Schools can be effective venues for promoting disaster risk reduction for communities at large. As noted by the UN/ISDR, \"Schools are the best venues for forging durable collective values; therefore they are suitable for building a culture of prevention and disaster resilience.\" In many communities, schools also serve as centres for community events and social functions, and serve as gathering places or shelters during emergencies. They have great potential for being core institutions for community disaster risk reduction activities. A school safety campaign is important in promoting the second UN Millennium Development Goal of achieving universal primary education by the year 2015. Families simply will not risk sending their children to school if they do not see schools as safe places; without sufficient school safety measures, the goal of universal education cannot be achieved. When disaster strikes, children who are in school buildings - which are too often built without regard to structural codes or regulations in developing countries such as India - are particularly vulnerable. In disasters, children are among the most vulnerable groups. Children under the age of 15 account for nearly half of all victims of natural disasters. They are ill equipped to endure physical hardship and stress, they have immature immune systems, and they are in the critical stages of development. Schools are important institutions in any community, during emergencies and at normal times. At times of emergencies, they can be used as shelter before, during and after disaster, a good place to store emergency equipment, and a distribution centre for food, medical treatment, non- food items and other forms of aid and assistance. In normal times, they are a centre for education and awareness-raising and many social and organisational community activities take place there. 4.2 Scientific Knowledge2 Hands-on, experiential learning is the most effective way to educate. A disaster relevant curriculum would not only impart knowledge of the natural hazards themselves, but also would involve students in inspecting the school buildings, going outside to map the surroundings, and even interviewing elders about extreme natural events in the past. Such learning could be done in ways that reinforce basic skills in listening, writing, reporting and 1 From: UNISDR - Let Our Children Teach Us and From: AIDMI - southasiadiasters.net, Issue 49 2 From: UNISDR - Let Out Children Teach Us Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 101 mapping. It could be integrated into the study of history, geography and natural science. Age- appropriate math, from simple arithmetic to statistics, geometry and trigonometry, could be used. The real-life teaching and curricula varies greatly, and few approximate the ideal stated above. Some examples provide excellent training in earth and climate science, but do not focus on locally experienced hazards. In other cases, like generals who tend to re-fight the last war, education planners have focused exclusively on one recent disaster. Turkey, for example, within its all hazards school curriculum, has an impressive programme of earthquake-risk awareness that has reached perhaps five million students. On the tsunami-affected coast of Thailand, there are new curricula that focus exclusively on tsunami - even though the most common hazards in the region are coastal storms, floods and forest fire. Teaching about hazards is not enough to promote risk awareness or action on the part of children and youth. Academic earth and climate science is good, but should be taught as part of a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e83bf3a4-a918-4685-8971-db46eb1e5fd3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e83bf3a4-a918-4685-8971-db46eb1e5fd3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce34e951a6f269329b0032737245b5658b899ab64c8669560270d544cfc6369a"}}, "hash": "ce34e951a6f269329b0032737245b5658b899ab64c8669560270d544cfc6369a", "text": "comprehensive package with disaster prevention and preparedness. Where possible, some of the teaching should focus on locally-relevant hazards. 4.3 Strategies for Integration3 Begin with broad scientific disaster education \u2014 then continuously focus down in scale, increasing the detail of information. This should result in a journey from the worldwide context to practical ways of improving school and community building safety on the local level. Forge links with other local educational institutions on this subject. Higher education can offer many opportunities for knowledge sharing and useful research activities. Sharing successful practices internationally is also beneficial. Educational reforms that would add or blend in disaster-relevant teaching are difficult in systems with standardised examinations and a curriculum that \"teaches to the exam\". However, this example of India shows that it can be overcome: At the national level, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) of India has introduced disaster management into classes 8 and 9, and proposes to add it to the curriculum for class 10 in 2005/06. More than 1,000 teachers have already been trained in the use of this new curriculum throughout India. New texts supporting this initiative include: \u2022 Together, Towards a Safer India\u2026 An Introduction to Disaster Management for Class 8, CBSE, Delhi. \u2022 Together, Towards a Safer India Part II: Making a Difference, a text-book on disaster Management for Class 9, CBSE, Delhi. \u2022 Together, Towards a Safer India Part III: A Stride Ahead, a text-book on disaster Management for class 10, CBSE, Delhi. One of the most important issues when considering curriculum material is the appropriate language. Language, thought and action are very tightly coupled in very complex ways for human beings. Therefore, it is far better to use an indigenous language in many parts of the world, even though official language policy in schools may favour the lingua franca. If schools 3 From: UNISDR - Let Out Children Teach Us Making Schools Safer 102 are really going to be a focal point for diffusing risk reduction into the community, then material used in schools should also be accessible to parents and even grandparents. Also, to have vocabulary in an indigenous language for concepts of risk reduction is a very important step in increasing the community's ability to debate, study and plan. 4.4 Girls in School4 Historically, the education system in India has often treated girls as inferior to boys. This has created a significant gender gap in many areas of society. The gap is clearly visible in educational matters: more than two thirds of the world's 800 million illiterates are women. In India, according to the 2001 Census, nearly half of adult women are illiterate. In response to such needs the United Nations set achieving universal primary education as it's second Millennium Development Goal (MDG), and promoting gender equality and empowering women as MDG number three. This process has to start when girls are young. Often marginalised in the education system and confined to limited gender roles, rural women are one of the more vulnerable demographics in disaster situations. 4.4.1 Creating Effective Learning Environments for Girls The attendance of girls at school is poor, so ensuring a safe learning environment is essential for meeting the MDG and getting girls to school. One aspect is making schools safer against disasters. This can be in the form of structural measures, e.g. strength against earthquakes, cyclones, etc; layout sympathetic to evacuations and emergency situations; school area free from hazards. It can also be in the form of non-structural measures, e.g. preparedness plans, capacity building, awareness raising, disaster education, institutional frameworks to promote safety; crowd management (essential as overcrowded schools are a reality). Girls should be provided with a secure and attractive environment. This means that they should be able to trust their teachers and there should be systems in place to prevent and deal with abuse and bullying. Importantly, safe and adequate water and sanitation facilities for both sexes should be present. This has a substantial effect on the attractiveness of any school, and children will be unlikely to come to school if they are not comfortable and safe in this manner. Where appropriate, adequate boarding and meal services should be provided to ensure an attractive environment. 4.4.2 Empowering Girls and Women School-based DRR work should have a focus on girls, as it will empower them as disaster managers for the future, also allowing them to act in important roles. Many examples of ideas for good practice can be found, so some example methods are shown below: \u2022 Create girl-only disaster management clubs or teams. These teams will be responsible for hazard-spotting and developing solutions and safety", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3592c2cf-3f37-4e03-af0d-0510f925cf0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3592c2cf-3f37-4e03-af0d-0510f925cf0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc4987c1e65b4e5f4c832719405e3b0bd34b858d7b0443b5816c3893638c03cc"}}, "hash": "cc4987c1e65b4e5f4c832719405e3b0bd34b858d7b0443b5816c3893638c03cc", "text": "measures. Making them girl-only could give them a special sense of responsibility. 4 From: AIDMI - southasiadisasters.net, Issue 49 Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 103 \u2022 Similarly, the formation of Mothers' disaster planning groups could be encouraged. These women are likely to have strong connections with each other anyway, so their relationship could be used to good effect. \u2022 Schools are centres of learning and progress, but not just for children - literacy sessions for local women could be held out of school hours, and this would help to empower them. The involvement of the head girl and boy in development of plans disaster and evacuation plans (as well as other DRR methods) will give them legitimacy and the students will feel more in charge of their own safety. \u2022 In the appropriate classes, teachers should promote female self-worth, e.g. female role models, rights education. They should also strive for equality in essential skills development, e.g. swimming lessons and safety and science education. These skills can prove the difference between life and death in disaster situations. Equality in all aspects of curricula is just as important. \u2022 Provide DRR education that will also be relevant for the home and work environment. This means that local small-scale measures should be included, so that students can pass the messages onto their families, preparing them for hazards in day-to-day life. \u2022 Conduct a survey on male/female disaster knowledge - address differences in DRR education. \u2022 Girls can be at risk from attack and traffic on their journey to and from school. So, schools can arrange escorts for the girls' journeys. Mothers and community volunteers can be key to implementing this. \u2022 Set up mechanisms for reporting of abuse and help with psycho-social effects such abuse, as well as long-lasting psychological effects of disasters. 4.5 Targets for Curricula5 In centralised state education systems, curricula are developed that explicitly deal with locally relevant natural hazards and disaster risk reduction, complementing any existing academic treatment of environmental studies or earth science. In decentralised state education systems, curricula are developed \"from the bottom up\" by students, teachers and community members through the use of participatory community vulnerability and capacity assessment tools now widely available. In both kinds of systems, networks and training resources are made available through partnerships with NGOs and the private sector so that: a. teachers can be trained to use Community Risk Assessment (CRA) methods; b. schools and school jurisdictions can exchange and pool skills, experiences and resources; and c. some element of the \"bottom up\" generation of curriculum and pedagogy may also be incorporated into the \"top-down\" process in centralised systems. 5 From: UNISDR - Let Our Children Teach Us Making Schools Safer 104 4.6 Experimental Learning \u2013 The Child-to-Child Approach6 One of the most exciting pedagogical innovations is the \"child-to-child\" approach, which is a variation on the basic idea of experiential learning. The Child-to-Child Foundation, explains the method this way (in the context of health education): \"Child-to-Child ideas and activities represent an approach to health education. They do not constitute an alternative programme. It is more accurate and beneficial to view Child-to-Child activities as components that may be integrated with broader health education programmes that are either at the planning stage or already in operation. The distinguishing characteristics of Child-to-Child are the direct involvement of children in the process of health education and promotion and the nature of their involvement. The most effective programmes are those that involve children in decision-making rather than merely using them as communicators of adult messages. However, whenever children are involved as partners in this way, change is demanded in current structures and methodologies in health and education. \"Child-to-Child ideas and activities spread and take root in many different countries and contexts, for example, in national education programmes; in local programmes and individual schools; in training programmes for teachers and health workers; in youth movements and youth groups linked with schools and school children; in youth groups operating outside of the school system; when schools are linked with medical schools, health centres and health campaigns; when older children help pre-school children; and in programmes and activities designed to help children in especially difficult circumstances. Wherever Child-to Child activities take place, they stress the potential of children to promote better health: \u2022 To younger children. \u2022 To children of the same age. \u2022 In their families and communities.\u201d The same concepts are being applied to help children who have been affected by natural disasters. The child-to-child framework centres around a six-step approach to learning, used to elicit children's active participation in promoting health: 1.

Finding out more about the health issue. 3. Discussing what's been found out and planning action. 4. Taking action. 5. Evaluation: discussing results. 6. Discussing how we can be more effective next time and sustain action. The Child-to-Child Foundation explains the philosophy of the six steps as follows: \"We see children as agents of change, not megaphones to transmit adult messages\u2026 The six- step approach has an important effect on the way we teach and learn because: \u2022 It links what children do in class with what they do in the home. \u2022 It links what children learn with what they do. 6 From: UNISDR - Let Our Children Teach Us Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 105 \u2022 The activities are not taught in one lesson and then forgotten; they are learnt and developed over a longer period of time.\" 4.7 Connecting at Play7 Children respond to fun activities. These activities are more likely to be remembered and repeated by students within their homes and community. Children's clubs for DRR, environmental management, water monitoring, animal care, etc, are a great way of using children's potential and energy in an effective way for the benefit of the community. Creating such clubs in school and providing them with the means to make their community safer is an important step towards empowerment, especially if girls can be given key roles. Some countries have Disaster Museums that act as a fun and interesting learning resource for children. A similar idea is to encourage children to research a particular recent local or national disaster and get them to produce display boards to educate their fellow community members about it and the lessons to be learned. Internet resources are too a powerful tool. 4.8 Examples for Replication 4.8.1 \"Go\" Bags The \"Go Bag\" Scavenger Hunt activity developed by Risk RED is a short and fun activity that involves children and their families. By selecting which items they would pack in a bag to be prepared for a disaster, children and parents are encouraged to think critically about their needs in such a situation. Additional preparedness information is also provided to the families, so that they can take it home and act upon it. The materials required for the activity can be collected quite easily - the only additional material required is the Family Disaster Plan. 4.8.2 Riskland8 Riskland is a board game developed by UNISDR and UNICEF. One of the biggest factors in the success of this game is the element of fun involved. Many forms of entertainment that intend to educate children are often passive - something they listen to or watch. A board game such as this is an active learning experience, concerning decision-making, so they have fun while thinking about the disaster situations. The game is available in many languages already and UNISDR has set itself the task of spreading the game into as many languages as possible. Therefore, they are happy to respond to requests and suggestions to translate the materials into more languages, whether local or national. The game is also adaptable to local hazard conditions. 7 From: UNISDR - Let Our Children Teach Us 8 The website statement for both Riskland and Let's Learn to Prevent Disasters: \"UN/ISDR and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) have together produced an educational kit for children called \"Let's learn to prevent disasters!\". It includes the board game \"Riskland\" whereby players learn about what they can do to reduce disaster impacts by answering questions and advancing along the board's winding path. The kit and game may be adapted according to the different hazards communities face, and translated into multiple languages. To date, the kit is available in English, Haitian Creole, Maya Kackchiquel, Nepali, Portuguese and Spanish, with translations into over 15 others currently underway.\" Making Schools Safer 106 4.8.3 Let's Learn to Prevent Disasters9 To be found at the same web location as Riskland, is a document named \"Let's Learn to Prevent Disasters! Fun ways for kids to join in risk reduction\", which is a good accompaniment to the game. This is a booklet of materials on ways of getting children involved in DRR in the school and community. Suitable for children aged 8 to 12; the content of the booklet can be used to supplement other courses within the existing curriculum. The booklet includes: some scientific disaster education, environmental and natural resource management, disaster and risk concepts, and fun and practical ways for children to learn about and reduce the risk of disasters.

Many different hazards are also covered. Opening message of booklet: \"This booklet aims to provide the educational community and children with an innovative and interactive tool for risk management. Earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions and landslides all these are natural phenomena that have occurred throughout the history of humankind. However, rapid population growth, environmental pollution and degradation, and increased poverty, have all contributed to turning these natural phenomena into disasters that cause enormous losses in human lives, infrastructure, and material belongings. \"Every decade, disasters cause the death of a million people and leave several millions more homeless. Economic losses caused by natural disasters have tripled in the past 30 years. \"Working together continually as a community can help reduce the impact of disasters. Children play a very important role in doing this. How? \"By: \u2022 Carrying out school activities about this issue with the participation of the community. \u2022 Teaching their families and community about natural hazards and encouraging them to take preventive measures. \u2022 Helping to establish a real and long-lasting \"culture of prevention\", both through action and new attitudes. This means that when they become adults they will have a greater understanding of natural phenomena, the effects of human actions and the consequences of poor environmental management, as well as the need to promote a new kind of development in greater harmony with nature. \"This booklet is aimed at children between the ages of 8 and 12, as a supplement to materials already available in schools. Its contents can be used in the teaching of social studies, science and environmental studies, as well as in any other studies that relate to other human groups or countries. \"In order to make learning about disasters fun, we have included several activities, as well as an educational board game Riskland to help children learn as they play. 9 Ibid. Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 107 We hope this joint effort of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) will prove a useful and enjoyable contribution to the learning process.\" 4.8.4 Masters of Disaster The American Red Cross has developed an online series of learning materials, entitled \"Masters of Disaster\". Suitable for children of school entry age until the end of secondary school, the series aims to empower young people by providing with the ability to be prepared for disasters, thus reducing the risk. They aim to eliminate students' fear of natural disasters, directly addressing psycho-social issues. The materials are also available for download and come in the form of ready-made lesson plans. However, there are also materials for parents and families to use. This is key for spreading the knowledge into the home and wider community. There are different sets of resources for 3 different age groups - the difference manifests itself as though varying emphasis on games, activities, scientific knowledge, preparedness measures, etc. Website statement: \"The award-winning Masters of Disaster@ disaster preparedness curriculum teaches children how to prevent, prepare for and respond to disasters and other emergencies. We are pleased to announce its availability now in customised formats for both families and educators. \u2026 The Masters of Disaster\u00ae series is an educational tool that will teach youth the importance of preparedness while reducing fear of the unexpected. The goal is to empower youth with the confidence and knowledge to prepare for disasters and help create a culture of preparedness.

Immediately after a major earthquake damages buildings or a cyclone causes flooding, it can be days until food, water, and shelter from outside the area reaches those affected. People are often on their own for several days. The speed of later recovery depends on the ability that survivors have to organise themselves and to help each other. Drills and simulations are essential for training and practice. Handbooks, web-sites, manuals and specially-trained teams exist around the world. But just reading about these things and leaving them to others isn't enough. Drills often reach only a small population, perhaps one school or one building at a time. Until now. A new method is gaining popularity for mass public education for disaster preparation, while keeping it local. Just as Iran has pioneered national school earthquake drills, so too have cities and Japan and a whole region in California pioneered in community-wide earthquake drills. At 10am on 13 November 2008, Southern California rocked \u2014 to a pretend earthquake designed to get people to act for real. The Great Southern California ShakeOut was the largest earthquake drill in U.S. history. 5.5 million people participated, including almost 4 million students in kindergarten through grade 12. To make it seem as real as possible, a scientifically-developed practice scenario suggested that a magnitude 7.8 earthquake would rock the area for two minutes. Participants in the ShakeOut rang bells, shouted \"Earthquake\" and began by taking the 'earthquake position' Drop, Cover and Hold-on. Most participating schools followed with a full building evacuation and student accounting. Many enacted a full simulation, using the common incident command system to organise themselves. Schools' disaster management plans were put into practice to see where the weak spots lay. Meanwhile, international researchers from four continents looked on, seeking lessons to share with colleagues around the world. The ShakeOut was organised by Earthquake Country Alliance (ECA). The international school safety observation team was assembled by Risk RED (Risk Reduction Education for Disasters) in cooperation with Western Washington University's Institute for Global and Community Resilience and the international Coalition for Global School Safety and Disaster Prevention Education. Support came from ECA and ProVention Consortium. The team provided a School Disaster Resilience and Readiness Checklist along with School Drill Model and Templates including Self-evaluation forms based on good practices by Los Angeles Unified School Districts and other school districts around California. A School Disaster Preparedness Survey and School Post-Drill Evaluation Survey were implemented to aggregate self-evaluation observations by participating schools. These resources and the full report on School Disaster Readiness: Lessons from the first Great Southern California ShakeOut can be found at: http://www.shakeout.org/schools . Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 109 With 75 years of public policy leadership to support school safety, new school construction standards in California are higher than those for regular buildings. Non-structural mitigation measures, such as fastening heavy furniture and appliances to the walls and floors, began twenty years ago and are now mandatory. While this progress is reassuring and laudable, four areas of concern remain: \u2022 Private schools are not required to meet these construction standards. \u2022 7,537 school buildings in California constructed before 1978 are of questionable safety. \u2022 Portable classrooms, which may account for 1/3 of all classrooms in California, may be hazardous if not properly supported and fastened. \u2022 Non-structural mitigation measures require consistent application to be effective. The surveys, observations, and post-drill debriefings showed the ShakeOut to be a major success. The international research team reported on the impressive seriousness and conscientiousness with which school leadership, staff, and students approached the drill. They also highlighted the tremendous learning that comes from long-term engagement in drills and the discoveries and innovative solutions that emerge from reflection and action after each drill. It was encouraging to see the wide extent of knowledge and skills for safety \u2013 yet everyone recognised that there's still a long way to go. Almost all school staff members were aware that they are mandated disaster service workers and almost all have disaster committees and disaster plans. Yet less than one-third involve parents and less than one-fifth involve students and other community members. Schools notify parents about disaster drills, but most don't encourage staff or students to prepare at home, forfeiting this powerful learning opportunity and failing to transfer knowledge from children to their parents. Similarly, schools have fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, clearly marked evacuation routes, and first aid supplies, but many lack emergency water and food supplies, emergency lighting and shelter and supplies for children with special needs. Many school staff have first aid training, know how to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "290a83d2-dd45-48b6-a706-1c62478a4009": {"__data__": {"id_": "290a83d2-dd45-48b6-a706-1c62478a4009", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "14f77084d5fec503584d065f7b52293f045d6301764490fb7e09bec0494bb32f"}}, "hash": "14f77084d5fec503584d065f7b52293f045d6301764490fb7e09bec0494bb32f", "text": "turn off utilities, can use a fire extinguisher, and are familiar with student release procedures.

The ShakeOut turned theory into practice, showing how local solutions to disasters can be scaled up to teach and learn from the mass public. The event was so successful that it is now to become an annual event in California. The next one is scheduled for October 15, 2009. Get involved!

Marla Petal and Ilan Kelman Risk RED http://www.riskred.org Making Schools Safer 110 Annex 1: Article on Women, Education, and Disaster Educating Girl Child: A Step Towards MDG N irupa is one of five female teachers at the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) girls' boarding school in Kanhauli, Bihar, one of the Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign's supported schools. Inspired by Mother Teresa, 24-year-old Nirupa felt a duty to do something positive for her mother country. Two years ago she joined this government-funded school, which educates and cares for girls 10 to 14 years of age from rural, low-caste and low-income families in Bihar. If not for this school and passionate teachers like Nirupa, these girls would never have received the opportunity to get an education. Historically, the education system has often treated girls as inferior to boys. This has created a significant gender gap in many areas of society. The gap is clearly visible in educational matters: more than two thirds of the world's 800 million illiterates are women. In India, according to the 2001 Census, nearly half of adult women are illiterate.* In response to such needs the United Nations set achieving universal primary education as it's second Millennium Development Goal (MDG), and promoting gender equality and empowering women as MDG number three. This process has to start when girls are young. Women in Disasters Often marginalised in the education system and confined to limited gender roles, rural women are one of the more vulnerable demographics in disaster situations. The Child's Right to Safer Schools Campaign supports KGBV to promote the second MDG by ensuring that young girls have a safe place to learn, and to promote the third MDG by empowering girls to be agents of disaster management and risk reduction. It is important that any school-based DRR campaign give attention to this vulnerable demographic. Getting the Girls to School The teachers' work at the school is demanding and difficult. They have visited numerous villages searching for parents willing to let their girls get an education, and convincing parents of the importance of their daughters' education has at times proven challenging. In communities where it is customary for females to be married early\u2014sometimes when they are as young as 14 years old\u2014and to then stay home and serve as housewives, promoting education for girls can be a difficult break from traditional values. Furthermore, sending a girl to school means losing a valuable member of the household who would normally contribute to tasks such as work in the fields, care of younger siblings and preparation of meals. But teachers have also experienced the opposite scenario, in which parents have been grateful for the chance to see their daughters get educated\u2014an opportunity they may not have had for themselves. With Limited Resources The school's 50 girls are lodged in a hostel and provided with teaching material and food. Space is limited\u2014at night the two classrooms become dormitories, with two girls to a bed. Two cooks prepare their meals, striving to provide a balanced diet with vegetarian options. Each year during the monsoon, their courtyard, where they take their meals, becomes a pool of water. Empowering Young Women In addition to a traditional curriculum of Hindi, English, Maths and Science, the teachers emphasise awareness of female gender issues, including their rights and duties. This is expressed through instruction as well as various art forms such as songs. Rooms at the school are named for famous Indian women leaders, giving the girls female role models. The school also teaches vocational skills such as stitching and knitting that the girls would have learned had they stayed home rather than attending school. Aiming for a Brighter Future This girls' school is one of over 2000 KGBV schools sanctioned and funded by the Government of India. Its prime objective is to provide under-privileged and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ffcca9b4-c678-4f66-a377-78e5c5cd1fb2": {"__data__": {"id_": "ffcca9b4-c678-4f66-a377-78e5c5cd1fb2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9119c515a1aadd5809b7fe86c469277699e5e5615e72d06119e0e841d6f9cc1"}, "3": {"node_id": "f6a97cbf-9580-4433-a96c-a791bf13e8e5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a289a09b2c728d11a8f7636b286ecbf4ee115cc43f6d9b20a0753c6653151aa"}}, "hash": "034d781a2ed265b89af69ba5571ea276db2d1fd59a878d410012c6bd4d71d596", "text": "vulnerable girls with an education.

Cordon off an area, or set aside a small room of approximately 100-150 square feet or 10-13 square meters for this activity. 2. Spread ALL of the above materials out (except for the backpacks, handouts and sweets) randomly all over the contained activity area. 3. Gather 10-12 children together for this 15 minute activity. Parents are encouraged to stand around and enjoy watching the activity. 4. Ask the children to form 4 groups of 2 or 3. Ask them what kinds of hazards they face in their community and, in case of emergency, to think about what would they need with have with them? Explain that each group will have an empty backpack. They are to work in their team and they have 5 minutes to select 10 items to put in their \"Emergency Go-Bag\". This is not a competition. They just have to work as a team, think carefully, and put their selections in the bag. Hand them their bags and give them the signal to begin. 5. After 4 minutes announce to the children that they have 1 minute left. 6. After one more minute ask the children to come forward, outside of the activity area. Gather the children around, sitting down on the ground if possible. Ask each group to pass you their bag in turn. Remove each item one by one, asking the children why they included each particular item. Repeat and recognise all of their good choices and reasons. If there are items that don't belong (eg. baby clothes, but no little baby sister or brother, fresh food, too large toys) discuss these too. 7.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6a97cbf-9580-4433-a96c-a791bf13e8e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6a97cbf-9580-4433-a96c-a791bf13e8e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9119c515a1aadd5809b7fe86c469277699e5e5615e72d06119e0e841d6f9cc1"}, "2": {"node_id": "ffcca9b4-c678-4f66-a377-78e5c5cd1fb2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "034d781a2ed265b89af69ba5571ea276db2d1fd59a878d410012c6bd4d71d596"}}, "hash": "3a289a09b2c728d11a8f7636b286ecbf4ee115cc43f6d9b20a0753c6653151aa", "text": "7.

Disaster can strike quickly and without warning. It can force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services, such as water, gas, electricity, or telephones, were cut off? Local officials and relief workers will be on the scene after a disaster, but they cannot reach everyone right away. You and the other members of your household could be separated during a disaster. Having a plan will help you find each other. Families can and do cope with disaster by preparing in advance and working together as a team. Knowing what to do is your best protection and your responsibility. Learn more about Family Disaster Plans by contacting your local emergency management office or local American Red Cross chapter. What is a Family Disaster Plan? A Family Disaster Plan is a personalised action plan that lets each member of a household know what to do in particular disaster situations and how to be prepared in advance. A functional Family Disaster Plan helps alleviate fears about potential disasters, makes actual disaster situations less stressful, and saves precious time in the face of disasters. Watch, Warning \u2022 A National Weather Service (NWS) WATCH is a message indicating that conditions favor the occurrence of a certain type of hazardous weather. For example, a severe thunderstorm watch means that a severe thunderstorm is expected in the next six hours or so within an area approximately 120 to 150 miles (193 to 241 kilometers) wide and 300 to 400 miles (483 to 644 kilometers) long. The NWS Storm Prediction Center issues such watches. Local NWS forecast offices issue other watches (flash flood, winter weather, etc.) 12 to 36 hours in advance of a possible hazardous-weather or flooding event. Each local forecast office usually covers a state or a portion of a state. \u2022 An NWS WARNING indicates that a hazardous event is occurring or is imminent in about 30 minutes to an hour. Local NWS forecast offices issue warnings on a county-by-county basis. What to Tell Children Parents and caregivers should: \u2022 Tell children that a disaster is something that happens that could hurt people, cause damage, or cut off utilities, such as water, telephones, or electricity. Explain to them that nature sometimes provides \"too much of a good thing\"- fire, rain, wind, snow. Talk about typical effects that children can relate to, such as loss of electricity, water, and telephone service. * Source: American Red Cross, 2007, March. Excerpt: Talking about Disaster: Guide for Standing Messages. Making Schools Safer 114 \u2022 Give examples of several disasters that could happen in your community. Help children recognise the warning signs for each. Discussing disaster ahead of time reduces fear and anxiety and lets everyone know how to respond. \u2022 Be prepared to answer children's questions about scary things that they have heard about or seen on television, such as terrorist attacks. Give constructive information about how to be prepared to protect themselves and how to respond. \u2022 Teach children how and when to call for help. Teach them to call 9-1-1 or your local emergency telephone number. At home, post emergency numbers by all telephones and explain when to call each number. Include the work numbers and cell phone numbers of household members. Even very young children can be taught how and when to call for emergency assistance. If a child cannot read, make an emergency telephone number chart with pictures or icons for 911, \"daddy,\" and \"mommy\" that may help the child identify the correct number to call. \u2022 Tell children that in a disaster there are many people who can help them. Talk about ways that an emergency manager, American Red Cross worker, police officer, firefighter, teacher, neighbor, doctor, or utility worker might help after a disaster. \u2022 Teach children to call your out-of-town contact in case they are separated from the family and cannot reach family members in an emergency. Tell them, \"If no one answers, leave a voice message if possible and then call the alternative contact.\" Help them memorise the telephone numbers, and write them down on a card that they can keep with them. \u2022 Quiz children every six months so they will remember where to meet, what telephone numbers to call, and safety rules. \u2022 Explain that when people know what to do and practice in advance,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3c2ce41-1ae1-47b0-9a04-386c1a559d1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3c2ce41-1ae1-47b0-9a04-386c1a559d1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "338358b974ac15a3363fc6cc55de224281df76a9ff3ae25dfecffc9dd9c72d45"}}, "hash": "338358b974ac15a3363fc6cc55de224281df76a9ff3ae25dfecffc9dd9c72d45", "text": "everyone is able to take care of themselves better in emergencies. Tell them that is why you need to create a Family Disaster Plan. \u2022 Allay children's fears by emphasising that, in an emergency, a parent or caregiver will be there to help. ACTION MESSAGES Be Prepared for Disasters Make a Plan Core Action Messages: \u2022 Find out what could happen. \u2022 Create a Family Disaster Plan. \u2022 Make and complete a checklist. \u2022 Practice and maintain your plan. For general preparedness, every household should create and practice a Family Disaster Plan and assemble and maintain a Disaster Supplies Kit. In addition, every household should take Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 115 precautions specific to the types of disasters that could affect the local community and plan for and practice what to do if these disasters occur. Find out what could happen to you. By learning what disasters could occur in your community and what your risks may be (for example, living in a floodplain), you can prepare for the disasters most likely to occur in your area. Learn more by contacting your local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter. Be prepared to take notes. Ask the following: \u2022 What types of natural disasters are most likely to happen in your community? What types of human-caused or technological disasters could affect your region? Ask about chemical emergencies, which can occur anywhere chemical substances are stored, manufactured, or transported. \u2022 Find out if your home is in a floodplain. Check with your local emergency management agency. \u2022 How should you prepare for natural and human-caused disasters? \u2022 What can you do to protect your home and avoid or reduce the impact of the disasters that could occur where you live? \u2022 Does your community have a public warning system? How will your local radio and television stations alert the community if there is an emergency? What do your community's warning signals sound like and what should you do when you are notified? \u2022 If you care for young or elderly people or people with disabilities, how can you help them in a disaster situation? What might be some special needs to consider? \u2022 What about animal care after a disaster? Pets (other than service animals) usually are not permitted in public shelters or other places where food is served. Where could you take your pets if you had to go to a public shelter? Contact your local emergency management agency to find out about emergency animal shelters in your community, in the event that you have nowhere else to go and need to go to public shelter with your animals. Then, find out about the disaster plans at your workplace, your children's school or day care center, and other places where members of your family spend time. You should be prepared wherever you may be in case disaster strikes and learn steps you can take to prevent or avoid disasters. Create a Family Disaster Plan Note: You can adapt the Family Disaster Plan to any household-couples, related or unrelated individuals, adults without children, adults with children. Even people who live alone should create a Family (Household) Disaster Plan. Once you know what disasters are possible in your area, have a household meeting to talk about how to prepare and how to respond if a disaster should occur. Plan to share responsibilities and to work together as a team. Know what to do in case household members are separated in a disaster. Disaster situations are stressful and can create confusion. Keep it simple. Making Schools Safer 116 \u2022 Pick two places to meet: 1. Right outside your home in case of a sudden emergency, like a fire. 2. Outside your neighborhood in case you cannot return home or are asked to leave your neighborhood. Pick two out-of-town contacts: 1. A friend or relative who will be your household's primary contact. 2. A friend or relative who will be your household's alternative contact. Both adults and children should know the primary and alternative contacts' names, addresses, and home and cell telephone numbers, or carry the information with them. In addition, include these contact numbers on your pet's identification tags, or use a national pet locator service that someone could call to report finding your pet. Separation is particularly likely during the day when adults are at work and children are at school. If household members are separated from one another in a disaster, they should call the primary contact. If the primary contact cannot be reached, they should call the alternative contact.

Make sure that adults and children know how to tell the contact where they are, how to reach them, and what happened or to leave this essential information in a brief voice mail. \u2022 Discuss what to do if a family member is injured or ill. \u2022 Discuss what to do in the rare circumstance that authorities advise you to shelter-in-place. (See \"How to Shelter-in-Place\") Discuss what to do if authorities advise you to evacuate. Learn about public shelter locations in your community. Make \"in-case-of-evacuation\" arrangements for a place to stay with a friend or relative who lives out of town or with a hotel, motel, or campground you are familiar with that can be reached by an evacuation route you would expect to take. \u2022 Be familiar with evacuation routes. Plan several evacuation routes in case certain roads are blocked or closed. Remember to follow the advice of local officials during evacuation situations. They will direct you to the safest route; some roads may be blocked or put you in further danger. \u2022 Plan how to take care of your pets. Pets (other than service animals) usually are not permitted in public shelters or other places where food is served. Plan where you would take your pets if you had to go to a public shelter where they are not permitted. Many communities are developing emergency animal shelters similar to shelters for people. Contact your local emergency management agency to find out about emergency animal shelters in your community, in the event that you have nowhere else to go and need to go to public shelter with your animals. \u2022 Make and complete a checklist. Include the following: \u2013 Post emergency numbers (fire, police, ambulance, etc.) by telephones. You may not have time in an emergency to look up critical numbers. Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 117 \u2013 Teach all responsible members of the household how and when to turn off the water, gas, and electricity at the main switches or valves. Turn off utilities only if you suspect a leak or damaged lines, or if you are instructed to do so by authorities. If you turn the gas off, you will need a professional to turn it back on. Become familiar with the location and operation of shut-off valves. Do not actually turn any valve unless it is a real emergency. Place a tag on shut-off valves to make them easier to identify. \u2013 Attach a shut-off valve wrench or other special tool in a conspicuous place close to the gas and water shut-off valves. \u2013 Check if you have adequate insurance coverage. Homeowners' insurance does not cover flood losses. Ask your insurance agent to review your current policies to ensure that they will cover your home and belongings adequately. If you are a renter, your landlord's insurance does not protect your personal property; it protects only the building. Renters' insurance pays if a renter's property is damaged or stolen. Renters' flood insurance costs less than $15 a month in most areas of the country. Contact your insurance agent for more information. \u2013 If you are especially vulnerable to floods, consider relocating. \u2022 Be sure to have working smoke alarms and carbon monoxide (CO) alarms in your home. \u2013 According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), in 1999-2001, an average of 70% of home fire deaths resulted from fires in homes with either no smoke alarms or in which none of the smoke alarms sounded. \u2013 If every home had working smoke alarms, U.S. home fire deaths would decrease by an estimated 36%, resulting in an estimated 1,120 lives saved per year, based on 1999-2001 averages, NFPA says. \u2013 For new homes, interconnected smoke alarms are required on every level of the home, outside each sleeping area, and inside each bedroom. Although this approach is ideal for all homes, as a minimum, existing homes should have smoke alarms on every level and outside each sleeping area. Install CO alarms following the manufacturer's instructions. It is especially important to have a CO alarm near sleeping areas. Use only \u2022 CO alarms with labels showing they meet the requirements of the latest safety standards for CO alarms (UL 2034, IAS 6-96, or CSA 6.19.01). Test and maintain the smoke and CO alarms according to the manufacturer's instructions. (See Smoke Alarms and Carbon Monoxide Alarms.) \u2022 Consider equipping your home with alternative heating sources, such as fireplaces, wood- or coal-burning stoves, or space heaters. Be sure all heating sources are installed according to local codes and permit requirements", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48161bcb-fbec-4217-bd30-b0b6c299de5e": {"__data__": {"id_": "48161bcb-fbec-4217-bd30-b0b6c299de5e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c245a5ed5512d4152522956a8b044396f41a7cd8b9a4cce7cf23a4a20637f37"}}, "hash": "1c245a5ed5512d4152522956a8b044396f41a7cd8b9a4cce7cf23a4a20637f37", "text": "and are clean and in working order. (See \"Smoke Alarms\" and \"Carbon Monoxide Alarms\") \u2022 Get training from the fire department in how to use your fire extinguisher (A-B-C type), and show household members where extinguishers are kept. Different extinguishers operate in different ways. Make sure that responsible members of the household know how to use your particular model. There is no time to read directions during an emergency. Only adults should handle and use extinguishers. (See \"Fire Extinguishers\") Making Schools Safer 118 \u2013 Conduct a home hazard hunt. During a disaster, ordinary objects in your home can cause injury or damage. Anything that can move, fall, break, or cause a fire is a home hazard. For example, during an earthquake or a tornado, a hot water heater or a bookshelf could turn over or pictures hanging over a couch could fall and hurt someone. Look for electrical, chemical, and fire hazards. Contact your local fire department to learn about home fire hazards. Inspect your home at least once a year and fix potential hazards. In your hazard hunt, include your barns, outbuildings, or any other structures that house animals. Be aware of hazards at nose and paw or hoof level, particularly debris, spilled chemicals, fertilisers, and other substances that may not seem to be dangerous to humans. Make sure your fences are sound and positioned to allow grazing animals to move to high ground in the event of flooding. \u2013 Consider your need to add physical protection measures to your home. Add a \"wind safe\" room (see \"Wind Safe Room\") and tie your roof to the main frame of your house securely with metal straps for protection in case of hurricanes or tornadoes; bolt your house to the foundation to reduce earthquake damage; or take other measures you may find on www.fema.gov (click on Preparation and Prevention). Ensure that access and evacuation are manageable for elderly members of your household or those with disabilities. \u2013 Assemble a Disaster Supplies Kit and stock emergency supplies. Keep readily accessible in a portable container supplies that would meet your needs for at least three days. You can use these if you shelter at home or if you evacuate. Also, stock enough food and water for up to two weeks in your home. Keep an emergency kit in your vehicle. (See \"Disaster Supplies Kit\", Stocking and Storing Food and Water\", and \"Emergency Supplies for Your Vehicle\") \u2013 Keep a portable, battery-operated radio or television and extra batteries in your Disaster Supplies Kit. Maintaining a communication link with the outside is a step that can mean the difference between life and death. Make sure that everyone knows where the portable, battery-operated radio or television is located, and always keep a supply of extra, fresh batteries. \u2013 Consider buying a NOAA Weather Radio with a tone-alert feature. NOAA Weather Radio is the best way to receive warnings from the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service recommends a NOAA Weather Radio that has both a battery backup and a Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME) feature, which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued for your county. \u2013 Take an American Red Cross first aid and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) class and have other household members take one too. You will learn basic safety measures and skills that can be indispensable in an emergency. These classes can be fun for older children. \u2022 Plan home escape routes. Determine the best escape routes from inside your home in case a fire or other emergency requires you to leave the house quickly. Find two ways out of each room. \u2013 Find the safe places in your home for shelter during different types of disaster. Certain disasters require specific types of safe places. While basements are appropriate Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 119 for tornadoes, they could be deadly in a hazardous materials emergency. In this guide, safe places recommended for a particular type of disaster are discussed in the chapter covering that disaster. \u2013 Make a complete inventory of your home, garage, and surrounding property. The inventory can be written or videotaped. Include information such as serial numbers, make and model numbers, physical descriptions, and what you paid (receipts, if possible). This inventory could help you prove the value of what you owned if your possessions are damaged or destroyed and can help you claim deductions on taxes. Do this for all items in your home, on all levels. \u2013 Keep the originals of important documents in a safe deposit box, if possible, and make two copies of each document.

Practicing your plan will help you respond appropriately and quickly during an actual emergency. To make sure your household is ready for disaster: \u2013 Review your Family Disaster Plan and your Disaster Supplies Kit at least every six months. You may need to update them. \u2013 Observe the expiration or \"use by\" date on stored food and water. If you have prepared you own containers of water, replace them every six months to ensure freshness. \u2013 Conduct fire and emergency evacuation drills at least twice a year. - At home, practice escaping from various rooms, particularly bedrooms, and meeting at the place you have selected right outside your home. - Have each driver actually drive evacuation routes so each will know the way. Select alternative routes and familiarise drivers with them in case the main evacuation route is blocked during an actual disaster. - Mark your evacuation routes on a map and keep the map in your Disaster Supplies Kit. Remember to follow the advice of disaster officials during an evacuation. They will direct you to the safest route, away from roads that may be blocked or put you in further danger. \u2022 Include your pets in your evacuation and sheltering drills. Practice evacuating your pets so they will get used to entering and traveling calmly in their carriers. If you have horses or other large animals, be sure that they are accustomed to entering a trailer. Practice bringing Making Schools Safer 120 your pets indoors, into your safe room, so that if you are required to shelter-in-place, they will be comfortable. \u2022 Use the test button to test your smoke alarms once a month. The test feature tests all electronic functions and is safer than testing with a controlled fire (match, lighter, or cigarette). If necessary, replace batteries immediately. Vacuum cobwebs and dust from the mechanisms once a month. Make sure your children know what your smoke alarm sounds like. \u2022 Replace batteries at least once a year in battery-powered smoke alarms. (Replace the batteries in your CO alarms at the same time you replace your smoke alarm batteries.) You may have heard it recommended that you replace batteries when the time changes from standard to daylight savings time each spring and then back again in the fall: \"Change your clock, change your batteries.\" Replacing batteries this often certainly will not hurt; however National Fire Protection Association and U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission data show that fresh batteries will last at least a year, so more frequent replacement is not necessary unless the smoke alarm begins to chirp. Also, Arizona, Hawaii, the eastern portion of Indiana, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and Guam do not use daylight savings time. Pick an easy-to-remember anniversary, such as your birthday or a national holiday, as the day to change the batteries each year. \u2022 Replace your smoke alarms every 10 years. That is the recommendation of the National Fire Protection Association and the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Smoke alarms become less sensitive over time. \u2022 Look at your fire extinguisher to ensure that it is properly charged. Fire extinguishers will not work properly if they are not properly charged. Use the gauge or test button to check that there is proper pressure. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for replacing or recharging fire extinguishers. If the unit is low on pressure, damaged, or corroded, replace it or have it professionally serviced. For People With Disabilities Core Action Message: \u2022 If you or anyone in your household has a disability or a mobility problem, make special plans. Note: If a member of your household has a disability or a mobility problem, such as some elderly persons do, or if you are planning to assist someone else who does, you should review the following steps.

If you think you may need assistance in a disaster, discuss your disability with relatives, friends, or co- workers and ask for their help. For example, if you need help moving or help getting necessary prescriptions, food, or other essentials, or if you require special arrangements to receive emergency messages, make a plan with friends or helpers. Make sure they know where you keep your Disaster Supplies Kit. Give a key to a neighbor or friend who may be able to assist you in a disaster. Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 121 \u2022 Maintain a list of important items and store the list with your Disaster Supplies Kit. Give a copy to another member of your household and a friend or neighbor. Important items might include: \u2013 Special equipment and supplies, for example, hearing aid batteries. -Current prescription names, sources, and dosages. \u2013 Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of doctors and pharmacists. If you get prescriptions by mail, confirm where you will be able to get them locally in an emergency. \u2013 Detailed information about the specifications of your medication or medical regimen, including a list of things incompatible with medication you use, for example, aspirin. \u2022 Contact your local emergency management office now. Many local emergency management offices maintain registers of people with disabilities and their needs so they can be located and assisted quickly in a disaster. \u2022 Wear medical alert tags or bracelets to identify your disability in case of an emergency. These may save your life if you are in need of medical attention and unable to communicate. \u2022 Know the location and availability of more than one facility if you are dependent on a dialysis machine or other life-sustaining equipment or treatment. There may be other people requiring equipment, or facilities may have been affected by the disaster. \u2022 If you have a severe speech, language, or hearing disability: \u2013 When you dial 9-1-1 (or your local emergency number), tap the space bar to indicate a TDD call. \u2013 Store a writing pad and pencils to communicate with others. \u2013 Keep a flashlight handy to signal your whereabouts to other people and for illumination to aid in communication. \u2013 Remind friends that you cannot completely hear warnings or emergency instructions. Ask them to be your source of emergency information as it comes over the radio. Another option is to use a NOAA Weather Radio with an alert feature connected to a light. If a watch or warning is issued for your area, the light would alert you to potential danger. \u2013 If you have a hearing ear dog, be aware that the dog may become confused or disoriented in an emergency. Store extra food, water, and supplies for your dog. Trained hearing ear dogs will be allowed to stay in emergency shelters with their owners. Check with local emergency management or American Red Cross officials for more information. \u2022 If you have a service animal: \u2013 Be aware that the animal may become confused or disoriented in an emergency. Disasters may often mask or confuse scent markers that are part of your service animal's normal means of navigation. Making Schools Safer 122 \u2013 If you are blind or visually impaired, keep extra canes placed around your home and office, even if you use a guide dog. \u2013 If you have a guide dog, train the dog to know one or two alternate routes out of your home or office. A guide dog familiar with the building may help you and others find a way out when no one else can see. \u2013 Be sure your service animal has identification and your phone numbers attached to its collar, including emergency contact information through a national pet locator service. \u2013 Have a complete pet disaster kit with food and water, medical records and identification, bowls, extra leash, a favorite toy, and a pet first aid kit.

People with disabilities have the same choices as other community residents about whether to evacuate their homes and where to go when an emergency threatens. Decide whether it is better to leave the area, stay with a friend, or go to a public shelter. Each of these decisions requires planning and preparation. Plan for Your Pets Core Action Message: \u2022 Know in advance how to care for your pets in a disaster situation. If you have pets, you should: \u2022 Take your pets with you if you evacuate. If it is not safe for you, it is not safe for them. Leaving them may endanger you, your pets, and emergency responders. \u2022 Plan in advance where you will go if you evacuate, as pets (other than service animals) are usually not allowed in public shelters. Some communities have established sheltering options for pets. Contact your local emergency management agency to see if there are any emergency animal shelters in your community or along your evacuation route. \u2022 Contact hotels and motels outside your immediate area to check their policies on accepting pets and restrictions on the number, size, and species. Ask if \"no pet\" policies could be waived in an emergency. Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 123 \u2022 Ask friends, relatives, or others outside your area if they could shelter your animals. If you have two or more pets, they may be more comfortable if kept together, but be prepared to house them separately. \u2022 Prepare a list of boarding facilities and veterinarians who could shelter animals in an emergency; include 24-hour telephone numbers. Ask local animal shelters if they provide emergency shelter or foster care for pets in a disaster situation. Animal shelters may be overburdened, so this should be your last resort unless you make such arrangements well in advance. \u2022 Keep a list of \"pet friendly\" places, including their telephone numbers, with other disaster information and supplies. If you have notice of an impending disaster, call ahead for reservations. Hotels and motels with \"no-pet\" policies may waive these policies during a disaster, particularly if the pet is housed in a carrier. Contact establishments along your evacuation route to see if they will waive \"no-pet\" rules, and make sure you have adequate facilities and supplies for your pets. \u2022 Carry pets in a sturdy carrier. Animals may feel threatened by some disasters, become frightened, and try to run. Being in its own carrier helps reassure a pet. \u2022 Have identification, collar, leash, and proof of vaccinations for all pets. At some locations, you may need to provide veterinary records before boarding your pets. If your pet is lost, identification will help officials return it to you. \u2022 Assemble a portable pet disaster supplies kit. Keep food, water, and any special pet needs in an easy-to-carry container. \u2022 Have a current photo of your pets in case they get lost. \u2022 Create a plan in case you are not at home during an emergency to ensure that someone takes care of your pets, even evacuating them if necessary. The plan should include these elements: \u2013 Give a trusted neighbor the key to your home and instructions, as well as your daytime (work or school) contact information. \u2013 Make sure the neighbor is familiar with your pets and knows the location of your pet emergency kit. \u2013 Make sure the neighbor listens to a local radio or television station for emergency information and puts your shelter-in-place or pet evacuation plan into action. \u2013 Have a plan to communicate with your neighbor after the event. You will want to arrange a meeting place in a safe area so you can be reunited with your pets. \u2022 Contact your local emergency management agency, humane society, and animal control agency to see if your community has sheltering options for animals and for families with pets. If not, learn more about emergency animal shelters and volunteer to include this option in local disaster preparedness efforts. \u2022 Learn pet first aid and keep your pet first aid kit up to date. Making Schools Safer 124 Media and Community Preparedness Ideas \u2022 Work with local print, radio, and television reporters to: \u2013 Get the word out about how to make a Family Disaster Plan and how important it is for each household to have one and to keep it up", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c08e01c4-055e-42c2-93c4-619835986447": {"__data__": {"id_": "c08e01c4-055e-42c2-93c4-619835986447", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "37162c5a5f3af6092f3e396c9768071f0c7588284a1511b5d3b0c2c4e616a90d"}}, "hash": "37162c5a5f3af6092f3e396c9768071f0c7588284a1511b5d3b0c2c4e616a90d", "text": "to date. \u2013 Publicise information from local emergency services and American Red Cross officials on how people with mobility impairments or disabilities should plan for a disaster. \u2022 Help the reporters to localise the information by providing them with the local emergency telephone number for the fire, police, and emergency medical services departments (usually 9-1-1) and emergency numbers for the local utilities and hospitals. Also provide the business telephone numbers for the local emergency management office and local American Red Cross chapter. \u2022 Work with officials of the local fire, police, and emergency medical services departments; utilities; hospitals; emergency management office; and American Red Cross chapter to prepare and disseminate guidelines for people with mobility impairments about what to do if they have to evacuate. \u2022 Within neighborhood organisations, such as homeowners associations or crime watch groups, introduce disaster preparedness activities that help people think about how they can prepare for a disaster, stay safe during a disaster, and help each other should a disaster occur. For example: \u2013 Encourage neighborhood residents to prepare Family Disaster Plans and keep them up to date. \u2013 Encourage neighborhood residents to create Disaster Supplies Kits and keep them up to date. \u2013 Encourage neighborhood residents to plan how they could work together after a disaster until help arrives. Have them also consider ways they can cooperate with each other during recovery. Working with neighbors can save lives and property. \u2013 Check with your local fire department or emergency management training is offered for interested residents. \u2013 Create a neighborhood map with names and home and cell phone numbers next to each address so neighbors can contact each other in an emergency. -Encourage people to find out their neighbors' special skills (for example, medical, technical) and consider how they could help in a disaster situation. -Identify elderly and disabled people in the neighborhood, single parents with young children, or others who might need help. Determine how neighbors can help them if a disaster threatens (transportation, securing the home, getting medications, etc.). \u2013 Encourage parents to make plans with neighbors for child care in case parents cannot get home in an emergency situation. Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 125 Annex 4: Riskland Board Game Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 127 Annex 5: School Disaster Reduction and Readiness Checklist* ACTION STEPS 1. Convene local school safety committee representing administration, faculty, staff, students and parents, and local community. 2. Study the school safety planning and action steps below together. 3. As needed assign sub groups or individuals to be responsible for investigating and making recommendations for each task. 4. Create plan based on task group recommendations. 5. Implement the plan, involving the whole school community, setting milestones and taking action steps to achieve risk reduction and response preparedness. 6. Communicate and coordinate as needed with education authorities using the resources and support available, and advising them of resource and support needs. 7. Review and revise the plan as necessary, at least annually. 8. Be sure to keep all staff, parents/guardians, and students advised about the plan. Assessment and Planning \u2022 An ongoing school safety committee has been established to lead disaster risk reduction and disaster response planning in our school. We hold regular meetings (including staff, parents/guardians, students and local community leaders) \u2022 We have learned about local resources and assets (egs. fire extinguishers, first aid kits, people with response skills, generator, ladder, search and rescue equipment) public sources, and discussed shared use of resources post disaster. \u2022 We have researched historical events and current scientific studies and considered all of the different hazards that could affect us. We are aware of the needs of vulnerable groups or individuals such as young children, students with disabilities, and language minorities, as well as the concerns of staff, students, parents and community. \u2022 We have site and neighborhood maps and have identified alternate staging and evacuation locations. \u2022 We have assessed and are addressing physical risks posed by buildings, building non structural elements and building contents, and hazards in our neighborhood. \u2022 We have evacuation plans, including safe assembly areas, evacuation routes, safe havens and alternatives, buddy system. Student transportation systems have plans to take students to nearest safe school in case of disaster during student commute. Parents/ guardians are informed of location of all possible safe havens for reunification. The evacuation plan has been shared with the nearest police, fire and hospital officials and established communication and understanding in advance of emergency situations. * Source: Risk RED: Risk Reduction Education for Disasters (July 15, 2008) www.riskred.org Making Schools Safer 128 \u2022 We have established a communication", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d32aa216-b413-463f-8839-4597ab134f7d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d32aa216-b413-463f-8839-4597ab134f7d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05dc2041e647dc80900e7423fe7fb04a1c32bbb7e9fcef49586d597cb3fbbc7b"}}, "hash": "05dc2041e647dc80900e7423fe7fb04a1c32bbb7e9fcef49586d597cb3fbbc7b", "text": "system for emergencies, including a warning system wherever appropriate.

Facilitator Requirements during Training Total Time: Approximately 1hour 30minutes Items and Materials needed: PowerPoint presentation, whiteboard and marker OR blackboard and chalk, module materials, your own notes based on those materials, handout on KGBV girls school, handout on Risk RED's \"Go Bag\" activity, Risk RED's Family Disaster Plan handout, \"Riskland\" handouts. 3. Suggested Methods and Activities This module is covers 2 areas: disaster education in the curriculum, and empowering children as disaster managers in their community. Both of these areas will explain fun and interactive ways of achieving those aims. Spend the first 5 minutes introducing the presentation, via the objectives and contents pages. Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 131 Why DRR education in schools? 2 slides, 10 minutes The main reason that the integration of DRR into the school curricula is being advocated is due to the targets set by the 3rd Priority for Action for the UN's International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-15. The quotes on this first explanatory slide are the areas directly related to teaching and action in schools. Further reasons are numerous, so just a few have been provided on the following slide. Some explanation for the UN's Millennium Development Goals may be required. The goal related to universal primary school education will be furthered if schools are safer, because parents will be more likely to send their children to school if they believe them to be safe. Schools are very important within communities as places for protection during disasters, and centres for social action and interaction during normal times. They can also serve as a centre of learning and action for DRR. Educating children and teachers about disaster safety can help to achieve \"bottom-up\" safety in schools, implementing measures to make then safer. \"Bottom-up\" means ideas and actions that have originated at the small, community level, and have then been used on a larger wider scale in the region. The opposite is \"top-down\". These are policies and actions that have originated on the international, national or state level and attempt to filter down to smaller areas. A balance between these two strategies is favourable, turning \"bottom-up\" action into \"top-down\" policy. \"Bottom-up\" strategies are usually more sustainable at the local level because they are owned and run by the people there, and DRR education and action should spread through the community, having longer-lasting effect. Lastly, children are the most vulnerable group in disaster situations, so it is our duty to ensure their protection. Scientific Education and Strategies for Integration - 2 slides 15 minutes: A key element of DRR education within the school curriculum is scientific knowledge of disasters. This already exists in many forms in the curricula in different areas, such as geography, math, earth and natural sciences, etc, but a more explicit programme is required in most cases. Research has shown that in schools across the world there is not often a good balance between scientific disaster knowledge and practical DRR measures related to that knowledge. So, it is important to stress that one side without the other has much less impact. Scientific knowledge is needed, but if it does not follow up with practical preparedness and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76880c7a-68e6-4894-838a-c1ec07453230": {"__data__": {"id_": "76880c7a-68e6-4894-838a-c1ec07453230", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Making Schools Safer", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/making-schools-safer", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9befde043e3e0823dc4a01bdae6b8116a895192169193e3bb2241634ff52749c"}}, "hash": "9befde043e3e0823dc4a01bdae6b8116a895192169193e3bb2241634ff52749c", "text": "mitigation education, it will not have lasting effect. Similarly, education on preparedness will not be as effective if children do not understand the reasons behind the advice. Another necessary balance required in terms of the scale of hazard education. In some schools, the international and national context is very well explained, with a wide variety of hazards covered. However, this then rarely focuses in on DRR measures for hazards in the local areas. Conversely, schools that have a strong focus on the main local hazard and methods of preparedness and mitigation fail to cover other local hazards and disaster examples on the larger scale. The need for this balance is further stressed in the following slide, as one of the suggested strategies. The strategies in the second slide should be explained to the teachers. There is a strong focus on forging links with local and national institutions, whether they are NGOs, Government, Making Schools Safer 132 universities or other schools. The support of such institutions is valuable, as they can assist with expertise and materials. One good example is the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), which is providing courses on Disaster Management at the National level. These courses are covered in the three textbooks: \"Together, Towards a Safer India\", I - An Introduction to Disaster Management for Class 8; II - Making a Difference for Class 9; and III - A Stride Ahead for Class 10. These courses can help to solve them problem teachers face concerning teaching for exams. The curriculum is focused heavily in this manner, meaning that schools are often reluctant to include DRR as it serves an unwanted distraction from examinable material. It is worth considering acquiring materials on DRR in your local language also. This may be more appropriate in some areas and will also have a further reach into the community, especially to older members. Gender \u2013 3 slides, 20 minutes: The focus on gender in DRR in schools is very important for the future. The opening slide on this topic details a number of reasons why girls are more at risk in disaster situations and why their protection and empowerment is vital. The second slide on gender details the importance of a safe learning environment for girls. Female attendance is generally poor, for a few reasons. One of the most common is that conventional gender roles in India mean that it is the girls' responsibility to take care of matters at home; cooking, cleaning, raising siblings, learning useful household skills such as sewing, etc. So parents are often reluctant to allow their girls to go to school as help is needed at home, and they worry at that they will be missing out on important skills education for life. It has been shown that by improving the safety of schools and increasing the range of education available to them (both academic and vocational), parents will be more willing to allow their girls to receive education. The Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) girls' boarding school in Kanahuli, Bihar is a good example of innovative practice in a difficult situation. Please give the teachers a handout of the case study for this school. Empowering girls as disaster managers in their community through DRR activities and education is an effective way of reducing future vulnerability. Their knowledge will transfer to others in their community and will stay with them for their life in the future. Creating teams or clubs for girls to become responsible for safety in their school and to pass on the message at home is a positive method, as it gives them a role that is different to the typical gender roles. This kind of education and empowerment could also be used to encourage the formation of mothers groups for the same purpose in their neighbourhoods. Providing DRR education that is easily transferred from the school environment to the home and work environments will be particularly useful, as it will help to reduce vulnerability for their families in the future. Increasing girls' self-worth is an important step towards empowering to make their school and community safer. The example in the KGBV Girls School of introducing worldwide female role models to aspire to is a good one. Sensitising girls in terms of their rights under various UN activities, such as the Hyogo Framework for Action and the Millennium Development Goals, as Guidelines for Integrating Disaster Education 133 well as international and national law on human rights, will be very beneficial because it will reveal to them what standards of safety and they are entitled to.

Dangerous roads, difficult terrains and the threat of assault or molestation (as well as the worsening factor of the dark) can be a serious factor in limiting girls' attendance to schools. Arranging for escorts for them, such as teachers, parents or community members, could help to reduce this problem. Providing road safety education and reflective visibility bands for night times are important towards this goal. Regrettably, abuse is present in some schools. It is therefore essential that each school set up a mechanism for the reporting of such cases, that will allow children to stand up to such abuse. In a similar sense, it is also important to address psychosocial issues that children face within school, and because of disasters. Attendance is more likely to increase if children feel safer and happier at school. 'Targets for Curricula' is a summary slide on targets for integrating DRR into school curricula and is based on the recommendations in Ben Wisner's UNISDR report \"Let Our Children Teach Us!\". This should take no longer than 5 minutes. For primary and secondary schools within the centralised state education system, targets have been given to focus down on the local area and to spread DRR into the general curricula. For schools outside of that system, the emphasis has been placed on community-based methods. In addition, both types of schools will benefit from a greater exchange of knowledge and greater access to materials on DRR. Finally, as mentioned before, linking the \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" aspects will help to turn community-based action into national policy. The following 2 slides reference section 3.2 of Ben Wisner's UNISDR report entitled \"Let Our Children Teach Us\", and should take no longer than 10 minutes to explain with help from the source material. Methods that involve children in the process of both learning and teaching about disasters and risk reduction are proven to have a better effect in terms of their reach into the community. The following slide on the methods of the Child-to-Child Foundation in their approach to health education is a good example of community involvement. The next slide should be used to illustrate why children respond to fun activities. These activities are more likely to be remembered and repeated by
