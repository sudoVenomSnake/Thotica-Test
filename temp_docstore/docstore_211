Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 50 A disaster, or a con\ufb02ict, can spell an abrupt halt to everything we know and live with. The sea turns into a demon, the earth devours villages, neighbours turn into killers. A photographer freezes these dramatic moments and showcases them to the world. These images generate shock, information, compassion, awareness, policy changes, mass action (as in the US during the Vietnam war) and even entertainment, in a perverted sense. It takes a while to get the clock ticking again. If the cameras stay back, as it only rarely happens, then they can record the budding of life once again, moment by precious moment.

It argues that disaster photography needs to break away from the constraints of time and space. There is work to be done \u2013 both before the clock stops, and after it restarts. By the very nature of disaster, it is the sheer drama and scale of the event that attract media photographers. They look for shots that sum up \u2018the drama, spirit and courage in the face of a disasters\u2019, as Thomas E Franklin said about his famous still of the \ufb02ag raising at Ground Zero on 9/11.1 That was a \u2018decisive moment\u2019 as the legendary French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson would have called. It is all about being at the right place at the right time, when history happens. This is the essence of good \ufb01eld reporting using any medium \u2013 text, sound or visuals. A discerning photographer can combine this classic time and space formula with his or her heart, head and hand to produce lasting memories. Unforgettable images Closer home, the Indian Ocean tsunami produced a set of unforgettable images. Perhaps the most telling one about the sorrow of this tragedy was a picture taken by the Reuters photographer Arko Datta, showing a woman lying on sandy ground, mourning a dead relative. It became the World Press Photo of the year 2005. One of the jury members called it \u201cgraphic, historical and starkly emotional.\u201d2 In fact, this photograph\u2019s power lies in its understatement, the respect shown to the subject in keeping the bloated body beyond the frame, showing only the hand (see box for interview). At the same time we also saw a \ufb02ood of images, rather less respectful \u2013 mountains of bodies, bulldozers burying them en masse, bawling relatives... The boundary between reporting and disaster pornography often became very thin and contested. How much human suffering can actually be shown visually in the media depends on where the disaster or humanitarian tragedy occurs. An unwritten rule of thumb seems to be that the poorer a region is, the more graphic the international media\u2019s disaster coverage would be. Few dead bodies were shown in the visual media coverage after the 9/11 attacks in the United States. But the emaciated, naked bodies are staple for reporting on African famines while piles of dead bodies are routinely and explicitly shown in the aftermath of earthquakes or \ufb02oods in other parts of the developing world. The presence of cameras at the wrong spot aimed at a wrong angle is bad enough, but worse is their absence when people need it the most: after the last aid van has departed. The cameras vanished from the scene once the drama was over for the tsunami. The media interest waned and the assignment charts got \ufb01lled with election campaigns, corporate results, celebrity lifestyles, wildlife and assorted beauty pageants. And we had our fair share of disasters in the Indian subcontinent. When the tsunami-affected people were rebuilding their lives, living in hot, humid temporary shelters in all the affected countries, press cameras were often not there to tell the story to the world. If the international media played its role as the witness, thousands would not have suffered in shelters dubbed as shoeboxes, saunas and ovens across southern Asia. Fires and \ufb02oods would not have displaced many of these people again and again. In the suburbs of the South Indian city of Chennai, racketeers thriving on an organ trade would not have approached them with disgusting offers. Where were the cameras? Still, people showed their resilience and survived with dignity. They resold boats that did not \ufb01t their \ufb01shing patterns -- sometimes back to the aid agencies themselves. They also exchanged extra blankets for saris. They insisted that selective, piecemeal, discriminatory charity would not work. Cameras were just not there to capture small acts of courage in the face of a disaster that seemed to have no end. Across the region, the newfound peace in con\ufb02ict- striken northern Sumatra tip of Aceh in Indonesia, and that reached amidst disasters recovery and the broken cease\ufb01re in Sri Lanka, were news events for the world.

Committed photojournalism involves getting one\u2019s feet wet. It requires resource support, sound editorial decisions and, above all, bold photographers. Even all these may not work if there is no media interest in the plight of a set of marginal people. Media memory is indeed short. Ephemeral media The very life of the media lies in its ephemeral nature. It is all about here-and-now happenings. This concern with ephemera is in fact the bane of the media. We, reporters, tend to switch off our senses to what goes on then and there. Still, persistence of memory, some long-distance telephone calls and a little bit of imagination might help a text reporter to reconstruct a remote event and connect it to the present. But for a photographer, life revolves around here-and-now happenings. For a follow-up, she or he will have to take a \ufb02ight and land on the spot and search diligently for the actors of the drama long after the curtains are down. Or the editor may have to commission somebody closer there. Such time and resources are seldom spent by media houses on development stories. At the same time, the local media that can actually cover processes on ground fail to create enough momentum so that national, regional and international media get to notice what is going on at the ground level. Getting wide coverage of local issues like disaster rebuilding is like the making of an avalanche. It has to roll on to gain size and momentum. Humanitarian workers argue that it is important to have visual coverage at all phases of disasters. While disaster images generate compassion and policy interest, the follow-up coverage is essential to keep-up the interest and to ensure transparency and accountability. \u201cPhotographs offer a good a reality check,\u201d says Dr Unnikrishnan PV, an emergencies and con\ufb02icts advisor for ActionAid International. \u201cThey can alert the humanitarian and the government system and help initiate action.\u201d This globetrotter medic advises photographers to go beyond the roadsides and Azizur Rahim Peu/DrikNEWS/Majority World An old man carrying his goats on a bamboo raft, Pukuria, Manikgang, Bangladesh. 2007 Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 52 highways, to the remote corners where the real story lies, and witness the resilience of people. Walking an extra mile and getting closer to people always produce good pictures. As the famous con\ufb02ict photographer James Nachtwey says about his style, a photographer has to operate in the same intimate space that the subjects inhabit.3 While dealing with people caught up in disasters and con\ufb02ict, this closeness matters. It blunts the predatory edge of the camera. The photographer becomes a visitor, rather than a nosey intruder. Once the photographer knows the \ufb01rst name of the person she or he is shooting, it becomes a bit dif\ufb01cult to be offensive with the camera.

He befriended his subjects with Polaroid prints and small talk -- and sometimes serious debates -- before setting up his large-format analogue cameras.

Still, a strong storyline and a promise of stunning visuals coming from a photographer\u2019s end would be irresistible for any newsroom. One way to promote better visual representation of disasters and con\ufb02ict, and also of the people caught up in them, would be to empower photographers. They should be able to make their own storylines, charting out their own assignments. Some of the training sessions of the World Press Photo are aimed at developing better storylines. Such a trend has yet to catch up in the Asian media. Besides, the mainstream media in South Asia has yet to experiment with the photo possibilities offered by the digital technology and new age design and the use of multimedia. It requires quite a number of operational changes in the tradition-bound newsrooms and dark- rooms. Most of the editors in the region are text-driven, and all over the world too they have a background in text reporting or editing. So changes also need to reach the top. The way photographs are used can be innovative and quite effective. There is a trend of publishing a series of photographs in a series structured as if in a movie and telling the tale -- sometimes followed up by sound, video and multimedia clips in a web version. Such innovations can have a tremendous in\ufb02uence on humanitarian news coverage that often gets very little attention. Meanwhile, it may be worthwhile for Asian photographers to \ufb01nd opportunities to see the work of one another and to learn about their neighbouring countries. Photographers without borders Disasters that have recently hit the continent -- like the tsunami, the Kashmir earthquake and some \ufb02oods in the sub-Himalayan region -- did not respect national boundaries. There is no likelihood that future events, especially the climate-change related disasters, would be restricted to speci\ufb01c countries.

In this age of the Internet and instant transmission of images, there is a good case for photographers, especially those covering disasters and other emergencies, to work and learn beyond borders and pool their work.

I have to be very objective when I am covering any event. I leave the viewers to interpret the pictures according to their perspective. However, of course there are certain parameters I like to follow. I do not like showing corpses or any (image of) morbidity unnecessarily. In natural disasters it is mostly unnecessary; however, in a war, one may need to show the victims as that may be the strongest way of making people aware of the fallout of wars. In a natural disaster, the story is generally about the survivors -- their struggle to cope with the loss of their near and dear ones, their struggle to get back to normalcy.

In today\u2019s media-rich world, journalists\u2019 are the \u2018eyes and ears\u2019 for the Global Village to witness disasters as they unfold. This is one more reason to get media\u2019s disaster coverage just right. Amjad Bhatti While doing a report on media perceptions of disasters in 1999, I interviewed senior editors, journalists and columnists and asked how they look at disasters. I wanted to know what role they thought the media could play in reducing disaster-related risk via the domain of reporting. One senior editor of an English- language daily newspaper responded: \u201cWhat does the media have to do with disasters, except to report on it after it has occurred? For us [the media] disaster is always a front-page story, anyway.\u201d These re\ufb02ections now hit my memory and remind me a folkloric narrative on \ufb02oods, and how these were understood in the past in my country, Pakistan, and probably elsewhere too. This stands in sharp contrast to the understanding of the editor we encountered. \u201cKang aye aiy way loko kang aiye aiy\u201d (this could be literally translated as \u201cthe \ufb02ood has come o folks, the \ufb02ood has come\u201d) is a folkloric narrative in the Punjabi language, which I have been hearing from my childhood. It comes from my village, situated in close proximity to the crucial river Chenab. In the past, \ufb02oods were not just bad news. As the above comment suggests, this narrative goes beyond a mere mourning of \ufb02ood-induced loss in a risk-prone local geography. At certain points, it appears to be a cultural satire and social commentary on locally embedded causes, the differential impacts and discrimination witnessed in a disaster like a \ufb02ood. It\u2019s a traditional but critical articulation of seeing disasters differently -- by not treating it narrowly as an ecological event or a stereotypical \u2018fury of God\u2019. Rather, it\u2019s a way of unfolding the causal relationship and social interaction of \ufb02oods as an ongoing \u2018process\u2019.

I \ufb01nd this piece as an irresistible example of an oral \u2018reportorial\u2019 comment or understanding of what the \ufb02oods meant in the area. The longitudinal lens through which this folklore looks at \ufb02oods is what, arguably, is missing from the today\u2019s corporate-driven media \u2013- particularly when it comes to reports on recurring disasters. Disasters as mere events Media, arguably, tend to be the victim as well as the promoter of hegemonic ideologies, popular prejudice and social stereotypes. Like rest of the events happening everyday in our social milieu, the media largely looks at disaster as an \u2018event\u2019, and at the best treats it as a hard news. There is a glaring similarity between the government and media in the way both deal with disasters. A quick review of the disaster management policies of South Asian governments would reveal that the policy emphasis of the governments in the region remain post- hoc, focusing on emergency management and relief distribution. Wittingly or otherwise, the dominant media pattern follows suit when it comes to disaster reporting. This has happened particularly in recent mega disasters brought about by the Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 and the Himalayan earthquake in October 2005. There was a rush of camera crews to capture the melodramatic content of the disasters in the \ufb01rst few hours and days; but there was little or no news once the impacts of tides and tremors became \u2018stale\u2019. Though the survivors were still grappling with the nightmares wrought by those fateful moments of the tsunami and the earthquake, the media was simply not around, eager or forthcoming to follow up the story. Instead, they were all competing with each other to break at the time of the disaster itself. Disaster coverage formula? Swapan Dasgupta, then the deputy editor of India Today, argued disaster reporting in India as having traditionally followed a formula: \u201cFirst there are the gruesome horror stories, followed by accusations that the government willfully connived in the disaster, followed by the stories of how of\ufb01cial machinery is insensitive to the sufferings, followed by the alarmist fears of epidemics and, \ufb01nally, the expose of the wholesale loot of relief material.\u201d Migration never happens during flood, it happens when river erosion starts. But in Sirajganj, a northern district of the country river erosion and flood come together. Most of the northern district is under threat of flood. People have to move their homes with their belongings and take shelter on the highland. Continuous increase in water level causes inundation of river beds and marooning thousands of people.

People leaving beside the dam of the Mohishshoiri River, besides Sundarban Forest (west zone of Bangladesh) of Khulna division, some around 240 km from the capital Dhaka, didn\u2019t know what was waiting for them in the next morning. A part of the dam broke down and inundated the whole area overnight houses, shrimp firms as well as their dreams. They were not even prepared for the situation and with time they could realize they have to move from their home to a safer place not only themselves but also with their cattle. \u201cThe sufferings of cattle are more than what we human beings are going through\u201d, en us one of the victims said. They left their village and migrated to a safer village and made temporary homes on the Dam. Now there is no grass for the cattle so they tried to move them to another village. \u201cI sent sixteen of my seventeen cows but I can not move one, it does not want to move from this place.\u201d Ponds with sweet water mixed with saline water could never be drinkable.

The question, however, lies in how we perceive and understand disaster as a concept and as an event. Recent disaster studies have differentiated between a \u2018hazard\u2019 and a \u2018disaster\u2019. These studies maintain that a hazard is a natural event but a disaster is not. The South Asia Disaster Report 2005 suggests that \u201ca disaster is the dialectical upshot of development failures and socio-economic imbalances manifested in the built- and natural environment.\u201d The report criticises the \u2018dominant perspective\u2019 which believes that disaster is an interim intermission that can be ef\ufb01ciently reversed with emergency interventions largely based on rescue and relief. This is a stereotyped understanding of disaster, which rules the imagination of state managers and is being upheld by media in general. Yet, it has to be questioned. Nothing short of a paradigm shift is needed if one is to get an alternative perspective on disasters: a shift from emergency management to risk management. This perspective suggests understanding, investigating and exploring the social dimensions of disaster. It involves focusing on the process of ongoing development planning, state governance and social organization of at-risk areas and communities. A disaster event and its impact needs to be located through a longitudinal lens as what makes some communities and areas more vulnerable to disasters and how disaster could change or transform the social relationship at the country, community and household level. Broadly speaking, disasters can be divided into two categories: slow onset and sudden onset disasters. A cursory look at the media treatment of disasters would suggest that sudden and macro disasters catch media attention more prominently then the slow and micro-scale disasters. One possible reason of this trend strongly visible in the media can be seen in the \u2018shock value\u2019 of sudden and macro disasters. Micro and slow onset disasters largely remain \u2018missing\u2019 or \u2018invisible\u2019 in media analysis and hard-sell stories. Drought, for example, may not be as \u2018sexy\u2019 a story as famine; despite the fact that we all know fully-well that drought leads to famine. Let\u2019s look at another example. The consolidated data of disaster-related deaths in Nepal covering 32 years (1971 - 2003) reveals that epidemic was the cause of 60% of deaths, compared with 16% from landslides, 11% from \ufb02oods, four percent from earthquake, three percent from thunderstorms and six percent stemming from others causes. Similarly, in the eastern Indian state of Orrisa, epidemics were recorded to be one of the greatest causes of deaths. A comparative analysis of data for 2005 reveals that more people were killed in epidemics (748) than Children smile as they cross through floodwaters in Pulparamba, Kerala State, India (c) 2005 K. K.

It is pertinent to note that these mega development projects are being persued by national governments; and loans for these projects are solicited from international \ufb01nancial institutions (IFIs) on extravagent commercial interest rates. Closer investigations have revealed, particularly in the case LBOD (as mentioned above), that these IFI- \ufb01nanced mega projects are causing disasters in terms of \ufb02ooding, displacement and erosion of livelihood assets of vulnerable communities of the region. Media as partner, not just reporter A disaster cycle can be divided into \ufb01ve phases: pre- disaster; immediately post-disaster; short term relief; recovery; and rehabilitation. Media have speci\ufb01c roles to play in all these phases. Informing, educating and in\ufb02uencing public opinion and policy towards disaster risk reduction can be some untapped entry points for the media in relation to disaster reporting. For instance, in the pre-disaster phase of slow- onset disasters, the media can bring the potential risk into the public attention and highlight imminent damages. In sudden-onset disasters, it can disseminate preparedness information and send warnings to the threatened. In post-disaster situations stemming from slow- onset disasters, the media can inform decision makers about the concerns and needs of affected people and, inversely, can inform the people about the government\u2019s policies and decisions. It assumes the role of tracking, oversight and monitoring the relief process and can also provide relief information to the people.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a96989d0-d8c0-4d67-b0f2-33f41b7f564c": {"__data__": {"id_": "a96989d0-d8c0-4d67-b0f2-33f41b7f564c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ba0b896f63d4ceccdb108a584bac84d7b91302ece164fb9e999fd55a0e72c75"}, "2": {"node_id": "cef17636-01d0-461c-8539-15888ac23ed9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cb818ee28ecdd844fd780d70dfe308d6355a0e8c9203cdcd0f81bc95c43e563e"}}, "hash": "a9afd6d6c6d10eae735c2526f6b1793b25ee751c1b217c998dcdb26f03bb3ba9", "text": "In post-disaster situations arising from sudden- onset disasters, the media could identify the cause of the disaster, estimate its seriousness, provide and double- check damage estimates and detail the relief needs.

The failed project has now left a legacy of social and environmental disaster exempli\ufb01ed by silted-up dead rivers, permanent inundation of thousands of hectares of land, loss of indigenous variety of \ufb01sh and crop biodiversity, and has driven \ufb01sherfolk out of work.\u201d In another example, Zul\ufb01qar Halepoto of Forum for Con\ufb02ict Resolution-Pakistan stated: \u201cThe Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) project was intended to drain saline ground of surface water and storm run- off. Due to several technical problems, the drainage ef\ufb02uents, instead of going into the sea, started destroying lands and internationally-recognized wetlands. The project-induced problems include: \ufb02ooding, sea intrusion, loss of crops and agricultural land, reduction in \ufb01sh catches and the loss of lives.\u201d On the Case of Urban Infrastructure Development Projects in Karnataka, India, Gururaja Budhya of Urban Research Centre-Bangalore indicated that the implementation of urban development projects in Karnataka shows that the \ufb01ve major challenges in the Environment Policy identi\ufb01ed by the ADB have not been addressed; rather it has created more complications. The poor are not part of decision- making, institutional changes are top-down, the project has contributed to the deterioration of regional environment in the long run, no stakeholder engagement has been conducted, and systems within are not internalized. These recent trends open new avenues for investigative disaster reporting which are linked Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 59 Communicating to Save Lives The success or failure of humanitarian action can depend on good communication. This is far more complex than simply building good relations with the media in times of crisis. Communications needs of bene\ufb01ciaries must be addressed in programme planning and delivery, and humanitarian agencies must place more emphasis on sharing information and resources rather than competing for airtime. Patrick Fuller TVEAP image archive Communicating to Save Lives Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 60 On 26 January 2001 a devastating earthquake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale struck the Indian state of Gujarat. The epicenter was in the remote district of Kutch, close to the Pakistani border. Kutch was cut off from the outside world. Telephone lines were down, mobile phone networks were jammed and the HF radio mast used by local Indian Air Force base had been damaged. It took more than 24 hours before communication could be restored. This was not an untypical scenario and one that humanitarian organisations and the media regularly confront in the aftermath of major natural disasters. The South Asia Delegation of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (International Federation, or IFRC ) based in Delhi was at the forefront of the international response to the earthquake. Despite the information vacuum, a well-oiled response mechanism swung into action. By the afternoon of January 26, a preliminary appeal for 2 million Swiss Francs had been launched to assist 50,000 affected people.

Good communication in a disaster zone depends on many factors. Rapid access to the disaster zone, professional human resource capacity and readily available communications technology are among them. The latest communications technology should be integral to a humanitarian organisations emergency response toolkit. Whether it\u2019s an earthquake in the mountains of Afghanistan or \ufb02ooding in Somalia, a satellite phone is an essential piece of equipment to maintain contact with the outside world where conventional communication isn\u2019t possible. Combine a satellite phone with a laptop, digital camera and digital video camera, and a humanitarian agency can become a news provider from anywhere in the world. Web stories and blogs can be posted on agency web sites, and digital photos and raw video footage can easily be made accessible to international news agencies. Same disaster, di\ufb00erent needs Organisations such as the International Federation, UNICEF and World Food Programme (WFP) all recognize the importance of having experienced communications staff strategically located in of\ufb01ces around the world who are available to move into disaster zones at short notice. With the advent of the 24 hour news cycle, humanitarian agencies quite often \ufb01nd themselves arriving at the scene of a disaster at the same time as international news teams. This carries advantages and disadvantages. How many times have you heard the phrase when watching the News \u2026\u2018the aid effort is slow to get underway\u2019? In any given disaster, it always takes time to establish logistical pipelines and the infrastructure required to deliver relief supplies. But for the media, conveying a mood of drama and controversy makes for a more exciting news report. TVEAP image archive Interviewing tsunami survivor in Tamil Nadu, India TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 61 Generally, the relationship between the media and humanitarian agencies following a disaster is a reciprocal one. The media need access to the story, sound-bites and good story leads. Humanitarian agencies need visibility and the opportunity to broadcast their concerns to a global audience. While the relationship is one of mutual bene\ufb01t, it tends to be short-lived. Media interest in the Gujurat earthquake plummeted after a week when journalists moved on to the next story. In the case of the 2004 Asian Tsunami, media interest was sustained for a few weeks, but some would argue this was largely due to the numbers of foreign tourists who were affected. A common frustration is that news reporters tend to be very formulaic in their approach to covering disasters. Reporters arriving from abroad rarely probe beneath the surface to provide analysis of the wider issues surrounding disasters, and it is seldom that journalists return to the scene of a disaster to report on how affected communities are coping a few months or a year down the line. This is the nature of news -- the humanitarian community needs to recognize that they have a limited window of opportunity to get their message across using the news media. Silent emergencies The disparity in funding per capita between high pro\ufb01le disasters and some neglected disasters is alarming. Chronic disasters -- such as droughts -- are dif\ufb01cult to cover as news stories precisely because their onset is slow and the visible signs of human suffering that the media favour are often absent. But the disparity in funding received for different disasters is clearly re\ufb02ected in the levels of media attention that they receive. The Asian Tsunami raised at least US$ 1,241 per bene\ufb01ciary in aid, compared to appeals for disasters such as the 2005 droughts in Malawi and Niger which averaged less than US$27 per person.1 Although the media does have an important role as a catalyst to mobilise public support, they should not be held accountable for some disasters remaining in the shadows. While donor governments have their own decision-making criteria, media coverage of a disaster can certainly in\ufb02uence donor policy on whether or not they should intervene in any given crisis. Neglect is not necessarily a term that would be associated with the outpouring of goodwill shown by humanitarian agencies in their response to the Asian Tsunami, but it is questionable as to whether some agencies neglected to communicate suf\ufb01ciently with affected communities. Most International Non Governmental organizations (INGOs) have signed up to the Red Cross and NGO Code of Conduct (see box on page 62) which provides a clear set of guiding principles designed to regulate consultation between humanitarian agencies and the people they set out to assist.

Reviews conducted on the response to the 2004 Asian Tsunami clearly demonstrate that many humanitarian agencies made decisions based on experience and professional judgement when dispatching standard relief materials to the disaster zone. It was only when the chaos subsided that assessments and consultations with affected communities became more detailed and provided more factual data. Under these circumstances information is power and invariably aid agencies hold the key as they make decisions which have a direct impact on the people caught up in the disaster. Listening to bene\ufb01ciaries In November 2005, the International Federation teamed up with CDA Collaborative Learning Projects and other partners in the humanitarian sector to launch the \u2018Listening Project\u20192, which aimed to gather the views and opinions of local people in up to 20 developing countries where international aid had been provided after a disaster. The idea was to assess the impact of international assistance and learn from bene\ufb01ciaries experiences. Food supplies are delivered by volunteers from the Bangladesh Center for Communication Programs (BCCP) to rural villages during the 1998 floods in Bangladesh. (c) 1998 Edson E. Whitney, Courtesy of Photoshare Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 62 The project began in Aceh, Indonesia, and produced some interesting results. Seven teams of listeners were designated different localities. They didn\u2019t work from pre-set questions; rather, the approach was to move around, engaging a wide cross- section of people, young and old, in conversation. It was the bene\ufb01ciaries who took the lead in raising the issues that most concerned them. It was apparent that in their response to the Tsunami, NGOs overall had performed poorly when communicating with the people they set out to help. Many people were unhappy that they did not have enough information about aid and aid processes. Some couldn\u2019t understand why different aid was given to neighbouring communities. Assumed wisdom led many NGOs to channel information to the community through the village head man which wasn\u2019t always the best approach -- it created suspicions of unfairness, and quite often the information failed to trickle down to key groups, particularly women. The Listening teams found that many people felt there was no mechanism to express their opinions or discuss problems with the NGOs, and felt afraid to raise issues with NGOs. When asked how communication could be improved, there were a number of suggestions, such as more public meetings or information centers where NGOs could explain issues in greater detail to the community. The Listening Project highlights how a lack of bene\ufb01ciary communication can seriously undermine the credibility of humanitarian agencies, which, in turn, led to a negative impact on the welfare of local communities. Surprisingly few agencies have genuinely addressed the notion of accountability in their aid delivery. Some would argue that upward accountability to donors has taken precedence over downward accountability to bene\ufb01ciary populations. Despite the heavy branding on most of the relief materials that were distributed in Aceh, most of the recipients knew next to nothing about the agencies that had come to help them. The response to the Tsunami in Sri Lanka is a good demonstration of con\ufb02icting priorities. Reportedly over 300 agencies arrived with considerable funding and little knowledge of working in the country. It was not easy to establish coordination mechanisms at central and district levels between an overwhelmed government bureaucracy and NGOs whose main focus was to hit the ground Code of Conduct for NGOs in Disaster Relief The Code of Conduct for The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief, was developed and agreed upon by eight of the world\u2019s largest disaster response agencies in the summer of 1994 and represents a huge leap forward in setting standards for disaster response. It is being used by the International Federation to monitor its own standards of relief delivery and to encourage other agencies to set similar standards. The Code of Conduct, like most professional codes, is a voluntary one. It is applicable to any NGO, be it national or international, small or large. It lays down 10 points of principle which all NGOs should adhere to in their disaster response work, and goes on to describe the relationships agencies working in disasters should seek with donor governments, host governments and the UN system. 1. The Humanitarian imperative comes \ufb01rst. 2. Aid is given regardless of the race, creed or nationality of the recipients and without adverse distinction of any kind. Aid priorities are calculated on the basis of need alone. 3.

Because so many agencies wanted to stake their claim to a corner of the country, and become operational as soon as possible, opportunities to share data, assessment \ufb01ndings and knowledge were lost. Collaboration with local government and other agencies became secondary, and there was wide- spread duplication of efforts. Some villages received multiple distributions of \ufb01shing boats, while others received countless assessment teams from different agencies passing through their village asking the same questions\u2026.with little or no material bene\ufb01ts. Providing information to survivors of a disaster can have a signi\ufb01cant impact on their well-being by helping to repair psychological damage and restore people\u2019s dignity. In post Tsunami Sri Lanka, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) deployed twelve mobile teams whose function was to enable families and individuals staying in welfare centres to make contact with their relatives to let them know they were alive and well. The teams visited over 300 welfare centres armed with satellite and mobile phones, playing a critical role at a time when communication by telephone was almost non-existent. Mass media plays a crucial role in disaster preparedness and response. Radio was the sole information source for thousands of families living in temporary shelters in Sri Lanka after the Tsunami. Many NGOs and humanitarian agencies tapped into this by collaborating with public and commercial broadcasters to produce public information broadcasts that featured details of forthcoming relief distributions, training opportunities or health education messages. Media for early warning Despite the lack of of\ufb01cial early warning systems, communications technology played an important role in saving lives before the tsunami struck. There were many reported cases of people-to-people early warning via mobile phone networks. With the proliferation of mobile phone use, text messaging (SMS) is being looked at seriously in some countries for disseminating nationwide early warning alerts. Other modes of communication play a vital role in the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society\u2019s Community Based Disaster Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 64 Listening as Part of Communication The task of reconstruction in Sri Lanka has been arduous and complex and there are clear examples where the failure to communicate disempowered a\ufb00ected communities. Permanent housing bene\ufb01ciaries as well as humanitarian agencies were often unsure of entitlements and rights due to a lack of public information campaigns. This was a situation where consultation and communication between bene\ufb01ciaries, local government and humanitarian agencies could have been improved. Families who had been living with host families, or in temporary wooden shelters, for over a year should have known where they would settle down permanently. In Sri Lanka, the Red Cross is one of the main actors in the reconstruction e\ufb00ort, supporting the building of over 20,000 houses. The task will take close to three years to complete and explaining that to tsunami survivors is vital. For the Red Cross, communication has been integral to programme planning. As soon as the local authorities provides a list of bene\ufb01ciaries for a housing site, a series of consultative meetings begins that involves all families who will be moving to the houses when they are built. They are consulted on the designs and layout of the houses and are taken to neighbouring sites to see similar homes. Families are involved in the planning of each site and are brought together with members of the host community living in the vicinity to ensure that community buildings and infrastructure are planned in a way that reduces possible tensions between old and new residents.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60d9dcd9-39c1-4306-880a-626a9a486f64": {"__data__": {"id_": "60d9dcd9-39c1-4306-880a-626a9a486f64", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d937391663e01309a6900844c889d9bb28367ed1f87905dd5c9a43488615cc71"}, "2": {"node_id": "f716fac2-8940-4d16-be91-0c888766c5c8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b0e2d8dc568c9a28412260e09f3c61e8f86231b6a704e92a07aa5cf3cdd37a1f"}}, "hash": "a0155b0cd4989ecaa849a6b23d3a74652c0a058398e4dfafec21155e0d2112fe", "text": "Endnotes: 1 Source: Development Initiatives (UK-based NGO specialising in aid data \ufb02ows) based on UN FTS data, http://www.globalhumanitarian assistance.org 2 http://www.cdainc.com/lp/ Preparedness programme.

The programme has proved to be successful not only because it has saved thousands of lives, but because it is sustained through the active participation of volunteers from the community. The success or failure of humanitarian action can depend on good communication. This is far more complex than simply building good relations with the media in times of crisis. Communications needs of bene\ufb01ciaries must be addressed in programme planning and delivery, and humanitarian agencies must place more emphasis on sharing information and resources rather than competing for airtime. Agencies also need to join forces to raise awareness around neglected disasters that remain in the shadows. To make all this happen communications must be seen as integral to strategic objectives. Humanitarian agencies need to make the necessary investment and should explore new ways to engage their publics using new communications channels and media. If they don\u2019t, they can end up in the shadows. Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 65 Extra Hands in Times of Crisis The idea of volunteers being philanthropists lacking in skills, or being young, fresh college graduates entering the job market and seeking adventure, is rapidly changing. Several international organisations are engaging highly educated and professional volunteers for specialised tasks during emergencies.

She woke me up and said, \u2018Waves\u2019. She told me to move to higher ground. My mom is faster than the TV!\u201d eight-year-old Beam said after a tsunami-evacuation drill carried out in Thailand sometime in March 2005. Her mother Sumontha explained that community members did not always hear the warnings the government broadcasts; it was the neighbours who phoned them and made sure they evacuated from the high-risk areas. Beam was talking to a TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c \ufb01lm crew who had tracked families affected by the 26 December 2004 tsunami for months, and documented how they were returning to normalcy.1 Time and again, local community members are the \ufb01rst to join hands during an emergency situation, and on a voluntary basis they help the most vulnerable. Alas, few of these Samaritans are involved in preparedness activities; nor are most able to adapt available resources to disseminate much-needed information, including alerts on when evacuees can safely return to their homes. This was the case in Indonesia\u2019s province of Banda Aceh, one of the worst hit areas by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami. Aware of the isolated state in which their region was at that point in time due to the dreadful conditions on the ground, hundreds of local volunteers quickly organized emergency relief efforts. They succeeded in many ways, but developing communication methods once again proved challenging. Community radio It was ten days after the disaster that a group of volunteer experts from the KBR68H radio station in Jakarta were \ufb01nally able to arrive in Aceh, and set up a community radio station. The crew was given a crash course. They worked hard to ensure that much- needed information (from religious messages and encouragement to sharing data on missing persons) \ufb01nally got to the people. Had local volunteers already received appropriate training, they would have been able to set up the emergency studio in a period of just six hours. When disaster strikes, volunteers come to the fore. Community members typically rally to support one another. However they need to be prepared, and their efforts need to be coordinated. Trained professionals can provide crucial support by training people in disaster preparedness and response, and by helping to coordinate national and international relief and rebuilding programmes. The United Nations Volunteers programme (UNV) is often one of the \ufb01rst organisations to respond to disasters on-site. UNV mobilizes national and international UNV volunteers to support the immediate relief and recovery activities of major disaster organisations and domestic institutions.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5058a1af-df37-4f33-91a1-5386cbca34c3": {"__data__": {"id_": "5058a1af-df37-4f33-91a1-5386cbca34c3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "100becc48b361e71deefb26e6977b8f26fa48be06d6f0dc0ab9d08fb45ced6a6"}, "2": {"node_id": "546ba4c0-8749-4c15-a808-1d93e7228592", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b9a22fe82ff8563538dc3887e0067f6eabb421e763ec7980ee09ee93206b6679"}}, "hash": "670767972ad26a5aa56d5a70ea06a7f9242e338e3eb9f559323ba29975b02502", "text": "Beyond the response phase, UNV works with governments and other national partners in the creation of community-level disaster preparedness plans to strengthen their capacities and lessen the impact of possible future disasters.

The idea of volunteers being philanthropists and lacking in skills, or being young, fresh college graduates entering the job market and seeking adventure, is rapidly changing. The number of international organisations mobilizing highly educated and professional volunteers is on the rise. Volunteers associated with United Nations Volunteers (UNV), for instance, have \ufb01ve to 10 years of work experience and are an average 37 years old. Their on-site and online contributions are proving extremely productive in \ufb01elds as diverse as health, education, human rights promotion, community development, vocational training, industry and population.

Volunteers for Prevention If communities are to brace themselves for weather-related disasters, they need suf\ufb01cient early warning mechanisms to be able to implement emergency plans of action. Some initiatives are happening on the ground. As part of the World Meteorological Organization\u2019s (WMO) daily routine of weather observation, large numbers of people volunteer their time to the most basic level of meteorological prediction: data collection. Experienced farmers, \ufb01shermen, pilots and sea captains read hydrological and meteorological recorders, measure rainfall and test climatic conditions. They report their \ufb01ndings to national meteorological surveys around the world. Without these volunteer efforts, meteorologists would have less access to information about conditions in remote areas, impeding their ability to provide accurate forecasts of weather patterns around the globe. Volunteerism has also served as an effective communication support system in the wake of disasters. In India for instance, a victim of the Gujarat earthquake in January 2001 himself, Information Technology specialist Hemang Karelia declined an offer from a private consulting \ufb01rm and decided instead to help thousands of victims of the quake, which had devastated his hometown of Bhuj. After signing up as a UNV volunteer a few days after the disaster, he took charge of the computers in the control room and made sure relevant data was collected to help affected people. Easily-readable maps, which helped to track and channel the scarce resources available in those trying times, were also produced. Right information \u201cIt gave me great satisfaction to provide the right information at the right time and direct resources in the right direction,\u201d Hemang recalls. Before that, Sanjaya Mohanty in Orissa also used modern tools in communication to take information about government programmes right to the doorstep of poor villagers, whose livelihoods were destroyed \ufb01rst by a cyclone and soon afterwards by \ufb02oods in October 1999. Furthermore, he established Shocked by the magnitude of the tsunami devastation and number casualties, he quit his job in January 2005 and decided to join the relief efforts as a Volunteer in Banda Aceh. He was later on appointed UNV Volunteer and worked as an HIC Field coordinator supervising the work of the Field Information Officers. He provided key data to the governmental agency BRR and UNIMS.

Challenges ahead While volunteer contributions like these have proven extremely valuable at the country level, there is still a need to fully integrate them into strategic partnerships, such as those aiming at communicating disasters at regional levels. International organisations engaged in mobilizing volunteers should join forces and prepare a database of volunteers with speci\ufb01c professional backgrounds in \ufb01elds such as journalism, communication technology, disaster management and public health, to respond to the needs of mass media and other communication partners in times of emergency. The print and broadcast media would probably welcome an extra hand that would assist in their work and help ensure that reliable information is promptly gathered or disseminated. Overloaded news bureaux could greatly bene\ufb01t from having on-site and online specialized volunteers carrying out \ufb01eld research, extending advice and even giving interviews on disaster management or health recommendations, at least until of\ufb01cial sources are ready to do so. Experienced \u201cvolunteer journalists\u201d could also be deployed on-site to act as team leaders for local amateur reporters and photographers, and help speed up the collection of data on casualties and ground conditions. Information centres set up by the specialists would ensure that latest news reached main-stream media for broader dissemination in a timely manner. When disaster strikes, volunteers are the ones who spearhead activities to support those most affected. The ingenuity solidarity and creativity of ordinary people are harnessed through voluntary action. And since each and every human being has the potential to volunteer, encouraging and supporting their involvement in strategic partnerships will enrich disaster preparedness, mitigation and, ultimately, management.

So, this gap grows. There is a popular game prevalent in news-rooms. It involves nick-naming the development agencies in question based on the issue they focus on -- \u201dthe HIV- guy\u201d, \u201cthe development- index guy\u201d, \u201cthe global-warming guy\u201d, \u201cthe poverty guy\u201d, \u201cthe MDG (millennium development goals) guy\u201d, all labels referring to one or the other development agency working on the speci\ufb01c theme in question. Rarely have these organisations or their staff members shown an interest in themes or issues which are not directly linked with their own priorities of-the-moment. It is not very surprising therefore that most journalists consider the development agencies as yet another set of self-serving institutions. Institutions that are craving for media coverage, institutions which shamelessly want a plug for the purpose of their own pro\ufb01le-raising, and institutions that are not above board when it comes to that deadliest of sins \u2014 the planting of stories. The divide is nearly complete. The sole saving grace is that both sides have not started wagging war against each other. At least not yet. So, how did this chasm come about? Are these two arms of the society mutually exclusive? Is there no space for interaction and mutual bene\ufb01ts? Is it, at (Opposite Page Photo) TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 72 TVEAP image archive all, possible for both to work together for the eventual bene\ufb01t of their real clientele \u2014 the people? Understanding media To answer these questions, one must, \ufb01rst of all, understand media dynamics, and, then, the narrative dynamics of the development discourse. After all, the media is plural term, not a singular one. This implies that the media are not a monolith. Some are excellent; many are mediocre; some are downright bad. Some in the media are also indifferent to some issues but may be outstanding in addressing other issues. If you rotate the media vibgyor-disk fast enough, all you see are shades of grey. But, the development narrative tries to \ufb01t it into a bi-polarity of black and white. In a sense, the development narrative predates George W. Bush Jr. and the perspective that you are either with us or against us. Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 73 Fundamentally, this cleavage is due to the developmentalists\u2019 inability to distinguish between journalism and the media industry. The media industry, though it claims innumerable privileges, is still an industry with a clear focus on the bottom-line. However, it must be noted that there are any number of journalists who are alive to the crucial issues confronting - humanity. They are constantly on the look-out for a good story that would make some change in people\u2019s lives. They want to record, document, initiate a debate, shake the policy-makers out of either their slumber or rank opportunism, research for alternatives, and open up space for dissent. How am I so sure of this? Well, journalism was my chosen \ufb01eld for some twenty-odd years, till I moved on to the insular world of development, a couple of years ago. One never looked at journalism purely as a careerist pursuit. I believed, and still do believe, that the media are a site for the democratic mediation of ideas. It is important for any politically-sensitive person, but one who is not a politician or merely a partisan in narrow party politics, to reach out to the public directly, to bare open his or her ideas and views through the dynamics of media. This is essential to ensure a place for those ideas to germinate into something more concrete in the domain of the public sphere.

Publications, channels or radio stations may or may not share the concerns of the developmental agencies; but individual journalists do. They use three creative tools to get their stories published or broadcast. First, journalists always create a contemporary peg to hang their stories onto. They know that stories when presented with no sense of immediacy -- and those having a shelf-life beyond the periodicity of the publication -- seem \ufb01t for the story-bank, from which they are rarely if ever retrieved. This is an essential difference between the perception of developmental agencies and that of the media. Developmental agencies always believe they have generated a body of information that has relevance for at least a decade. And the media looks TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 74 at everything from a perspective of the here and now. The media always seeks a contemporary peg in order to help its reader relate to the story by providing a recent grounding. And that\u2019s the reason the media remains the best communication platform, while developmental work remains mainly on the shelves of the bookshop. Second, people working the media are masters of subtle subversion. They know how to mask a story without losing its power or potency in overcoming various forms of censorships to which the mainstream media is often subject. Censorship comes from the ownership, from the state, from the market and at times there is even self-censorship to tide over a current crisis within the organisation or to cope with the Spirit of the Times. Developmental agencies should therefore leave the narrative grid of the story and form to the journalist, and not to try and impose a politically correct, sanitised version which fails to work, especially with the readers. Third, journalists also deploy their excursions in erudition to bring forth a point closer to the reader, by drawing parallels or hinting at similarities. For this, they will obviously not be prepared to use verbatim the developmental agencies\u2019 \ufb01ndings, recommendations, research and writings. Journalists need to counterpose these with other claims, research and writings in order to contextualise them. One of the usual complaints against journalists coming in from development agencies is that \u201cwe gave them so much material but they used so little\u201d. There is a need here for the development agencies to re\ufb02ect why this happens ever so often. Engaging media all the way Development agencies rarely bring journalists into their universe at a stage which can be called \u2018work-in- progress\u2019. They usually just come to the media with a \ufb01nished product. There is hardly any joint exploration. When presented with a \ufb01nished product, there is just one alternative for a reporter \u2014 that is, to review the product that is already done. Imagine a scenario where journalists are brought into the process right from the word go. There would TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 75 have been a series of stories, and when the \ufb01nal report of the development agencies is realised, that may well serve as the winding-up story tracking the entire trajectory. A journalist is expected to report and not just reproduce. Development agencies like their versions to be reproduced to a large extent. This becomes an assault on the journalists\u2019 work-pride. He or she would like to do a \ufb01eld report, taking a cue or two from the work of the development agency. But, to merely reproduce a report is seen only as providing a free plug, an unpaid advertisement, and doing a stenographer\u2019s job. Let\u2019s look at one story which had a massive impact. In India, the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA \u2013 the movement to protect livelihoods of tribals coming under threat from a series of major dam projects) has been campaigning on the contentious issue of big dams for nearly two-and-a- half decades. But, not once did Ms. Medha Patkar, the moving spirit of the movement, fail to get the support from the mainstream media. The media has, in fact, been an integral part of this struggle. This is true on many fronts. Whether in terms of countering the government\u2019s claim over proposed dam projects, or in terms of generating details of the area or mass of land that was to be lost due to the raising water levels, or the question of displacement, or on the lack of rehabilitation. On all these issues, the NBA managed to keep the media informed from the word go.

NBA shared with journalists its own doubts, vulnerabilities, and anxieties and often voiced their fear that all their efforts may be futile. In many a sense, it was a partnership between the NBA and the journalists. Though the NBA\u2019s struggle may have ultimately not yielded the desired results in its entirety \u2013 the contentious dams were built, \ufb01nally -- what resulted from this fruitful partnership was many a useful by-product.

Medha Patkar TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 76 Not just a publicity tool UN agencies, donor agencies and international development organisations should keep in mind that media is not merely a conveyor of messages handed to them by press of\ufb01cers. The prose of the development agencies often has no people in it... it\u2019s just numbers. They retain their sense of critical distance; and journalists feel slighted by the press releases that land on their tables mostly without any scope whatsoever for veri\ufb01cation, counter-checking and illustrative examples. A good journalist always strives to a give a human face to his or her reports. There are names, faces, families, friends, and depictions of the local society in their stories. By focusing on one individual, the media makes the suffering of that individual a metaphor of larger malady. It helps the readers to understand the pain, hope and frustrations of the victims. In that sense, journalism helps people to retain their dignity and not get reduced to becoming mere statistics. If developmental agencies understand this dynamics about the working of journalists, then there is nothing that prevents a most bene\ufb01cial partnership from \ufb02ourishing sometime in the future. But that goal is some understanding away, still.

How is it that some houses can be destroyed by storm winds while others resist the most frightening earthquake? Why do some people need years to recover from a bout of localised heavy rain, while others are back in business just a few months after a major tsunami? For risk professionals, disasters occur when a potentially dangerous natural phenomenon impacts vulnerable people (or their houses, organizations or cultures) who then cannot cope with these natural forces and their destructive effects.

A misunderstanding of how development effects could end up causing increasing risks. The unavailability of suf\ufb01cient resources to build better homes.

Access to historical information about past events is often one of the best mechanisms to prevent death for many. That is why most of the participatory approaches to assess risks at the village level include in their initial steps a discussion and collection of past events. This is the case with the approaches used by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Red Cross/Red Crescent, Asian Disaster Preparedness Centre (ADPC), CARE, Oxfam and many others that work on supporting local communities. Such an approach allows one to know in which conditions those events have occurred in the past, where they normally happen, and who has been historically affected and how.

The UNDP has been promoting DesInventar (www.desinventar.org), a Free/Libre and Open Source Software tool to collect, analyse and present such historical data. It is being used in all \ufb01ve tsunami affected countries, as well as in Latin America and other Asian countries, to be able to go into the details of past events. Development induced disasters Deeper risk analysis requires one to look for additional information. There\u2019s a reason for that: how can we avoid an event from turning into a disaster if we don\u2019t understand its roots, its causes and the parameters that creates it? Apart from the natural phenomenon, the developments around which and evolution of which are well known to researchers and scienti\ufb01c institutions across the globe, digging into the social causes such as territorial (un)planning, productive activities that lead to the changing of the environmental balances, building methods, organizational structures, internal power struggles and disparities, and the impact of external actors, are some of the key factors needed to be incorporated into a good risk assessment. Tools like hazard-mapping, actors-mapping, seasonal calendars, economical activities, an analysis of social service providers (such as transport, education, power, water and sanitation) and social typologies, are then useful to allow communities to better understand, express and explain their knowledge of risks. All this is also essential to document the reality of risks. Unfortunately, all this information is not always available at the community level, because it is unknown by people there or unavailable to them. Take the case of migration, involving people in search of a better future, who opt to move to some newly-created community or neighbourhoods, around an important urban centre. They often don\u2019t have this past information to be able to build on their knowledge of potential threats. They wouldn\u2019t know, for instance, how a river would evolve during the rainy season, or they often don\u2019t even have access to proper construction materials, basic health care, education or permanent jobs. In many cases, they themselves risk being affected by monsoon \ufb02oods, and deliberately choose to \ufb01nd a way to survive in their permanent social disaster (whether this is brought about by poverty, illness, illiteracy, discrimination or something else). Being the most vulnerable to natural events is very often an indicator of a deeper social vulnerability, inequity and discrimination. To reduce risk, it is also essential to document and understand good practices, not only as ready-to-use technical solutions to imitate, but most importantly, as social processes to replicate in different conditions, searching for internal and external factors that will trigger success. Looking for, understanding, sharing, and adapting good practices, building its own new ones from others\u2019 experience is certainly one of the best ways to ensure proper ownership and sustainability of new techniques, organizations and partnerships.

These solutions need to be adapted to the local context, implying the translation of documents. It would also help to produce audio documents, incorporate cultural standards, and reach the most vulnerable sections. At the national, state or district level, with decision-makers, awareness can be increased by education and training on risk creation, by producing assessment techniques to identify the most-obvious risks using existing data, just as it is being done for environmental purposes, allowing the emergence of prevention or mitigation solutions. Informing the general public on these matters is also a way to produce pressure for better decision- making. In 2004 in Panama, CEPREDENAC2 and the UNDP supported the Ministry of Finance while modifying the normal government project-\ufb01nancing approval process, so as to train their project reviewers on disaster risks, enabling them to add \ufb01ve questions about risks, to be answered by any proposal: Is the project zone prone to natural events? With which frequency? When \ufb01nished, will the project produce new risks to other projects? If infrastructure project, is it compliant with the seismic-resistant constructions codes? Does the project consider mitigation measures to reduce its vulnerabilities? Responsibilities, duties and rights As we have seen above, the responsibility on producing vulnerabilities and increasing risk does not lie solely with the communities. Many decisions affecting local land use or social mobility are driven by local authorities, economical conditions and private investments, national policies and regulations. In some cases, these decisions are even taken in another country (particularly in the case of trans-boundary rivers\u2019 management scenarios that produce \ufb02oods in the lowest part of the watershed). Knowledge should then be used to communicate on an informed basis, so as to promote \u201chorizontal\u201d dialogue and open discussion between parties to look for solutions after determining responsibilities. Development strategies should always be the product of a wide discussion, taking economic, environmental and social interest into account. (Incidentally those are the \u201cingredients\u201d of sustainable development, as de\ufb01ned during the 1990s.) There should also be a special place for discussing risks, as they also have economic, environmental and social implications which show up during disasters. Information and communication are among the main purposes of the media. Risks can be reduced even before tragedy strikes by using informed cases studies, success stories or examples of good- and bad- practices. In these efforts, one could highlight existing risks to enhance the dialogue between communities and decision-makers. It\u2019s not enough just to report on the number of the dead, and point at responsibilities after an event. This is specially the case if one\u2019s focus is building education around prevention matters, and for empowering communities with useful information. Based on concrete examples, the media can and should play a signi\ufb01cant role in letting large audiences be aware of the risks. It can also play a useful task by getting people to start to think of potential threats before they occur, so that human development activities might include vulnerability-reduction actions too.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a386729-fe27-4ff7-90ad-76cfd4d19358": {"__data__": {"id_": "7a386729-fe27-4ff7-90ad-76cfd4d19358", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e415f4073de0ef2704f00b2ac92666c8644c44f66492223e39c82fe417d4c47"}, "2": {"node_id": "c31b2355-3003-4c69-899a-e8cd40bd996f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "aebe324af790e7628e56f200c3bdc40c4458c8ca930233e102aab41059b10b73"}}, "hash": "b57a1a33fd957fcb2e6f2471d2d323b85d542adcfb49066e3ccfa999115f5835", "text": "Endnotes: 1 Except known human interaction causing changes in nature\u2019s balances, such as global warming and increased frequency of extreme events, or deforestation and its e\ufb00ects on a higher number of \ufb02ash \ufb02oods and landslides. 2 Spanish acronym for the Coordination Centre for", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5e8d36c6-77a0-4724-9a77-8bc3c09b1e42": {"__data__": {"id_": "5e8d36c6-77a0-4724-9a77-8bc3c09b1e42", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a07a6e2521651d3899fef7ca4ec2f858bda9f5d7b8d30230b77a8e54f5c4ddbb"}, "3": {"node_id": "2d4cc567-e0b3-49ea-b25b-91e5b0924c66", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bf612e627a1daa34c69b75115b95c91f14cceae403a5d709c077fb06db3a0e5f"}}, "hash": "e60f671e90f00833670285a61ab794d6c02fd7126bb5ecbc7cac33e8753c90d6", "text": "the Prevention of Natural Disasters in Central America Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 81 Who is Afraid of Citizen Journalists?

Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 82 Disasters, whether natural or man-made, used to be phenomena that we read about, saw on the television or heard on the radio after they happened. Even the advent of cable TV and 24 hour news channels did not change this. Unexpected or unplanned, no one could accurately predict where or when they would occur. Once they did, our \ufb01rst images and sounds usually used to be of ambulances rushing into hospital with the injured and the dead; bloody, ashen or mud-stained emergency workers and survivors emerging from the chaos; an aerial shot over the disaster area; an image zoomed in to focus on a single detail (a broken toy, a frozen clock or a single shoe); an animation depicting the lead-up to the disaster and how it played out; sound-bites from traumatized victims and various spokespersons; or a news anchor struggling to be heard above the din of relief work. Headlines the next day would scream out the numbers dead alongside an image of the tragedy -- shot by a professional photographer and purchased for hundreds of dollars. Large-scale disasters are growing. One the one hand, global warming and unprecedented environmental change are resulting in disasters more frequent and calamitous than before. Natural disasters such as earthquakes (Kashmir, 2005), \ufb02oods (Bangladesh, India and Nepal, 2007), landslides and mudslides (Bam, 2003; Chittagong, 2007), volcanic eruptions (Merapi, 2006), tsunamis (South and Southeast Asia, 2005) and forest \ufb01res (across Europe, 2007) continue to severely affect the lives and livelihoods of millions. On the other, the iconic images of the London bombings (7 July 2006), the Twin Towers in New York on 11 September 2001, Madrid train bombs (2004) and the Bali bombings (2002 and 2005) coupled with hundreds of gruesome local incidents -- including suicide bombings in countries such as Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Iraq -- are a stark reminder that man made disasters, often the result of terrorism, are a permanent feature of domestic life in many countries. Making sense But how do we make sense of such disasters -- their causes, their impact on those involved as victims and perpetrators? How do we maintain compassion in a world with competing human tragedies? Does the increasing availability and affordability of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) -- covering PCs, radio, mobile phones, blogs, SMS and the Internet -- result in the coverage and awareness of disasters qualitatively better than before? Or does reportage across a hundred thousand websites and The Khao Lak shopping center was destroyed by the tsunami that hit the shores of Thailand on 26 December 2004. (c) 2005 Rachel Serrano, Courtesy of Photoshare Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 83 blogs by those who are untrained in professional journalism diminish the importance of and, by extension, the response towards a disaster? There are no easy answers to these questions. Whether we like it or not, new technologies are changing the manner in which we gather, store, disseminate, consume and comment on news. The overall experience after the tsunami in Sri Lanka and the subsequent design of ICTs for humanitarian aid suggests that ordinary citizens can play a pivotal role in facilitating the \ufb02ow of information in relief and con\ufb02ict management mechanisms. What has changed? Let\u2019s take the scenario in the \ufb01rst paragraph.

SMS to the rescue The web is littered with examples on how SMS (Short Message Service, often called text messages) helped in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami in Indonesia and Sri Lanka.1 For example: \u2022 I'm standing on the Galle road in Aluthgama and looking at 5 ton trawlers tossed onto the road. Scary shit. \u2022 Found 5 of my friends, 2 dead. Of the 5, 4 are back in Colombo. The last one is stranded because of a broken bridge. Broken his leg. But he's alive. Made... \u2022 ..contact. He got swept away but swam ashore. Said he's been burying people all day. Just dragging them off the beach and digging holes with his hands. Go.. An enduring lesson in this regard was that since SMS is more resilient to mass scale destruction of telecoms infrastructure2, it can be the foundation for early warning systems3 and as a key alerting tool for communities at risk.4 For example, the Dutch government is testing a mobile phone danger alert system that sends text messages to people who could be affected by natural disasters or terrorist attacks. The system, called Cell Broadcast, uses GSM technology to identify cell phone users in a particular area. Here are four other examples of citizens using SMS: \u2022 Some governments are \ufb01nding it hard to control the \ufb02ow of information on inept and inadequate responses to disasters.5 SMS became an important tool in 2003 in China when it was used to spread information on the SARS epidemic. And although the spread of false information hampered relief efforts and sometimes created mass panic, SMS was a vehicle through which citizens exchanged information that the Chinese government wanted to suppress. \u2022 In the aftermath of the devastating earthquake on the Indonesian island of Java in May 2006, which killed over 5,000 and left 1.6 million homeless, mobile phones quickly became mobile news services for journalists covering the recovery efforts. International media support group Internews worked with more than 180 Indonesian journalists to establish a quick, low-cost text messaging service that enabled local radio stations to report on humanitarian relief.6 \u2022 In Sri Lanka, mobile phone totting citizens are requested to send in news and situation reports to JasmineNewsWires (JNW), a service set up to broadcast news updates through SMS. These messages are parsed into a news feed on the web, making it easy to access information in real time on everything from traf\ufb01c conditions, street violence at political rallies and \ufb01eld reports from the embattled regions in the North and East of Sri Lanka. \u201cMy name is Mohammed Sokor, writing to you from Dagahaley refugee camp in Dadaab.

You must help.\u201d The Economist (26 July 2007) carried an article7 that began with this quote as an example of how the relationship between victims and aid agencies has changed on account of the mobile phone. It shows how mobile phones could be used to strengthen the quality and responsiveness of aid work because of the accountability and transparency of aid operations it fosters amongst bene\ufb01ciaries, governments, civil society and donors. Citizens bearing witness In Sri Lanka, citizen journalism initiatives such as Groundviews8 and Vikalpa9 elicit content from ordinary citizens with little or no training in journalism. The contributors attempt to humanise violent con\ufb02ict, support peace and reconciliation and expose the growing divide between that which the Government and other warring parties promise and actually do. In fact, citizen journalists are increasingly playing a major role in meaningfully reporting deaths, the humanitarian fallout and hidden social costs of violent con\ufb02ict, often glossed over or sensationalised by traditional media. If we expand our de\ufb01nition of disasters to encompass failed or failing states, or regions with a clear democratic de\ufb01cit, initiatives that record human rights abuses in the form of photos, videos and short stories produced by ordinary citizens through mobile devices and PCs are hugely important. The Human Rights Video Hub10, run by WITNESS and Global Voices, is a powerful example. Another is how Nepali citizens used blogs to restore democracy from the disastrous rule of the Monarchy that led to hundreds of deaths and gross human rights abuses.11 Such initiatives - simple yet effective - can help strengthen accountability, expose corruption, help in the restoration of democracy and support governance mechanisms responsive to the needs of citizens.

The growth of high speed internet access in many countries around the world has also resulted in this growth - it is now possible to stream video in real time from many places in the world. This opens up the potential for new perspectives and insights into disasters - instead of one TV crew, we now have a thousand, all of them recording, bearing witness and publishing. New media through ICTs have also given rise to new ways of visualising disasters - activists now use tools such www.vikalpa.org www.groundviews.org http://radio.voicesofpeace.lk Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 85 as Google Earth to highlight the enormity of human tragedy in places such as Darfur.13 Many challenges But is it all good and positive? Put another way, merely because we now have access to a hundred times more content on a disaster than before does not mean that we get any closer to understanding it or responding to it. Information overload is a real problem, as is the subjectivity of citizens, who only capture what they feel is important and often ignore aspects to a disaster beyond their own comfort zone and prejudices. There is still no widely accepted standard for citizen journalists, though organizations such as the Centre for Citizen Media are actively working towards such standards.14 There are other challenges associated with citizen journalism, especially in a context of violent con\ufb02ict. This author receives vicious hate mail, suffers public insults, is branded a \u2018terrorist\u2019 and even receives the occasional death threat \u2013 all because of the content he promotes on the citizen journalism websites he edits. Not all citizens, even when they can do so and have access to digital devices, record disasters or human rights abuses - especially when their own security could be compromised for having done so. Governments can also clamp down hard on citizen journalism. The French Constitutional Council approved a law in early 2007 that criminalizes the \ufb01lming or broadcasting of acts of violence by people other than professional journalists. The law could lead to the imprisonment of eyewitnesses who \ufb01lm acts of police violence, or operators of Web sites publishing the images.15 Sri Lanka unof\ufb01cially banned a pro- Tamil nationalist website16 in 2007 and regularly cuts off mobile phone and Internet services in the North and East of the country.17 Scared by the potential for embarrassment, political debacles and popular uprisings, countries such as Egypt, Iran, Cuba, North Korea and China vigorously censor and monitor content on blogs and exchanges through SMS, prompting Julien Pain, head of the Internet freedom desk at Reporters Without Borders (RSF) to note.18 \u201c\u2026 all authoritarian regimes are now working to censor the Web, even countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The Ethiopian regime of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has blocked openly critical Web sites and blogs since May 2006, and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is considering a law allowing security forces to intercept online messages without reference to the courts. One of the \ufb01rst moves by Thailand\u2019s military rulers after their September (2006) coup was to censor news Web sites, even foreign ones, that criticized the takeover.\u201d It is a signi\ufb01cant challenge for citizen journalists to cover disasters and con\ufb02ict in such contexts. What is essential here is to identify the social and organisational contexts in which the technology is implemented. It is true that the evidence of the use of ICTs in disaster management and early warning is growing.19 It is also true that mobile devices are increasingly powerful because they are pervasive, personal and capable of authoring content.20 However, like any other tool, they can lie unused, used for purposes they were not intended for, misused or only used for personal gain. There is no guarantee that images and photos from disasters produced by victims in the thick of it will galvanise attention and support.

Nalaka Gunawardene TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 88 In the months following the tsunami of December 2004, some believed that it had caught the Indian Ocean rim countries entirely by surprise. This misconception, repeated by governments and aid donors alike, was included even in some independent analyses. While the countries of South and Southeast Asia were largely unprepared to act on the tsunami, the disaster did not entirely arrive as a surprise. As the killer waves originating from the ocean near Indonesia\u2019s Sumatra Island radiated across the Indian Ocean at the speed of a jetliner, the alert about the impending tsunami moved through the Internet at the speed of light. Scientists at the Paci\ufb01c Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) in Hawaii, who had detected the extraordinary seismic activity, issued a local tsunami warning one hour and \ufb01ve minutes after the undersea quake.1 That was a bit too late for Indonesia -\u2013 which, being closest to the quake\u2019s epicentre, was hit soon after the seismic event -\u2013 but it could have made a difference for countries further away, such as India, Sri Lanka and Thailand. As is now well established, an authentic warning was delivered to each country, but there were few listeners at the receiving end -\u2013 and even fewer to act on it. For example, the warning went unheeded by the centres of power in Sri Lanka: no one reacted with the swiftness such information warranted.

There was also a communications failure in sharing an alert across the country. The tsunami progressively pounded the tear drop-shaped island for nearly four hours, starting on the eastern coast at around 8.30 am local time, and then spreading northwards and southwards. If only the rest of the island had been alerted soon after the east was \ufb01rst hit, coastal evacuation could still have signi\ufb01cantly reduced deaths elsewhere.2 But alas, that too did not happen. As a result, over 35,000 people died, most of them needlessly.3 Where were all the ICTs? It was astonishing that a disaster of this magnitude could arrive without any public warning in many places across Asia despite the rapid proliferation of information and communications technologies (ICTs). With thunderous impact, the tsunami drove home the point that the timely and ef\ufb01cient delivery of disaster warnings involves much more than mere technologies. As Sir Arthur C Clarke, author and long-time resident of Sri Lanka, later remarked: \u201cThe Asian tsunami\u2019s death toll could have been drastically reduced if the warning -\u2013 already known to scientists -- was disseminated quickly and effectively to millions of coastal dwellers on the Indian Ocean rim. It is appalling that our sophisticated global communications systems simply failed us that fateful day.\u201d Clarke, best known for inventing the communications satellite, added: \u201cWe need to address the long-term issues of better disaster preparedness, functional early warning systems and realistic arrangements to cope with tsunamis and a multitude of other hazards. It is imperative that we improve our monitoring and early warning systems, but we must also put in place a fail-proof plan to sound the alarm as and when necessary.\u201d4 In response to the Indian Ocean tsunami, the United Nations and aid donor countries embarked on building a high-tech tsunami early warning system in the Indian Ocean. By June 2006, UNESCO \u2013- whose Inter-governmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) coordinated the effort -\u2013 reported that the system was \u2018up and running\u2019. Some 25 new seismographic stations would detect underwater earthquake tremors, it said, while three deep-seabed sensors were in place to detect tsunami waves through tiny changes in water pressure. More equipment, including satellite sensors and additional seabed sensors, are to be added to the system by 2008. A network of 26 national information centres will enable Indian Ocean countries to receive and distribute warnings of potential tsunamis.5 However, all these elaborate arrangements address only part of the challenge. As I wrote in December 2005: \u201cDeveloping effective early warning systems for multiple hazards is an urgent priority for the Indian Ocean rim countries. But setting up a state-of-the-art, high tech and high cost system is not a solution by itself. Because the most advanced early warning system in the world can only do half the job: alert governments and other centres of power (e.g. military) of an impending disaster. The far bigger challenge is to disseminate that warning to large numbers of people spread across vast areas in the shortest possible time.\u201d6 TVEAP image archive HazInfo Project meeting at Sarvodaya Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 89 The crucial question remains: how can we travel that all important \u2018last mile\u2019? Uncertainties and di\ufb03culties Issuing and disseminating public warnings about rapid onset disasters like tsunamis is fraught with uncertainties and practical dif\ufb01culties. This has been underscored by recent experiences in the Indian Ocean rim countries. Two examples: \u2022 On 17 July 2006, a magnitude 7.7 undersea earthquake occurred off the resort town of Pangandaran on Java island in Indonesia. The tremor was detected by various groups of seismologists overseas, and within 17 minutes, the PTWC issued a tsunami warning. That warning reached the Indonesian capital in two minutes by email -- but of\ufb01cials there lacked a proper system to get the warning across to areas at risk in their vast, archipelagic nation. Two-metre high waves hit the southern Java coastline 37 minutes after the quake. A timely public warning and evacuation could have saved many of the nearly 600 people who died.7 \u2022 On 12 September 2007, a magnitude 8.4 earthquake shook western Sumatra with the epicentre located undersea off the city of Bengkulu.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ec2f267f-36d6-493e-b013-4613dc0857f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "ec2f267f-36d6-493e-b013-4613dc0857f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a66ce58b5046ae22dd485c946aa2d04737b5f1dee0c86087463e5f0672b4e377"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e1816a2-ae68-4a34-8ac5-34e879c731ec", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e3eafe3d5f37ea51d7ff3fad41f1e918b2c52052f6c4620729ded1193e383961"}}, "hash": "bfb1a9e70b902b9212b5bc2f861d993e07b68e869e434d7b8a34da28c4e88349", "text": "Following seismic reports, repeated tsunami warnings were issued in Indonesia, as well as in Sri Lanka, but the quake did not produce a tsunami.

One 'ready-made' option for rapidly disseminating disaster warnings in Asia is to use the broadcast media, i.e. radio and television. Since the early 1990s, Asia\u2019s airwaves have become crowded with a cacophony of FM radio and television channels that today reach out to most households day and night. Using the airwaves -\u2013 a public property -- these channels inform, titillate and occasionally educate their audiences. Most channels would willingly carry authentic, of\ufb01cial warnings and other public interest messages in times of crisis, including when a hazard turns into a disaster. Indeed, partnerships with the broadcast media can make a big difference in going the last mile. Yet there are inherent limitations in using radio and TV channels, which are engaged in peddling content and messages mostly in a single direction (from producers or journalists to their audiences). Ordinary radio and TV receivers also cannot receive warnings when they are switched off. As the world grapples with the increasing frequency and intensity of disasters, the search continues for other ways in which life-saving warnings can be delivered quickly, reliably and effectively. Can the potential of ICTs be tapped to augment the broadcast media and of\ufb01cial methods (e.g. police or military communications) in this process? What is the right mix of technology, preparedness and community mobilisation that would help create more disaster resilience at the grassroots? Technology, training, action! These questions were at the heart of a path- breaking initiative implemented in Sri Lanka during 2006-2007. \u2018Evaluating Last Mile Hazard Information Dissemination Project\u2019 (HazInfo project for short) was an action research project by LIRNEasia to \ufb01nd out how communication technology and training can be used to safeguard grassroots communities from disasters. It involved Sarvodaya, Sri Lanka\u2019s largest development organisation, and several other partners that included telecom operators, civil society organisations, IT companies and the media (see box for full list). The research was supported by International Development Research Center (IDRC) of Canada. TVEAP image archive Dr Rohan Samarajiva, Executive Director, LIRNEasia Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 90 The project studied which ICTs and community mobilisation methods could work effectively in disseminating information on hazards faced by selected coastal communities. The exercise was not con\ufb01ned to tsunamis alone; other rapid onset disasters such as cyclones and \ufb02oods were also covered. The project grew out of a participatory concept paper that LIRNEasia developed in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami.9 It noted that a national early warning system was a \u2018pure public good\u2019, and the responsibility of its supply would normally fall on the government. However, the paper acknowledged that, due to lack of capacity, \u201cit is unlikely that the last mile of such a system will be provided by the local government or private \ufb01rms operating in the marketplace\u201d.

This voluntary responsibility was assigned to local level Sarvodaya leaders. \u2022 Based on a participatory hazard mapping process, each community prepared a plan on how to respond to such an alert or warning. This included identifying vulnerabilities, demarcating evacuation routes and designating safe locations for community members to assemble after evacuation. \u2022 Communities also decided on the most effective ways for locally communicating a disaster warning they would receive: choices ranged from runners and loud-speakers to temple bells. \u2022 To assess how all these factors blend together, hazard warning simulations (which included evacuation drills) were conducted in each participating village. TVEAP image archive Dr Vinya Ariyaratne, Executive Director, Sarvodaya Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 91 Relay and ampli\ufb01cation The result of these interventions was not a traditional warning system that is usually used by governments but a community-based model used for alert and noti\ufb01cation, emphasizes Dr Rohan Samarajiva, Executive Director of LIRNEasia. He adds: \u201cThis is not in any way, shape or form a public warning system that lots of people talk about. When you talk about a community-based warning system, we are not talking about reaching every member of the community. We are talking about a representative of the community, a designated \u2018\ufb01rst responder\u2019.\u201d The research component of the project involved evaluating factors that contribute to effective last mile hazard information dissemination. These included the reliability and effectiveness of various ICTs; how training and the level of organisational development in a village in\ufb02uence community responses; and how women participated in these exercises. To transmit information from the hub to the grassroots, \ufb01ve ICT tools in eight combinations were tested out in the participating villages. The tools were: \u2022 Fixed telephones (using wireless CDMA technology) \u2022 Java enabled mobile phones customised to carry text alerts in English, Sinhala and Tamil \u2022 Very Small Aperture Satellite Terminals (VSATs) \u2022 Addressable Radios for Emergency Alerts (AREA), developed by the WorldSpace Corporation (which this project was the \ufb01rst to \ufb01eld test) \u2022 A remote alarm device (RAD) developed by Dialog Telekom and University of Moratuwa. It was akin to running a relay \u2013 from the Hub to the \ufb01rst responders, and from them to the communities at risk. Speed and accuracy were of essence at each step of the transmission. The HazInfo project was among the \ufb01rst in the world to apply the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP), an international standard method to exchange emergency alerts and public warnings among different alerting technologies.10 CAP helps standardise the collection and relaying of hazard warnings and reports locally, nationally and regionally for input into a variety of dissemination systems. LIRNEasia analysed how each ICT tool or combination was integrated into communities to deliver timely warnings to those designated as \ufb01rst responders. The factors needed for ef\ufb01cient functioning of the hazard information hub were also studied.11 The front-runner was AREA combined with \ufb01xed or mobile phones. Under normal circumstances, AREA works as a radio, receiving digital radio transmissions from WorldSpace satellites in geosynchronous orbit. But they can be switched on remotely from a central location, whether or not the user has turned it on at that moment, converting them instantly into a hazard alert system. Each radio has an in-built Global Positioning System (GPS) and a unique code. This enables hazard warnings to be issued to only those units known to be within a vulnerable area -- or just to those units with speci\ufb01c assigned codes.12 Mobile and \ufb01xed phones, on their own, were also found to be reliable, although having two communication technologies ensured at least one would work at critical moments. AREA and RAD units also worked well as a combination. For tsunami-affected communities anxious to safeguard themselves from future disasters, communication technologies epitomised reliability and dependability, says Dr Samarajiva.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62a70b2f-aa70-4b5f-95a5-cf87bc47b4a9": {"__data__": {"id_": "62a70b2f-aa70-4b5f-95a5-cf87bc47b4a9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "401f7b8875df4c55f4a2bef57e96eee1dcfe3c799769f0c9687a77073578ab00"}, "2": {"node_id": "e849f591-8bf0-4a67-a413-e8888ef2db52", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "051fe6ae4e2a9653c095e9c21bc7b87ff3cdff13fc3728ce4ad61ed2787eb296"}}, "hash": "c50eac064ae1d5aa24a551427412ae8b02661cd6be7e9e7b6e9c31817b08ad27", "text": "\u201cIf you don\u2019t have the technology, if you don\u2019t have the assurance and the trust that is built up over time that the messages will be reliable, they will come rain or shine, they will come in the middle of the night when I\u2019m sleeping, they will come in the middle of the day when my husband is not here.

Gender and Disasters: Tracing the Link What\u2019s gender got to do with disasters if Nature is indiscriminate in unleashing her fury on men and women? South Asia\u2019s experience goes against this perception. Disasters impact the human constructed society where gender relations are a key determinant in who is a\ufb00ected and how the rest of the world perceives and responds to calamities.

Why should the media concentrate on the women?\u201d1 Anticipating just such a reaction to my presentation on some of the missing links in media coverage of the tsunami at a workshop on 8 January 2005, I \ufb02agged the doubt myself: \u201cIt may seem irrelevant to raise the question of gender awareness in the context of media coverage of a natural disaster such as this one, which obviously affected those who happened to be in the path of the massive waves -- men, women and children. Can there possibly be a gender angle to the tsunami story? Is it at all reasonable to call for a gender perspective while covering the post-tsunami situation?\u201d2 It was not long before it became abundantly clear that gender was indeed a critical factor in the tragedy, as well as in the relief, recovery and rehabilitation process that followed.3 For example, there is substantial evidence that more women than men died when the killer waves engulfed the shores. Most of the reasons cited for the apparently higher female death toll have everything to do with gender as manifested in many of the affected countries. For instance, women\u2019s restrictive clothes, their customary inability to swim or climb trees, and their conventional roles as mothers and care-givers.

Iqbal Ahmed/DrikNEWS/Majority World Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 95 There were also early reports of molestation and rape at some relief camps, of traf\ufb01cking in women and girls, and of adolescent girls being made to marry older men who had lost their wives in the calamity. Special needs At another level, the special needs and concerns of women and girls \u2013 such as inner wear and sanitary napkins, accessible toilets with adequate water, reproductive and maternal health care, female health workers, safety and privacy -- were often forgotten in relief efforts. Many women also found themselves left out in the distribution of relief money and material, thanks to traditional notions about heads of families or breadwinners. Single women \u2013 including female heads of households -- were particularly vulnerable, especially if they did not have adult sons. In the rehabilitation and reconstruction phase, too, women were disadvantaged, especially with regard to the restoration of means of livelihood. With the plight of \ufb01shermen, and their losses in terms of assets like boats and nets, occupying centre-stage, little attention was paid to other economic activities in coastal areas, including those involving women. In addition, the \u201cproperty-owner centric\u201d approach that generally characterised rehabilitation packages came under criticism for ignoring the needs of people from the \ufb01shing and farming communities who do not own boats, nets, land or shops but do contribute their labour and skills to the coastal economy. Under the circumstances women -- who traditionally form a major section of the informal or unorganised sector of labour and who rarely own property \u2013 were rendered doubly invisible, with their economic activities, losses, and needs by and large unaccounted for. The consequent neglect of women\u2019s livelihood needs was obviously catastrophic for a large number of families, especially among the poor, because women are often their sole earners or sources of support. And, in any case, women\u2019s earnings tend to go directly towards meeting the basic needs of their families, while a signi\ufb01cant portion of many men\u2019s earnings is frequently spent on personal habits such as drinking, smoking, and gambling.

Unequal in death So, yes, people died -- not just women. People suffered, succumbed, survived, recovered, rebuilt -- not just women.

Yet, despite the well-documented gender differences in the impact of disasters, and despite the fact that women and children constitute the majority of victims seen in the media\u2019s representation of disasters -- natural and otherwise -- media coverage of recurring disasters across the world continues to be, by and large, gender- blind.

It was about the conversion of an abandoned movie theatre in Islamabad into a women\u2019s hospital catering to the needs of the large number of women who sustained spinal injuries in the disaster. A doctor attending to the severely injured in the makeshift medical centre said that 90 per cent of the patients he had seen were girls and women. Most were paraplegics.14 The fact that most of the patients with spinal injuries were women is attributed primarily to gender-related roles and restrictions. The future of these women, too, will in all likelihood be determined by gender. Unable to walk and, in many cases, to control their bladders or bowels, they may require constant care for the rest of their lives. Under the circumstances, the married ones lived in fear of being abandoned by their husbands and the single ones knew their chances of marriage were virtually non-existent. The attending doctor was obviously concerned about what would happen to his patients after they left the hospital. \u201cThis society is cruel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will be out on the streets unless they can get a skill and become independent. A young woman who does not walk, who has no control over her bladder, has no real chance in this society.\u201d15 Paraplegics were not the only ones facing a bleak future.

Wherever they hit, pre-existing structures and social conditions determine that some members of the community will be less affected while others will pay a higher price. Among the differences that determine how people are affected by such disasters is that of gender.\u201d19 The media need to recognise more fully that even \u201chard news\u201d coverage, including the reporting of disasters, can actually bene\ufb01t from gender consciousness. By focussing attention on the inevitable social consequences of \u201cnatural\u201d calamities, the media can alert both communities and the authorities to the impact of the event on different sections of the affected population, including various categories of women, and highlight the importance of taking their experiences, opinions, needs and resources into account in the relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction process. The bonus is that the special stories resulting from gender awareness not only serve a valuable purpose in the aftermath of such events, but they are also likely to stand out as more memorable than many others in the customary media blitz that generally follows.

If few of them make it to the mainstream media it is because gender awareness is still missing in many newsrooms. There is, today, no dearth of sources and resources that can be tapped to \ufb01gure out whether or not an event or process has any special implications for women, including different categories of women, as well as other vulnerable sections of society whose voices are not commonly heard in the media.20 It\u2019s just a question of looking for them \u2013 and even that is not dif\ufb01cult, especially in the present era of the Internet. The bottom line is that unless gender is acknowledged as one of several factors that affect people\u2019s experience of almost everything, and accepted as one of the \u201cangles\u201d to be explored while covering anything, the media will continue to tell only part of the story \u2013 whatever that story may be.

Sri Lanka. Communication is one of four necessary steps towards recovery. Survivors need to maintain communication with family, friends and counsellors in order to share their experiences. They need to tell their stories about the disaster, and listen to others as they tell theirs. Chin Saik Yoon Shahidul Alam/Drik/Majority World Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 102 in order to share their experiences. They need to tell their stories about the disaster, and listen to others as they tell theirs. This helps survivors to collectively release their stress. Participatory communication processes work best here. This is where survivors assume the role of both the \u201cinitiator\u201d as well as the \u201creceiver\u201d of communication. No expert or government of\ufb01cial should be there to decide what is to be discussed by the survivors. They need only facilitate the process. The participatory processes ensure that communication occurs at the pace that communities are comfortable with and address issues only when survivors are ready to deal with them. Communication is also vital in rebuilding efforts when communities are mobilised to plan, execute, and evaluate reconstruction programmes. An important part of these programmes will need to focus on reviving core social elements that make up communities. These elements are as vital as, if not more important than, the infrastructure; in the absence of socially connected survivors, physical and hardware components alone will not lead to the rebirth of viable communities. What is worst, if such infrastructure is rebuilt without the active participation of the people in their planning, it may contribute to the disintegration rather than re- integration of communities. Survivors recover from disasters in the isolation of what is left of their communities. Their rebuilding begins far away from the gaze of the mass media. Often within alien environments created by relief shelters. And usually forgotten by media audiences who had once taken a keen interest in the survivors\u2019 plight. During the months and years of anguish that follow a disaster, survivors have to cope with anger, grief, homelessness, isolation, shame, physical and emotional pain, and despair. They often do this alone. In most instances, they are disconnected from social and communication networks that are at best temporarily disrupted or at worst permanently impaired. The revival of these networks is given low priority by most relief agencies \u2013 there is always the greater urgency to tackle the tangible \u2013 even though most survivors grieve more deeply for their intangible losses. Relief agencies must come round to see that their mission to heal these broken hearts and calm their anguished minds is just as urgent. Reconnecting and rebuilding Communication is one of four necessary steps towards recovery.1 Survivors need to maintain communication with family, friends, and counsellors (Left) Sri Lankan Theeban survived the tsunami but not its cruel aftermath.

What matters most of all is the people\u2019s active participation in deciding what needs to be communicated, by whom, to whom, using which channels, and for what purpose.

The immediate aftermath Notices of the missing One of the most vivid examples of participatory media in the immediate aftermath of recent disasters is the spontaneous posting of missing-people notices by family members, colleagues and friends. We saw this outside the hospitals in the areas struck by the Asian Tsunami and around the site of The World Trade Center in New York City during the days after September 11, 2001. The notices invariably carry a photograph of the missing person, his or her name, a short description including what clothes they were last seen wearing, and the contact telephone number or address of the people looking for the missing person. The notices are often photocopied and posted at vantage points where they stand the best chances of being seen and read. These include the site of the disaster, major intersections, outside hospitals and police stations, and public venues such as bus and train stations, food stores, and cafes. Jonathan Perugia, a Jakarta-based photographer, found such notices plastered everywhere in Banda Aceh when he arrived soon after the tsunami. He has photographed these notices and mounted them online as a gallery at the Christian Aid website. Looking for the missing in Acheh Jonathan Perugia, a Jakarta-based photographer, digitised and mounted on a website notices about people missing after the tsunami. This is what he said about the notices he photographed at the website: Normally the dead and the missing are faceless. I found it poignant to see these pictures of missing people posted all over town\u2026. These photocopies of family portraits, of special or even mundane moments in ordinary lives, become a unique memorial which emphasises the tsunami in a more personal way than pictures of dead bodies and destruction ever can\u2026. When you approach the display, you get a sense of anonymity. Then you step forward, and see people\u2019s eyes and expressions. When I \ufb01rst started taking the pictures, I imagined them displayed like this, in a way that gives a sense of the sheer number of victims\u2026 then you step closer and get a sense of who they were. It\u2019s a similar feeling to that I had when I saw the photos of Khmer Rouge victims in Phnom Penh: a simultaneous sense of the anonymity of death, and the personalities of the dead\u2026. TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 104 Perugia\u2019s efforts at photographing and then mounting the images at a website are a good example of what communicators can do to facilitate this participatory process. Since nternet access will probably be unavailable in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, copies of such webpages may be distributed on compact discs (CDs) and made available to disaster relief centres where they may help in either the happy process of reuniting dispersed family members or the sad task of identifying the dead. Agencies at the scene of the disaster should support this spontaneous and participatory form of communication by making available wall space for the posting of the notices. The notices should be allowed to stay on display until recovery efforts are well- established and effective documentation processes for reporting the missing have been established for and accepted by the people. The notices may then be removed and disposed of in a manner that is respectful of the dead who may be featured among the collection of notices. The notices may either be stored for photography, or scanning, at a later date to create a database similar to that built by Perugia, or disposed of in a culturally acceptable manner, such as burning them at a temple compound set aside for funereal rituals. Websites and databases for reporting the missing should include text that is searchable. It should ideally include the names of the missing, descriptions of their appearance, including their ages, height and weight, and what they were wearing at the time of the disaster, and where they may have been at that time. Such information will help make the webpages a searchable database which disaster-relief agencies can use ef\ufb01ciently. I saw another striking use of the internet during the \ufb02ooding and destruction of many parts of New Orleans when hurricane Katrina struck the city. I started to monitor the website http://www.nola.com closely2, starting when the storm was a couple of hours away from coming ashore, and then tracked its consequences when it roared across the city.

The newspaper\u2019s website had been designed early on with the facility for readers to post online their comments about stories from around the New Orleans metropolitan area. But, as the storm struck and internet access and public utilities was lost across the city, this interactive facility became one of less than a handful of communication channels for relatives and friends of those living in the city to post their messages online for disaster relief agencies to respond to. As the levees of the city were breached, some of the most heart-wrenching messages which were posted online at this website were from people living outside New Orleans but who had elderly relatives living alone in the affected areas. Desperate pleas were made online for relief agencies to go to the homes of these helpless elderly victims to rescue them from their homes which were been drowned in quickly rising \ufb02ood waters. These pleas were largely not responded to as search- and-rescue operations for the disaster had unravelled by then. Relief agencies planning for future disasters should plan on plugging into such spontaneous channels of communication from relatives and friends of victims. A practical way of doing this may be to link such interactive messaging facilities to a larger disaster-relief website where volunteers appearing on scene (as part of the \u201cconvergence\u201d described below) may respond to the messages by posting their intentions to act on particular requests for assistance so that others need not duplicate rescue efforts. The convergence The mass gathering of people at the site of a disaster, and the despatch of relief supplies (particularly food, clothing and medicine) is a phenomenon that was \ufb01rst recognised about \ufb01ve decades ago by researchers. It is both welcomed and feared by agencies responsible for disaster management. People are driven by a variety of intentions to converge on a disaster scene. Two researchers3 interviewed people met at \u201cground-zero\u201d soon after the attacks on The World Trade Center on September 11 to \ufb01nd out why they were there. The researchers found that an important group of people within the convergence were anxious relatives, friends and colleagues of people working or living at the site of the disaster, they were there to con\ufb01rm the well being of their loved ones. The second group of people comprised volunteers with good intentions to provide assistance to the injured and others affected by the disaster. As time passed a third group of people came to the site, they were \u201cthe curious\u201d who just wanted to have a \ufb01rst-hand look at the scene of the disaster. They were quickly joined by the fourth group \u2013 \u201cthe supporters\u201d \u2013 who were touched by the noble efforts of Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 105 the rescue workers and were there to acknowledge their work and to cheer them on. In the case of the World Trade Center disaster scene in New York, the convergence proved to be a headache for the authorities who were trying to both secure the site as well as better organise search-and-rescue efforts; all the while apprehensive of follow-up attacks. Security personnel were, for example, deeply concerned that the food and beverages being handed out to rescue personnel by people converging on the site may not have been safe for consumption and could provide the means for a second attack on the site. The rescue workers themselves were distracted by people setting up barbeque pits to cook food for them and unintentionally adding an inappropriately festive touch to their grim mission. The concerns about convergence stemmed mainly from disasters occurring in urban areas of developed countries where the politics and dynamics of the disasters gave rise to adequate reasons for apprehension. In the case of the developing countries, and especially in the immediate aftermath of the Asian tsunami, convergence may be viewed largely as positive. In many isolated and less developed areas, it was the people, NGOs and other civic groups volunteering their help and contributing their own food, clothing, medicine and rescue equipment that were the \ufb01rst on the scene of disasters. In many cases they were the main responders. Many survivors would have suffered greater trauma if not for convergence. Many disaster agencies now accept that convergence needs to be included in disaster mitigation planning. The apprehensions that the agencies may have for the phenomenon may be addressed by putting in place communication and information programmes where efforts and movements of the people and groups forming the convergence may be coordinated. This may comprise a decentralised system where well-established \ufb01rst responders, such as", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2599701f-47a5-4f8b-8765-9a8ad9a1c4ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "2599701f-47a5-4f8b-8765-9a8ad9a1c4ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4a6987abed4d986049e502ca6777a3811ed7f22fe726a76593775998059edacc"}}, "hash": "4a6987abed4d986049e502ca6777a3811ed7f22fe726a76593775998059edacc", "text": "the Red Cross and Red Crescent, community organisations and religious congregations are networked, so that they, in turn, can help to coordinate other groups of people who spontaneously offer their assistance when a disaster strikes.

Shahidul Alam/Drik/Majority World Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 106 The internet is an excellent channel for networking civic groups. If the disaster has not cut off Web access, the coordinators can make use of a website to announce the help that is required and make use of simple interactive facilities to invite individuals and groups interested in responding to the disaster to describe what they are mobilizing to contribute towards search-and-rescue and recovery efforts. The quickest channel may be via an email address announced over radio and television. A quick and effective way of establishing an interactive online service is by signing on to any of the free blogging websites and creating a blogsite. The blog that is established for this purpose may be setup to allow posting of \u201ccomments\u201d which in effect enables all visitors to communicate with each other via a central website. The main advantage of using one of the large blogging service providers is that they tend to be operated by well-equipped internet companies that run servers on fast telecommunication links that will be able to handle sudden spikes in visitors to a particular blogsite. The demands of thousands of people trying to access the same website at the same time can quickly crash the computer systems of smaller service providers. In disasters where internet-access and electricity supply are disrupted, coordinators should make use of the broadcast media to suggest that volunteers head towards designated staging areas. Radio is potentially the most effective medium. Many volunteers would probably carry one with them or have a car radio installed on the vehicles they are travelling in, as they head towards the scene of the disaster. The staging area should be equipped with large boards or wall spaces on which are pinned charts showing the priority needs of victims and survivors, and maps of where they are located. Volunteers should be encouraged to sign up on the charts against the areas they are heading for to render their help. This will announce to other volunteers which areas have yet to be responded to and where they should focus on. Coordinators should also hold regular meetings of representatives from various groups of volunteers. These meetings should be as brief as possible as volunteers will be eager to get to the scene of disaster quickly and to avoid what they will consider cumbersome bureaucracy. The meetings will allow coordinators to provide volunteers with pertinent information about the different sites and to allow the volunteers to announce their intentions and contributions. The aim is not perfect coordination, but to prevent counter-productive chaos caused by different groups of people setting off on their own aimlessly. The other important aim of routing volunteers through staging areas is to ensure that communication processes are established between them and the coordinators. Volunteers should be encouraged to report back from the scene of the disaster, especially if they are the \ufb01rst responders, so that a clearer picture of the scene of the disaster may be mapped. This will, in turn, help the authorities mobilise suf\ufb01cient resources to meet the needs of the injured and survivors. Reviving communities The necessity for facilitating participatory communication processes increases after search- and-rescue efforts have been completed. At this point emergency services withdraw and planning begins for the long-term recovery of affected communities. The plans that are to be implemented will enjoy a higher probability of success if they are prepared in a participatory manner, involving members of the community that they serve. The \ufb01rst and most daunting challenge that faces facilitators of such a planning process is that community ties may have been seriously fractured. Social groups and organisations that facilitators may have chosen to work with in normal conditions may no longer exist. The facilitators\u2019 \ufb01rst task is to revive fractured social networks, help form new groups, and motivate the people to work together in communal efforts to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c8efd44-125f-4c1e-a383-097335baa2a3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c8efd44-125f-4c1e-a383-097335baa2a3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f955eca2bed95e115db22f631e1563d03cadbf493b6622c21feedb8e3f20fa18"}, "3": {"node_id": "d8dfb99d-435a-4187-a464-3d3d45c04065", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9b525e5f2eb9e99290a66a2db7386498174907894e3bb37af91a1554d0b4d1e2"}}, "hash": "cef66323a0460d8630460ff6fecfff2a98cf649b212418635372e94341304186", "text": "rebuild. Participation does not always come naturally to groups of people. This is especially the case in communities that have previously been organised in a top-down manner with a few elites dictating a community\u2019s agenda. Indonesian teenager Yenni in the weeks after the tsunami Jungle Run Productions, TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 107 It is useful to help these groups learn about participatory methods by \ufb01rst addressing simple and routine issues such as arrangements for providing temporary food, shelter, water, security, and medical services. In this way they learn to work together and build trust in the groups and the processes. Facilitators may also propose the formation of a special group which will focus on the search for missing members of the community. Women from the communities should be actively involved in managing groups responsible for a community\u2019s logistics. Experience has shown that women often make better managers than men in organising communal logistics. The involvement of the women will also ensure that the interests of children are better represented in decision-making. It will also ensure that security issues for women are not overlooked; this is particularly important as numerous reports were received of women being abused in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami. Facilitators should be aware that although the principles of participation are sound and worthy of pursuit they can be fraught with dif\ufb01culties. The \ufb01rst of these is con\ufb02ict that may arise among members and between sub-groups. Such con\ufb02ict is often due to competing interests and allegiances. Facilitators should be ready and trained to help the groups resolve them. Successful resolution and management of such con\ufb02icts will help the community build trust in the process. Community members themselves need time to learn to resolve their disagreements and learn how to build consensus; facilitators will therefore \ufb01nd it useful to begin with the simpler issues described above, that tend to cause less intense disagreements and are easier to resolve. It is only after the groups have grown more con\ufb01dent of working together as a community that facilitators help to introduce the more complex and potentially more contentious process of planning for the long-term rebuilding of the community. Experienced facilitators will be able to introduce survivor groups to a number of participatory communication methods that may be applied towards building consensus on a communal plan for the future. You can obtain tips at the website http://www.southbound.com.my/vipp which is published by the community of practice of the VIPP (Visualization in Participatory Programmes) process. VIPP has been successfully applied by the UNICEF (United Nations Children\u2019s Fund) in different participatory activities and especially those involving women and children who are illiterate. Keeping survivors informed Survivors have an urgent need for information to regain some sense of control and normalcy in their lives. Getting information to them is dif\ufb01cult, as most channels of mass communication will have been disrupted within a disaster site. A quick method of restoring some news \ufb02ow at relief shelters and other affected sites is by organising small editorial groups to begin the publication of wall-newspapers. Young literate men and women are probably the best people to mobilise for this task. Wall-newspapers are simple notices pasted on a wall at a location where people congregate or pass daily. This may be the wall of a tent where food is distributed or a location at an intersection. It is important that the wall is sheltered from rain and wind. The newspaper may be organised into departments that re\ufb02ect the priority needs of the survivors. These may be: food and water, medical services, missing people, search and rescue, accommodation, clothing and supplies, funeral and religious events, government disaster relief announcements, women and children services, temporary schools, and eventually entertainment programmes. All government and relief agencies working at the site should make it a point to post a copy of all their public announcements at the wall-newspapers. The role of the editorial group is to post news, comments and appeals from members of the communities. They will also translate notices posted by relief agencies into the local language.

As time progresses and the community settles down to a calmer routine, relief agencies may wish to strengthen the production of wall-newspapers with a basic desktop-publishing system and supplies. This should include a digital camera so that images may be added to the postings. This digital system should also enable the newspapers to be posted to a website so that relatives and friends, and relief agencies located at a distance from the site can keep in touch with the community. Desktop-publishing arrangements will also allow local editions of wall newspapers to be shared among neighbouring communities. Such sharing is particularly important for notices about missing people. The editorial groups should be aware that many members of the community may not be able to read the postings on the wall. Members of poorer communities and women, who may be facing greater distress than other survivors, may not be able to obtain important information off the walls due to their higher illiteracy rates. The editorial groups should arrange for periodic public readings of the most important recent postings so that the illiterate members of the community can receive this information. The \u201creaders\u201d should also help the illiterate members present at these sessions to write and post their comments on to the wall. Cultural competencies of external communicators A global disaster relief network has evolved in the past decades, managed by highly competent groups that are able to mobilise at short notices and promptly ship their material and rescuers to even remote locations. This has developed disaster response into complex efforts involving people from a diverse mix of cultures and training. At the same time, these international groups have grown more sensitive to the importance of their cultural competencies when working in disaster scenes located at a distance from their base. This competency is not only important for the international groups but also for groups and individuals responding to events within their own countries. Development Respecting the people\u2019s culture The following characteristics of a community make up its culture: \u2022 Traditions, customs, rituals \u2022 Language \u2022 Age \u2022 Gender \u2022 Religious beliefs \u2022 Political beliefs \u2022 Family values \u2022 Goals in life \u2022 Socioeconomic status \u2022 Education level \u2022 Geographic location \u2022 Family and household makeup Communicators working away from home at a \u201cforeign\u201d site of a disaster need to be keenly aware that communities differ greatly in how they think of life and death. They grief and mourn in their own ways the lost of loved ones, and the destruction of their homesteads and traditional burial grounds. A large group of relief workers from \u201cthe outside\u201d working within a community can easily overwhelm a community, especially when they have been left weakened and fractured by a disaster. Communicators should therefore always seek advice from local leaders and knowledgeable individuals when planning and executing their programmes. This is particularly important in the case of participatory processes where the over-arching intention is to facilitate the articulation of local intentions and restoration of identity. One of the most controversial episodes to occur after the Asian tsunami was the conversion of signi\ufb01cant numbers of communities in some affected areas to the religion of the group of volunteers which had been active in relief work among them. The conversion troubled members of the communities, and many people in neighbouring villages who were struggling to rebuild and to regroup. It also caused concern among other relief groups who felt that an unfortunate case of \u201ccultural destruction\u201d had been committed by a group of their peers. Cultural destructiveness is characterized by organizations or individuals who view cultural differences as a problem and undertake activities that purposely attempt to destroy a culture to achieve what they consider to a be a more desirable replacement.4 communicators have long appreciated how cultural diversity within countries, and between city-dwellers and villagers in the rural hinterland, affects effective and meaningful communication especially in critical issues relating to life and death. Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 109 Remembering disasters Remembering a disaster and the people lost to it enables survivors to move on. It also helps to prevent the recurrence of a similar disaster, or minimising its impact if it cannot be prevented from happening again.

They had all sensed danger when they saw the sea retreating before the tsunami hit and had rushed to higher ground. Their sense of ill boding was triggered by a Moken legend about \u201cThe Seven Waves\u201d that had been passed down from generation to generation. It had long been recited around camp\ufb01res and accurately described what had happened when the Asian tsunami hit. In the legend, the Moken called the tsunami the \u201cLaboon\u201d or \u201cthe wave that eats people\u201d. They believed it was caused by the angry spirits of their ancestors. The source of the legend is unclear but it was very likely based on the remembrance of a tsunami that had affected the ancestors of the Moken people centuries ago, and was so traumatic that it was not only etched into the oral history of the community but also its sea-faring culture. A different, but just as inspiring, example of an urbanized community remembering a disaster may be found in San Francisco. The Interfaith AIDS Memorial Chapel is \u201ca space for remembrance and celebration\u201d of the lives of the thousands who have died. Set on one of its wall are brass symbols representing the religions of the world. The chapel has two focal points. One is provided by a triptych created by internationally renowned artist Keith Haring who \ufb01nished it two weeks before he himself died from AIDS. On the opposite side of the chapel, hanging from the ceiling, is a panel from the AIDS Memorial Quilt which is changed on a regular basis. Each panel is sewn together from smaller pieces of quilt hand-made by family members, lovers and friends of people who had died from AIDS. Sewing the quilt has helped many people recover from losing their loved ones. It also serves to remind everyone who passes by the chapel and enters the cathedral the continuing threats posed by AIDS.

The location was selected so that people who are uncomfortable about attending church may avoid walking through the cathedral to get to the chapel. Symbols recognising various faiths adorn two pillars \ufb02anking the famous altar-piece by Keith Haring. Visitors tend to spend the most time standing under a panel of the AIDS Memorial Quilt (http://www.aidsquilt.org) reading obituaries of the people being remembered. Each panel comprises eight smaller three-by-six-foot pieces of quilt hand-sewn by the loved ones of people who had died from AIDS. Each of these pieces is poignant with its often bitter-sweet remembrances. They frequently include an item of clothing of the person being remembered. The quilt project is itself a good example of a participatory communication initiative that has succeeded in not only remembering those who died from AIDS but also in increasing awareness among people about HIV and AIDS. It began in June 1987, when a small group of strangers gathered in front of a shop in San Francisco to document the lives of their loved ones who had died; fearful that they will be forgotten. They wanted to create a memorial for those who had died of AIDS, and at the same time to help people understand the devastating impact of the disease. That meeting of devoted friends and lovers eventually led to the launching of the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt across the United States. The Quilt today is a powerful visual reminder of the AIDS pandemic. More than 44,000 individual three-by-six-foot memorial panels have been sewn by friends, lovers and family members of those who have died.

Ours was a closely-knit community. Most families had lived there for generations. My family was exceptional: they had arrived recently, but were assimilated fairly easily. The formal leadership came from the village headman, who was respected by everyone. The headmanship had been in his family for several generations. The chief monk of the village temple was another cohesive factor. When a family had an illness or some other problem, the chief monk was sure to visit. Informal leadership arose depending on the occasion. An alms-giving always brought out an \u2018expert group\u2019 for the event\u2019s arrangement.

With these factors in place and in harmony, it was not dif\ufb01cult to achieve the critical mass needed to move an idea into action in our village community. Things have changed considerably in the past 50 years. I imagine communities like the one from my childhood still exist. But more often than not, the factors supportive of community action have been in decline. This is more noticeable in the urban and semi-urban communities. There may be many reasons as to why this has happened, which needs separate discussion. The fact is: bringing a community together has now become a daunting task.

It was as if the building of disaster resilience in their communities was not reward enough. Yet, when a disaster strikes, the \ufb01rst responders are almost always from the neighbourhood. This was most visible after the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 2004. Together, we are safe\u2026 Building disaster resilience calls for a community\u2019s participation for an anticipated future event. That is where the critical mass becomes crucial. When that is missing, it becomes necessary to intervene from outside the community. The availability of funds from beyond the community is also an important factor. With it comes the challenge of communicating to the community. It is dif\ufb01cult for outsiders to move in and quickly establish trust and credibility with a community. It is much more effective to align with an existing leadership. Alternatively, staying and working in the community for a period of time can build relationships and trust. In the aftermath of the tsunami, the Sri Lankan government\u2019s Disaster Management Center (DMC) introduced a mechanism where members of the armed forces were deployed as District Disaster Management Coordination Units. These were attached to the District Secretariats (the civil administration at district level) in nine out of 25 administrative districts. Walking amongst the people without \ufb01rearms and initially trying to create awareness in the communities and schools about hazards and disasters, these of\ufb01cers soon gained visibility. Sri Lanka has a tradition of the armed forces and the Police being deployed to provide disaster relief. This had built up goodwill over the years. This visibility and recognition were important to the success of evacuation drills and other work they conducted to create disaster resilience in coastal communities. This is also the experience in other parts of the Asian region. For example, the Asian Urban Disaster Mitigation Programme (AUDMP) of the Bangkok-based Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) carried out several community based \ufb02ood mitigation projects in Bangladesh during the late 1990s. Key to the success in these predominantly Muslim communities was the involvement of Muslim religious leaders in communicating messages. In one project, where a school was made \ufb02ood proof, it was the school principal who provided leadership. In \ufb02ood proo\ufb01ng the school, which was on high ground, a drain was constructed to carry the rain water away. The surrounding area of the school, whose \ufb02ooding prevented access to the school, was mud-packed to raise the ground above \ufb02ood level. AUDMP has conducted risk mitigation projects in other countries. In Katmandu, Nepal, a project looked at enhancing school safety from earthquakes. There, the work was carried out by an NGO called NSET-Nepal. The \ufb01rst step was creating awareness about the risk faced and the safety measures that could be adopted. The school buildings were strengthened using reinforcement, minimizing their collapse during an earthquake. Parents, teachers and students volunteered labour in this process, known as retro\ufb01tting. Some parents were masons Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 113 who had specialized skills. The cement, metal and steel were donated by local vendors. In some cases, the children walked from house to house singing and dancing to collect money. Technical know-how was provided by NSET-Nepal and their partner, Geo Hazard International. The project\u2019s focus on the safety of school children established credibility in the community. Lesson one: risk communication must be followed by speci\ufb01c action which will consolidate a community\u2019s trust. Of course, the ground reality and social dynamics can vary from community to community. Back in Sri Lanka, DMC is working with several landslide prone communities within Ratnapura district. The residents were owners of small-scale tea holdings. Their income was good. Due to the apparent vulnerability, they had been advised to relocate but were not given acceptable alternatives. They wanted to stay on and risk death in the event of a landslide rather than relocate and lose their income. The people were skeptic at the beginning which was apparently based on past experience. Various outsiders had visited the community with good intentions, discussed their vulnerability and promised solutions. But none had come back. The people felt cheated, and it took much effort to convince them to join in participatory work and \ufb01nd possible solutions.

This work is beginning to show results. During a series of landslides that occurred in late 2006, several communities warned by these tell-tale signs evacuated their homes just in time, saving many lives. Lesson two: successful community action can catalyse other communities to adopt similar preventive measures and safe behaviour before disasters strike. When a community intervention is facilitated by an outside entity which brings in the funding, there is always the danger of losing momentum when outsiders withdraw. Sustainability comes with ownership of the intervention by the community. In early 2000, the Sri Lanka Urban Multi-hazard Disaster Mitigation Project (SLUMDMP), a project under AUDMP in Sri Lanka, undertook a drought mitigation initiative in Aarachchikattuwa, in the north-western part of the island. An irrigation reservoir (\u2018tank\u2019), called Medawewa, which stored water for farming, had breached in 1975 and gone into disrepair. SLUMDMP agreed to provide funds to rebuild the breached dam and the sluice gate, but the people donated their labour to clear the tank bed that had been overgrown by thicket. The local government provided the heavy machinery to dredge the tank bed. Leadership came from the Chairman of the local Farmers\u2019 Association. Sense of ownership As it turned out, not everyone was convinced. Past efforts to repair the damaged tank had \ufb02opped for 25 years, demoralizing some people. Volunteers were initially jeered by some members of the community. The Chairman of the Farmers\u2019 Association was persuasive enough to keep the volunteers going. When the rehabilitation was completed, the community united in its celebration. Later I visited this community with the manager of SLUMDMP. The area was experiencing heavy rains. We wanted to monitor the sturdiness of the repaired dam and sluice gate. Water in the tank was close to spilling level. We found several villagers at the sluice gate. They had come to open the sluice gate to let out part of the water to ensure that the tank would not breach again due to water pressure. They found that the sluice gate was blocked and dived into the water to remove several logs. This monitoring had become routine during rains. This was convincing evidence for a strong sense of ownership of the project by the community. Not every project is so successful. There is no single recipe for success in building disaster resilient communities. It is best to approach a community with an open mind. In most cases, the community has most of the answers. That comes from traditional wisdom of villagers, although much of it is now disappearing or is being ignored by engineers and other experts from outside. Participatory Hazard Mapping The big challenge is to sustain disaster preparedness interventions over time. This is helped by the creation of informal leadership within the community through participatory action. Sri Lanka\u2019s Disaster Management Centre (DMC) typically begins its community engagements with awareness creation. It then moves on to participatory hazard mapping. Here community members are divided into a few groups and asked to map their neighbourhood \u2013 they have to capture roads, footpaths, rivers, hillocks, houses, schools, temples and other key landmarks. Then people mark the areas that have been a\ufb00ected historically with di\ufb00erent disasters such as tsunami, \ufb02oods or cyclones. This helps identify relatively safer areas as well as safety routes in case a new disaster demands quick evacuation.

Ballakot. Pakistan. To be more e\ufb00ective, the media needs to look within at where it has compromised on the basic skills that are part of every journalist\u2019s tool kit. These are needed at all times, in all kinds of reporting. But when reporting on extraordinary situations, they became absolutely essential to do a competent job of communicating a disaster truthfully and in all its dimensions. Kalpana Sharma Shahidul Alam/Drik/Majority World Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 116 On 26 January 2001, when an earthquake that measured 6.9 on the Richter Scale hit the western state of Gujarat and \ufb02attened large parts of Kutch, the desert district bordering Pakistan, it took national media over 24 hours to reach the district capital city of Bhuj. The earthquake had knocked down cellular phone towers and telephone lines. There was no electricity. And therefore few knew the extent of the devastation. Even the of\ufb01ces of the District Collector, the chief administrative of\ufb01cer, had been destroyed. One of the \ufb01rst commercial \ufb02ights from Mumbai that \ufb02ew in essential aid to the region also carried with it a handful of journalists. I was one of those who managed to \ufb01ght my way onto that \ufb02ight. What we saw in the 24 hours after we landed are scenes none of us will forget. Disasters have a way of writing themselves into your memory, etching unlikely details that spring up when you pause to think about them. In the rush of reportage, these details are often overlooked. In those 24 hours, all one could do was absorb and record. Reporting was impossible until we got back to Mumbai on the return \ufb02ight the next day. Our stories could convey only \ufb01rst impressions. The bigger challenge came a week later when electricity was restored, phone lines were working and the national and international media had established themselves in the \ufb02attened town of Bhuj. How much detail do you report? How many photographs of crumpled buildings can you send? How many people who have lost family can you speak to before you get a good enough idea of what had happened? How many stories do you narrate of people who had lost entire families, people who were maimed and badly injured, people who could not trace their families? Do you rely on what of\ufb01cials tell you or do you personally go and double check each fact despite immense logistical problems? None of this is unfamiliar to journalists covering anything beyond the routine beats in cities. There are constant challenges of getting facts, verifying them, making sure you have enough information, that you talk to an adequate number of people, that you get all sides of the story, that you get human interest, etc. And that you meet your deadline. You come across villages where not a twig moves. Moonscapes. No sound. Only the stench of bodies that lie buried under the mounds of rubble. There are others were people have survived. Like one settlement where each house seems to be sliced in half, leaving it exposed, like a row of cardboard houses on display. You watch the inhabitants patiently attempting to rescue what they can from the ruins. And as you stand by and watch, you talk to some of them.

Quddus Alam/DrikNEWS/Majority World Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 117 groups set about providing relief to only their own kind. And political parties that had built their base on caste and religious divides went about building new townships with clearly demarcated areas for different communities and castes. The story then was not a simple \u201cdevelopmental\u201d kind, with disaster, relief and rehabilitation. It was interlaced with caste, community and politics. This is precisely why reporting on disasters \u2013 natural or human induced \u2013 is so demanding. It has all the excitement and immediacy of covering an event. You are guaranteed page one! But it also has layer upon layer of complexity, of histories that have to be dug out from under the rubble, of policies that have to be unearthed that make the current and future tasks more dif\ufb01cult, of understanding the interconnectedness and \ufb01ssures that predate a disaster but impact what follows it. If you take into account such layering, reporting on disasters can be much more nuanced. Otherwise, once the emergency ends, it turns into another routine story, of daily brie\ufb01ngs by the \u201cauthorities\u201d on relief and rehabilitation, on the work of international aid organisations and NGOs, on the \ufb01nal death count, of the state of the injured, etc. Survey media coverage of any natural disaster, and you will \ufb01nd this change of tone setting in within a couple of weeks. Not only do the stories disappear from the front page, as they are bound to do given the compulsions of the news business, but often they vanish altogether. The reason for this, I would suggest, is as much the way the media functions as the absence of imagination of reporters assigned to cover the disaster. And one reason for this, I think, is because journalists have stopped being \u201cgeneralists\u201d. Gone are the days when, as part of formal education, we were taught \u201cGeneral Knowledge\u201d or GK. We were supposed to be curious and interested in everything if we wanted to be counted as a good journalist. Life, nature, science, politics, economics, social structures \u2013 all this was supposed to be a part of our essential kit along with writing skills. The problem with an absence of GK, as I call it, or plain old homework about the region you are assigned to cover, is that journalists fail to see stories that are staring them in the face. The excuse is lack of time. But in the age of the Internet, where information is there for the asking, surely such an excuse does not count. What lies beneath Much of disaster reporting sounds and reads the same because the reporters only see what is in front of them, not what lies behind the mounds of rubble, \ufb01guratively speaking. What was this region before it became this disaster area? How were social relations between different groups? What was its history? What were its relations with the state government? Was it neglected or was it favoured? How important was it to the politics of the state? These questions are examples of the many other, but essential, dimensions of reporting on disasters that are often not part of discussions that look at how media communicates disasters. Just as gender is overlooked, so is much else. These are oversights in general reporting, exacerbated when it comes to disaster reporting. Another example that comes to mind is the inundation of large parts of the Indian commercial capital, Mumbai on 26 July 2005 when a cloud burst brought", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a61e5920-c54e-4405-8f8b-255550b677d3": {"__data__": {"id_": "a61e5920-c54e-4405-8f8b-255550b677d3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5c95bc8d65714adfcb5e76036801cd4c03bacea6071214653c03f5a487391ad9"}}, "hash": "5c95bc8d65714adfcb5e76036801cd4c03bacea6071214653c03f5a487391ad9", "text": "944 mm of rain on the city within 12 hours.

Tanvir Ahmed/DrikNEWS/Majority World Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 118 a dismal storm water system that can barely cope with routine monsoon rains. So the city almost drowned: over 400 people died; life came to a standstill for 48 hours; there were no trains, buses, no electricity and water; the airport was closed; and the roads were jammed with cars that had stalled. During these 48 hours, the broadcast media, the multiple 24-hour news channels, went into over-drive. Unable to reach many areas, they chose to telecast old footage without explaining to viewers that these had not been updated. Apart from misinformation, this spread panic. It also undercut the credibility of the media. It did not help that the government was unprepared and did not have a proper disaster management system in place. But it was also evident that much of the media was not prepared for disaster coverage and was \ufb02oundering. It is ordinary people, citizen journalists, who came to the rescue by phoning in information and visuals. A little known river The disaster exposed inadequacies in both the media and government. It seemed the rain forced both to take note of a river called the Mithi! In fact, this river, which has now been reduced to little more than a dirty narrow drain, has always existed, slicing Mumbai into two halves. But few reporters knew of its existence, or its importance for the city. The fact that it provided natural drainage. Or that the city\u2019s development had ignored this and reclaimed immeasurably important mangroves to build swank of\ufb01ce buildings. That the airport had changed the course of the river to meet its requirements for an extension to a runway. And that no one, including the media, had noticed or commented when all this happened, many years before 2005. So when the rain came down on 26 July 2005, the poor Mithi struggled to push out the water. It had to face the high tide from the Arabian Sea, into which it drained out. So instead of taking water out, it became the conduit for huge quantities of seawater coming in, even as its banks over\ufb02owed from the rain. The result: complete and sudden \ufb02ooding in areas all along the river, including the airport. The Mithi story is another important illustration about the need for journalists to be generalists, to have GK. Any reporter worth his or her salt covering a city like Mumbai should have been aware of the importance of the Mithi to the city. Within a few hours, they could have pinned down the reason for the \ufb02ooding. Instead it took days, for both authorities and the media, to understand what had happened. From my own experience of reporting on disasters I can cite many such examples to underline again the importance of training journalists to understand linkages \u2013 between the environment and disasters, between developmental policies and disasters, between socio- economic conditions (which would necessarily include the position of women and other marginalised communities) and disasters, and between local politics and disasters. Following up stories Apart from reporting in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, what about follow up? This is an eternal question that most media practitioners face. For how long do you pursue a disaster story? For weeks, months, and on every anniversary? There is clearly no formula. It depends on the media. But once media scrutiny disappears, attention to the area also lapses. While the routine work of reconstruction continues, the people falling between the cracks go virtually unnoticed. Until a civil society organisation brings this to the notice of the media. The history of post-disaster work in India has many examples that show that those historically marginalised often slip further back into deprivation after a natural calamity. Constant media scrutiny and follow up can help expose the gaps between professed intentions and actual performance of governments and aid givers and in the long-term aid those most needing help. To conclude, there is no question that in an age when the media seems not just to be omnipresent but almost omniscient, its role in communicating disasters and playing an important role as a way of two-way communication between affected communities and the government is central.

These are needed at all times, in all kinds of reporting. But when reporting on extraordinary situations, like the 2004 Asian Tsunami, or the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, these skills became absolutely essential to do a competent job of communicating truthfully and in all its dimensions, the extent of a disaster.

Yet, the relationship between media practitioners and those managing disasters can often be stressful, di\ufb03cult and fraught with misunderstandings. Communicating about disasters sometimes ends up as communications disasters. How can these mishaps be minimised, so that the power of established and new forms of mass media can play a more meaningful role in managing both hazards and disasters? This was the broad question addressed during a regional brainstorming meeting in Bangkok, Thailand, held on the eve of the Indian Ocean Tsunami\u2019s second anniversary, i.e. 21 \u2013 22 December 2006. Organised by TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c and UNDP, the meeting brought together over 30 leading media professionals, disaster managers and communication specialists from South and Southeast Asia. Early on, it became apparent that both the media practitioners and disaster/development professionals had very di\ufb00erent attitudes and approaches to managing information before, during and after disasters. Some of the di\ufb00erences arose from a failure to appreciate the di\ufb00erent needs and priorities of these two groups. But this division became less sharp as the two groups agreed on the essential functions of information and communication, and the need to serve the public interest over individual, corporate or agency interests. The meeting recognised that the media must evolve its own ethics, guidelines and strategies for covering hazards and disasters, and these cannot be imposed from outside. At the same time, all participants agreed on the value of greater understanding and cooperation between media practitioners, development professionals and disaster managers.

He went on to say that after the Tsunami had struck, the media\u2019s role was paramount. This was living proof of what Bernard Kouchner, the co-founder of Medecins sans Frontieres, had said: \u201cWhere there is no camera, there is no humanitarian intervention.\u201d If not for the wide coverage in the media, the world would not have pledged US$13 billion for relief and recovery e\ufb00orts. TVEAP image archive Thananuch Sanguansak, TVEAP image archive Meeting proceedings Day One: 21 December 2006 Introductory remarks Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 122 He urged the meeting to remain focused on the following: \u2022 Public communication of disasters using mass media and new media \u2022 Look at all phases of a disaster: before, during and after \u2022 Consider many di\ufb00erent types of disasters \u2022 Study the nexus between media-based communications and disasters with a view to \ufb01nding ways to improve this relationship on all fronts. Chin Saik Yoon, publisher and communications specialist, saw disasters as the more visible \u2018peaks\u2019 in processes that unfold over time a\ufb00ecting lives of large numbers of people. Media, as mirrors of society and analysts of social trends, should be interested in these processes as much as they cover the \u2018peaks\u2019. During the self-introductory session, each participant was asked to share a \u201cquick personal insight related to any disaster\u201d. These helped illustrate the diversity of nationalities, experiences and perspectives in the room. Examples: \u2022 Chin Saik Yoon, Southbound Press: Shortly after the Tsunami, I wrote about the experience of the Nallavadu village, Pondicherry, on the eastern coast of India, whose people were alerted about the oncoming Tsunami via phone from Singapore. This call, given by one villager who was working in Singapore, saved everyone\u2019s lives. But later I found out that he had become the most hated person in his community! Because while lives were saved, the village su\ufb00ered signi\ufb01cant property losses. But the news had spread far and wide that this village had been \u201csaved\u201d by that call, which prevented relief or recovery support from reaching the people.

Milind Khandekar, Deputy Managing Editor, Star News, India: \u2022 For a media practitioner, the biggest challenge in a disaster is logically managing information about the unfolding event. You have to get the pictures. This was the ch allenge when covering the Tsunami. We have heard and seen so many disasters in India, yet never heard of Tsunami. Honestly, we were not ready for it. \u2022 In India, the \ufb01rst reports of the Tsunami came in from the eastern metropolis of Chennai around 9 am. These talked about \ufb02ooding at Marina Beach. Water was said to be coming into the city. There were no reports yet from other parts of the state of Tamil Nadu. Our \ufb01rst reaction was: is it a \ufb02ood? It took us time to understand this was a Tsunami. Even while the story was still unfolding, we found out that it was hitting our neighbours worse: Sri Lanka, Thailand -- and things were getting worse by the hour. \u2022 In a disaster, everyone is a victim in one way or another; no one is spared. We as media are not there to merely and dispassionately report. We invariably become a vital link the scene of the disaster has with the rest of the country and world. During the Gujarat Earthquake, I allowed dozens of a\ufb00ected people to use my microphone -- live on air \u2013 to speak out and tell their family and friends elsewhere that they had survived. Asoka Dias, Station Director, Sirasa TV/Mararaja TV, Sri Lanka \u2022 When the Tsunami story was breaking, one big challenge was to \ufb01nd a word or a phrase to explain the Tsunami in our local languages (Sinhala and Tamil). Historically Sri Lanka has had some tsunamis, but none in living memory. We struggled to describe what was happening. \u2022 The tsunami hit many provincial correspondents based in coastal areas. According to one assessment, two correspondents went missing and 23 were injured. Add itionally, nearly 1,000 members of 121 journalists\u2019 families were displaced, with housing and equipment damages totaling US $300,000. Among the damages listed are 48 houses, 80 still cameras and nine television cameras. This, and telecommunications disruption in the a\ufb00ected areas, placed practical di\ufb03culties in obtaining coverage in the initial days.1 \u2022 Sri Lankan government requested the media not to carry photos of dead bodies. Later, we realised a\ufb00ected people were using pictures in the media to identify their missing loved ones. This prompted some individuals to record the TV reportage of the tsunami and sell them on CDs for approx US$ 1.50 per copy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "06bd4b67-9ccc-47d9-80a6-b99726c96a5b": {"__data__": {"id_": "06bd4b67-9ccc-47d9-80a6-b99726c96a5b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbccc11a088574397300ca8dd7259e057bf510f2015ca9493dc21c5b90422b11"}, "2": {"node_id": "ef20acc8-77a5-45ba-918c-d102d710167d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7c08691b6b027815e289dce58f7067e6f61ba9c11e1f965835c87026b395e1ca"}}, "hash": "98044d0120555326d53ee791ad1de28b8d1836d2faad70d11eb0261226dd4c35", "text": "Ahmed Shakeeb, Television Maldives \u2022 You can barely imagine impact of that magnitude for Maldivian people living on the sea.

Panos South Asia Executive Director (and former News Director of India\u2019s Sun TV network) A S Panneerselvan told the meeting: \u201cGenerally, the Indian news market is highly competitive with 18 TV news channels. They\u2019re not willing to share visuals or co-operate. But something extraordinary happened soon after the Tsunami news broke. For the \ufb01rst time, none of the channels was insisting on exclusivity. They were simply downloading each other\u2019s images, without even bothering about the rights or other issues. \u201cThis was indeed rare. We know how many contracts have to be signed even for broadcasting 10 seconds of a cricket match. The kind of cross-\ufb02ow of information after the Tsunami was amazing. All channel rivalries were momentarily forgotten. \u201cThe only problem was with the international relief agencies, who are extremely hierarchy conscious. They were not easily available to the news media, and often they spoke only to in\ufb02uential Western news agencies such as Reuters and BBC.\u201d Panel 2: Covering the Asian Tsunami: beyond news headlines Moderated by Manori Wijesekera, Regional Programme Manager of TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c, this panel discussed the Tsunami\u2019s coverage in formats other than news and current a\ufb00airs, and how such coverage extended beyond the hard news values. TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c\u2019s Children of Tsunami was one key experience discussed during a panel. Three of the four panelists had been associated with this multi-country, multi-media initiative, which tracked -- on television, video and web -- how a\ufb00ected people were rebuilding their lives, livelihoods and homes after the disaster. From February to November 2005, TVEAP-commissioned local \ufb01lm-makers made monthly visits to two chosen families in each country. Based on location \ufb01lming and \ufb01eld investigations, they produced television, video and web stories for a global audience. The main focus was on eight surviving children, who served as \u2018story guides\u2019 \u2013 but the stories also covered their extended families, neighbours and communities. Using their speci\ufb01c experiences, Children of Tsunami showed how tsunami recovery was progressing \u2013 or, in some places, stagnating \u2013 across a\ufb00ected Asia. TVEAP\u2019s Regional Programme Manager Manori Wijesekera described it as \u2018an open-ended experiment that took us beyond the comfort zone of conventional television journalism\u2019. She added: \u201cPositioned between hard-edge news and current a\ufb00airs TV journalism and the development community, TVEAP was well equipped to engage in this exercise. As a regionally operating media organisation, we were extremely keen to tell the story of tsunami recovery using the audio-visual medium.

For example, how some Western relief o\ufb00ers came with attempts in Christian proselitization, or the di\ufb03culties faced by Tsunami widows -- under Thai law, their husbands were not considered dead till bodies were found. Joanne Teoh Kheng Yau, Executive Producer, Channel News Asia \u2022 In the days following the tsunami, Channel News Asia received satellite news feeds showing the extent of devastation, as well as what experts, charity workers and politicians were doing to provide relief. But we felt the need to move beyond headlines. We wanted to examine the various facets of the tsunami\u2019s impact \u2013 social, cultural, political and even scienti\ufb01c aspects,\u201d she recalled. \u2022 Shortly after the disaster, I visited my native town of Penang, Malaysia, where my grandmother was among the a\ufb00ected. The randomness of this event caught many journalists by surprise. Many of us were groping for words to describe the impact. \u2022 It was in the second half of 2005 that I became involved in Children of Tsunami, when TVEAP negotiated a co-production arrangement with Channel News Asia. I was designated as executive producer for CNA\u2019s documentary based on the material \ufb01lmed by the four country teams: Children of Tsunami: No More Tears. \u2022 I have seen many types of TV and video productions related to disasters, but never come across a sustained e\ufb00ort like Children of Tsunami. It covered the struggles of some very ordinary people with extraordinary courage in the tsunami\u2019s aftermath. It captured many nuances and subtext. These details tell us more than the screaming news-headlines. My challenge was to distil so much that was gathered over the year into 26 minutes. \u2022 Even now, many media organisations still work according to a \u2018disaster template\u2019, which needs to evolve. Dendy Montgomery, Freelance TV professional, Aceh \u2022 Aceh was the worst hit by the Tsunami. The good news is that children in Aceh are no longer afraid of the sea. They go to the beach every Sunday. \u2022 There has been progress, but not for everyone. President Clinton was in Aceh recently, but when I asked a\ufb00ected people, some said: \u2018We don\u2019t care who comes visiting. When do we receive our permanent houses?\u2019 \u2022 The Tsunami disaster in Ache is not sexy (as a news-story) anymore. For several months after the disaster, all eyes were on Aceh. When the \ufb01rst year's commemoration came up, reporting took a spurt. Then it slowed down again. You should follow your heart. Journalists from elsewhere come to Aceh to do what their news directors want, and not really to report on what's happening on the ground.

For example, some disasters are covered much more widely than others. The international news media takes an interest in some countries only when a major disaster strikes. Even within countries, some areas receive media attention only when a disaster strikes. \u2022 We need to critique the media for not telling the stories that break over a long period. The tsunami story is not yet over. It may no longer be \u2018sexy\u2019, but there is much un\ufb01nished business in the post-tsunami recovery process. \u2022 The under-reporting and non-reporting of many human interest and human development stories is a scandal.

Can citizen journalists help improve communication of disasters? The following are highlights of initial and later remarks made by each participant of the debate. Lynette Lee Corporal, Project Editor, Inter Press Service - Asia Paci\ufb01c, raised the issue of the mass media \u201closing interest\u201d in disasters after a while. \u2022 The Tsunami (like other disasters) came in \"di\ufb00erent waves\" -- the need for information, the need for analysis and commentary, the spurt in citizen journalism. \u2022 Citizen journalism has changed the way journalism is practised today. Unlike the detached \u2018objectivity' of the professional journalist, we have some honest, real accounts of what happened at the ground from Thananuch Sanguansak, TVEAP image archive TVEAP image archive Thananuch Sanguansak, TVEAP image archive Session 2: Beyond the Tsunami: zooming out to the wider issues Debate 1: Communicating Disasters or Communications Disasters? Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 127 citizen journalists (mainly bloggers). That in some ways has enhanced the reporting of professional journalists. The two groups have become complementary. \u2022 The reporter needs to know what is happening... and not just go \u2018blind\u2019 to the scene of a disaster or any other event. Understanding and re\ufb02ection are important attributes of a good communicator. Amjad Bhatti, Regional Coordinator, Duryog Nivaran - South Asian Network for Disaster Risk Reduction, called for de\ufb01ning \u2018disasters\u2019 and going beyond the \u201cobsession with macro disasters\u201d. \u2022 Since the Indian Ocean Tsunami, there has been a trend of \"Tsunamisation of disasters\" which had led to a desensitisation of responses in other disasters large and sm all. \u2022 Disasters that set in slowly are being overlooked. For example, if 500 people die in a single train disaster, it's a big story for the media. But if that many - or far more \u2013 people die over a period of time by drinking pesticides, that's not as big a story. \u2022 So many people have to die in one place at the same time for it to qualify as \u2018news\u2019 in today\u2019s media world. Mega-narrative of disaster is attractive to the media. For them, the motto seems to be: \"If it bleeds, it leads\". \u2022 We must question how the media perceives 'news'. For instance, in 2005, 98.22% of the total number of people a\ufb00ected by all disasters in South Asia were those a\ufb00ected by \ufb02oods. But the story of \ufb02ood disasters was buried under issues like Kashmir earthquake and the Tsunami. \u2022 There are 'missing' disasters (which don't get re\ufb02ected in the media). Among them are climate-induced, technological or biological disasters. Talking openly about HIV/AIDS is still a taboo in many parts of South Asia. Sea level rise in Bangladesh is not seen as a potential disaster. Famine becomes a story, drought doesn't \u2013because the latter kills slowly. \u2022 The disaster-management discourse has to be linked with the media perspective, and vice versa. A S Panneerselvan, Executive Director, Panos South Asia, argued that development professionals and disaster managers should not view the \u2018media\u2019 as a monolithic entity. \u2022 If they want to engage the media, development professionals must \ufb01rst understand the complexity, nuances and diversity in what is collectively labeled as \u2018media\u2019. In fact, the very term \u2018media\u2019 is a plural! \u2022 Yet, development professionals regard and engage the media on simplistic presumptions.

We need to take the reality head on and \ufb01nd creative ways to push our own public interest agendas within existing inequalities. \u2022 Some of us don\u2019t like to confront this reality, and opt for terms and strategies like 'alternative media'. Well meant as these are, we often tend to marginalise ourselves in doing so. The so-called mainstream media can, in fact, be used as a vehicle for all kinds of reformist, progressive agendas \u2013 we just need to be smart and tactical about it. \u2022 The biggest challenge is to make what is currently perceived as \u2018alternative\u2019 viewpoints into mainstream viewpoints.

Here are the wishes expressed by participants, reproduced in their original wording (excepting improvements on grammar for clarity), as sorted into several categories by the meeting co-moderators: Avoiding Con\ufb02ict: \u2022 Developmental agencies and NGOs often feel that they 'possess' or 'own' the community that they provide assistance to. This creates tension/con\ufb02ict between journalists and developmental agencies. \u2022 To avoid confrontation, there is a need to focus on the public interest. \u2022 Disaster o\ufb03cials should avoid using jargon. They need to be responsive to the journalists\u2019 questions. \u2022 If a question is a complex one, journalists need to take the time to listen to the complex answer. Don't ask for the simplistic response. \u2022 Both journalists and disaster managers should indulge in more self-re\ufb02ection.

Day Two: 22 December 2006 The second day started with the moderators presenting a summary of the interactive session which ended the \ufb01rst day. This was followed by the screening of audio-visual material. \u2022 Children of Tsunami: No More Tears (24 mins) was a regional documentary co-produced in late 2005 by Channel News Asia of Singapore and TVE Asia Paci\ufb01c, based on year-long \ufb01lming carried out in India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. It was broadcast Asia-wide on the \ufb01rst anniversary of the Asian Tsunami, in December 2005, and has since been repeated several times on Asia\u2019s leading English news channel. \u2022 Asoka Dias screened extracts from his media network\u2019s news and current a\ufb00airs coverage of the two Tsunami related Sri Lankan stories where the media had played a key role: \u25a0 The case of two men who were caught on a freelance journalist\u2019s video camera on Tsunami day as they robbed the necklace of an a\ufb00ected woman and threw her back into the waters immediately after the \ufb01rst wave had struck Galle. Based mainly on this evidence, a judge sentenced both men to death in December 2006.2 \u25a0 The case of baby Abilash, who was separated from parents and washed away by Tsunami waves but miraculously survived. Dubbed \u2018Baby 81\u2019 by the media, he received worldwide coverage when the media claimed nine couples claimed him as their own \u2013 which turned out to be a fabrication. (See Box on page 131). \u2022 Asoka saw the \ufb01rst example as one where the timely action by a professionally trained videographer \u2013 himself caught in the unfolding disaster \u2013 helped solve a crime. The second was where the media went overboard, and \u2018created news needlessly\u2019 when so many other, more legitimate stories were unfolding all around them. \u2022 Nalaka Gunawardene, originator of Children of Tsunami, described how challenging it was to get regional and global broadcast media organisations to take note of the thousands of individual recovery stories behind the mega-story of the disaster\u2019s death and destruction. \u201cWhen they were not following the blood, they were following the (aid) money.

But t he devastation in Aceh turned out to be much bigger than initially thought. This became known only after a few days, and then the world responded generously. \u2022 But the post-disaster management could have been better handled by the Indonesian government. Relief materials were piling up at airport and harbours. People\u2019s needs and expectations were not being met. Frustrations were setting in, and morale was very low. \u2022 We decided to use the airwaves to uplift the morale of the Achenese. We felt this would help them to start rebuilding their lives. Of course, it was not easy. \u2022 We also started rebuilding the local radio station damaged by the waves, and sought international assistamce. Before the disaster, we had 14 radio stations in Aceh and we now have 25. Lisa Hiller, Communications Manager, UNDP Nepal, held the view that the priority of development organisations arriving at disaster scenes \u201cis not primarily to communicate, but to respond to the emergency situation on the ground\u201d. \u2022 This frustrates many journalists. It is therefore necessary for development organisations to see information as a \u2018commodity\u2019 -- in the same way they see emergency shelters or water supply as a commodity. \u2022 As relief workers, we don't just arrive, bringing the tents, and then say \u2018Oh, here it is - you guys pick it up\u2019. We would \ufb01nd distribution networks, and make sure the tents reach the right people. We have to manage information in the same way. \u2022 It\u2019s a bit surprising that in Asia \u2013 where a majority of countries are still developing \u2013 that development is not considered a top news story. Surein J S Peiris, Deputy Director General, Sri Lanka Red Cross said the Tsunami was major challenge to his relief organisation. The Red Cross did have decades of experience in dealing with various types of disasters, but the Tsunami was of an unprecedented scale and magnitude. \u2022 The strength of the Red Cross is in its volunteerism. We had the capacity and readiness to mobilise Thananuch Sanguansak, TVEAP image archive Thananuch Sanguansak, TVEAP image archive Debate 2: Communication under duress: Do disaster managers make good communication managers? Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 135 thousands of volunteers for rescue and relief within hours. \u2022 Under the overall banner of Red Cross, over two dozen organisations operated in Sri Lanka in the months following the Tsunami. This included the ICRC, IFRC, a number of Red Cross societies from other countries, and of course the Sri Lanka Red Cross. Most sections of the media did not grasp nor appreciate this complecity. To them, it was all one and the same Red Cross. Some misreporting and confusion arose as a result. \u2022 As the Red Cross operates on a neutral basis, its preferred mode of operation is collaboration and partnership building. Sometimes the Red Cross cannot make statements as expected by the media, criticizing aid agencies or governments. \u2022 In my view, the media needs to raise and sustain the coverage of the issue of internally displaced people (IDPs) both in times of disaster and con\ufb02ict. Prof Nalini Rajan, Dean, Asian College of Journalism (India) stressed the value of self re\ufb02ection by both media practitioners and development/disaster professionals. \u2022 While journalists dislike it when they are criticised, they seldom exercise the adversarial role they are expected to play. \u2022 The media is good at reporting an event in terms of the 5 Ws in journalism -- who, what, where, when and why -- they but not so good at explaining processes that lead to an event, or the \u2018how\u2019 part of it. \u2022 Criticism is needed on both sides: development workers need to focus the spotlight of criticism on themselves because there is a good deal of self-congratulation going on while there is much un\ufb01nished business. Governments, disasters and communications Indian environmentalist Anil Agarwal wrote a scathing comment after the Bhuj earthquake of 2001: \u201cDisasters come and go but, our government has become a permanent disaster\u201d.

In some countries, this could be traced to their colonial or dictatorial past. Similarly, many citizens feel they cannot count on their governments: the authorities often just want to avoid causing panic and alarm -- and hence play down or even deliberately suppress early warnings. The sheer lack of reliable information and the many bottlenecks prevents its \ufb02ow were also identi\ufb01ed as problems. For instance, in the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, it took a long time before the leaking deadly gas could be identi\ufb01ed and its seriousness assessed. The meeting agreed that for media to ful\ufb01ll its role as public educator and early warning disseminator, governments need to get their act together and create an enabling environment. One participant \u2013 a media manager - shared his bitter experience of having to face legal action for a bona \ufb01de error in a public interest website his company had put up after the Tsunami. Clearly, a good deal of \u2018bridge building\u2019 and con\ufb01dence building is needed. TVEAP image archive Thananuch Sanguansak, TVEAP image archive Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 136 In the ensuing discussion, participants cited both best and worst practices in disaster communications. One aspect that drew several comments was the obsession of many relief and development agencies for \u2018branding\u2019: the phenomenon of using disaster relief items, as well as disaster relief communications, as \u2018logo delivery mechanisms\u2019. Nalaka Gunawardene drew attention to another unhealthy trend: some developmental agencies seeking favourable media coverage \u2013 basically, their propaganda - by paying for air time or print space. \u201cThis distorts the news values and makes it more di\ufb03cult for other agencies to get the media coverage they deserve. This is corruption \u2013 I call it \u2018chequebook development\u2019,\u201d he said. Development agencies present acknowledged they are under much pressure to document and account for resources they receive. While coping with these institutional imperatives, the meeting agreed, issue-based public communication of development and disasters should not be sidelined or abandoned. Concluding Remarks The meeting concluded with a few remarks by the co-organisers and co-moderators. \u2022 Nalaka Gunawardene described plans for compiling a regional resource book on Communicating Disasters, which would include: the full report of this meeting; invited contributions from several participants; and contributions from a number of other media or development professionals in the region. \u2022 Participants agreed on the value of an internet-based mailing-list focusing on communications and disaster. The idea is to keep it open to others who are not present, but interested in the intersection-point of these two topics. 4 \u2022 Building online (or print) directories of journalists interested in developmental communications was also mentioned. Shahidul Alam said he would be keen to build up a listing of photographers in various parts of Asia. Others pointed to the existence of some such lists. \u2022 Amjad Bhatti mentioned attempts to create a global network of journalists working on disaster issues. He said special editions were also brought out, with six being released so far, related to disaster themes. \"In South Asia, we are sharing mountains, river basins and deserts. The question is how to also share more information?\" In her concluding remarks, Cherie Hart, UNDP\u2019s Regional Communications Advisor, said looking at the issue in terms of \u201cmedia vs. development practitioners or disaster practitioners\u201d was a false divide. She added: \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019re two di\ufb00erent sides. We need to see each other through the same lens.

They are carried here without editing. Before a disaster strikes (hazard phase) Gudelines for media organisations, and also government/developmental organisations: \u2022 Investigative reports are needed; on issues like institutional readiness. \u2022 Pre-disaster work needs to start years before disaster, not minutes before. \u2022 Need for credible government agencies tackling such issues. \u2022 Institutional, developmental and academic institutions need to provide media with easy-to-digest information. \u2022 Non-media institutions need to assist media in covering slow-moving stories, and to provide the 'human face' to what could otherwise be just dry stories. \u2022 Fill in the 'resource gap'. Recognise logistical limitations of the media, with support from institutions for exposure visits and the like. \u2022 Developmental organisations and institutions should make e\ufb00orts to understand the diversity of the media. This means, diverse sections of the media need to be dealt with in di\ufb00ering ways. \u2022 State of preparedness needed to be created among media organisations. \u2022 Reach out to a greater variety of the media, and also the traditional media \u2022 Institutions could make available B-roll footage available to the media, exploit existing networks such as the UNiFeed,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c50d82e1-260e-4d04-95a8-c4828787af52": {"__data__": {"id_": "c50d82e1-260e-4d04-95a8-c4828787af52", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6f26ecbd96d9e909f618e102a04dd8e7bb7e0f1af0c3a2850584a5c9ac2ec247"}, "3": {"node_id": "c97ec118-41a8-4120-a811-c7574497b4e2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "33d46855e0434723fed7d3e15238b78f11f6d61225b97c19db3313ffce524523"}}, "hash": "9914062cf3738fcf1f1758d11ea82cdc3df76fca92c27f191aec83025b9ceebf", "text": "http://www.un.org/unifeed/. Online photo libraries could also help to build awareness in the media. Institutions (working on disaster issues) should consider starting blogs. \u2022 Local languages need to be deployed in media campaigns. \u2022 Editors should be encouraged to have a 'disaster beat' \u2022 Preparedness is a cultural value. It needs to be built upon. During an unfolding disaster and immediately afterwards (\ufb01rst two weeks) \u2022 It\u2019s not possible nor realistic to compile a rigid list of do's and don'ts. \u2022 This phase of the disaster, in most cases, involves a window of two weeks from the time a disaster breaks. \u2022 Focus on the 'immediate' media -- newspapers, TV, radio, web, cell phone. (Theatre, music, etc., may not be relevant at this point of time.) \u2022 Work actively to bridge the mismatch between victims' needs and relief agencies\u2019 interest/focus. \u2022 Let media have access to all information and sites, without restriction. Don't prevent journalists from reaching the disaster and other relevant sites. \u2022 Encourage active participation of a\ufb00ected parties in the information and communication processes. Suggested guidelines for more e\ufb00ective engagement of mass media and new media before, during and after disasters Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 140 \u2022 Rather than preparing any more manuals or guidelines for media, what is needed is training, reorientation and sensitising for developmental agencies. \u2022 Media needs to considered and build (based on spot-reporting), a central desk, expert panel and other suitable forms to better cover an unfolding disaster situation. \u2022 The goal is to spread information e\ufb00ectively, and provide expression to the people a\ufb00ected. \u2022 Media should be treated as (those generating information for) part of the public domain, and a space for complementing ideas. \u2022 Guidelines: Encourage and support all forms of narratives, and visuals. \u2022 Guidelines: Be sensitive. There can be a di\ufb00erence between showing bodies and gore. \u2022 Guidelines: Don't be o\ufb00ensive. \u2022 Guidelines: Be e\ufb00ective. \u2022 Guidelines: Training needed for the authorities, donors, agencies to understand journalism and how media organisations work. \u2022 Bridge the mismatch between information available and needed. \u2022 Assessment should start from the ground up. \u2022 Let media have access to real information. \u2022 New media (including TV) requirement: good \u2018sound bytes\u2019. \u2022 Media needs to adopt an antagonistic position, based on its logic of operations. Idea is to make those in power more accountable, less cosy. After a disaster: long-term recovery \u2022 Taking care of physical needs without overlooking mental disorders, stress, psychosomatic issues that are not often raised. \u2022 Factors that exacerbate the problem need to be focused on: ethnic tensions, regional divisions, etc. \u2022 Issues of gender need to be considered: especially concerns such as rede\ufb01ning women's role in the family after a disaster. \u2022 Make available \u201ccultural\u201d emergency relief, as well as recovery support \u2022 Disaster beat is recommended, the media should work to keep post-disaster issues in the news. \u2022 Media should focus on both immediate aftermath and long-term e\ufb00ects. \u2022 Be aware about possible mismatch between aid available, and the community needs. \u2022 Media coverage needs to extend beyond the status quo in society (e.g. male control of households and assets). \u2022 New media can play a special role in bypassing the hierarchy. \u2022 Media has a role in 're-energising' the community during recovery phase. \u2022 Media also has a role to play in sharing relevant stories with the community.

Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 144 Appendix 5 Reuters AlertNet: Helping journalists cover crises \u201cWhat I \ufb01nd indispensable about AlertNet is its coverage of corners of the world that the mainstream media reports from less and less. When you click on the country name, there\u2019s a country pro\ufb01le, statistics, analyses and the latest news. It\u2019s a terri\ufb01c research tool.\u201d - Mahtab Haider, Senior Assistant Editor, New Age English language daily in Bangladesh who has reported on \ufb02oods and cyclones in Bangladesh. Ever had to get your head around an unfamiliar war minutes before going on air? Or had to rewrite the front page after an earthquake struck just as you were going to print? Reuters AlertNet has launched a set of free online tools to make your life a whole lot easier when it comes to reporting on emergencies. AlertNet for Journalists is designed to help editors and reporters cover con\ufb02icts and disasters. It provides a shortcut to the context and contacts journalists need to get to grips with complex stories. There are background brie\ufb01ngs on scores of emergencies \u2013 the big ones as well as those that get overlooked. You may think you can explain Iraq, but could you write a sidebar on the con\ufb02ict in Nagorno- Karabakh? If you couldn\u2019t actually place Nagorno-Karabakh on a map then AlertNet can help there too. Its interactive mapping service lets you zoom in on anywhere in the world and measure distances \u2013 useful when you need to pinpoint a \ufb02are-up of \ufb01ghting in a Sri Lankan town you\u2019ve never heard of. And if you wanted to interview someone on the ground about the violence there\u2019s an online contacts book listing phone numbers and email addresses for hundreds of aid workers in war zones and disaster areas around the world. AlertNet also provides tip-o\ufb00s about brewing crises before they hit the headlines and o\ufb00ers journalists ideas for features and new angles on long-running emergencies. There are statistics on every country and a tool that lets you create graphs to illustrate your stories \u2013 handy if you\u2019re comparing refugee populations across Asia, for example. So what is Reuters AlertNet and why is it o\ufb00ering this free of charge? AlertNet is a humanitarian news and information website set up by the Reuters Foundation charity in 1997 following the Rwandan genocide. Aid agencies were strongly criticised for their lack of co-ordination in the post-Rwanda relief operation. AlertNet was launched to help improve communication and co-operation. Although the service is primarily aimed at aid workers, increasing numbers of journalists are using it too.

The resulting report examined the barriers reporters face in covering humanitarian crises \u2013 whether they be con\ufb02icts, earthquakes, \ufb02oods or famines. Journalists\u2019 gripes included the di\ufb03culty in \ufb01nding aid workers willing to talk to the media, a lack of authoritative background on complex crises and a dearth of reliable statistics.

It aims to do this in practical ways by providing the tools journalists need to get better informed on humanitarian emergencies and by facilitating contact between reporters and aid workers. It also hopes to challenge journalists to think again about the way they report crises. AlertNet has some 400 member aid agencies who are committed to sharing information on the website. (Bene\ufb01ts for them include free access to Reuters photographs, which they can use in their emergency appeals and publications.)

These content partners include several U.N. agencies, the U.N.\u2019s news service IRIN, the International Crisis Group think tank, Human Rights Watch, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network and the Tropical Storm Risk warning service. On top of this, there are reports and analyses from Reuters correspondents around the world and from AlertNet\u2019s own reporters.

It is a global challenge that requires action at all levels to reduce the su\ufb00ering of millions of victims a\ufb00ected every year by disasters triggered by natural hazards. After the Indian Ocean Tsunami, the many earthquakes around the world, the frequent hurricanes in the Caribbean, and the onset of increasingly severe, weather-related disasters, more people want to know: Why do disasters happen? Who is responsible for them? How can we prevent them? The media play a critical role in answering these questions and the UN/ISDR secretariat attaches great importance to working closely with print media and broadcasters to promote disaster risk reduction policies. Journalists can go beyond the brutal facts of an avalanche or a \ufb02ood and help people and governments understand the whole process. The Media Network on Disaster Risk Reduction is a partnership made up of international organizations and communication professionals. The Network seeks to develop a new approach to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to disasters worldwide. This new approach aims to raise awareness about disasters as a process, not just as a fact.

The UN/ISDR secretariat facilitates initial consultations and acts as the catalyst of the initiative. Media individuals raise awareness about the importance of the issue internally and discuss with their executive directors how they can help to make progress on the activities of the network respecting their editorial choices. The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction The International Strategy for Disaster Reduction aims at building disaster resilient communities by promoting increased awareness of disaster risk reduction, with the goal of reducing human, social, economic and environmental losses caused by the combination of natural hazards and vulnerabilities. United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) Media Network on Disaster Risk Reduction Communicating Disasters - An Asia Paci\ufb01c Resource Book 148 The ISDR system, which includes a wide range of stakeholders such as Governments, UN agencies, regional bodies, non-governmental organizations and scienti\ufb01c institutions, works together to reduce disaster losses, in lives and in social, economic and environmental assets and to implement the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. The UN/ISDR secretariat serves as catalyst, advocates for the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Hyogo Framework for Action worldwide, and mobilizes commitment and resources for disaster risk reduction through partnerships at all levels. The UN/ISDR secretariat also provides services to support the ISDR system.

The project came about as a result of the collective acknowledgement within the humanitarian community that the lack of information exchange had forestalled early action. United Nations member states recognized the need for a tool to support appropriate decision-making, and the expanding capabilities of the Internet o\ufb00ered a way forward. ReliefWeb was endorsed by two General Assembly resolutions that established its mandate: to strengthen the response capacity of the humanitarian relief community through the timely dissemination of reliable information on preparedness, response and disaster prevention. ReliefWeb is administered by the United Nations O\ufb03ce for the Coordination of Humanitarian A\ufb00airs (UNOCHA). In order to provide balanced coverage, it gathers and disseminates information from more than 2500 sources from the United Nations, non-governmental organisations, governments, academic institutions and the media. These information providers are also the primary users of ReliefWeb. With an archive of over 300,000 documents in three languages (English, French and Spanish) dating back to 1981, ReliefWeb is the largest existing source of documents and maps for humanitarian response on the Web. ReliefWeb operates in three time zones with o\ufb03ces in Geneva, New York and Kobe, which enables it to provide 24-hour coverage and to communicate and reach out to partners around the world. Through constant monitoring of disasters, ReliefWeb ensures timely coverage of natural disasters and complex emergencies. As delivery of relief reaches disaster-a\ufb00ected areas, ReliefWeb shifts from its early-warning role to full coverage of humanitarian action, and thus ful\ufb01ls its mission as an information- exchange tool in support of coordination on the ground.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "789e6770-fa0e-4052-ac03-becc3ff2bebf": {"__data__": {"id_": "789e6770-fa0e-4052-ac03-becc3ff2bebf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Communicating Disasters: An Asia Pacific Resource Book", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "29ec419845d3cf545371d5b4bf803a0eb55972a0148daeacb0f2d8f94cf2f805"}, "2": {"node_id": "83dfef3d-a88e-48a6-b038-7cfaa6675540", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/communicating-disasters-asia-pacific-resource-book", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ed869b945207abce4d257f0cc0eaba35c7bf14b1519dafc666861f2eacaafb26"}}, "hash": "c2a4728fd15d1e241025f69dd447a3a18bf59c71e5a5e04e1926c2678c7e5af1", "text": "Coverage of complex emergencies includes countries and regions in con\ufb02ict or post-con\ufb02ict situations.

Disaster managers and relief agencies acknowledge the mass media\u2019s key role at times of distress. Yet, the relationship between media practitioners and those managing disasters can often be stressful, di\ufb03cult and fraught with misunderstandings. Communicating about disasters sometimes ends up as communication disasters. How can these mishaps be minimised, so that the power of conventional and new media can be harnessed to create more disaster resilient communities? What value addition can the new information and communication technologies (ICTs) bring in? In this book, media and development professionals from across the Asia Paci\ufb01c share their views based on decades of experience in covering or managing a variety of disasters \u2013 cyclones, earthquakes, \ufb02oods, landslides and tsunamis. This book is aimed at journalists, disaster managers and civil society groups who want to use information and communication to create safer societies and communities.

This focus has also resulted in a shifting understanding of security, which now includes the safety and well-being of people and communities as well as the security of the state. The Pacific, like other regions, is dealing with a difficult and diverse set of law enforcement, governance and security challenges. The region has witnessed violent conflict, civil unrest and political crises. This has led to a growing recognition of the critical role of law enforcement agencies and security institutions. However, in recent years, there have been concerns that these institutions lack capacity to meet the challenge of providing security to the general public; that governments do not have the necessary civilian security expertise to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "33a85a73-c62b-430d-a3eb-bfaeff304bef": {"__data__": {"id_": "33a85a73-c62b-430d-a3eb-bfaeff304bef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cc7904daa7cb21397de55089e73a96e6cc5cfc58539eb9fa7f90512dc8207d1b"}}, "hash": "cc7904daa7cb21397de55089e73a96e6cc5cfc58539eb9fa7f90512dc8207d1b", "text": "manage them; that legislatures are not empowered to oversee them; and that security forces are not held accountable under the law for their actions. To deal with these challenges the Pacific has moved towards closer regional integration and cooperation, which is enshrined in the Pacific Plan and Pacific Islands Forum Leader\u2019s declarations. However, it is becoming apparent that more has to be done to achieve the Leader\u2019s vision for a peaceful, secure and prosperous region. Achieving the vision requires fresh thinking and new innovative approaches. Security sector governance (SSG), which links two key pillars of the Pacific Plan and aims to improve the transparency and accountability of security institutions and their interaction with government, legislatures, accountability institutions and civil society, is one such approach. In other regions of the world, improving SSG has helped to instil public confidence in security institutions by responding to both the needs of the people affected by insecurity and governments\u2019 need to strengthen such institutions. Effective governance of security institutions is vital for the Pacific region. In the context of conflict and violence, it supports the efforts of state institutions to stabilize the security situation, begin the road to recovery and reduce the potential of relapse. In non-conflict contexts, it ensures security institutions fulfil their mandate to combat insecurity. This creates an enabling environment for poverty reduction and sustainable development. To accelerate work to deal with the SSG challenges in the Pacific, in August 2008 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pacific Centre and Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) initiated a joint initiative. This began with high level discussions with key stakeholder groups in five target countries: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. These missions were supported by DCAF. The scoping missions resulted in a draft report assessing immediate SSG needs and opportunities. Subsequently, UNDP in cooperation with PIFS hosted a Regional Conference on \u201cSecurity Sector Governance in the Pacific\u201d in Tonga from 27 \u2013 30 April 2009. This ensured that the concept was designed in a way that was relevant to the Pacific. Following the Regional Conference, UNDP and PIFS presented a joint paper to the Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC). The FRSC endorsed the development of regional and national policies and programming assistance to strengthen SSG in the Pacific region. This publication is intended to support regional and national stakeholders to develop appropriate policies and programming. However, we recognise that much remains to be done in terms of reviewing, assessing, and evaluating existing efforts and capacity constraints to inform future programming. UNDP and PIFS will therefore continue to work together to further advance this agenda in the Pacific. Rick Nimmo Director \u2013 Political Governance and Security Programme Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat Jean-Luc Stalon Senior Regional Crisis Prevention & Recovery Advisor/ Programme Manager UNDP Pacific Centre Foreword The Pacific region has been affected by violent conflict in Solomon Islands and Bougainville, Papua New Guinea; social unrest and riots in Tonga and Vanuatu; and political crises caused by military and civilian coups in Fiji. There have also been significant challenges to effective civilian oversight of security institutions. Security institutions in the Pacific region have a special responsibility in society to support democracy and human rights and to protect citizens from harm. This considerable responsibility underpins the essential compact that exists between security institutions and the societies they are meant to protect and defend. Such concepts are essential to achieving the objectives of good governance and security as enshrined in the Pacific Plan. Overall the key security governance challenges in the Pacific region, as with experiences of other nations around the globe, revolve around promoting security institutions which are transparent, accountable and fully cognizant of their roles and responsibilities. Each country needs to ensure adequate security for the population and to safeguard the civil liberties and freedoms codified in their respective constitutions and national laws. To deal with these challenges the Pacific has moved towards closer regional integration and cooperation, which underpins the Pacific Plan and Pacific Islands Forum leader\u2019s communiqu\u00e9s and declarations. However, it is becoming apparent that more has to be done to achieve the leader\u2019s vision for a peaceful, secure and prosperous region. Achieving the vision requires fresh thinking and innovative approaches. Effective security sector governance (SSG) is one such approach. It seeks to make people, communities and states more secure by emphasizing constitutionalism and civil supremacy. It does this by instilling a sense of service among security providers and by locating the functioning elements of the entire security system within the broader framework of the rule of law and respect for universally accepted human rights.

It is structured into two main parts. Part One Why security sector governance is vital for a secure and prosperous region This section details the evolution of the SSG policy concept to situate the key challenges to security and stability in the Pacific. It also highlights the ways weak SSG has affected the region and the importance of a security sector that adheres to the principles of transparency and accountability. These principles enhance the protection of human rights, prevent violent conflict and political crises, ensure security for the poor and provides an enabling environment for economic development. Key security sector governance principles, elements and actors This section of the publication provides some key SSG principles based on United Nations (UN) and UNDP experience and an overview of the key SSG strategic elements and actors by focusing on good practice and the current situation in the Pacific. The four key strategic elements are: Legal Frameworks: Essential to ensure the effectiveness, accountability and transparency of security institutions. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities within and among security institutions are crucial in defining legitimate mandates for oversight. Executive - Strategic Security Policy Direction and Decision Making: Primary responsibility for setting security priorities, determining the roles and responsibilities of key security institutions, coordinating the implementation of security decisions and the proper institutional management of security services. Executive Summary Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 12 13 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Democratic Oversight \u2013 Legislature, Judiciary, Accountability Institutions, Civil Society and the Media: Essential to ensuring accountability of security actors and subordination to the executive branch which manages them; effective oversight also helps to ensure compliance and respect for the principles of the rule of law. Engagement with civil society and the media enables the perspectives of ordinary people and important stakeholders in the general population (such as women and ethnic and other minority groups) to be incorporated into policy making and oversight processes. Gender and Governance of Security Institutions: A gender analysis and perspective ensures that the different security needs and priorities for men and women inform the formulation of security policy and ensures better oversight and accountability of security institutions. UNDP and PIFS efforts to enhance security sector governance in the region In 2008, UNDP and PIFS designed a strategic initiative to enhance the governance of security institutions in the Pacific. The first phase involved scoping missions undertaken by UNDP and DCAF, observed and supported by PIFS, in five target countries: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. To build on the scoping missions and identify priority needs and capacity constraints UNDP, in cooperation with PIFS, organized a Regional Conference from 27 \u2013 30 April 2009, in Tonga. During the conference, national stakeholders had the opportunity to present their current situation and undertook group work that resulted in preliminary national priority areas. The process also highlighted key common regional priorities requiring support: Development of strategic security policies and strategies; Capacity-strengthening programmes for civil society; Provision of support to improve parliamentary oversight; Development of gender-sensitive policies and programmes; and Strengthening the capacity of ombudsman institutions to improve accountability of the security sector. In June 2009, the FRSC endorsed the development of regional and national policies and programming assistance to strengthen security sector governance in the Pacific region. Since then, given the FRSC endorsement and conference outcomes, UNDP and PIFS have undertaken national security sector governance strategic planning to agree national level priorities and programming activities to commence in 2010. Part Two Country Case Studies This section of the publication provides five country case studies: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu based on background research and interviews conducted in the target countries during late 2008 and early 2009. The analysis is best described as a scoping study, which had the purpose of assessing if there was added value in developing assistance programmes to improve SSG in the Pacific region. The scoping study mapped the regional and national contexts, key security sector governance challenges, existing security frameworks and structures in place, and identified key opportunities to enhance SSG in the five target countries. The country case studies are structured as follows: Brief situation analysis Key security sector governance challenges Opportunities National priorities \u2013 determined by country delegations during the Regional Conference.

However, it is important to note that the People\u2019s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress included a Working Group on the role of Fiji\u2019s security forces in national development. The Working Group came up with a number of recommendations to reform law enforcement agencies and security institutions. With this in mind, the People\u2019s Charter views are one of many possible views, which will need to be considered once the basic principles of SSG have been restored. Papua New Guinea Government The government is in the early stages of strategic planning towards the formulation of a national security policy. This provides an opportunity to set national security priorities; determine the role of security institutions and any institutional reforms required; strengthen the capacity of civilians to coordinate security actors; determine oversight mechanisms with parliament; determine the proper accountability mechanisms of the sector through formal legislation; and determine the resources needed to maintain security and law and order in Papua New Guinea. Parliament There exists opportunities and demand to support the building of capacities and skills of committee members and staff to monitor and oversee security sector policy development, practices and budgeting issues. Ombudsman Commission The Ombudsman Commission is actively engaged on security sector oversight activities \u2013 specifically dealing with complaints against the police through an MOA. This practice provides an excellent model to be replicated with other security institutions such as Papua New Guinea Defence Force and customs agency. Civil Society The establishment of a Centre for Civil Society by the Ministry of Community Development provides an entry-point to enhance the research, advocacy and analytical capacities of a core group of civil society organisations focused on security issues. Military and Law Enforcement Given that the minister of police has initiated a process to increase the human resource strength of the police to 10,000 by 2010, there is an opportunity to enhance the training of new cadets on engaging with communities, strategic planning, accountability, leadership and financial management. Summary of Country Opportunities to Enhance Security Sector Governance During the scoping missions, a number of potential entry-points for security governance programming for each of the target countries were identified. This list is not exhaustive and is only meant to initiate country-focused discussions on programming and possible support opportunities. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 14 15 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 The government of Papua New Guinea Nation Building Programme with the UN Country Team includes specific work to enhance the capacity of police in their response to gender based violence, which provides a platform to improve overall internal accountability of the police. The military is currently assessing the issue of a Military Ombudsman in coordination with the Ombudsman Commission. The MOA between the Ombudsman Commission and police provides a model for the PNGDF, and the opportunity to harmonise approaches. The Intelligence Division of the Military is undertaking a security assessment process in the provinces, which could benefit from additional support in terms of strategic policy formulation and implementation. Solomon Islands Government Following the parliamentary review of the International Facilitation Act, it is an opportune time to discuss the need for an overarching national security policy that provides a long- term vision, bearing in mind a future without the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. If the government decides to develop a national security policy, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office will need capacity enhancement to ensure policy direction, adequate public consultations and coordination of the process. Truth and Reconciliation Commission offers a space to address police involvement during the conflict and design corrective and preventative measures. Parliament With the establishment of a law and justice committee in parliament, it is a suitable time to discuss the needs and priorities of the new committee. Constitutional and Electoral Commission The ongoing constitutional and electoral reform process provides an entry-point for establishing appropriate and context specific legislative oversight mechanisms for the security sector. Anti-Corruption Task Force The establishment of an Anti-Corruption Task Force provides an entry-point for determining which accountability institutions should be responsible for receiving and dealing with complaints and corruption claims against security institutions. Civil Society A cluster of civil society organisations exist sufficient to begin a substantive start-up capacity development programme focusing on enhancing research, analytical and advocacy skills to engage with relevant security institutions.

Legislative Assembly With ongoing political reforms and police reform being a key issue, the capacity of the Legislative Assembly to scrutinise the development of security sector policy and practices will grow at the national level. Against the background of the ongoing reform process, there is a clear interest in developing the number and work of the committees in line with the agreed format of the reform process. Ombudsman / Commissioner for Public Relations The possible role of the Ombudsman / Commissioner for Public Relations in monitoring the security sector can be clarified in order to provide a mechanism for the recording and systematic handling of public complaints about the security sector. Civil Society Given current political and police reform processes, opportunities exist to support civil society to develop a more effective platform for interaction with the Legislative Assembly, the security sector and government agencies to provide valuable inputs into the police reform, general oversight processes, and the amendment of policing policy and practices. Tonga Police Service The ongoing police reform process provides an opportunity to discuss: how to improve the interaction between citizens and communities; ways of dealing with complaints against police behaviour, i.e. Police Complaints Authority and Code of Conduct; and mechanisms for engagement between the police and governance institutions. Vanuatu Government & Parliament The reforms initiated by the ministry of internal affairs and justice, the creation of parliamentary committees and the high-level of awareness provide an enabling environment to discuss an overarching framework for security governance in Vanuatu. This could include the formulation of a security policy, plans to strengthen governmental coordination mechanisms, legislative frameworks and oversight mechanisms. Civil Society Civil society already plays a strong role in advocacy matters. Support could be provided to improve research, analysis and advocacy to enhance their engagement with parliament and its relevant committees, and feed into security policy and debates, for example on the role of the Vanuatu Mobile Force. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 16 17 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 1.1 Evolution of the Security Sector Governance Policy Concept The delivery of vital services such as justice and security is one of the crucial functions of an effective state. Since the end of the Cold War in 1989 a number of countries have undertaken noteworthy efforts to reform their security institutions. This was driven by the understanding that an ineffective and poorly managed security sector does not provide security to citizens, or actively undermines it through the inappropriate use of force. This represents a decisive obstacle to development and the progressive realization of human rights. As a result, security sector reform (SSR) as a policy concept emerged. SSR aims to institutionalize a professional security sector that is effective, responsive, efficient, legitimate, apolitical and accountable to the citizens whom it is duty-bound to protect. Put differently, security sector reform is: ..at its core an attempt to make the military and police accountable to laws, democratic oversight and checks and balances, rather than subject to the discretion of individual commanders or police chiefs. Impunity in the security sector weakens legitimacy and perpetuates human rights violations.3 Part 1 1. Why is security sector governance vital for a stable and prosperous Pacific? Effectiveness of security, justice and oversight institutions, including civil society/non-state actors Democratic governance of security and justice actors and institutions, including non-state, management policies and practices SSR: Enhancing security and justice service delivery The foundations for engagement in SSR needs to be facilitated through fostering political support for SSR Figure 1: OECD DAC Approach to Security Sector Reform \u201cThere is a growing consensus that accountability and the rule of law are necessary to strengthen citizen safety, trust and legitimacy, both in the short term peace-building scenarios and in the longer term state-building context. There is a growing understanding that if all groups in society are treated equally under the law, by the police and in the courts, the likelihood of conflict drops and the environment for development is vastly improved.\u201d2 Since the 1990s, SSR processes have varied, taking into account the different national and regional contexts, histories and cultures in which they have taken place. The concept continues to undergo evolution through the experiences of countries, the UN system, bilateral donors, regional organizations and non-governmental organizations.

It also provides operational support at the country level through missions such as the EU Legal Assistance Mission in Kosovo, EU Police Mission in Afghanistan and the EU Advisory and Assistance Mission for Security Reform and EU Police Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) provides assistance for SSR and defence reform across the Partnership for Peace space; The Economic Community of West African States has established guidelines on SSR and supports SSR processes in Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia and Sierra Leone; In the Pacific, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has provided support since 2003 to the Government of Solomon Islands, initially to restore order but now to build capacities for long-term development and stability; and A number of non-governmental organizations and think tanks such as the Latin American School of Social Sciences, DCAF, International Alert and Saferworld have positioned themselves globally within the debate on SSR by documenting lessons learned and providing policy advice on issues such as democratic control and oversight, security policy and decision making, defence, justice, police, legal, intelligence, customs and immigration reform, community-policing and regulation of private security companies4. All these experiences have contributed to establishing a significant body of knowledge and expertise in the field of SSR (see annex two). The term security sector governance (SSG) emerged within this broader context of SSR in the 1990s. At this time, a transition process was underway in the newly independent states in Central and Eastern Europe (see box 1) as these countries began to establish oversight frameworks for the security sector to ensure a decisive break from their authoritarian past. As part of this process, strategic planning, demobilisation and retraining took place within the defence, law enforcement and intelligence sectors, resulting in revised strategic directions, new institutions, and chains of command; the executive began to put in place security policies that reflected domestic expectations and international obligations; legislatures began to actively engage on security matters; and civil society and the media began to acquire the tools to monitor security policy and practice. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 18 19 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Since the early SSR efforts the UN has supported national authorities to provide effective, efficient and accountable security and justice services. In 2008 the UN Secretary-General provided much needed strategic direction to the UN\u2019s efforts through his report entitled \u2018Securing Peace and Development: the Role of the United Nations in Supporting Security Sector Reform.\u2019 The report described SSR as a process of assessment, review and implementation led by national authorities with the goal being to: Support States and societies in developing effective, inclusive and accountable security institutions so as to contribute to international peace and security, sustainable development and the enjoyment of human rights by all. At the core of the UN\u2019s approach to SSR is the understanding that it should only be undertaken on the basis of a national request. The cornerstone of the UN\u2019s approach to SSR is national ownership. Laurie Nathan (2007) makes a strong case for the pragmatic importance of national ownership, which aligns with the UN\u2019s own thinking: The imperative of local ownership is both a matter of respect and a pragmatic necessity. The bottom line is that reforms that are not shaped and driven by local actors are unlikely to be implemented properly and sustained. In the absence of local ownership, SSR is bound to fail. Local ownership is therefore more than an important theme. It should constitute the fundamental framework and point of departure for security reform.5 In concluding the \u2018Securing Peace and Development UN report, the Secretary-General emphasised that there are no quick fixes for establishing effective and accountable security institutions. The development of strategies, structures and capacities is a time- consuming effort. The evolution of perspectives, dialogue and understanding is, equally, a long-term process.6 UNDP\u2019s initial thinking on security sector governance was articulated in the 2002 Human Development Report on \u2018Deepening Democracy in a Fragmented World,\u2019 which examined political participation as a dimension of human development.7 The report argued that democratic governance of security forces is the From the experiences in Central and Eastern Europe during the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c2de0f45-6dad-44f3-8a1f-55f87b857be6": {"__data__": {"id_": "c2de0f45-6dad-44f3-8a1f-55f87b857be6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "665fb0968737f1d9b146f765855411fee3bedcdfdf22acc836e132debc6fe822"}, "3": {"node_id": "40eb814e-5d5c-4a48-91c7-3d119d287f05", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "129b43de6e3d56e452120580196e5367893cb20b8f43f66a6988da063f2933ff"}}, "hash": "6e99e9a546cf86b2479c8a087b61829c0d8874987beb5744f4d02793aecd897e", "text": "1990s, key criteria for successful implementation of reform efforts have been posited.

From these experiences, UNDP has learned some key lessons: that SSR plays a vital role in breaking the vicious circle of conflict, insecurity and underdevelopment, and that: Such issues as normative and consultative frameworks, institutional management, and oversight mechanisms are often neglected in a security sector reform process, which can undermine the objectives, intended to be achieved by such reform and result in a net decrease in security.9 Consequently, UNDP understands SSR as fundamentally a governance issue whether in conflict, post-conflict or developing country contexts. As a result, UNDP\u2019s contribution to SSR is to provide support to Member States and regional organisations to enhance the governance of security institutions. Subsequently, for UNDP SSG is an institutional framework, set of standards and practices conducive to providing effective and responsive security services to the people and ensuring security institutions\u2019 are accountable under the law. This contributes to an enabling environment for real improvements in people\u2019s lives and in the choices and opportunities open to them. It also builds and consolidates the rule of law.

There are social factors that make for a fertile ground for conflict and criminality such as high population growth unmatched by economic development, growing levels of poverty and social exclusion, poor infrastructure and government service delivery, corruption and poor governance, land management and tenure system, internal migration and urbanization, uneven patterns of development, and the high levels of social dislocation accompanying Pacific Island Countries (PICs) difficult integration into the global economy. The police, military, judicial officers, customs, immigration and correctional services have a vital role in ensuring security and preventing instability by upholding the rule of law, ensuring fair, timely and adequate justice and ensuring the territorial integrity and sovereignty of PICs. However, the region has had to deal with the serious political and socio-economic impacts of security institutions challenging the established governance structures (see box 2). The following section provides an overview of these key challenges focusing on Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu \u2013 the target countries of the regional initiative. Fiji Islands have experienced social tensions as a result of a range of structural factors (e.g. land management, segregated service provision in education and polarized identities primarily \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 between Fijians and Indo-Fijians) that have originated in the colonial past of the country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40eb814e-5d5c-4a48-91c7-3d119d287f05": {"__data__": {"id_": "40eb814e-5d5c-4a48-91c7-3d119d287f05", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "665fb0968737f1d9b146f765855411fee3bedcdfdf22acc836e132debc6fe822"}, "2": {"node_id": "c2de0f45-6dad-44f3-8a1f-55f87b857be6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6e99e9a546cf86b2479c8a087b61829c0d8874987beb5744f4d02793aecd897e"}}, "hash": "129b43de6e3d56e452120580196e5367893cb20b8f43f66a6988da063f2933ff", "text": "In more recent history, Fiji has had to deal with the significant political, economic and social consequences of military coups in 1987 and 2006 and a civilian coup in 2000.

Papua New Guinea has suffered from a range of violent conflicts and high levels of violence in recent years. The island of Bougainville was devastated by a civil war between local groups and the central government. About 60,000 people were displaced and an estimated 10,000 people died. While the situation in Bougainville appears to be improving, the law and order situation on the mainland is increasingly worrying. In the oil-rich Highlands regular clashes between competing clans over resources have caused dozens of deaths, injuries, widespread destruction of private and public property, and infrastructure. There are also significant challenges to law and order due to the circulation of illicit small arms and light weapons and increasing rates of violent crime in urban and rural areas. Solomon Islands was significantly affected by conflict and violence between the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM) of the island Guadalcanal and the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF), supported by parts of the Malaitan dominated police force from 1998 \u2013 2003. This also included a joint coup by the MEF and police force in June 2000. In 2003, the Solomon Islands government requested the Pacific Islands Forum to restore law and order, which they did through RAMSI. The Solomon Islands are now in a post-conflict situation with significant state-building, law and order and economic recovery challenges.

In 2001 the role of security institutions was further debated during the FRSC meeting. The FRSC was informed of two critical and inter-related issues: the strained relations between the military/paramilitaries and police in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu; and the very low level of public confidence in the police and military/paramilitary forces in the four countries. Another perception coalesced that security institutions had become overly involved in national affairs and consequently had increased their political leverage. In some cases this leverage was used to increase their budgets. As a result, during the presentation of a paper on Melanesian Security to the FRSC, it was recommended that in order to ensure effective government, restore public confidence and enhance security in the region, there needed to be a focus on \u201cenhancing the quality, integrity and impartiality of disciplined forces.\u201d 10 1.3 The Consequences of Weak Security Sector Governance The incidents of violent conflict, political crisis and social unrest in the Pacific have had serious impacts on internal stability and sustainable development, some of which had immediate consequences for the region and all of which had \u2013 and still have \u2013 the potential to reverberate across the region. A non-transparent security sector creates an environment that is conducive to a range of abuses, including: systematic violations of human rights on the part of security institutions; the direct intervention of security institutions in national political processes, including during conflict; and reduced human and economic development. These kinds of interventions reduce confidence in security institutions, which in turn affects their ability to ensure freedom from fear. Human Rights Abuses The state is the key duty-bearer of international and national human rights obligations, as well as having the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence within its territory. The security sector is clearly one way the state respects, protects and fulfils its human rights obligations. Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu are signatories to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and have ratified the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which enshrine the right to security and justice. The target countries (except Tonga) are also signatories to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Nevertheless, despite this commitment, the Pacific region has seen incidents indicative of low levels of security sector governance in recent years. The security sectors have occasionally been a major source of insecurity (see Box 2) and have committed human rights abuses against domestic populations.11 These types of abuses generally result in the militarization of society, making it harder to deal with existing tensions in a non-violent manner.12 Violent Conflict and Political Crises Security institutions have contributed to conflict and instability in the region because they have reflected and perpetuated differences in society. This has been seen in cases where the police or military have supported particular interest groups or militias based on ethnic differences, such as in Solomon Islands and Fiji. Security institutions in the region have also been involved in the escalation of violence and inter-group tensions, through such actions as perpetrating military coups, reacting to civil and political unrest through the excessive use of force and arbitrarily detaining political activists.13 These situations highlight that a badly managed or unprofessional security sector can lead to governments being unable to guarantee the security of their citizens and consequently the state governance structures losing legitimacy and authority. As has been witnessed in other regions of the world, this can also result in the civilian population seeking security guarantees by other means, leading to the proliferation of non-statutory security forces and a spread of weapons to equip them. Reduced Human Development Outcomes In the Pacific, violent conflicts have damaged livelihoods \u2013 caused displacement, limited movement resulting in social segregation and have affected access to capital, land and markets. They have reduced social capital by affecting the long-term health and education of the young. They have eroded institutional capacity of government and civil society, which has an effect on service delivery and meeting people\u2019s basic needs. Armed violence and insecurity have adversely affected mobility and hence the ability to market cash crops or access essential services,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "52430a30-ab6e-4fd6-b781-25001c55274b": {"__data__": {"id_": "52430a30-ab6e-4fd6-b781-25001c55274b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4e894620e2d2e736c74f77deb740d307ef44835c8a6bb72c68f4b5e3aed74634"}}, "hash": "4e894620e2d2e736c74f77deb740d307ef44835c8a6bb72c68f4b5e3aed74634", "text": "which has lead to a contraction of the cash economy in rural areas, and caused small- scale producers to return to primarily subsistence-based economies (see box 3).14 Recent research has highlighted that security matters to the poor and vulnerable, \u201cto one degree or another, poor people speak of declining public safety as an element of increasing insecurity in almost every country, in both rural and urban areas.\u201d15 This situation can be seen in the Pacific with rising crime rates, especially in urban centres, and some of the highest reported statistics of sexual and gender-based violence in the world.16 When policing is inadequate, when injustice prevails and militaries are corrupt, the most vulnerable segments of society, which are in most cases women and children, suffer disproportionately from crime, insecurity and fear. As a result, the poor and vulnerable are most in need of a professional and well-functioning security sector. Where the security sector is not accountable to democratic institutions of governance, human development is not sustainable. Physical security is necessary to make development possible. Without reform of security policies and institutions that address incentives and expectations, other development and capacity building endeavours will be largely futile.17 Poor Economic Development Recent research found a clear and straightforward effect of a coup: in the year of the shock it reduced growth around 3.5 percent, which adds up to 7 percent of national income. It also found that for the first three years after a coup there is a sharp and significant economic deterioration, and even by the fifth year the economic situation is worse than prior to the coup.18 Research has also found that coups and subsequent military regimes result in reduced international and local investment, increased expenditure for those security institutions that perpetrated the coup, reduced oversight of security budgets and weakened public financial management. In situations where the government is unable or unwilling to control the expenditure of security institutions it has resulted in public money being wasted on unnecessary and/or over-priced equipment; and public money has been diverted from essential services and poverty reduction efforts.19 In the Pacific there have been comparable results in Fiji (see figure 3). After the 1987 and 2000 coups investor confidence was undermined, the image of tourism was damaged, there were trade bans and reduced international funding. In 1987 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) fell by 6.4 percent, in 2000 the economy contracted by 9.3 percent reflecting the impact of political instability and after the 2006 coup there was close to 8 percent contraction. The four coups have resulted in emigration, an erosion of the skills base and the business community - undermining long-term growth prospects.20 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 24 25 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 In 2005 an armed violence assessment was commissioned and funded by the UNDP country office as part of preparatory assistance project, which was designed to assist the government of PNG and the UNDP country office develop an integrated strategy to respond to the challenges of armed violence in conflict and post-conflict situations. The report was undertaken by the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey and the Australian National University\u2019s State Society and Governance in Melanesia Project in collaboration with researchers from the University of Papua New Guinea, the Southern Highlands and Meri Kirap \u2013 a local PNG based NGO. The key findings in terms of armed violence impact on human development were as follows: Actual and threatened violence significantly hampers mobility and restricts access to markets and essential services in both Southern Highlands Province (SHP) and National Capital District (NCD). More than a third of respondents in SHP and 21 percent of respondents in NCD reported that they had been unable to access local markets in the six months to May 2005. While 51 and 12 per cent of SHP and NCD respondents respectively reported that they or someone in their family had been unable to access health services due to actual or threatened violence. Restricted access to essential services due to violence was most pronounced in SHP\u2019s Hela region and NCD\u2019s settlements. Four out of five households in the Hela region had been unable to access essential health services in the six months prior to the survey due to actual and threatened violence. In NCD, 70 per cent of those households unable to access health services in the previous six months were located in the settlements. Governance has been severely compromised by increasing levels of armed violence, but service delivery failure is also contributing to armed violence and insecurity.

Port Moresby: UNDP Papua New Guinea Impacts of Armed Violence on Human Development Box 3 Insecurity, conflict and social unrest have also significantly affected other PIC economies (see figure 3). In Solomon Islands the Tensions caused massive economic costs (see box 4). The police played a significant role in perpetuating the conflict and contributed to significant economic underdevelopment through its inability to maintain the rule of law, its part in overthrowing the government in 2000 and subsequent demands made by special constables. In Tonga, a 20 percent cut in the civil service in mid-2006 and riots that destroyed a large part of the business district of the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, in November that year led to a 3.5 percent contraction in GDP in the 2007 financial year. Also as a consequence of riots in 2006, a range of sub sectors were hurt, including commerce, hotels and restaurants, transport and communications, financial and real estate services, and manufacturing. Tourism receipts in the 2007 financial year dropped by 10.4 percent. Additionally, expenditure had to be increased for internal security purposes.22 In Papua News Guinea crime and armed violence has had a significant impact on the economy. It has made the cost of doing business high, through insurance premiums, staff turnover, loss of productivity and the growing costs of private security. Research has suggested that the direct financial cost of crime amounted to 4.66 percent of PNG\u2019s GDP in 1995.23 It also hinders business expansion and the creation of employment opportunities and results in forgone foreign investment.24 These examples have highlighted the considerable economic impacts of coups, instability, insecurity and social unrest in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tonga. 1.4 The Importance of Effective Security Sector Governance for the Pacific Region Each of the target countries has initiated national reform processes to improve security services to their populations and to ensure security institutions are accountable under the law.

Fish export revenue, which suffered as a result of low prices and civil unrest, sank from SI$195 million in 1999 to SI$45 million in 2000. This sectors contribution to GDP fell by an estimated 42 per cent in 2000. Agricultural output dropped by over 50 percent from the beginning of 1999 to the end of 2000. Other key sectors in the economy, such as logs, copra, and cocoa suffered as a result of the disturbances, although they all continued to export in June 2000. Gold from the Gold Ridge mine on Guadalcanal had begun to make a significant contribution to exports before the mine was closed in June 2000. Rapid decline in economic growth. Between 1999 and 2003 the economy contracted by 26 percent and GDP per capita in United States dollars fell by half. Infrastructure damage estimated at over SI$250 million (equivalent to 20 per cent of Solomon Islands GDP).

Since the 2006 coup the military regime has initiated economic and governance reforms, which are contained within the Strategic Framework for Change and Roadmap process. Before this, there was a working group as part of the People\u2019s Charter that was tasked with developing recommendations on the appropriate role of the Fiji security forces in national development. However, it is unclear whether those recommendations will be addressed in a genuinely consultative or participatory manner by the military regime. In Papua New Guinea, the government is working on national security policy through a well-developed security decision-making structure. There has been significant law and justice sector reform through a sectoral approach. In 2004, the Minister of Internal Security initiated a wide-ranging administrative review of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, which resulted in detailed recommendations for reform. Since 2008, the handling of police complaints has improved significantly due to a Memorandum of Agreement between the police and Ombudsman Commission, improving overall accountability (see example 5). In Solomon Islands, since the Tensions, there have been significant reforms of the economic and governance systems and a marked improvement in law and order. Significant capacity building has been focused on improving the quality, capacity and discipline of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. Also, the parliament has played a prominent role in determining the future direction of the RAMSI through an extensive review of the 2003 International Assistance Facilitation Act (see example 4). In Tonga, during the riots it can be argued that the system in place worked with the Tonga Defence Service designed to work as an extraordinary law enforcement agency in a time of crisis. Also, the government ensured the appropriate legislation was fast tracked to ensure any response was legal. Following the November 2006 riots, there have been extensive reform and capacity development efforts targeted at the Tonga Police Force to improve its effectiveness and public confidence in it. This has taken place against the backdrop of the Constitutional and Electoral Reform Commission looking into the future directions of the governance structure in Tonga. In Vanuatu, in 2001 under threat from an impending no confidence vote, incumbent Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Barak Sope, sought police help to stage a coup and declare a state of emergency. The Commissioner of Police\u2019s refusal to be drawn into the illegal plan allowed the constitutional order to be maintained. Recently, the Ministry of Justice has developed a law and justice sector policy and action plan to improve law and order, accountability and eradicate corruption. Moreover, the Ministry of Internal Affairs recently held a National Policy Direction Conference on Security, Decentralisation and Good Governance. This has structured discussions on the need for a comprehensive security policy and extensive consultations on the future role of the Vanuatu Police and Mobile Forces. However, as the previous section highlighted, there have been noteworthy challenges to civilian control of security institutions in the target countries. These challenges are linked to key governance deficiencies. Recent research and consultations by UNDP and PIFS provides an initial articulation of these deficiencies: The lack of and weak or outdated legal frameworks to deal with security concerns; The lack of overarching security policies, including the appropriate role of security institutions, which are agreed through public consultation; Institutional and capacity constraints within line ministries responsible for security policy formulation and management; Executive dominance and limited capacity amongst MPs and within parliamentary secretariats to engage with security matters; Weak and overlapping mandates and internal capacity constraints within accountability institutions to deal with complaints against and maladministration of security institutions; and A lack of critical mass within civil society that has expertise on security issues and their continued exclusion from formal discussions on security matters. Overall, the SSG challenge in the target countries, as with experiences of other nations around the world, revolve around promoting security sectors which are transparent, accountable and fully cognizant of their Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 28 29 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 roles and responsibilities; to ensure adequate security for the population and safeguard the civil liberties and freedoms enshrined in their respective constitutions and national laws.

These enable the police and military to provide the best support for the key objectives of good governance and the creation of secure and prosperous societies. There are many recent experiences in new democracies in Africa, coup- prone countries in Latin America and in transition countries in Eastern Europe undertaking successful reform efforts, resulting in improved relations between civilians and security services. These efforts have also contributed to the strengthening of democratic institutions and politics. Effective SSG seeks to make people, communities and states more secure by emphasizing constitutionalism and civil supremacy, by instilling a sense of service among security providers and by locating the functioning elements of the entire security system within the broader framework of the rule of law and respect for human rights.25 A well-managed and accountable security sector protects human rights, prevents conflict from occurring and ensures countries recover from conflict, and provides an enabling environment for sustainable human and economic development. Human rights protection The security sector in the region has a special responsibility within society to support democracy and human rights and to protect citizens, including those most vulnerable from harm. This considerable responsibility underpins the essential compact that exists between security forces and the societies they are meant to protect and defend. Such concepts are essential to achieving the objectives of good governance and security as enshrined in the Pacific Plan. Conflict Prevention and Recovery Strengthening democratic governance of security institutions is critical for states as they transcend histories of conflict and violence. In such contexts, effective and accountable security institutions are also critical to reducing the risk of a relapse of conflict. For states that have not recently emerged from a conflict environment, effective governance of security institutions is essential in consolidating democratic gains and in preventing conflict from erupting in the first place. In post-conflict environments there is a rare opportunity for national governments to reform and strengthen governance of security institutions to improve accountability and efficiency, as has been witnessed in the Solomon Islands through the efforts of successive governments supported by RAMSI. In countries affected by legacies of politicized armed forces, as well as military or police intervention in politics, good security governance is essential. If properly constituted and reformed, security institutions can act as a force for good, thereby helping to reduce instability and contributing to a reduction in human suffering. Enabling environment for economic and human development Governance reform of the security sector is now widely recognized as one of the essential conditions for sustainable human development as it encourages national and international investment and provides an environment where individuals and communities feel safe and able to go about their daily lives. This contributes to poverty reduction efforts, which is often at the core of societal instability. 2.1 From Honiara to Biketawa Declaration The region is engaged with a difficult and diverse set of security threats such as: a) developing effective responses to political crises and violent conflict; b) rising crime rates and civil disturbances, particularly in the urban centres; c) sexual and gender-based violence, with some of the highest documented levels in the world; d) weak border security and increasing transnational organized crime, including human trafficking, drugs and small arms smuggling and illicit financial transactions; and e) the global security challenges of terrorism. The region also faces broader governance challenges such as: enhancing the transparency of political and budgetary processes; strengthening accountability mechanisms; improving government effectiveness; managing increasing demands of public institutions with limited human and fiscal resources; and protecting human rights. The success of measures taken to address these wider challenges will remain inter-related with responses to those faced in the security sphere. The recognition that these are the common regional security threats and governance challenges has created an impetus for collective regional responses (see Box 5). The Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) is the pre-eminent political body that is mandated to deal with the described regional security threats and governance challenges. Its approach to dealing with political crises, violent conflict, security threats and governance challenges has evolved considerably over the last two decades. The starting point was perhaps the 1992 Honiara Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation, which marked a new collective effort to combat transnational crime. However, the forum did not play an active role in addressing the major political and security challenges at the time in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea or in response to previous coups in Fiji (1987).

We seek a Pacific region that is respected for the quality of its governance, the sustainable management of its resources, the full observance of democratic values and for its defence and promotion of human rights. We seek partnerships with our neighbours and beyond to develop our knowledge, to improve our communications and to ensure a sustainable economic existence for all.\u201d Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Vision to Strengthen Regional Cooperation and Integration, in response to the many challenges facing Pacific Islands Countries (2004) Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 30 31 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Also in 1997, the Forum Leaders agreed on Eight Principles of Accountability and Principles of Good Leadership. There were a number of accompanying reform measures, which contribute not only to the achievement of accountability and good governance but also to an effective and efficient fiscal management and policy, which is also key in the law enforcement and security sector. However, it was not until the double shock of coups in Fiji and Solomon Islands in mid-2000 that the forum developed more forthright steps to address serious regional security threats through the adoption of the Biketawa Declaration. 2.2 Biketawa Declaration and Beyond The declaration set the framework for regional crisis management and conflict resolution. One of the guiding principles of the Biketawa Declaration recognises \u2018the importance of averting the causes of conflict\u2026\u2019, and the declaration directs that the action to be taken in times of crisis: \u2026must constructively address difficult and sensitive issues, underlying causes of tensions and conflict, explicitly raising long-standing and difficult issues, \u201cethnic tensions, socio-economic disparities, lack of good governance, land disputes and erosion of cultural values.27 The Biketawa Declaration also for the first time allowed the Secretary-General of the Forum Secretariat to act in a \u201cgood offices\u201d capacity to address developing security crises and laid out a range of tools. These included statements by Pacific Islands Forum Members, the creation of ministerial action groups, fact-finding missions, the use of eminent persons, third-party mediation, convening of special leaders or ministerial-level meetings, and support for institutions and mechanisms which could assist a resolution.28 The declaration also commits forum members to some key fundamental values including, among others, the importance of averting the causes of conflict, upholding democratic processes and the rule of law, and commitment to good governance, including transparency and accountability. In August 2002, the Forum Leaders adopted the Nasonini Declaration, mainly as a response to the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, which had created new expectations on states in addressing the issue of global terrorism. The declaration committed member states to \u201cgood governance practices as a key fundamental strategy for addressing some of the difficult and sensitive issues underlying the causes of tension and conflict in the region.\u201d29 This evolution in the forum\u2019s approach to regional security led directly to a point where, in a significant shift in policy, RAMSI was overwhelmingly approved to help restore law and order in a fellow forum member country. More recently, within the framework of the Biketawa Declaration, the forum has taken a number of actions following the December 2006 coup in Fiji, including: dispatching an eminent persons\u2019 group; forming a Foreign Ministers Action Group; establishing the Forum-Fiji Working group to engage with interim government officials on credible mechanisms for returning to democracy as soon as possible; a Special Leader\u2019s Retreat in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea; and the suspension of the current military regime in the Republic of the Fiji Islands from full participation in the Pacific Islands Forum with immediate effect from 2 May 2009.

In 2000 Forum Member Countries endorsed the Millennium Declaration, which identified conflict prevention as a key peace and security challenge, recognised the need to strengthen respect for the rule of law in national affairs, and that good governance is necessary to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable development. Between 2001 and 2004 the Forum Secretariat commissioned a series of national security reports, which informed regional approaches and priorities with the endorsement of the outcomes of a regional civil society workshop on peacebuilding and conflict prevention by the FRSC. In 2004 at the 9th Triennial Conference on Pacific Women and 2nd Ministerial Meeting in Nadi to review progress on the Pacific Platform for Action on the Advancement of Women and Gender Equality 2005-2015, Pacific ministers, government officials and civil society representatives recognized peace and security as a critical and emerging issue and added it to the Pacific Platform of Action. In 2005 the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders recognised through the adoption of the Pacific Plan that security (the stable and safe social and political condition) and good governance (the transparent, accountable and equitable management of all resources) are essential for sustainable development and economic growth. Importantly, they also sought a region that would be respected for the quality of its governance, the sustainable management of its resources, the full observance of democratic values and its defence and promotion of human rights. In June 2006 the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat hosted the Gender, Conflict, Peace and Security Regional Workshop, which immediately preceded the annual FRSC. It proved an opportunity to get United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325: Women, Peace and Security on the regional inter- government security agenda. The conference also expressed the need to uphold women\u2019s rights and support their participation in all aspects of conflict prevention, peace negotiations and post-conflict reconstruction in the region. In 2006 the FRSC noted \u2018that potential security challenges included political insecurity, population growth exceeding economic growth, land availability, ethnic politics and public policies of social exclusion, environmental insecurities (land, water, energy), urbanisation, and food shortages\u2019, and directed the Forum Secretariat to prepare a paper on human security and how it is addressed by the evolving Pacific architecture. In 2007 a series of three regional consultations on human security was organised by the UNDP Pacific Centre, in collaboration with PIFS, the University of the South Pacific and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) FemLINKPacific and the Citizens\u2019 Constitutional Forum.31 Following these consultations, the FRSC discussed the final UNDP paper A Human Security Framework for the Pacific.32 The committee confirmed the importance of broadening the concept of security and the security concerns that the FRSC engages with. They also raised a number of concerns that indicated a wish to start the process towards the strengthening of human security and conflict prevention capacity, with a thorough investigation of existing capacities in the region, and the need to guard against a generic approach, as each PIC has a unique cultural framework and specific needs in terms of human security. Officials also warned against the establishment of new institutions to do work that was already underway and emphasised the importance of mapping existing institutions and capacities. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 32 33 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 initiated four national level case studies into human security and conflict prevention in Vanuatu, Samoa, Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia (with a focus on the state of Pohnpei). In order to ensure an inclusive approach to conflict prevention across the Pacific region, countries were chosen from the three sub-regions, with the addition of Kiribati as an atoll country. The aim of the case studies was to gather deeper insights into the manifestations and causes of conflict in the Pacific by focusing on countries that had not benefited from much conflict", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "361371b9-ee01-4e3a-aabd-55fbcba5b38c": {"__data__": {"id_": "361371b9-ee01-4e3a-aabd-55fbcba5b38c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "712e819307ad70cf245e686b8e4faf4f7432e5f5861dc11c0b5da1f7ced72d0f"}}, "hash": "712e819307ad70cf245e686b8e4faf4f7432e5f5861dc11c0b5da1f7ced72d0f", "text": "analysis. The results of the case studies feed into the design of a Human Security Framework for Conflict Prevention. In 2008 following initial work undertaken by the Forum Secretariat in collaboration with the UNDP Pacific Centre, the FRSC mandated the secretariat to develop a regional policy framework for conflict prevention efforts. This framework focuses on two components: Addressing the underlying causes of conflict by linking human security issues and development to conflict, i.e. strengthening analysis and monitoring of the long-term causes of conflict and ensuring development programming is sensitive and responsive to conflict dynamics; and Strengthening the regional architecture for peace & security, including through the Biketawa Declaration. As part of these efforts, the committee also underlined the importance of strengthening gender-sensitive approaches to conflict prevention and resolution. In the last two decades, in response to increased international and regional expectations, the forum has evolved considerably as an institution, in particular, in the way it deals with political crises, violent conflict, security threats and governance challenges. 2.4 Existing Support to Address Security Challenges in the Region There is now relatively well-developed regional policy architecture to deal with conflict, security and law enforcement concerns (see box 5). In the last few decades, key regional institutions and development partners such as Australia and New Zealand have provided significant technical assistance and funding to deal with these concerns. The role of PIFS - the pre-eminent political and policy regional organisation - is to support annual Forum Leaders\u2019 Meetings and other Forum-based Ministerial and official gatherings; deliver advisory and technical services to Forum Member Countries; and implement the Pacific Plan. PIFS has a Political Governance and Security Programme whose aim is to give effect to the vision and decisions of PIF leaders and members through such mechanisms as the FRSC. The principal focus of the programme is to provide strategic and political advice to assist members in developing appropriate regional, sub-regional and national responses to their key security and governance challenges.33 In addition to the assistance provided by the Forum Secretariat, there have been a number of regional programmes initiated to support member countries in improving security and law enforcement, including: the Pacific Judicial Development Program; Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police Secretariat; Pacific Prevention of Domestic Violence Programme and the Pacific Legal Information Institute. Also, there are a number of other regional bodies that support Forum Member Countries such as the Pacific Immigration Director\u2019s Conference and the Oceania Customs Organization. 1. 2. Pacific Islands Forum Regional Security Architecture Box 5 Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) The annual meeting of the FRSC is the principal forum for setting a regional security agenda and identifying priorities for enhancing the capacity of members to respond to internal and external security threats. Security Declarations 1992 Honiara Declaration on Law Enforcement Cooperation: Recognised that an adverse law enforcement environment could threaten the sovereignty, security and economic integrity of Forum members and jeopardise economic and social development. 1997 Aitutaki Declaration on Regional Security Cooperation: Forum Leaders agreed to a number of principles governing security cooperation in the region. 2000 Biketawa Declaration: The declaration sets the framework for regional crisis management and conflict resolution initiatives. 2000 Nadi Framework Initiative: Legal Framework for a Common Approach to Weapons Control in the Pacific region. 2002 Nasonini Declaration on Regional Security: Leaders recognised the need for immediate and sustained regional action in response to the current regional security environment. Pacific Plan (2005) Strategic Objectives Good Governance - Improved transparency, accountability, equity and efficiency in the management and use of resources in the Pacific Security - Improved political and social conditions for stability and safety Alongside the growing collective regional efforts, key bilaterals in the region such as Australia and New Zealand have been providing extensive support to law and justice sector reforms. Targeted assistance has been provided to improve access to justice, policing and crime prevention, accountability mechanisms, the delivery of justice services and to reduce corruption for the populations in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu. In addition, Australia, New Zealand, France, the United Kingdom, United States and China have provided bilateral defence cooperation and assistance to Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Vanuatu. However, to date there have been limited efforts to tackle the SSG governance challenges, which remain vital for a secure and stable region (see chapter one) Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 34 35 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 a) Regional Level Since 2005 the UNDP Pacific Centre has been providing technical assistance and policy advice to enhance the capacity of regional", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1be96b34-97ee-417e-86f8-06bc40a4830a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1be96b34-97ee-417e-86f8-06bc40a4830a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0796a2cc7ea8e0aabac97e8db2e2a5599d3fd81fcfbe0114d1361de9e6acd8a7"}}, "hash": "0796a2cc7ea8e0aabac97e8db2e2a5599d3fd81fcfbe0114d1361de9e6acd8a7", "text": "organisations, governments and civil society organisations to prevent, manage and respond to conflict and carry out socio- economic activities for sustainable post-conflict recovery in the region. During that time, UNDP and PIFS have developed a strong partnership to advance the conflict prevention agenda in the region. In 2008 the UNDP Pacific Centre undertook a thorough internal analysis of key conflict and security issues in the Pacific to identify strategic gaps with a view to anticipating rather than reacting to emerging issues that could cause tensions and instability. This resulted in the design of a new strategic regional initiative to enhance the governance of security institutions in the Pacific. The initiative recognized not only serious challenges to the principle of civilian control of security institutions, and the need to create an enabling environment for development in the region, but also existing policy work by PIFS and assistance provided by development partners to enhance regional integration and cooperation on security and governance issues. In pursuing their vision for the region, Pacific Islands Leaders sought partnerships within the region and beyond. The regional initiative is consistent with the Leaders\u2019 vision. It is through the Forum Secretariat\u2019s support for further exploration of the applicability of 2.5 UNDP and PIFS Regional Security Sector Governance Initiative Figure 4: Schematic of Regional Initiative Regional Policy Model Legislation, policy, technical guidance & consolidating knowledge, good practices & lessons Underpinned by Regional Co-operation & Integration, Forum Norms, Values, Principles Strategic Security Policy, Coordination Mechanisms & Line Ministries Technical Assistance Capacity Development Policy Advice MPs, Parl. Committees, Ombudsman Civil Society Organistions & Media Gender & Security Sector Governance Regional Level National Level international best practice, including drawing on the lessons learned from other nations and regions, that they serve the twin mandates of bolstering security and good governance in the region. As is clear from their vision, Pacific Island Leaders have mandated an obvious body of work for the governments of the Pacific as well as PIFS, which encompasses the field of SSG in supporting two key pillars of the Pacific Plan.34 During the initial phase Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu were chosen as the target countries within a regional framework (see box 6). This was because of the complex security governance challenges they face and in recognition of reform efforts that were underway. However, in each country there has been concern expressed that more work needs to be done to support key national stakeholders to identify public security priorities, develop policy responses and institute appropriate governance arrangements to ensure security institutions are transparent and accountable. The initial phase of the initiative focused on understanding the regional and national context, raising awareness of the key aspects of security sector governance, facilitating relationship building between multiple stakeholders, identifying what efforts already exist and offering programming options focused on opportunities at the regional and national level. From December 2008 to February 2009 UNDP, PIFS and DCAF undertook high level consultations in the five target countries with government ministers, officials, parliamentarians and their support staff, Ombudsmen, civil society representatives and security sector personnel. The consultations provided a better understanding of the regional and national contexts, including what security frameworks and structures are in place, existing programmes of assistance and the identification of opportunities to enhance security sector governance. The in-country consultations subsequently went through a validation process during the Regional Conference on Security Sector Governance organized by UNDP in cooperation with PIFS. That was held in Tonga from 27th to 30th April 2009. The conference was a first step in supporting Pacific Island Countries to determine their own security governance concerns, the resources they will need to deal with them and the strategies that will work best in their context. This conference also enabled participants to share views with different stakeholder groups, ensuring broad ownership of security problems across a variety of actors. During the conference, participating ministers saw value in initiatives to improve security sector governance in the region. Ministers subsequently came up with specific recommendations: The designation of a focal point in the respective countries\u2019 Prime Ministers\u2019 office to coordinate activities related to security sector governance; Undertake national conferences on security sector governance supported by international partners, including UNDP and PIFS; and Raising the profile of security sector governance utilizing relevant regional mechanisms. This includes the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders, FRSC and the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police Meetings.

Such issues are often sensitive or may lack government commitment and require regional buy-in or acceptance before moving into country specific action and follow-up. Common Security and Governance Concerns: At the regional and especially sub-regional level, PICS face broadly similar security and governance challenges. Common Security Sector Governance Priorities: At the recent Regional SSG Conference, key national stakeholders agreed on a number of key common priorities in the sub-region. Collective Response to Regional Security Issues: There is increasing recognition that there are a number of common challenges that require collective action. This is most clearly articulated in the Pacific Plan strategic pillars and responses within the framework of the Biketawa Declaration i.e. RAMSI, Nauru Assistance and to the December 2006 coup in Fiji. Regional principles of security and good governance: The Pacific region has developed a number of normative frameworks for governance i.e., Forum Principles of Good Leadership and Accountability and frameworks for crisis response and management, which are underpinned by agreed forum values including the importance of good governance for security. Economies of Scale: A regional approach to common challenges can reduce the costs of providing services if the number of people benefiting from the service is increased. For example, capacity development activities (e.g. training) can be done more cost effectively on a regional basis. Coordination and harmonisation of actions and policies: At the 40th Annual Pacific Islands Forum Meeting, the leader\u2019s agreed to the Cairns Compact on Strengthening Development Coordination in the Pacific. The key objective of the compact is to drive more effective coordination of available development resources from both Forum Island countries and all development partners. In this regard, there are a number of bilateral, regional and multilateral agencies working on security and governance issues. This requires that a common approach should be used to avoid duplication, which has the potential to enhance efficiency of aid provision for SSG activities. Regional approaches can be useful to strengthen or complement bilateral cooperation: The practical experiences of regions in similar situations can be a powerful way of demonstrating the benefits, risk and challenges of reform, as well as exchanging lessons learned and good practices. During the conference, national participants had the opportunity to present on their current situation and undertook group work that resulted in preliminary national priority areas. The process also highlighted key common regional priorities requiring support: Development of strategic security policies and strategies; Capacity-strengthening programmes for civil society; Provision of support to improve parliamentary oversight; Development of gender-sensitive policies and programmes; and Strengthening the capacity of Ombudsman institutions to improve accountability of the security sector. Following the Regional Conference, PIFS, with the support of UNDP, presented a joint paper to the FRSC of the results of the scoping missions and outcomes of the conference. The presentation enabled full consideration by all Forum Member Countries on how PIFS, in cooperation with other key partners such as UNDP, can support the security sector governance agenda in the region. Subsequently, the FRSC noted the activities undertaken to date surrounding the security initiative and endorsed the development of regional and national policies and programming assistance to strengthen security sector governance in the Pacific region. The next steps at the regional level are to: Develop a regional mechanism to assist countries through policy advice and technical assistance based on expressed needs and demands, including the five common priorities from the regional conference; Enhance regional standards and norms through provision of guidance on good practices; Develop and submit for possible endorsement by Forum Leaders a broad set of Pacific Security Sector Governance Principles; Develop model legislation and inform national policy processes; and Consider other candidate countries that may benefit from similar assistance. b) National Level PIFS and UNDP recognise that assistance provided at the national level to improve security sector governance has to be sufficiently tailored to the needs, priorities and circumstances of Forum Member Countries. Assistance also needs to be flexible enough to respond to changes in the political situation. This requires the development of a process of national debate and reflection on security sector governance. Given the conference outcomes and the FRSC endorsement PIFS, with the support of UNDP, are undertaking country level strategic planning sessions with key stakeholders from government, parliament, civil society, accountability institutions and security institutions in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu.

Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 38 39 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 3.1 Principles of Security Sector Governance The UN Secretary-General\u2019s report on security sector reform laid the foundation for the UN\u2019s support to member states for the development of effective and accountable security institutions. The approach is underpinned by a number of fundamental principles:35 Security, human rights and development are interdependent and mutually reinforcing conditions for sustainable peace; Effectiveness, accountability and democratic governance are mutually reinforcing elements of security; Men and women have different experiences of insecurity and have specific security needs; SSR can only be achieved within the broad framework of the rule of law (RoL) and that strengthening the RoL is the purpose of SSR; and SSR is a multi-stakeholder process, which goes beyond traditional military elements and involves a much wider range of national institutions and actors. The report also detailed a number of common features of an effective and accountable security sector, namely: A legal and/or constitutional framework providing for a legitimate and accountable use of force in accordance with universally accepted human rights norms and standards, including sanctioning mechanisms for the use of force and setting out the roles and responsibilities of different actors; An institutionalized system of governance and management: mechanisms for the direction and oversight of security provided by authorities and institutions, including systems for financial management and review as well as the protection of human rights; Capacities: structures, personnel, equipment and resources to provide effective security; Mechanisms for interaction among security actors: establishing transparent modalities for coordination and cooperation among different actors, based on their respective constitutional/ legal roles and responsibilities; and Culture of service: promoting unity, integrity, discipline, impartiality and respect for human rights among security actors and shaping the manner in which they carry out their duties. UNDP\u2019s experience of supporting national partners to improve the governance of security institutions has been underpinned by the understanding that uniformed and civilian security institutions function most effectively if based on the principles and practice of democratic governance. In this regard, UNDP has elaborated nine key principles of SSG:36 Civilian management of security policy and implementation. The executive determines security policy and exercises control over the security services. It is accountable to citizens, chiefly through parliament and regular elections but also through media scrutiny and public consultation and debate. Legislative oversight of security institutions. A constitutional and legal framework, which constitutes the separation of powers (between government, legislature and the judiciary) and clearly defines the tasks, rights and obligations of the security sector within the institutional checks and balances. Parliament approves security legislation and budgets, performs oversight functions and provides a forum to debate security policy. 3. Security Sector Governance: Good Practice and Pacific Context Judicial Oversight. Independent courts perform judicial functions and various statutory bodies might have watchdog functions in relation to the security services such as Ombudsman, Leadership Code and Security Service Commissions. Compliance and adherence by security institutions to domestic and international law, consistent with human rights standards. The security services execute government policy and carry out their mandates as prescribed by law. Transparency of policymaking and practice among and within security institutions, including financial, administrative and programme management arrangements. Active participation of the media and civil society in security affairs. The engagement of civil society and the media in security affairs enables the perspectives of ordinary people and important sub-sections of the population (such as women and minority groups) to be incorporated into policymaking and oversight processes. Security institutions that protect and promote women\u2019s rights. This means not only ensuring women are participating in all processes related to governance of security institutions but also that policy makers and oversight bodies ensure that security institutions are delivering security and safety for women. Fair and equitable representation in security institutions.

Central government is responsible for setting security strategic direction and for making and implementing policy decisions through coordinating mechanisms and line ministries. They also usually make final decisions on security matters of national importance. However, in some instances there can be a particular mandate to request parliamentary approval. This section focuses on the executive\u2019s role in setting strategic security direction through policymaking, different types of decision-making structures, and how security institutions are accountable to the executive. I). Strategic Security Policy Development Good Practice There is now a general consensus that countries embarking on efforts to enhance the governance of security institutions should have an overarching vision of security to provide a long-term perspective for reform efforts. Such a security vision will need to take into account the local history, culture, values, domestic political and governance dynamics and regional security priorities and arrangements. As the UN Security Council has expressed on several occasions, \u201cit is the sovereign right and primary responsibility of the country concerned to determine the national approach and priorities of security sector reform.\u201d A democratic vision of security has the potential to enhance reform efforts (see box 7). Democratic Vision of Security Box 7 It can provide a normative framework for determining security threats, priorities and allocation of resources in the interests of citizens and vulnerable groups. It can help to shift the locus of power away from informal security networks towards the official security organisations and oversight bodies. It can provide an authoritative mandate and guidance to the officials who are tasked with designing and implementing SSR programmes. It can provide progressive criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of SSR programmes and projects. It can provide benchmarks for civil society organisations and opposition parties to hold government to account for the conduct of the security services. It can provide government and the judiciary with a basis for dealing with human rights abuses and other misconduct by the security services. It can help to ensure that the security services do not pose a threat to citizens. Source: Laurie Nathan (ed.)

Developing a Comprehensive National Security Policy (NSP) Box 8 Conduct a strategic environmental analysis and identify a \u2018national vision\u2019 for the country and its people through broad-based consultation. This process should encompass consultations with CSOs to discuss perceived and actual security concerns \u2013 e.g. through written submissions and direct participation in public meetings. Analyse and prioritise current and future threats and opportunities to the achievement of objectives outlined in the \u2018national vision\u2019. Determine and prioritise national capabilities, both within the security/justice sectors and beyond, that can address security threats and deliver key security services to citizens. This includes the financial basis for implementing the NSP and the general financial management procedures of a given country. Undertake a gap analysis to assess the current capability of national security/justice institutions to address threats and deliver key services, compared with required capabilities. A gap analysis should, where appropriate, be based on sources both within and outside state institutions.

Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 42 43 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Laurie Nathan (2007) has provided a number of useful strategies to shape security policies to meet the needs of vulnerable groups in society: The development of a comprehensive security vision that emphasises the principles of human security, respect for human rights, the rule of law and the accountability of the security services. The inclusion of these principles into the constitution and legislation so that they have a binding status. The design of security reforms and policies in an inclusive and consultative manner that takes seriously the issues raised by citizens and vulnerable groups. Enhancing the capacity of citizens, vulnerable groups and their organisations to lobby for reforms that serve their interests and to participate in public debates on security. The design and administration of local security surveys aimed at identifying and addressing the security needs of poor communities.37 The level of participation and consultation and how the concerns of the population are reflected in the strategic security policy will determine its viability and legitimacy. Line ministries play a crucial role in the formulation and implementation of security policies. Their ministers participate in national security decision-making processes and permanent secretaries work closely with relevant counterparts to ensure information, analysis and options are shared and policy is implemented. In the formulation of the policy framework, equal time and energy should be allocated to the identification of threats and priorities, as well as the design of robust implementation and coordination mechanisms. To ensure the formulation and implementation of effective strategic security policy, national governments should have adequate institutional capacity in terms of staff size, and expertise and skill level of ministers, civil servants and security officials. II). National Security Decision Making and Coordination Structures Good Practice In a number of countries, national security decision- making structures have been set up for different purposes. These are generically known as national security councils or committees (NSCs) depending on whether it is a presidential or Westminster system respectively. NSCs can have different structures in place Step1: Conduct strategic environmental analysis & identify national vision Step 3: Determine and prioritise capabilities required to successfully address key threats and deliver services, incl. acceptable risks & considering affordability Step 4: Determine lead responsibility for delivery each capability & establish means of ensuring effective co-ordination, accountability & oversight National Security Policy: fully co-ordinated across all relevant organisations designed to deliver safety & security to the country & its people & provide the enabling environment for national development Conduct a gap analysis to determine current capability of security - related - organisations Step 2: Analyse and prioritise current & future threats to achieving National Vision Step 5: Establish National Security Policy Figure 6: Process for Developing a National Security Policy that gives it an executive decision making, advisory or implementation and coordination role. In the United States, the National Security Council is formalized in the National Security Act 1947. The NSC is the principal forum used by the president for considering national security and foreign policy matters. The NSC also coordinates policy amongst the various government agencies. In India, there is a national security advisory board (NSAB), which provides advice to the formal National Security Council. The NSAB consists of eminent persons outside the government with expertise on a range of security issues. It provides long-term analysis to the NSC recommends solutions and addresses policy issues referred to it. This is similar to the UK, where the current government established a National Security Forum. The purpose of the forum is to provide independent advice on a variety of national security issues. They provide that advice to the government and the Cabinet Committee on National Security, International Relations and Development (NSID). The NSID is comprised of relevant cabinet ministers, heads of security services, the police, the armed forces, and considers and articulates national security priorities. In formulating a security policy, an NSC can support this through coordinating assessments, identifying threats and priorities and providing a discussion forum within government for ministers and senior officials. It can also lead or provide secretarial support for public consultations.

This can help to ensure a focus on the national interest above ministerial objectives. It can also provide formal or informal coordination between the executive, officials and implementing actors. An effective NSC should support information sharing to make proper decisions and would need the support of the country\u2019s senior leadership and adequate resource allocations of its own.38 Any NSC requires a balance between civilian officials and security personnel whether from the military, police or intelligence agencies. This is particularly important in countries transitioning from conflict and in interventions of security actors in national political affairs. A balanced NSC can help to deter interference and manage conflict. III). Security Sector Accountability to the Executive Government provides clear policy direction, prepares security plans, sets standards or performance indictors, and establishes strong accountability mechanisms. As such: \u201cClear and independent systems of make it easier for security officers to assess and resist illegally motivated or inappropriate orders. Well-functioning accountability systems also generate the sort of public goodwill that makes it more difficult for governments to mistreat security officers for political reasons without public outcry\u201d39 The Chief of Police, Defence, Customs, Immigration and Correctional Services is accountable to the executive, answering directly to a responsible minister who is the political head of the organisation. The Chiefs of the respective security institutions are the administrative head responsible for day-day management, operations, discipline, administration and finances. The responsible minister has a critical role in providing policy guidance, resource allocation through the national and ministerial budget process, and administrative and logistical support. While ministers have responsibility for overseeing the security institutions and providing strategic direction, the security institutions should be responsible for their own operational plans and activities. The line ministries responsible for security institutions need to be based on an appropriate legal foundation, have a clearly articulated mission, function according to established administrative and operational policies, and comprise competent, properly supervised personnel (see box 9).40 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 44 45 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Transforming Line Ministries Responsible for Security Institutions Box 9 Transforming a line ministry responsible for security agencies requires a reasoned and informed process of assessment and strategic planning. Strategic planning is the process by which the ministry can visualize its future and develop the necessary operations to achieve that vision. This involves three main steps: Draft a mission statement clarifying the host of issues present at the start of the planning process. Key issues to identify are the ministry\u2019s major areas of responsibility; the major objectives for the ministry and its constituent components; and the major policy questions, key actors, supporting tasks, and potential \u201cshowstoppers\u201d. Study of the ministry\u2019s internal environment, including analysis of its strengths and weaknesses, major challenges that must be addressed and potential barriers to progress. Assess the external environment, particularly opportunities and threats. What is the political, economic, and social context? The level of technology? Who are the key stakeholders, including legislative and regulatory bodies and civil society groups? This \u201cSWOT\u201d (strengths, weakness, opportunities, and threats) process should generate a strategy for reform by analyzing how the ministry can use its strengths, improve its weaknesses, exploit and capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats. Source: Perito, R. M (2009), \u201cThe Interior Ministry\u2019s Role in Security Sector Reform,\u201d United States Institute of Peace Special Report: <www.usip.org>. The security line ministry is also responsible for overseeing the institutional management of the sector, which is often neglected, particularly in the field of financial management. Few countries have established internal institutional management systems to run effective, transparent and accountable security institutions. Such systems are essential in order to ensure financial and operational efficiency and to prevent corruption and abuse of power. Additionally, effective personnel policy and personnel management (recruitment, staffing, training etc.) is crucial to the development of professional security institutions that adhere to democratic principles, the rule of law and respect of civilian oversight (see box 10). As the implications of the global economic crisis and consequent budgetary cuts are required, this is likely to be an even more pressing issue. Under certain circumstances, the economic crisis may lead some countries to increase the size of their law enforcement agencies to address anticipated law and order problems. Whether countries scale up or scale down their services and institutions, the economic crisis is nevertheless likely to have a significant impact on the security sector. Thus, it is a critical issue to strengthen the capacity of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4825489-8641-46f1-91d5-3b448f81dc83": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4825489-8641-46f1-91d5-3b448f81dc83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4cbc4efa3d146befd265a5ab6a24cd2749fa7240bd1285177868739e4f1546ed"}}, "hash": "4cbc4efa3d146befd265a5ab6a24cd2749fa7240bd1285177868739e4f1546ed", "text": "civilian authorities to manage security institutions more effectively and deliver improved security services.

Policy and Planning Cycles Policies and planning for security provision must reflect the priorities and available resources designated by the government and legislature. Moreover, they must be updated in a timely fashion. Budget Planning Budgets must be planned in accordance with the policies, priorities and available resources designated by government and legislature. Procurement plans must fit within the boundaries designated by the budget plan and not focus on acquiring unnecessary technical equipment at the expense of providing key security services. Financial Control Financial controllers must ensure that expenditures fit with the budget plan, ensuring that procurement in particular is carefully monitored to prevent overspend and cost overruns. Personnel & Human Resource Management Personnel must be selected and promoted competitively. Ministries and agencies must ensure that salary scales, promotion, professional development, assessment and evaluation criteria are in place to ensure the quality of security professionals delivering security.

In terms of appointment of senior security officers, in Solomon Islands, the Head of State appoints the Police Commissioner after consulting the Police and Prison Services Commission; this is the same in Vanuatu. In Fiji, before the 2006 coup the Constitutional Officers Commission appointed the Commissioner of Police following consultation with the minister responsible for the police. In Tonga, the Minister of Police has the authority to administer, command, superintend and make all appoints to the Police Force, with the approval of Cabinet. And in Papua New Guinea, the Commissioner of Police is appointed by the National Executive Council. The NEC is a constitutional entity representing the executive. Tonga and Papua New Guinea are the only two countries that have one source deciding on senior appointments. It has been argued Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 46 47 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 that in the case of Tonga it is a dangerous precedent that is open for political patronage and in Papua New Guinea as the appointment comes from the NEC, it implies the Commissioner is a political appointee.42 One way of ensuring against political interference with security institutions is to support the establishment of an independent police service commission made up of eminent figures that are responsible for overseeing recruitment, promotion, discipline and other personnel issues. Service commissions are autonomous government bodies that oversee management and disciplinary matters in security institutions. They can be drawn primarily from the executive or eminent persons from different walks of life. They are designed to be an independent voice in matters of administration and governance. Service commissions are meant to be established to limit potential political interference in selection, promotion, transfer, and removal of security officers. However, given that the President/Governor- General usually appoints on the advice of the prime minister the commissions are open for potential political patronage. They can also be designed to deal with appeals from security officers seeking redress from internal disciplinary measures. In all the target countries, a constitutional provision to maintain the independence of Service Commissions exists, which says a person is disqualified for appointment to any Service Commission if s/he is a Member of Parliament, holds any public office, or a position deemed to be of \u201ca political nature.\u201d It has been argued that this is an important provision and makes good on the envisaged design that the Service Commissions are not subject to any other control of authority.43 There are newer models that are more ambitious in composition and scope - in some cases including citizen representation, with wider powers to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bfbca5b9-cf3a-4ed4-8b09-9853e9f1787b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bfbca5b9-cf3a-4ed4-8b09-9853e9f1787b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "18eb603c586c1b2b44028db5973be3e0a0a9d5f53f4f6a724a78fc21d53c537b"}}, "hash": "18eb603c586c1b2b44028db5973be3e0a0a9d5f53f4f6a724a78fc21d53c537b", "text": "shape policy, set budgets, oversee ethics, examine behaviour, assess performance and go beyond making recommendations.44 IV). Current Situation in the Target Pacific Island Countries Currently, none of the target countries have a comprehensive security policy. However, each country has in place mechanisms to develop strategic policies and coordinate security actors while some of the line ministries and security institutions have strategic/ corporate plans. In Fiji, the Ministry of Defence, National Security and Immigration are in the process of developing a national security policy and have undertake consultations within the administration and with select civil society groups. To support this process, in 2008 the NSC was revived to provide oversight of policy development and monitor security developments. It is comprised of the prime minister (chairman), commander of the RFMF, the attorney general and minister for justice, minister of defence, minister of finance and commissioner of police, with the permanent secretary of the Ministry of Defence providing secretariat support. The Papua New Guinea government is in the process of developing a national security policy. This will be derived from the recently approved 2050 Strategic Vision, which includes a pillar on security and international relations. It will also take into account the Medium Term Development Strategy, the Defence Corporate Management Action Plan, which incorporates recommendations from the White Paper Defence Review in 1999, the national law and justice policy and action plan (2000), the White Paper on Law and Justice (2007) and the Royal PNG Constabulary Corporate Plan 2006 \u2013 2010. The government has in place a national security decision-making structure, without a policy to provide strategic direction. The Office of Security Coordination and Assessment (OSCA), which performs the administrative and secretariat duties for the National Security Advisory Council (NSAC), as well as the coordination and assessment role for the Papua New Guinea intelligence community was established during the crisis in Bougainville. OSCA assists the National Executive Council (NEC) Secretariat in facilitating National Security Council (NSC) meetings. Via the NEC and the Prime Minister\u2019s Department, most strategic policy is created through this mechanism (see example 1). In Solomon Islands, there is no formal security policy in place. However, the government has a Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS) for 2008 \u2013 2010. The MTDS is part of a long-term national development strategic plan, which translates the government\u2019s strategic vision into a series of programmes. The MTDS is set within the context of the Sikua Government\u2019s Policy Statements of January 2008. It includes two sections that are relevant to improving the governance of security institutions: 1) national security and foreign relations; and 2) Reconciliation and Rehabilitation. A national security council is not in place; however, the responsible line ministries have developed four-year corporate plans. To support the coordination of government and implementation of these plans there is a functioning Combined Law Agencies Group (CLAG) and there are weekly meetings between security-providing actors, including the police commissioner and representatives from the justice sector, to outline current issues. Tonga also does not have a formal security policy. However, it has a number of mechanisms for policy formulation, which ultimately lies with the Prime Minister\u2019s Cabinet, with inputs from the Defence Board and Minister of Police. The Defence Board, which consists of the King and Privy Council (Article 19 of the constitution), is responsible for formulating defence policy, controlling services through the commander, controlling funding and acquisition, and performs disciplinary and administrative functions. Recently, the Tonga Police Force has finalised a new strategic plan and corresponding business plans. Also recently, the Constitutional and Electoral Reform Commission provided its final report with 80 recommendations on ways to structure a new system of governance for Tonga, which will have an impact on how the security sector is managed and overseen. In Vanuatu, there is a growing consensus on the need to formulate a comprehensive security policy. In support of this, the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Internal Affairs have developed long-term corporate plans and have undertaken national policy direction conferences. The Prime Minister\u2019s Office and the government through the Council of Ministers are responsible for developing strategic policy. There is a national security apparatus in place including a CLAG but it is constrained due to a lack of technical support. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 48 49 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 In 2003, the cabinet of the government of Jamaica decided to launch a process to develop the country\u2019s first comprehensive, whole-of-government National Security Strategy (NSS).

Under the heading \u2018The Effects of Violence on Communities\u2019, the National Security Policy calls for close attention to the impact of violence on individuals, communities and society. \u2018Domestic violence\u2019, it noted, \u2018is one of the more pervasive and common forms of violence plaguing the society. It contributes to the overall pattern of crime and violence due to its debilitating effects on the social fabric and its role in socialising the youths to violence as a means of dispute resolution\u2019. Women and children are disproportionately at risk from domestic violence. Existing mechanisms for coordinating government priorities were examined and it was determined that the National Security Council (NSC), chaired by the prime minister, is best suited to own the responsibility for the implementation of the NSP. The mandate of the NSC is to be expanded to reflect this added responsibility and to include a formal biennial review of the National Security Policy. It may be necessary to include on the council the ministers holding responsibility for finance, foreign affairs and information. This additional mandate will necessitate a schedule of regular meetings with specific agenda items relating directly to the implementation of the NSP. The NSC will report to the cabinet, and the cabinet to parliament. Parliament has recently established a Select Committee on National Security. A National Security Strategy Implementation Unit (NSSIU) appointed by the National Security Council (NSC) is to be established in the Cabinet Office as a forerunner to the permanent structures of the NSC. The NSSIU will carry out the day-to-day coordination, target setting, monitoring and assessments required to implement the NSP, in addition to driving the transformation process on behalf of the NSC. The executive director of the NSSIU, who should be of the rank of permanent secretary, will be accountable to the NSC. Other senior members of the NSSIU staff would be drawn from relevant ministries that have a primary stake in achieving NSP goals. A small research, evaluation and administrative staff will be required. The executive director of the NSSIU will report ultimately to the prime minister, but routinely to the cabinet secretary. He/she will temporarily function as the secretary to the NSC, in addition to providing direction and control of the NSSIU and ensuring that the NSP is implemented across government on behalf of the NSC. Functions to be performed by the NSSIU include: Assisting permanent secretaries, chief executive officers, and managers in making operational key Example 2: National Security Formulation and Decision-Making Process in Jamaica The Office of Security Coordination and Assessment / National Security Advisory Committee (OSCA/ NSAC) Secretariat was established in 1991 based on the need for coordinating timely intelligence management system in PNG. The concept of a national Security Assessment and Coordination body is reminiscent of the common international practice of the national management of intelligence and provision of timely security advice to government by different security line agencies. In 1991 OSCA was established through a National Executive Council (NEC) Decision No. 104/91, in line with the government\u2019s policy document on \u201cSecurity for Development.\u201d Despite a series of NEC Decisions to amend its shape and form from 1991 to 1994, the functions of OSCA have not been fully achieved until now. This was due to legislative, staffing, financial and other administrative challenges. In a nutshell, the establishment of OSCA/NSAC was a policy strategy designed to effectively strengthen and streamline management issues related to the proper and efficient coordination and assessment of law and order and security intelligence reports provided to the national government by NASC agencies.

National constitutions, laws and regulations governing security institutions are essential to ensure their effectiveness, accountability and transparency. Without legislation it is impossible to entrench the rule of law. Legal frameworks are the foundational basis for establishing the ultimate objectives of security policies. Legal frameworks provide the legitimate mandate for oversight, including establishing professional standards and codes of conduct, and should clearly define the roles and responsibilities within and among security institutions.

Additionally, the legislative framework needs to ensure that the dialogue between democratic institutions on security issues is underpinned both by laws defining the responsibilities and available means for each of these institutions and laws ensuring that there is neither intended nor unintended immunity for any security sector institution. It is crucial that legislators have the necessary skills and capacities to conceptualise, scrutinise and draft appropriate security-related laws. However, legislation only provides a formal guideline for the roles and responsibilities of security institutions. As was noted by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative: \u2026a law alone is often too blunt an instrument to provide appropriate solutions to the daily dilemmas faced by police [security] officers on the ground and by police leaders engaging with governments and communities; but the law provides the framework for the difficult exercise of police discretion. In a proper democratic system, police accountability solely to the law is not sufficient \u2013 police must also be accountable to communities, government agencies and independent oversight bodies.46 Nevertheless, by establishing a legal framework that encompasses the security sector\u2019s activities, legislators provide the legal basis for a series of checks and balances on security sector policy and practice, executive decision making and the rights of citizens. This process anchors the concept of democratic oversight of the security sector in society as a whole and allows an independent judiciary to prosecute wrong-doing. Developed in 2002 by the Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces (DCAF) in partnership with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Parliamentary Assembly, the Model Law on Civilian Oversight of the Security Sector was created to help former Soviet countries create legislation, which embeds the concept of democratic civilian oversight of the security sector in their countries as per the obligations of the OSCE Code of Conduct. The law was used as a basis for similar laws adopted in Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan. The model law can be found at: http://www.dcaf.ch/_docs/bm_fluri_nikitin_cis_model.pdf (English).

Recommendations for Improving Democratic Oversight and Guidance of the Security Sector \u2013 Creating a Legal Framework Box 12 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 54 55 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 To apply these principles in practice, one method chosen has been to adopt a specific law on civilian oversight of the security sector (see box 11). A more common method is to include provisions that guarantee civilian oversight in each of the laws that regulate the security sector, e.g. the police act, protection of official secrets act, internal security services act, foreign intelligence act, states of emergency act, national defence act, financial accountability act, military (and alternative) service act, conscientious objectors act, defence procurement act, ombudsman act and a freedom of information act.47 II) Current situation in the target Pacific Island Countries Pacific Island countries are in the process of reviewing, updating and reforming legal frameworks that govern their security institutions. This section highlights a number of existing constraints with the legal framework in the target countries, which will need to be addressed to ensure the effective accountability and oversight of security institutions in the region: Given the changing regional and national security environment, there is a need for legislation on such issues as transnational crime, counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism. Generally, the security legislation in the Pacific do not make reference to the protection of human rights and civil liberties. For example, the functions of the police relate to \u201cmaintenance of law and order.\u201d The constitution and acts of parliament related to the police or military contain the concept of operational independence, vesting the police commissioner or commander of the military with responsibility and ultimate accountability for operational and administrative decisions, which aims to reduce the likelihood of political interference. However, in Tonga the minister of police has command, superintendence and direction of the force. This includes maintaining discipline, efficiency and making appointments. This results in the police not being politically autonomous. Also, the existing emergency legislation in Tonga was not sufficient to deal with the 16/11 riots in Nuku\u2019alofa and had to be amended accordingly (see example 3). There was a critical weakness of the Fiji Constitution (Amendment) Act 1997, that the role of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces was not defined except to say that \u201cthe Republic of Fiji Military Forces established by the Constitution of 1990 continues in existence.\u201d This leaves open claims that the repealed 1990 Constitution\u2019s definition remains in force, namely: \u201cIt shall be the overall responsibility of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces to ensure at all times the security, defence and well being of Fiji and its peoples.\u201d According to the Forum Eminent Persons Group Report in 2007, this situation lead the RFMF to believe the \u201cConstitution provides it with a political mandate to influence government policy in the interests of Fiji, however they may be defined.\u201d48 Also in Fiji, in October 2008 the Fijian High Court upheld presidential decisions and promulgated legislation made after the December 2006 coup as lawful in the intervening period prior to parliamentary elections, rendering inoperative the conventional separation of powers between civilians and the military. On April 9 2009, Fiji\u2019s Court of Appeal ruled that the 2006 coup by military leader Commodore Frank Bainimarama was illegal, as were all decisions made by his military-led government. Since that decision and the purported abrogation of the constitution, the interim military-lead government in Fiji has issued decrees to prevent legal challenges to decisions made by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo since the December 2006 coup; a decree setting up the framework for a new court system and the appointment of judges, which would require the president\u2019s approval; public emergency regulation; and decree on Executive Authority of Fiji (Amendment Decree) (Decree No. 28), which states that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9481a12-e657-4de3-ba8f-38eb7b134bc0": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9481a12-e657-4de3-ba8f-38eb7b134bc0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78c72f8beaadfc194b31ba19bdabd73422d2e203d4fa65b738c2d8da500c7ae1"}}, "hash": "78c72f8beaadfc194b31ba19bdabd73422d2e203d4fa65b738c2d8da500c7ae1", "text": "\u201cif the Office of the President becomes vacant, the Chief Justice, acting on the advice and nomination of the Cabinet, shall appoint another person to become President.\u201d The Police Acts of Fiji, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands all contain a provision that allows the Head of State to unilaterally declare, when faced with what s/he considers a grave threat to the defence or internal security of the country, that the police will be used as a military or internal security force and in doing so will comply with military orders. A danger here is that the decision to invoke a state of emergency is left to the sole discretion of the executive, with no input from Parliament or any other agency of government. This could create tensions and complications over the lines of accountability and supervision.49 In Vanuatu, the mobile force is unmentioned in legislation. The parliament has passed a Police (Amendment) Act 1994 specifying in section 4 that \u2018members of the Force may be engaged in Peace Keeping duties outside Vanuatu with the approval of the Council of Ministers on the recommendation of the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs\u2019. The police and defence acts currently in force in the target countries predate the creation of external oversight bodies, which means there is a focus on only internal police disciplinary systems to investigate police misconduct and maladministration. There has been little progress in changing outdated laws that are discriminatory against women in Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Tonga. Only Vanuatu has comprehensive legislation that deals with domestic violence. Fiji has addressed some elements of domestic violence in its family law but has not amended sexual and domestic violence in its criminal or civil codes. Papua New Guinea has made changes to sexual assault laws but has not legislated on domestic violence. In Tonga, CEDAW has not been ratified. Solomon Islands have recently changed its sexual assault legislation to comply with CEDAW.50 There are currently no regulations governing private security companies in Tonga and the legislation in Papua New Guinea needs updating. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 56 57 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 A The Tongan Government At the top of every security sector in the country there is the government, which formulates policies and enacts laws to govern and administer the security sector. The Tongan security sector therefore has its origins in the Tonga Constitution in the provisions that created the Tongan Government. B The Tongan Security Sector The main players in Tonga\u2019s security sector are the Tonga Police Force (\u2018TPF\u2019) and the Tonga Defence Services (\u2018TDS\u2019), who are in turn supported by the Crown Law Department in conducting criminal prosecution and the provision of legal advice and legislative drafting services. The constitution presupposes the establishment of the TDS consisting of land and sea forces, with the King as the \u201cCommander-in-Chief \u201d.51 The constitution also empowers His Majesty to appoint all officers and make regulations for the training and control of the forces. The constitution, however, limits the powers of the commander-in-chief in that war cannot be made without consent of the Legislative Assembly. The constitution also presupposes the existence of the TPF in empowering His Majesty to appoint a Ministry of Police. C Tongan Security Sector Legislation The Police Act The Police Act was enacted in 1968, replacing the old Police Act 1923. The act establishes the TPF. The TPF is now in the process of modernising their legislation and such process may likely be complete in 2010. One area that may be considered for better security sector administration is linking the current Police and TDS Acts to the Public Order (Preservation) Act for clearer provisions when dealing with law and order threats or civil emergency. The Tonga Defence Services Act 1992 The Tonga Defence Services Act 1992 was brought into effect to replace the Tonga Defence Services Act 1952. In relation to assisting the civil authorities to maintain order in the Kingdom, His Majesty may call out the TDS in aid of the services once a proclamation is made under section 3(1) of the Public Order (Preservation) Act.52 In relation to assisting the civil authorities in the case of civil emergency, the board may direct the TDS to assist civil authorities upon request from the civil authorities, and upon determination of the board that it is in the national interest to do so. The TDS Act is fairly recent with only fourteen years in existence and is also comprehensive.

Immediately after the prime minister signed the proclamation, the commanding officer of the TDS at the time advised His Majesty that the proclamation was issued and recommended that the TDS be released to assist the civil authorities in accordance with section 18 of the TDS Act. His Majesty agreed and TDS soldiers were sent to secure vital installations and government buildings in Nuku\u2019alofa, and also to assist in the restoration of order on the streets. Emergency Powers (Maintenance of Public Order) Regulations 2006 Crown Law was also directed to draft regulations under the Emergency Powers Act. The following day the Privy Council meeting was held as per normal for every Friday morning. Privy Council considered the draft regulations and then they were approved by His Majesty in Council as the Emergency Powers (Maintenance of Public Order) Regulations 2006.53 The regulations came into effect on 17 November 2006, and they were effective for thirty days unless renewed by Cabinet.54 The main purpose of the thirty days period was that government wanted to avoid appearing to be heavy handed in using emergency powers, and also to send a message to the public that the emergency powers had a time limit, unless the circumstances required it to be renewed. Cabinet was also given the power to make orders for the purposes of securing public safety and the maintenance of public order.55 Emergency powers were then given to any persons authorised by Cabinet, and all members of the TPF and TDS to secure public safety and maintain public order. The emergency powers were drafted incorporating the same powers in the Public Order (Preservation) Act. So in effect it gave the law enforcement authorities the same powers to be applied throughout the kingdom as if it were a proclaimed area. E Issues With the benefit of hindsight, the main issues from the riots emerged in no uncertain terms. From the outset it was clear that this was the first time the Tongan Executive was faced with such a situation. Faced with an unprecedented event, the TPF found themselves unprepared to respond in a timely and effective manner during the initial phase of the riots. Consequently, preparations, mainly in building resources and also improved training, should be undertaken by both the TPF and the TDS. Furthermore, preparations should be made to establish early conflict prevention strategies. F Assessment of the Executive\u2019s Response First, the executive\u2019s response in issuing the proclamation and making the emergency regulations was within the legislative framework, and therefore according to law. It was also a vital requirement for government not to take advantage of the situation and come down on the people with a clenched iron fist, so to speak. The rule of law was never far away from executive decision making. This was confirmed when soon after 16/11 the Supreme Court held that the executive was empowered within the law to make the emergency regulations and the proclamation it did.56 Secondly, the TDS\u2019s and TPF\u2019s joint response were effective and swift in restoring public safety and public order overnight. Thirdly, some TDS and TPF personnel are the subject of legal challenges as to how they utilised their enforcement powers under the emergency regulations. Some of these cases have been resolved and others are still pending. The legal challenges have mainly been about excessive force and unlawful arresting powers. In relation to those claims that have been resolved and were successful, they clearly involved officers who acted beyond their legal powers. This indicated either a lack of aptitude for law enforcement work or a lack of simple training on professional standards and ethical behaviour. The main area for concern therefore seems to be the training of soldiers and police officers on accepted professional standards and ethical behaviour.

Example 3: Security Sector Legislation in Tonga: Responding to 16/11 Riots Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 58 59 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Democratic oversight of security institutions is essential to ensuring accountability of security actors and the executive branch that manages them; effective oversight also helps to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Oversight bodies should be independent, well- resourced, and able to understand and execute their respective mandates. Rarely, however, do governments establish such robust oversight mechanisms until a crisis has already occurred. The focus of this section is on the role of the legislature, ombudsman institutions, judiciary, civil society and the media in ensuring external oversight and accountability of security institutions (see figure 7 below). I). International Good Practice The legislature has a very important role in developing and strengthening a culture of accountability and transparency. Legislators have three pivotal roles: legislating or enacting laws; representing constituencies and passing ideas of various kinds on to decision makers; and monitoring and overseeing government policies and practices, particularly in terms of public expenditure. As a result, legislatures play a central role in security sector oversight. They can provide an effective counterbalance to the powers of the executive branch and serve as a \u201cvoice\u201d of the people. In their oversight capacity, parliaments can debate and shape strategic security policy, determine budget allocation and oversee expenditures, hold security institutions accountable through interpolation, hearings and investigations, ensure the subordination of security institutions to the law and to judicial oversight and oversee the implementation of laws that relate to security institutions. Legislators need to ensure that: accountability institutions have a statutory right to monitor, enquire and report on security actors\u2019 activities; that the judiciary can oversee court cases against security actors; that prosecuting lawyers in those trials as well as law enforcement officers investigating crimes or accusations can gain access to documents, employees and premises of security institutions to fulfil their tasks; and that adequate state funding is made available for all of the actors concerned, not only for procedural activities but also in the event of emergencies. Overall, although overlaps do occur occasionally, the division of labour should be based on the free flow of information between all these institutions, as accelerated by the activities of civil society and the media. Notably, the legislature is only one element of a network of accountability institutions that can be utilized to oversee the security sector. anti- corruption commissions, ombudsman institutions, the auditor-general, the media and civil society all have a role to play. The legislature can be strengthened in its own oversight activities if it Justice System & Ombudsman Institutions Civil Society and the Media Legislature Legislature c) External Oversight and Accountability figure 7 External Oversight and Control of Security Institutions by Accountability Institutions Budget Allocation Overall democratic control of security policy orientation Control of career progress Case-based legality control Control of misuse of force or abuse of powers by security personnel & institutions Independent wachdogs Determination of disciplinary matters Monitoring Advocacy Awareness- raising Communications Policy & practice inputs Box 13 Develop an over-arching legislative framework that will create an optimal environment for democratic civilian oversight of the security sector, which reflects international norms and adjusts the constitution to reflect those norms. Develop legislation specific to each security sector component and law enforcement agency in accordance with international precedents. Develop legislation which guarantees the independence, functioning and availability of suitable instruments for democratic institutions to monitor the security sector. Integrate human rights norms into laws relevant to the security sector. Develop strategic documents outlining the specific roles, tasks and means available to security sector components. Demand democratic, accountable and effective executive control and well-functioning internal control mechanisms within the military, police, border police and intelligence services. Ensure that security services address the real security concerns of the people and that tax and other resources are used for their intended purposes, seeing to it that the security services operate in the interests of society and observe the human rights of men and women.

Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 60 61 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 II). Current Situation in target Pacific Island Countries In the Pacific, legislatures are variable in size, capacity and engagement in national governance activities. Tonga has 33 members in its legislature (1 female member of parliament (MPs)), Solomon Islands has 50 MPs (no female MPs), Vanuatu has 52 MPs (1 female MP) and PNG 109 MPs (1 female MP). All four legislatures have only a single chamber. Fiji had a bicameral legislature, with 71 elected members in the House of Representatives and 32 members appointed to the Senate. Since the 2006 coup, the Parliament of Fiji has been suspended. Due to the colonial history of the region, the parliaments of the South Pacific by and large follow the Westminster model, although as the only monarchy in the region, the Tongan system varies somewhat. Nonetheless, all of five legislatures have an executive which sits within the legislature. At a structural level, this has arguably contributed to the diminished ability of parliaments to engage in effective oversight because the government usually has sufficient numbers to suspend debate in the chamber and/or limit the capacity of parliamentary committees to undertake effective inquiries. At an operational level, staffing and funding limitations have also weakened parliaments, as MPs are often not provided with sufficient technical support to discharge their law making and oversight responsibilities. Most notably, committee secretariat support is often limited and there is sometimes no legal counsel available to non-executive members of the legislature. In terms of security sector oversight in Fiji before the 2006 coup there was a Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Order, which is one of six committees established to scrutinise and review all bills and government policies that relate to security, law enforcement and the prosecution of crime and other related issues. However, these committees do not and law enforcement committees based on the principles of transparency and accountability. Ensure balanced representation in all committees, including by opposition members and female and minority parliamentarians, facilitating fair representation of the interests of the whole population. Create effective rules and procedures for each committee. Hold regular committee hearings on security sector oversight issues. Train and use civilian permanent parliamentary staffers within parliamentary committees to work alongside parliamentarians and advise on oversight issues. Broaden the consultation process on policy development by holding public hearings on budget, legal, human rights, law enforcement and defence issues. Encourage parliamentary unity on security sector oversight issues. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16 Source: UNDP and DCAF (2006), \u2018Recommendations for Improving Democratic Oversight and Guidance of the Security Sector\u2019 in Democratising Security in Transition States.

Prior to the coup, the committees functioned on their described basis \u2013 the Justice Law and Order Committee reviewing, for example, bills on bail, civil evidence, passports, family law, arms and ammunition and reconciliation issues between 2002 and 2003. In Papua New Guinea, sections 118-123 of the National Constitution provide for permanent parliamentary committees. This constitutional provision was reinforced in 1994 with the introduction of the Permanent Parliamentary Act 1994. The committee system prohibits ministers to sit on committees and, at the same time, tries to be inclusive by accommodating as many backbenchers as possible. There are at present thirteen parliamentary committees in the PNG parliament.57 Although the parliament has committees mandated to deal with foreign affairs, security and law enforcement related matters; it is currently unable to adequately provide human or financial resources to support their work. Moreover, parliament has limited capacity to revise legislation, lacking legal experts with the ability to re- draft acts submitted by the government. In Solomon Islands there is currently no dedicated defence and security committee. However, there are ongoing discussions about the establishment of a law and justice committee. Before the establishment of such a committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee has undertaken relevant activities. For example, it undertook a field survey across Solomon Islands to address public perceptions of RAMSI and its effectiveness. The survey was a component of a parliamentary inquiry to review the International Facilitation Act (see example 4) conducted from July 2008 onwards, inviting submissions on the act and the work undertaken by RAMSI \u2018and to suggest any improvements or changes to the functions and relationship", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "61a85ee3-0d82-4714-b208-13d633694c1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "61a85ee3-0d82-4714-b208-13d633694c1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3df7622e5de3bc432400d7ea78891db05fb73d3439b6e3fd51dd36fcb4e6cf0e"}}, "hash": "3df7622e5de3bc432400d7ea78891db05fb73d3439b6e3fd51dd36fcb4e6cf0e", "text": "between RAMSI, assisting countries and the people and Government of the Solomon Islands\u2019.58 The Foreign Relations Committee submitted its final report on 12th November 2009. Similarly, an inquiry was held into the April 2006 civil unrest in Honiara,59 which contributed to the acknowledgement that the police needed a riot unit to contain such events. In general, in the context of the current Tongan political system, parliament has a limited mandate and only two committees exist which do not have a statutory security oversight role. However, the Tonga legislature has also used the chamber of the House as a place to discuss the riots and follow up issues, not necessarily as a deliberate strategy but as part of Question Time. The parliament will be expanded as part of the ongoing reform process. Legislation has already been passed so that the majority of positions in the country\u2019s government are already elected representatives rather than hereditary noblemen or those directly appointed by the King, with the first commoner prime minister elected and taking office in 2006. National elections to elect the majority of parliament by popular vote are scheduled for 2011 and the number of MPs expanded two-fold. The Tongan legislature also has the responsibility to discuss the Nov 2009 report of the Constitutional & Electoral Review Commission. Parliament currently plays a very limited role in security oversight in Vanuatu. This is unsurprising as there is weak parliamentary oversight of public finances \u2013 with limited meetings and effective scrutiny by the Public Accounts Committee and auditor-general; parliament currently has no role in developing legislation; it is only being asked to pass bills by the government and has only in 2009 established permanent committees with no mandate on security matters. Whilst private members\u2019 bills can be advanced, there is no parliamentary legal counsel in place to draft legislation independently. There is also a high turnover of parliamentarians at each election and lack of regulation and transparency of MPs allocations. Within this context and without the need for wholesale reform, there are numerous opportunities for legislatures to be involved in security sector oversight in the target countries. For example, the legislature can: Be used as a forum to air the concerns of constituents, rather than letting tensions fester in communities without any public forum where issues can be mediated; Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 62 63 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Be used to engage with regional issues: by asking members for their input on key security issues; tabling reports by UN / PIFS in parliament for discussion, e.g. Pacific Plan updates; and by officials providing an update to parliament through ministers on return from security meetings e.g. FRSC; Be a key player in minimising partisan political interference with the security sector through engaging in key appointment processes for senior posts, such as the head of the military or the police commissioner, ideally this would be done by a cross-party selection committee; Undertake reviews where public interest issues arise, e.g. scandals, deaths in custody etc; Be given a role in overseeing the imposition of emergency rule by the head of state. For example, in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, parliament must meet to endorse a state of emergency within 1-2 weeks or the state of emergency will cease; Exercise its law making functions to ensure that security sector laws respect human rights and entrench proper principles of good governance (independence, impartiality, equality, etc.); Review the annual budget to analyze whether spending was effective and efficient on military and police activities and whether it included specific budgets for training on such issues as ethics and human rights; Use its parliamentary committees to oversee the security services, either through issue-specific committees (e.g. law and order, foreign affairs) or general finance/budget committees. For example, in Solomon Islands, the parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee has been used to undertake hearings on the performance of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, which was mandated to support the government to restore law and order, among other things (see example 3); Use its parliamentary committees to oversee key anti-corruption institutions, including those responsible for overseeing security services. For example, in the Australian State of New South Wales, a parliamentary committee has the mandate to oversee the work of the Police Integrity Commission; Establish ad hoc committees or commissions of inquiry to investigate specific security sector issues. These benefit from focusing on a single issue, are time bound and supported by experts.

They can draw on civil society for ideas and expertise. Questions can also be asked during chamber debate when a security bill or policy is being discussed. Adjournment of debate speeches provides an opportunity to talk about a security issue; and Outside the parliamentary process, members can discuss issues with constituents through public debate and with the media. Members can also invite CSOs and partners to regular meetings to discuss issues with legislators and provide briefings to committees and MPs on security matters. The genesis of the Solomon Islands Parliamentary Strengthening project was provided by a Legislative Needs Assessment (LNA), undertaken in 2001 by the UNDP at the behest of the speaker of the National Parliament. The LNA pointed to a number of major shortcomings in the operation of the National Parliament including: lack of independence of parliament and dominance of the executive; lack of access to and availability of information for members to perform their roles effectively; performance issues such as infrequent parliamentary and committee meetings and poor attendance of members at those meetings. In 2005, the parliamentary strengthening project was established with the support of UNDP with the aim to improve the capacity of parliament. The project was designed to address five outcomes, namely: Effective and efficient parliamentary services, management and administration; Representative role of the Solomon Islands parliamentarians strengthened; Law making procedures of Solomon Islands Parliament strengthened; Capacity of the Solomon Islands Parliament to exercise its oversight role strengthened; and Increased representation of women and gender perspectives in governance. In order to strengthen these five key areas the project facilitated the development of a revised organizational structure that created new and revised positions in key functional areas of the secretariat and also established a Graduate Trainee Program of eight officers who provide procedural and administrative support to the speaker, clerk and members. Gradually, the graduate officers (secretariat) embarked on providing research and information services for the members of parliament, which accelerated over the life of the project. For example, the secretariat has achieved international best practice for prompt and regular posting of Hansard the next day, which has already established an expectation for a high standard of service amongst regular users of Hansard. The parliamentary administration, in particular the speaker and clerk, also benefited from the secretariat\u2019s support in areas such as members\u2019 entitlements and matters relating to the Public Service. This is a significant area of achievement for the parliament, which now has the capacity to deal with issues properly and with strict adherence to the administrative regulations \u2013 an area that has not been adequately resourced in recent years. Likewise, parliamentary committees have been strengthened through the increased technical support given by the secretariat. One aspect of this support is an analysis of bills, which is prepared by the secretariat for the Bills and Legislation Committee before it deliberates on the proposed legislation. This entails extensive research in the area that the bill seeks to address and the production of a comprehensive brief on any issue (particularly contentious issues) that the bill raises. Such briefs would also typically include any discrepancy or drafting error that the secretariat identifies in the bill. Given this type of support, the Bills and Legislation Committee has been increasingly well equipped to scrutinize legislation and report its findings to the House before the bill proceeds. Another select committee whose work has been enhanced by project support is the Foreign Relations Committee (FRC). This committee was all but defunct when the project was established. Under the Standing Orders, the FRC has the mandate to review and advise parliament and the executive on matters such as international instruments and the administration of any foreign assistance, to name a few. Prior to 2008, however, the FRC did not carry out its mandate fully for many reasons including a lack of direction and financial constraints.

The secretariat was called on by the prime minister to advise on how parliament can procedurally \u2018review\u2019 the notice. The ensuing advice was that parliament could only undertake a complete review through one of its select committees, the most appropriate one (in terms of mandate) being the FRC. This was taken up by the government and when parliament met on 24 July 2008 to review the notice, it resolved instead, on a motion by the prime minister, that this review be referred to the FRC. The FRC, with strong support from the secretariat, responded quite enthusiastically to the referral. With the joint financial support of both the government and the project, the FRC embarked on a provincial tour of the country to get an insight into how rural communities view RAMSI and its work. The FRC was not asked by parliament or the government to extend the inquiry to the provinces but it resolved to do so. The actual inquiry took a year. During the inquiry, the project supported the FRC through the secretariat, which was responsible for identifying and mobilizing witnesses to hearing venues in nine different provinces. The secretariat produced the final report of the inquiry, which was tabled in November 2009 before the budget meeting. The inquiry was the first of its kind and has been hailed as the first occasion on which a parliamentary committee literally took parliament to the people. The fact that this achievement was formulated and guided by the project through the secretariat should be sufficient as an indicator of the extent of the project\u2019s success in terms of supporting the capacity of parliamentary committees. Apart from committees, it is safe to add that as each key project outcome was strengthened, parliament began to effectively carry out its mandate. For instance, there has been: An increase in attendance by MPs in parliamentary sittings.60 The improved attendance of MPs was noted by an editorial in the Solomon Star following the August 2007 meeting of parliament, which described the meeting as \u2018a great success\u2019 as a result of \u2018a marked improvement in the attendance of our MPs\u2019.61 An increase in activity and scrutiny of government by parliamentary committees including an increase in the number of reports tabled or drafted by committees. Whilst there were only nine hearings held by the five parliamentary standing committees in 2004 and 2005 in total, 40 hearings were held by committees in 2006 alone and a similar amount in 2007.62 Between 2008/09 there have been 50 public hearings. Acceptance by the government of committee recommendations, including proposed amendments to certain bills before the House. There has also been increased coverage of parliamentary proceedings in the media, including through \u2018OneNews\u2019 television broadcasts, and in newspapers, partly as a result of the improved quality of parliamentary debates. Other key areas which the project has also developed and strengthened are: Information Services \u2013 development of the parliament website and Information Communication Technology; Corporate Services \u2013 corporate planning and Parliament Open day; and Parliament Education and Community engagement \u2013 curriculum development and school visits.

They protect the public against violations of rights, abuses of power, and maladministration, and can serve to make the government more accountable to the public by ensuring compliance with policy and rule of law. They perform these functions by raising awareness of human rights within the general public and within security and justice institutions, carrying out investigations and issuing recommendations and drafting monitoring reports. While some countries establish ombudsperson offices with wide-ranging mandates, others establish security-specific ombudsperson offices. In such circumstances, ombudspersons may be responsible for overseeing security-related legislation, complaints and investigations against security institutions, and reporting on financial and administrative security- related matters. Ombudsmen often have powers to demand papers, to interview officials and to visit premises (such as military barracks or security establishments). They may also have their own power to initiate investigations and to make recommendations concerning legislative reform or compliance with International Human Rights Law. These offices can be useful in bringing systematic human rights violations by security sector agencies to the attention of relevant governmental bodies or the parliament, through their investigations. In some states the general ombudsman for the administration as a whole also acts in relation to the armed forces or other security agencies.

In other states, specialized military ombudspersons or commissioners to examine issues such as surveillance or data handling by the security and intelligence agencies have been created to exercise detailed oversight on behalf of parliamentarians. As a separate institution, an independent ombudsman for the military appears in several countries under different names, such as the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces (Wehrbeauftragter) in Germany and the Ombudsman for National Defence Forces in Canada. They have often been used as models by other countries, for example, the Irish Military Ombudsman and the Czech Republic Armed Forces Ombudsman. The ombudsman may also have power to investigate and report on a complaint against a security or intelligence agency, as is the case in the Netherlands. In other countries, an independent inspector-general of security and intelligence deals with complaints against the services as part of the office\u2019s overall oversight remit in a rather similar way. This is the case, for example, in New Zealand (Office of Inspector- General of Intelligence and Security, established in 1996) and South Africa (Office of Inspector General of Intelligence, appointed pursuant to section 12 of the Constitution). In addition, specific offices established under freedom of information or data protection legislation may have a role in investigating complaints against these agencies. At the very least, ombudsman need to collate information of alleged human rights abuses by security and intelligence agencies and document them in their annual reports, recommendations to prosecutors, and highlight them with presentations to the parliament and the media. The arguments for a specialised military or security ombudsman as opposed to a generic ombudsman covering the public service as a whole (including the security sector) are finely balanced. The advantage of a military or security ombudsman is that it is a specialised office that can operate in a way that is adapted to the special aspects of military life or of the security sector. However there is a risk that the office may become too closely associated with the security sector to be seen as independent and it may lack the visibility and accessibility of a general ombudsman.

The office deals with complaints from the public about how police officers operate. On the basis of these complaints, the police ombudsman produces an annual report. The office also reports to the secretary of state and may carry out research on an issues referred to by the secretary of state. The reports of the Ombudsman Office are used by both parliament and a number of CSOs to hold the police accountable.

The PIC is headed by a commissioner, who is appointed by the governor (PIC ACT, Subsection 7[1]). The commission may not appoint any staff which serve or have served with the NSW Police Force. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Office of the Ombudsmen and the Police Integrity Commission monitors and reviews the PIC in the exercise of its functions (PIC Act, Section 95). The commission is required to report on its operations annually to the Houses of Parliament (PIC Act, Subsection 99[1]). The principal functions of the PIC, in accordance with Subsection 13(1) of the PIC Act, are : To prevent serious police misconduct; To detect or investigate, or manage other agencies in the detection or investigation of serious police misconduct ; and To detect or investigate, or oversee other agencies in the detection or investigation of, other police misconduct, as the PIC may see fit.

II). Current Situation in the target Pacific Island Countries The five target Pacific Island countries covered by this initiative together have some of the most developed accountability institutions in the Pacific. All five have an auditor general who reports regularly. However, the auditors\u2019 reports have variable impact, with limited action taken to implement recommendations or prosecute criminal actions. In Fiji, since the coup, the auditor reports to a government-appointed Public Accounts Committee. All countries also have some form of ombudsman- style complaints mechanism. However, these are also of limited capacity and effectiveness. While the Papua New Guinea Ombudsman Commission is considered the strongest in the region, in Tonga only a Public Relations Commissioner is currently in place, and in Fiji, since the abrogation of the constitution, the ombudsman has not been reappointed. Notably, both the Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu ombudsmen have a mandate to examine complaints of maladministration and to monitor the Leadership Code; however, in Vanuatu in reaction to a very active campaign against corruption in the late 1990s the government reduced the Ombudsman\u2019s powers to bring action under the Leadership Code. In Solomon Islands, there is an Ombudsman Commission, but it is administered by the Prime Minister\u2019s Office. Also a separate Leadership Code exists. Both Fiji and Tonga have recently established Independent Commissions Against Corruption (ICAC), though each has had some establishment challenges. In Solomon Islands, the government is currently exploring options for streamlining their accountability institutions, including considering the possibility of setting up an ICAC. In Papua New Guinea, there has been considerable discussion around establishing an ICAC. However, more recently a National Anti-Corruption Alliance of key accountability bodies has been developed, which may reduce the need for a separate body. Only Fiji has established a National Human Rights Commission, although following the coup, a chairperson has not been reappointed. The draft Solomon Islands Constitution proposes setting up a national human rights institution and in Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu, the governments have indicated an interest in establishing such a body. In the meantime, the Papua New Guinea Ombudsman Commission primarily deals with human rights cases as well as more recently complaints against the police (see example 5). Although Pacific Islands Countries (PICs) now have various accountability institutions, recent research63 has found that they are generally ineffective. Possible reasons include: Lack of \u2018fit\u2019 between introduced and local institutions; Lack of investigative skills, legal capacity, or essential personnel; No powers to enforce its recommendations; Weak links between accountability and enforcement institutions; Poorly defined roles and functions; Limited operational autonomy; Weak leadership; Lack of political will; and Poor public education and support. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 68 69 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Background The Police Review of 2004, established by Hon. Bire Kimisopa, minister for internal security, made several recommendations. Number 29 recommended the police enter into an agreement with the Ombudsman Commission (OC) to immediately oversee the review and investigate all complaints made by the public about police actions/inactions. On 2 March 2006, then Commissioner of Police Mr. Sam Inguba wrote to the Chief Ombudsman Mr. Ila Geno requesting the OC to oversee the complaints handling process of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary (RPNGC) and eventually establish a police ombudsman. The chief ombudsman, then Mr. Ila Geno, accepted the invitation but proposed that both the OC and the RPNGC work in partnership to restore the integrity of the police complaint handling process. As a result police officers from the Internal Affairs Directorate of RPNGC and the Complaint and Administrative Investigation Branch of the OC were tasked to implement Recommendation 29. Implementation of the Project The project was implemented in four phases. Phase One Recommendation 29 was too general and the Ombudsman Commission had to work from scratch to come up with a model to be able to assist the RPNGC. In August 2006, research was undertaken into the concept of police oversight and four models were identified. These include current, minimal, moderate and radical models. A submission was made to the members of the OC to choose a model that would be used by the OC to assist the RPNGC in restoring their integrity and public trust and confidence. Phase Two The Police Ombudsman Team then conducted a series of meetings and discussions with respective personnel and divisions within RPNGC as a prelude to implementing the recommendation of the Police Review of 2004. The Police Ombudsman team travelled to the four regions in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa5d8fc0-7c0a-4f5d-a9f6-e1ba5ce8461f": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa5d8fc0-7c0a-4f5d-a9f6-e1ba5ce8461f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2f41c483050afd15871f983f26a8a915ecb5af8215cb003ceb6ba701651592ff"}}, "hash": "2f41c483050afd15871f983f26a8a915ecb5af8215cb003ceb6ba701651592ff", "text": "the country and talked to the assistant police commissioners (ACPs) and provincial police commanders (PPCs) on the importance of the oversight role of the OC and gauge their views on the four models. The police officers opted for the radical model that is to come up with a Police Complaints Act to address the problems faced in the police force. However, the police ombudsman team chose to start with the moderate model and slowly work towards the radical model. Initially there was a bit of resistance that the OC was trying to interfere with their internal affairs or impose on them an arrangement contrary to the police culture. However, having explained to them the advantage of the whole exercise, they accepted it and contributed meaningfully to the discussion. Phase Three The issues discussed during the meeting with the ACPS and PPCs were integrated into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA). Given capacity constraints with the OC it was decided the OC would oversee only high profile cases. The other administrative complaints were to be addressed by the Police Administration. The MOA was signed by the Commissioner of Police Mr. Gari Baki and the Chief Ombudsman Mr. Ila Geno on 1 June 2007. On 3 September 2007, the commissioner of police issued Circular Number 08/2007 for the RPNGC to adhere to the MOA. Phase Four After the signing of the MOA on 1 June 2007, the Police Ombudsman Team conducted a MOA awareness meeting in all four provinces and began joint investigations into high profile cases. Investigation Two high profile cases were investigated jointly by the police and ombudsman officers under the MOA. These include the Kimbe Police Raid case and the alleged rape case of the Provincial Police Commander East Sepik. The police personnel involved in the raid in Kimbe were arrested and detained. They were also suspended on administrative charges and are awaiting trial. The PPC East Sepik was suspended and arrested for alleged rape and he is now awaiting trial in National Court. This was a test case were the PPC was reinstated by the ACP for Momase Region Mr. Labi. The OC wrote to the commissioner of police to provide reasons for uplifting the suspension of the PPC when the National Court trial was still pending and the PPC was suspended again. Mr. Kabilo is no longer a police officer and his criminal trial is pending. According to the OC\u2019s records, some of the other high profile cases that were referred to Internal Affairs for investigation and overseen by the OC were successfully resolved. This would not have been possible without the OC oversight under MOA. Review of the MOA The initial MOA signed between the RPNGC and the Ombudsman Commission was to be in operation for a year (1 June 2007 \u2013 31 June 2008). The views and issues that were raised by the senior police officers during the MOA Awareness Meetings were considered and a review was undertaken. Some of the issues raised were integrated into the MOA. The Reviewed MOA was signed between the Commissioner of Police Mr. Gari Baki and the Chief Ombudsman then Mr. Ila Geno to work together for another three years on 11 June 2008. The Reviewed MOA will lapse when the Police Complaint Handling legislation comes into place. Phase Five On 4 July 2008, the Police Ombudsman Team met and formed a Steering Committee comprised of the Director of Internal Affairs Directorate of RPNGC Chief Superintendent Mr. John Maru, Director of CAID of the Ombudsman Commission Mr. Joseph Molita and the Counsel of the Ombudsman Commission. Further, a working group was formed comprised of the officers of Internal Affairs and Team 7 from the CAID. They are now working on a discussion paper, which is the first step towards drafting of the Police Complaints Handling Act. Impact of the MOA The MOA is beginning to have a great impact on the thinking and work practice of the police force. First, there is overwhelming support from the police officers of the provinces that the MOA become an act. They see it as the only way forward to restoring accountability, integrity and lost confidence and trust to the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary. The most encouraging experience is that the Mobile Squad officers from McGregor Barracks \u2013 who have a reputation for unlawful actions \u2013 have given their full support for the MOA to become an act. Even the officers from the Internal Affairs Unit of RPNGC admitted to the commission that for the first time they were able to resolve cases or perform their function without interference from the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11d746dc-7650-471c-a4f7-6903cdad23a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "11d746dc-7650-471c-a4f7-6903cdad23a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "47e026a10922ee578067cd748e27c44b6c50903429e656d922bb6e25ae79ebdf"}}, "hash": "47e026a10922ee578067cd748e27c44b6c50903429e656d922bb6e25ae79ebdf", "text": "top management of the police force. Moreover the number of high profile investigations that were conducted jointly by the police and the officers of the OC under MOA produced very good outcomes. Example 5: Role of Ombudsmen in Security Sector Governance in Papua New Guinea Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 70 71 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Investigation To date, a number of high profile joint investigations have been conducted by the Internal Affairs Directorate and the OC. The MOA has also protected the commissioner of police from political interference. In the case of the former PPC East Sepik Province, whom allegedly has political connections with the prime minister, Mr. Kabilo was suspended and charged. If it was not for the MOA, the commissioner would have been directed to reinstate the then suspended PPC. Hence the commissioner has been assisted to do his job without political interference because of the OC\u2019s involvement. Since then, numerous other cases have been addressed with OC oversight. Successes The Police Oversight MOA has assisted the RPNGC to achieve a number of results as described above as a way of making government departments responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, help improve their work and also be seen to be fulfilling its constitutional duties. Police officers from the Internal Affairs Unit of RPNGC are now able to resolve cases or perform their duties without interference from the top management of the police force. Furthermore, the complaints handling system is now more independent. More police officers have become aware of the existence of the MOA and oversight of complaints against police. Police Internal Affairs is now investigating complaints lodged with them knowing that their failure to investigate will give people reasons to complain to the OC. Successfully undertaken joint investigation into high profile cases. Closer working cooperation between the OC and the police in dealing with cases, e.g. through monthly case reviews and informal contact at the director and officer level. Challenges The challenge now is to draft the Complaint Handling Act, have it debated and passed in parliament to be enacted as law. There must be political will to get the legislation through parliament. The legislation will regulate the way complaints against police are dealt with. The other challenge is to ensure there is not too much reliance on OC oversight to deal with all cases as the idea is really to assist police to improve their internal complaint handling mechanism through the Internal Affairs Directorate. There is still a disconnection between Provincial IIUs (who are under the command of the PPC) and the Internal Affairs Directorate. Police informants \u2013 most of whom are officers \u2013 still lack protection from their superiors, especially when giving evidence against those higher up the hierarchy. The MOA is only an agreement between the two agencies to work together and the protection for the complaints cannot be accommodated. Delay in adjudication of some cases by police. The transfer of officers out of IA is an internal matter for the police commissioner but one that can stabilise the gains that have been made. There continues to be stories in the media of police abuse. Some of the cases have been dealt with. However, the challenge to improve the work of police is enormous and a lot of work still needs to be done. Funding will continue to be a challenge to deal with cases in a timely manner.

Where there is an alleged breach of criminal, civil or human rights law, individual or corporate responsibility can be investigated and determined in a transparent process consistent with human rights standards. Provided a suitable legal framework exists, judicial oversight can curb and punish the excessive use of force by security actors, and can ensure that policies, practices and actions are limited by legal norms and standards, including human rights law. The judiciary\u2019s core tasks in relation to the security sector are to judge whether its actions conform to the constitution, relevant legislation, whether they infringe human rights either of citizens at large or citizens in uniform (members of the armed forces), or civil and criminal law. These tasks take on special significance in times of emergency. Unlike parliament or the executive, the courts have no power to hold public officials accountable on their own initiative \u2013 the ability of judges to do so depends entirely on appropriate cases being brought to court. Civil society organisations (CSOs) can play a vital role here in defending the public interest and upholding the rule of law by using litigation to expose abuse and to defend human rights. The courts can be engaged in two basic ways. The first is where state authorities themselves bring legal action, for example prosecution in a terrorism or official secrets case or disciplinary proceedings against a member of the armed forces. In such instances the courts may act as an indirect control over the security sector, especially by considering whether certain types of evidence (for example evidence obtained by torture, illegally or deceptively) should be permitted. Where, however, prosecution or disciplinary action is brought against a member of the armed forces, or a police officer alleged to have abused their position, the element of control is direct. Secondly, the courts can be used by individuals or organisations to challenge the legality of the actions or policies of the security sector. Thus, for example, the courts may be called upon to judge the legality of committing members of the security sector to engage in or support an armed conflict. \u201cThere can be no peace without justice, no justice without law and no meaningful law without a Court to decide what is just and lawful under any given circumstance.\u201d Benjamin B.

Commander of the Fiji Military Forces [2001] FJHC 126; Hbm0014.2001s (8 May 2001) This case concerned the unlawful detention of Lieutenant Penaia Vetaukula Baleinamau for 277 days by the commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) on allegations of his involvement in the 19 May 2000 coup and the mutiny at the Queen Elizabeth Barracks. Lt. Penaia was detained for 48 hours on 27 July 2000 under section 18(2) of the Emergency Decree (No. 4) of 2000. Thereafter he was kept in custody for 67 days before being released on 5th October 2000 under Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure (Army) 1972. After the alleged mutiny at RFMF on 2 November 2000 he was again arrested on 5 November 2000 and kept under \u2018protective custody\u2019 under section 202. The commander stated that the detention was not in breach of section 23 of the Fiji Military Forces Act Cap. 81 on the applicability of the Army Act 1955. However, the presiding judge ruled that the RFMF\u2019s right to detain the Lt. Penaia was not being disputed but the RFMF\u2019s powers of detention are limited by time. Section 202 of the Emergency Decree provides for detention for a period not exceeding seven days. The judge further added that the purpose of the said Emergency Decree was to maintain law and order but not to deprive a citizen of his constitutional rights. The court ordered Lt. Penaia\u2019s immediate release from detention and/or arrest. Adjudicating Cases Against Security Services/ Upholding the Rule of Law, Solomon Islands, 2006: On August 24, former Guadalcanal Liberation Front leader Harold Ke\u2019ke was convicted of murder for ordering the killings of seven men in 2002 and sentenced to an additional life term, to be served concurrently with a 2005 life sentence imposed for the killing of Father Augustine Geve in 2002. Adjudicating Cases Against Security Services/ Upholding the Rule of Law/Protecting Human Rights Solomon Islands, 2003-to-date: RAMSI apprehended and charged persons allegedly responsible for human rights abuses and other criminal acts. Over 160 former Solomon Islands Police Force officers have been arrested for serious offences including corruption, murder, assault, rape, intimidation and robbery. Upholding the Rule of Law, Tonga, 2007: Three police officers were investigated over allegations of police brutality in connection with the riots of 2006. As a result of the investigations by the unit, one of the three accused was convicted and dismissed from the force. Upholding the Rule of Law: Vanuatu, 1997: The security forces abducted President Jean Marie Leye in 1996 during a dispute over salaries: almost half of the defence force was arrested and charged with kidnapping, carrying weapons and unlawful assembly. However, only eight Vanuatu Mobile Force members were convicted in June 1997 for kidnapping President Jean Marie Leye. This decision was later upheld by the Court of Appeal in Oct 1997. Providing Effective Remedy, PNG, 1995: Koimo v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea [1995] PNGLR 535 (31 May 1995) The plaintiff in this case, Mr. Koimo, claimed damages on behalf of himself and twenty-seven others for an illegal search and raid conducted by the police on the plaintiff\u2019s village. The police had entered the village, fired shots, burned down houses and their contents, shot and killed livestock and carried away the personal property of the plaintiff and others. The courts ordered that the plaintiff be awarded exemplary damages.

Even more remarkable (and commendable) was the announcement by the military-supported Interim Civilian Government that it would implement the decision of the Court of Appeal. Context for Law and Justice Sector Reform The Papua New Guinea Law and Justice \u2018sectoral approach\u2019 is driven by a number of important government decisions beginning with the National Law and Justice Policy of 2000. This National Policy, together with the Law and Justice Sector White Paper and Sector Strategic Framework (SSF), captures the essence of the \u2018sectoral approach\u2019 and is complemented by the Medium Term Development Strategy (MTDS) and the Public Sector Reform that the government is actively pursuing. These key documents emphasised the importance of improved service delivery through effective coordination and accountability among the various stakeholders. In 2003, the Government of PNG (GoPNG) and the Government of Australia (GoA) entered into an agreement to collaborate to drive these important policy documents through the \u2018Law and Justice Sector Program\u2019. The program phase lasted for five years, from 2003-2009. In April 2009 the collaboration was renewed for another five years under the name \u2018Papua New Guinea-Australia Law and Justice Partnership\u2019 (PALJP). The Department of National Planning & Monitoring and AusAID continued to be the major coordinating agencies representing the respective governments. Why the Sector Approach was used The sectoral approach was employed in principal to improve coordination and collaboration among the eight main law and justice sector agencies and key stakeholders and to ensure law and justice services are effectively delivered to people at the community level. The sector agencies include the: Police Correction Services Ombudsman Commission Magisterial Services National Judiciary Staff Services Department of Justice & Attorney General Public Prosecutor Public Solicitor As the mandated office, DNPM oversees the management of this partnership arrangement in collaboration with the National Coordinating Mechanism (NCM). The NCM is comprised of the heads of all the eight sector agencies and the sectoral approach is based on three main pillars: Improved functioning of the formal law and justice system; Improved sectoral coordination; and Increased focus on crime prevention and restorative justice. The SSF take its cue from the overarching direction set by these three pillars. How does it work in practice? Funding arrangements under this partnership come under the Development Budget, to which the GoPNG and GoA counter funds. These funds are pooled under the \u2018one-basket policy\u2019 since 2006. Every year the agencies send in their Project Formulation Documents (PFDs) for planned projects in the next year. The PFDs go through an annual mini-screening process that the sector has to determine its relevance to the MTDS, SSF and NCM priorities. The approved projects from these submissions are forwarded to the NCM for their endorsement before being sent to the DNPM, who then submits to AusAID for release of the GoA component for LJS funding. These funds are managed by the Law and Justice Sector Secretariat (LJSS) under the GoPNG Financial Management Manual & LJSP Imprest Account Procedural Manual and related statutes. What have been the challenges and lessons that have been learnt that could be usefully shared in the region for other countries in a similar situation? The LJS being a huge sector with eight constitutional offices and other subsidiary offices has few common challenges you expect to find in any sector. Capacity Building Building the capacity of officers in the agencies continues to be a major concern, especially in terms of being able to effectively coordinate and manage the Development Budget (DB) activities in their agencies besides attending to their core business. Coordination Continuous efforts are being made to improve the coordination and collaboration of DB activities given the complexity of the law and justice sector issues and the agencies\u2019 constitutional mandate as independent entities. Ownership Agency ownership of DB activities or projects continues to be a challenge as the sector moves into the new partnership agreement over the next five years. Ownership issues include not having an efficient reporting system, delaying projects and under spending/overspending by agencies or AMTs. Despite these challenges, the sector is able to adapt and make inroads in its endeavour to ensure quality and reliable law and justice services are delivered, even down to local communities. How do the oversight mechanisms function? There are unique arrangements in terms of the governance and reporting processes under the sectoral approach. The DNPM, as the government rep, oversees the overall coordination and management of the partnership arrangement.

This is currently being undertaken through the sector\u2019s Provincial Engagement Strategy, the Community Justice Liaisons Unit and other cross-cutting issues.

Source: Joe Kanekane, Director \u2013 Law and Justice Secretariat Context of Law and Justice Sector Reform in Vanuatu In the mid 1990\u2019s, the Vanuatu Government saw the critical need for, and undertook reforms in public service sector, including reforms of public financial institutions which included the National Bank of Vanuatu, the National Provident Fund, and the winding up of the Development Bank of Vanuatu. In June 2008, I was appointed as the Director General of Ministry of Justice and Social Welfare. On appointment I decided after much personal analysis and assessment of the law and justice sector that it was critical that there was a review. This focused on the law and justice institutions as a package in the context of a growing economy, changing needs, demands and expectations and there need to dispense efficient and quality services. We started with a historical look at our law and justice institutions, its place and performance in our governance framework, to see if it could stand scrutiny and the test of its strength, integrity, performance and service delivery to the nation\u2019s satisfaction and pride. For example: A strong, able, independent and transparent judiciary, public prosecutor and Ombudsman. And if not why not? How could we make things work better? No effort according to my knowledge had ever been done to attempt to review and reform the law and justice sector as a whole. In addition, it was not seen by past governments in Vanuatu, nor anyone for that matter, as a sector that should be dealt with in a coordinated manner. Why a Sector-wide approach? In the context described, it made sense that if we wanted to address law and justice, (justice includes human rights - (MDGs, UNCRC, UNCRPD, CEDAW), anti-corruption and good governance we needed to do it properly and deal with all the sector\u2019s key institutions and partners, such as CSOs. At least, at this point in time in our history, it made sense to do it that way. It seemed responsible, to make a start to address law and justice issues, and the institutions providing those services underpinning our economy and nation. We recognised that law and justice issues are cross- sectoral. This meant we needed to place them in context and scrutinise their standing, capacity, caliber, Example 8: Law and Justice Sector Reform in Vanuatu integrity, structures, human resources, and financial and management systems against their performance and public opinion. We could not deal with our criminal justice systems and the legal sector without involving CSO\u2019s, human rights (our UN obligations), culture and traditions, good governance and transparency issues. For example, correctional services needed to be able to articulate their functions, challenges and concerns to other law and justice institutions in the policy development and decision-making process. Whilst also listening to the views of CSOs such as Transparency International and Ombudsman on the running of prisons, management of detainees and juveniles and how to protect and ensure human rights. What was the Process to design the strategy and Action Plan? The Director General led a process of drafting the proposed strategy with support of the Ministry of Justice. This included consultations with the key sector institutions, Chiefs, churches, women and youth groups and other CSOs. This was subsequently presented to wide range of stakeholders from government and civil society. They were given one month to meet and consider the strategy in line with their institutional mandates. A month later all heads of the sector", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55f520fd-c9b7-447f-9ff9-30c8f7bcae1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "55f520fd-c9b7-447f-9ff9-30c8f7bcae1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cea6140c8068b9403214ea8bc950eefe55d143082a138717e4a326527ebe2196"}}, "hash": "cea6140c8068b9403214ea8bc950eefe55d143082a138717e4a326527ebe2196", "text": "agencies and civil society attended a week long law and justice conference. It was the first of its kind in Vanuatu. With the leadership of the Ministry, they worked on, and agreed the strategy in line with the government national agenda. During the conference they also developed an action plan linked to the strategy. This was later presented to and approved by the Council of Ministers. Oversight and Coordination Model During the conference a model was proposed and accepted to establish a law and justice agency head\u2019s group. This group works with the government through the Ministry of Justice. Its purpose is to develop policy, coordinate the sector and recommend directions to government. The unique aspect of the model is that the judiciary, police, ombudsman, public prosecutor, public solicitor, state law office (attorney-general\u2019s chambers) sit at the same table with women, youth and disability groups, other CSOs, chiefs, churches, and the children\u2019s desk to discuss and decide on law and justice issues for the country and make recommendations to government on the best way forward for the sector. Those recommendations are relayed by the Minister of Justice to the Council of Ministers for approval and implementation. Challenges? Two main challenges encountered: The first challenge is the buy-in process \u2013 getting heads of institutions are their staffs to own the vision, and understand and agree that there needs to be coordination of policy and implementation to address key issues. We are already seeing that working as a sector enhance our ability to lobby government and development partners. For example, the recent successful \u201cLaw Week\u201d and the effective 2010 budget presentation by the law and justice sector institutions within the sector strategy, to the government\u2019s ministerial budget committee. Second challenge is managing the model, making it work, and maintaining interest and commitment of institutional heads. This requires strong leadership, expertise in law and justice issues, and a vision for the sector to maintain interest and lead the implementation of the strategy and action plan. Key Lessons learnt Law and justice institutions are put in the spotlight when there is political instability in the executive and legislative branches of government. This necessitates Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 78 79 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 a strong, independent, neutral and impartial judiciary and Ombudsmen to produce public reports on allegations of abuse and maladministration of public funds. The government requires a vision and needs to lead the way, by committing itself to effective law and justice policy development and giving the necessary funds to improve performance. Regular review of such an important sector is vital to scrutinise the nature, structure, legal framework, role, systems (management, human resource, financial, IT etc) and determine necessary reforms. Examples: The structure of the public prosecutors office was revised to enhance capacity without the need for amendment of the constitution. The Ombudsman Act and Leadership Code are currently being reviewed. This process will result in recommendations to government on the way forward in the current national context, including streamlining and simplifying processes e.g. leader\u2019s annual returns. A discussion paper on review of the public defenders office has been drafted. The objective is to improve capacity and better equip the office to deliver services to those in need, under the national constitution, who cannot afford a private lawyer, but who is charged with a serious offence. Future Directions Review Law and Justice Strategy and Action Plan 2009-2014. Making sure it maintains its relevance. Build capacity of law and justice agency heads (Registrar of Supreme Court, Ombudsman, Commissioner of Police, President of National Council of Chiefs, President of National Council of Women, Chairperson of National Youth Council, Chairperson of national Council of Churches, etc). Strengthen and enhance functioning of Law and Justice Agency Heads Group. Ensure that needs within the sector are addressed, improving capacity and performance. Streamline legislation. Build human resource capacity and management and IT systems across the sector. Stay \u201cone step\u201d ahead of community expectations, by thinking and planning ahead.

This enables the public, policymakers, parliamentarians and others to play a more effective role in their oversight roles. To perform this role, the media must be free and independent and information on the policy, operations and activities of security institutions must be accessible. The media itself may require technical support to promote accuracy and fairness in reporting. Advocacy by civil society groups representing the interests of local communities and groups of like- minded individuals helps to give voice to often marginalized actors and opens up the policymaking process to a wider set of perspectives. In this way, CSOs have a vital role to play not only in established democracies but also in post-conflict, post- authoritarian and undemocratic states, where the activities of CSOs can still affect the decision making of politicians, government officials and security sector managers. Civil society groups often have no inkling that their activities can contribute to democratic oversight and governance of the security sector. Those groups professing to deal with peace and security issues \u2013 disarmament groups, academic departments and research or policy institutes dealing with criminal justice \u2013 constitute the most obvious types of civil society groups likely to become involved in the security sector reform and governance agenda. However, the spectrum of civil society organisations that can play a role in security sector governance is potentially much broader. Accountability and democratic oversight of the security sector, for example, are often directly linked to questions of human rights, civil liberties and social and transitional justice. Minorities and other marginalised groups may find that their security needs are not being met, or alternatively, that they are victims of excessive use of force, unwarranted monitoring or other types of behaviour on the part of security sector personnel. Police accountability is a primary concern, and a subject about which a broad range of community groups and associations can provide information and on which many are already engaged. Additionally, different CSOs have different \u2013 but relevant \u2013 skills to contribute to the process of public oversight of the security sector. The key areas in which CSOs can contribute to the development of security policy and practices in the interests of the general public are: Research and information; Advocacy; Awareness raising; Training; Monitoring; Budget analysis; Promoting women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality; Human rights promotion; and Legal assistance and reform The ability of civil society actors to participate effectively in the processes of public oversight of the security sector is contingent on their core competencies. All CSOs, regardless of their specific focus, should seek to progressively develop their skills to maintain a consistent level of service provision to their constituencies and enable interaction with their peers and interested parties, including at the international level. Box 17 Media and Security Sector Governance in the Palestinian Territories In established democracies, the media helps to strengthen accountability and good governance of the security sector.

Actions such as monitoring government performance, policy, compliance with laws and human rights observance all contribute to this process. II). Current Situation in the target Pacific Island Countries CSO capacity, reach and impact are variable throughout the Pacific. Fiji and PNG are generally considered to have fairly strong civil society sectors, though capacity challenges still exist. Women\u2019s organisations are particularly strong, as are service delivery NGOs who often deliver services in rural areas in the absence of a strong government presence. Accountability and democracy organisations are more limited, though all four countries of Melanesia have functioning Transparency International chapters. In all countries, the churches have strong influence and outreach. The media is generally strong in all countries. All have newspapers, radio and television stations. However, in Fiji, three publishers have been deported by the government and the current Public Emergency Decree permits censors to sit inside media bodies. Any drive towards comprehensive security in the Pacific must ensure that policy and practice is embedded in the needs and experiences of communities affected by conflict and insecurity. Through their proximity to communities, NGOs are uniquely placed to deliver this. However, civil society organisations face a number of key challenges: (a) shortage of skilled human resources (particularly on security matters); (b) lack of management, leadership and technical capacity; (c) no stable financial sustainability, which undermines long-term planning and the development of a long-term vision; (d) limited cross-fertilisation of expertise and learning; (e) difficulties in fundraising for rapid micro-level responses to violence; and (f) highly fragmented initiatives.66 An approach to building civil society is needed that enables these groups to effectively engage with state actors on security issues, creates synergy in application of expertise, while also building their capacity for effective response to conflict. Box 18 Civil society organisations working on conflict prevention in the Pacific are few in number, fragmented and isolated. They have, nonetheless, very important insights, expertise and experiences that are not shared region-wide. PNG civil society organisations are known for their work on restorative justice at the community level and in mediation of clan-related conflicts. In Vanuatu the Great Council of Chiefs has been crucial in mediating land disputes and putting an end to social unrest in Port Vila. In the Solomon Islands, NGOs have monitored the implementation of the peace agreement, worked on community mediation, raised awareness on the gender dimensions of security and systematically engaged government on peacebuilding and reconciliation issues.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4f200e3f-f83f-41d8-809f-26d0b9fb6e7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4f200e3f-f83f-41d8-809f-26d0b9fb6e7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6b106241dc11fc6e0744e026fd82ad202cd00e6757dc86e8aff4324324679e72"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0b1e294-3aea-45a6-bf30-0974f9f02208", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a35ef9a0001c92f8eb37fc61108d6c85e302296771cdb4b6f7daf7f4df00bea3"}}, "hash": "20470dda66bedc819a59b42a76fec103b4078b68f87347389db574d22b44bb30", "text": "In Fiji, NGOs have done extensive work on community-mediation, trauma healing, and constitutional reform and provided inputs on security matters during Defence Reviews and the People\u2019s Charter process.

There is strong recognition that governance of security institutions should be on the basis of dealing with the different security needs of men, women, boys and girls. The integration of a gender analysis and perspective is central to the effectiveness and accountability of the security sector, and to local ownership and legitimacy of reform processes. Adopting a gender perspective makes these differences visible and enables action to be taken by the security sector to better guarantee that the diverse security needs of men, women, girls and boys are met. As such, gender is not something that only concerns women. Though full and equal representation of women is an essential step towards gender equality, it does not ensure that gender perspectives are taken into account. Instead, the integration of gender issues, known as gender mainstreaming is: \u2026the process of assessing the implications for women and men of any planned action, including legislation, policies or programmes, in all areas and at all levels. It is a strategy for making women\u2019s as well as men\u2019s concerns and experiences an integral dimension of the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programmes in all spheres so that women and men benefit equally and inequality is not perpetuated.69 Stereotypes of masculinity and femininity can stand in the way of gender mainstreaming and women\u2019s participation in the security sector, and can also serve to perpetuate insecurity. Women are often stereotyped as weak, dependent, innocent victims while men are seen as strong, independent providers of security or perpetrators of violence. In reality, women can also be providers of security and perpetrators of violence, and are often experts on community security needs. However, this means efforts need to focus on ensuring women\u2019s right to agency over their own security, and indeed, their own lives is realised in practice. In many countries, the security of women warrants special attention for a number of reasons:70 Women are subject to a high level of general violence and insecurity, and also to pernicious gender-based violence and fear. Women are marginalised in political decision making and the determination of security priorities and resource allocation. Public discussion of sexual and domestic violence is taboo. The security services, headed and predominantly staffed by men, neglect gender- based violence, are themselves guilty of this form of violence, and discriminate against their female members. However, it is important to recognise that men are also negatively impacted by these stereotypes as the expectation of security provision is fully placed on their shoulders. There is a growing awareness that addressing gender issues requires a closer look at men in terms of their gender needs and the critical role that the concept of masculinities play in the formation of ideologies, cultural norms and individual behaviour. As the World Bank states, \u201cthe subject of male identities, the link between masculinity and violence, the need to encourage a non-militarized masculinity and the particular positions of adolescent and young men require considerable attention in research, programme design and planning.\u201d71 d) Gender and Governance of Security Institutions Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 84 85 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 By integrating a gender perspective into security governance reform efforts, a clear emphasis is given to prioritising needs-based policies, more operationally effective security institutions, representative parliamentary decision making on security issues, as well as equitable budgeting and resource management. Effectively Addressing the Security Needs of Men and Women Because of the different roles that women and men play in society, largely based on their socially prescribed gender identity, they have different security needs. In a democratic security sector, these needs will be equally prioritised. As it stands today, threats to women\u2019s security are oftentimes not effectively addressed which results in a negative impact on women, families, communities and society as a whole. One of the largest gender-based security threats is the violence that is perpetrated against women globally. From domestic violence, stalking and harassment to human trafficking, rape and murder, women around the world live in insecurity due to the daily threat of violence. Globally, one out of every three women will be the victim of such violence, which often occurs within", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11efd22f-dd02-4649-bbe6-56a6ba7e9afd": {"__data__": {"id_": "11efd22f-dd02-4649-bbe6-56a6ba7e9afd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c4190782ba6f3215b144e983e2c6eecef8a3658c1e0f0f8ce4b21759dc82cd5a"}}, "hash": "c4190782ba6f3215b144e983e2c6eecef8a3658c1e0f0f8ce4b21759dc82cd5a", "text": "intimate relationships.72 High rates of violence against women also negatively impacts families, as children often fall victim to beatings or secondary trauma. Trauma also has large financial costs to be born by society as a whole: in the United States for example, where it is estimated that every year 1.3 million women are physically assaulted by their intimate partner, the health costs amount to US$5.8 billion annually.73 As the security sector, especially the police and justice systems, is responsible for preventing and responding to violent crime, security sector actors have the potential to effectively combat violence against women. Hidden in statistics from conflicts and instability in Papua New Guinea, Bougainville, Solomon Islands, Fiji and Vanuatu is the fact that women and children constitute a disproportionate number of those affected, whether at home, in flight, in camps for displaced people, and/or in the resettlement and reconstruction period. Even in periods of post or non- conflict, women are still at greater risk of other threats to human security than men, such as violence, sexual exploitation, disproportionate economic hardship, and in some cases trafficking and prostitution. Furthermore, while women have played a vital role in day-to-day peace work during times of instability, they are not accorded an equal place at the negotiating table for peace agreements, and not adequately consulted or involved in post-conflict decision-making processes. The risk of violence and constant presence of violence in communities affects many women in the Pacific. Gender-based violence (GBV) is endemic with some of the highest reported incidences in the world. However, the reported levels do not give a full picture of the nature of GBV, because of substantial levels of under-reporting of (for example) domestic violence, which is normalized in many societies, and the stigma attached to sexual violence. These forms of violence are predominantly an expression of aggression, power and dominance. Gender inequalities and power relations are at the core of these manifestations of violence. CSOs have initiated extensive work to address GBV in the Pacific. For example: community-based projects focused on attitudinal, knowledge and behavioural change among individuals, efforts to reform the response of police and the judiciary to GBV, promoting women in leadership through temporary special measures and advocacy for new, enhanced and reformed laws and policies to increase gender equality and prevent violence. There are also numerous public awareness campaigns on issues including the criminality of domestic violence and the rights and safety of girls and women. In addition, there are an increasing number of initiatives with a focus on engaging men and boys to prevent GBV and promote gender equality in the Pacific. Gender and Strategic Security Policy Gender is important in strategic security policymaking as it ensures a people-centred approach to security provision, not least through promoting participatory policymaking processes. By focusing on the sometimes different needs of men, women, boys and girls, objectives can be specified which allow planning, resource management and budgeting to be focused on providing a secure environment in which all segments of society can conduct their daily life. Such an approach assists in the creation of a comprehensive security policy that addresses diverse security needs, and it reduces discrimination in security policies and security sector institutions. Key questions need to be considered to ensure that gender issues are addressed in security policymaking, including: Does it address threats to security as identified/ prioritised and experienced by people and communities, not only state interests? Have internal security threats and day-to-day threats to human security been included? Has the policy been developed in a participatory manner, including women\u2019s groups and other CSOs, staff from the ministry of women\u2019s affairs, female parliamentarians and gender experts? How does the policy address the different security needs of women, men, girls and boys? How does the policy address GBV? How does the policy emphasise the importance of gender equality goals, including non- discrimination and the equal participation of women and men? Is the policy formulated in gender-sensitive language? Is the policy in line with international, regional and national legislation and policies on gender issues? Will the policy be implemented, monitored and evaluated in a gender responsive manner?74 Gender and Oversight of Security Institutions In order to create a democratic and inclusive security sector, it is essential that security institutions be representative of the population they serve. As men are highly overrepresented in security institutions, targeted initiatives are needed to increase women\u2019s participation. Women not only have the right to full and equal participation in security institutions and reform processes, as stated in various international mandates, but their participation has a positive influence on the security sector.

Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 86 87 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Box 19 The 1996 White Paper on National Defence for the Republic of South Africa was drafted by Laurie Nathan of the University of Cape Town. The first draft of the paper was widely commented on by civil society organisations and members of the defence industry. It included a focus on human security and emphasised the creation of a non-sexist institutional culture, including an obligation of the Ministry of Defence to identify and eliminate discriminatory practices and attitudes in the armed forces. In addition, it called for affirmative action and equal opportunity programmes as well as acknowledgment of the right of women to serve in all ranks and positions, including combat roles. The White Paper also called for a defence review to outline operational details such as doctrine, force design, logistics, armaments, human resources and equipment. At the insistence of women parliamentarians, the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Defence called for a national consultation as part of the defence review process. A variety of measures were taken to ensure public participation, including using military planes and buses to transport religious and community leaders, CSO activists and representatives of women\u2019s organisations to regional meetings and workshops. Grassroots women\u2019s organisations were vital in drawing attention to previously ignored issues such as the environmental impact of the military and the sexual harassment of women by military personnel. To respond to these issues, two new sub-committees were formed within the Defence Secretariat. Ultimately, the participatory nature of the Defence Review was credited with assisting the process of building national consensus around defence issues and generating public legitimacy for new security structures.

Geneva: DCAF, OSCE/ODIHR, UN-INSTRAW. Creating Gender Responsive National Security Policies To integrate a gender perspective into parliamentary oversight of the security sector, it is recommended that parliaments formulate inclusive, needs-based security laws and policies, build representative and effective security institutions, address gender-based violence, increase women\u2019s representation in parliaments and parliamentary security decision making, and implement equitable budgeting and procurement.75 The Pacific has the lowest proportion of women in national legislatures of any region in the world, with only 4.3% women legislators.76 The table below highlights the number and percentage of women in the legislature in the target countries.

Recently UNIFEM Pacific has launched a five year regional gender equality and political governance (GEPG) Programme. The aim is to increase women\u2019s understanding of democracy, citizenship and leadership especially at community and local government level; to support the application of democratic principles and accountability of leaders in local organisations, including women groups. Also in recent years, the issue of promoting more women in national legislatures using temporary special measures such as reserved seats or political party quotas has gained increasing attention amongst policy- makers and civil society alike in the Pacific. Article 4 of CEDAW, which has been ratified by all but three Forum Islands Countries, recognises that sometimes governments need to implement affirmative action initiatives or \u201ctemporary special measures\u201d to advance gender equality.

In Tonga and Solomon Islands, submissions have been made to their respective constitutional review bodies, arguing for the reservation of a set number of seats for women.

Parliament, itself also stand to benefit from addressing the unequal power relations found in society, by ensuring formal legal equality between women and men. Gender and Security Sector Oversight - The Legal Framework To fully integrate gender into security policy and practice, it is vital for a society to integrate relevant international and regional laws, instruments and norms concerning security and gender into their legislative framework. This not only provides a legal foundation for accountability on security provision but also enables the security sector, democratic institutions and government to better develop their focus on gender issues. In terms of security sector governance, certain instruments have targeted a specific security sector component.77 Parliamentary Oversight CEDAW (1979): Of particular importance to parliamentarians is the emphasis on the right of women \u2018to vote in all elections and public referenda and to be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies\u2019 (Art. 7-a) and \u2018to participate in the formulation of government policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of government\u2019 (Art. 7-b). United Nations General Assembly, DEVAW (1993): The declaration stipulates that \u2018States should pursue by all appropriate means and without delay a policy of eliminating violence against women and, to this end, should\u2026 Include in government budgets adequate resources for their activities related to the elimination of violence against women\u2019(Art. 4). Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995): Governments committed to make available gender- sensitive human rights education and training to members of parliament.

In Solomon Islands, the parliament made changes to four legal practices, which reduce discriminatory evidence practices in sexual assault law, when it passed the Evidence Act 2009. In 2008, the Vanuatu Parliament passed the Family Protection Act, which provides for an offence of domestic violence and family protection orders in the cases of domestic violence. It was signed into law by the president in 2009. It is the first PIC to pass stand alone comprehensive domestic violence legislation. The Vanuatu legislation complies with global best practices by stating that the payment of bride price in custom marriage and compensation shall not be a defence against prosecution for domestic violence.79 In 2003, the Papua New Guinea Parliament passed new legislation on sexual offences, including marital rape and offences against children, however, such changes have not been forthcoming on domestic violence and family law. Also in 2003, in Fiji the Family Law Act was passed by parliament after years of lobbying, awareness raising and training by CSOs. The act established the Family Law Court and counselling facilities. However, Pacific laws on violence against women (VAW) are outdated and treat women with indifference despite the globally high rates of VAW in the Pacific region. The Secretariat for the Pacific Community \u2013 Regional Rights Resources Team have initiated a regional project to change laws protecting women and lobbying for legislative change in violence against women and family law in order to enhance protective legislation for women and girls in six PICs, including Solomon Islands and Tonga. The project recognises that laws are not the be all and end all but can be an effective catalyst of social change.80 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 90 91 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Gender and Democratic Oversight \u2013 Ombudsman Institutions Ombudsman institutions play an important role in addressing gender-based violence, principally through aggregating data that reflects the incidence of GBV, but also through monitoring the security sector\u2019s own practices when interacting with society. Ombudsmen can also oversee the integration of gender issues within defence and other security sector institutions, and/or ensure that any such oversight positions examine gender issues. Overall, ombudsmen can be effective advocates and play a key role in highlighting the impact of both domestic violence and of conflict related crimes.81 Gender and Democratic Oversight \u2013 Line Ministries A gender perspective is vital to ensuring that policy and planning of ministries responsible for security sector institutions meets the needs of all stakeholders across society. For example, ensuring that interior ministries budget for training and services dedicated to addressing the security needs of women and children involves both strategic planning, knowledge and relevant capacity to prioritise gender issues. Moreover, line ministries also need to address human resource and personnel management issues (including their own in-house policies) that reflect good practice in terms of gender equality, as well as aggregating gender data that can guide the development of policy and planning.

Integrating gender into oversight may entail the following: Ensuring transparent and equitable disciplinary procedures; Setting minimum standards of behaviour and codes of ethics for security service personnel; Ensuring that gender-specific needs are identified and incorporated into security sector structures and practices; Advocating for more women in the security services, particularly at senior decision making levels; Raising awareness of key security issues among the general population, particularly as they relate to women and vulnerable groups; and Channelling complaints from the public to the appropriate individual or organization within the security sector. The media also plays an important role in promoting public scrutiny of the security sector and communicating information about security sector governance. CSOs can collaborate with the media in order to strengthen their awareness-raising and advocacy campaigns. CSOs can also work with the media to train them on how to collect information and report on security issues in a gender-sensitive manner and can also play a role in facilitating the sharing of stories of GBV and in providing the necessary care and assistance to victims who are willing to share their stories in public.82 Box 20 As part of the long process of post-apartheid transformation, CSOs, especially women\u2019s organisations, mobilised to ensure women\u2019s equal participation and the inclusion of gender issues in the new government structures. The White Paper on Defence for the Republic of South Africa and the highly participatory Defence Review process firmly integrated gender issues into South African security policy. The White Paper called for non-sexism and affirmative action, including the right of women to serve in all ranks and positions. The Defence Review highlighted the need to address sexual harassment and create an environment that accepts and respects women. Specific initiatives were taken to mainstream gender issues and increase women\u2019s participation: Women were appointed to senior positions with the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Secretariat to demonstrate a commitment to gender equality and to serve as role models. Gender training was given to personnel at all levels of the Defence Ministry. Male and female military personnel were jointly trained to emphasise equal treatment and non-sexism. Personnel policies that directly affected women were changed, such as those governing maternity leave and equal benefits for dependants of men and women in the forces. A gender focal point was created within the Equal Opportunities Directorate. A gender forum was established to implement gender policies at the lower levels of the Department of Defence. A telephone hotline was created in order to report cases of sexual harassment and violence against women within the defence forces. The annual organisation of \u201cWomen at the Peace Table\u201d, a Deputy Defence Minister- hosted gathering of women in the armed forces and civil society to discuss people and security issues.

Defence Reform in South Africa: Institutional Mechanisms for Gender Equality Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 92 93 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 Some of the most interesting and ground breaking work on peacebuilding has been and continues to be done by women\u2019s organisations across the region. In the 1980s, women\u2019s groups initiated and provided sustained leadership to the anti-nuclear movement. At the regional level through advocacy, awareness-raising and policy documents, women\u2019s organisations have advised and informed the evolving agenda of the Forum Regional Security Committee. In Bougainville, PNG, Solomon Islands, and Fiji, women\u2019s organisations were among the first to actively work across ethnic divides at considerable personal and organisational risk. They have been instrumental in providing basic assistance to affected communities and in demanding accountability and respect for human rights. For example, in the Solomon Islands, the first efforts towards peacebuilding before the peace accords were from women who engaged militias of both sides to discuss issues around community-based security and to prevent further violence. In Bougainville, women\u2019s organisations started work with young men on peacebuilding and reducing the extent of domestic violence and stood in front of troops to protect communities. They initiated the informal peace talks that subsequently led to the peace agreements. Yet they were not invited to the negotiating table. They have also provided gender training to new police recruits and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b73502f6-c972-484a-b8ac-a86e868f19e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b73502f6-c972-484a-b8ac-a86e868f19e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cf5d0ce807e33c1470da342cb224eb2b09aeb49948a32d46e4c7204b72e8287d"}}, "hash": "cf5d0ce807e33c1470da342cb224eb2b09aeb49948a32d46e4c7204b72e8287d", "text": "worked in collaboration with the police to highlight the negative impact of violence against women and children.

However, their perspectives are not reflected in regional policy or national peacebuilding efforts and their voices continue to be marginal. In Vanuatu the Women\u2019s Centre has been instrumental in advocating for the Family Protection Act, supporting a network of male advocates, including training police officers and magistrates. Source: UNDP Pacific Centre Example 9: Pacific Peacewomen\u2019s Work on Security Issues and Exclusion in the Region In Fiji, integration of gender concerns in security sector governance initially took place within a broader framework of efforts for implementing UN Security Council Resolution 1325: women, peace and security. In 2003, the Women, Peace and Security Fiji Coordinating Committee on 1325 (WPS Fiji) was established, following consultation with the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs and a range of women\u2019s groups and NGOs (under the umbrella of the National Council of Women Fiji) that had consistently addressed women and peace issues. Subsequently, in 2003 women contributed to the National Security and Defence Review. This was an opportunity to not only become informed about national security processes but to also raise critical issues such as: The way in which the review process was being conducted; Who was being consulted; The issues being identified as security threats; and How international standards and norms, including UN Security Council Resolution 1325, were being incorporated into the process. Example 10: It was recognized that the reform of the National Security Council could pave the way for the inclusion of women\u2019s civil society representatives with relevant expertise. They would be involved in helping to redefine and ensure implementation of the new human security agenda, including through representation on national security councils and other local or district/provincial level committees and delegations addressing security issues. It was thus critical that the reform process recognise that women\u2019s organisations can: Provide policy advice on improving transparency, accountability and responsiveness. Monitor the implementation of international and regional agreements, as well as national and institutional policies. Provide capacity building for oversight bodies on gender issues. Identify early warning indicators or security threats and issues facing individuals and communities. Facilitate dialogue between local communities and security sector oversight bodies. Raise public awareness of how to hold security sector institutions accountable. In December 2003, The Fiji WPS Coordinating Committee, together with the National Council of Women, made formal submissions to the National Security and Defence Review. Recommendations included: The Minister of Women should be included as a member of the National Security Council; The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Women should be included as a permanent member of the National Security Advisory Committee; Women should be effectively and equitably represented on Provincial and District Security Committees; Women should be included in the National Security Assessment Unit; Gender balance in the decision-making levels of the security forces should be ensured and efforts made to recruit women into the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. The submission built on women and peace initiatives during the May 2000 hostage crisis in Fiji, including a dialogue between leaders of the National Council of Women and the Military Council. The submission noted \u201cthe National Security and Defence review provides an opportunity to take corrective measures of existing structures and processes that are out dated.\u201d These structures, according to the submission, excludes half of Fiji\u2019s population from being involved in security and defence matters and should be dismantled and re- structured. \u201cDefence and security is the business of men and women, therefore the organizational mechanism that deals with it should ensure that issues of men and women are given the same level of attention.\u201d Because of the role of the military in both conflicts, and its recurring role in addressing instability in Fiji, women learnt to negotiate and communicate with the security forces. In 2000, as a result of discussions at the Peace Vigil, the National Council of Women Fiji made contact with the military and, as a result, the commander of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces, Voreqe Bainimarama, brought together the members of the military council and other senior officers to meet with the representatives of the Peace Vigil.

The women also requested that the military respect human rights. From this initial meeting, women learned the importance of using the language of the military/security sector for future dialogue and peace initiatives. The letter was received respectfully and favourably, and a critical lesson learnt from this process was to ensure that future communication was more in line with the style of communication that the army was familiar with.

Fiji\u2019s National Security Defence Review 2003 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 94 PART 2 Photo By: Thomas Jensen Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 96 97 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework PART 1 UNDP and PIFS note that each of the target countries have initiated and are at different stages of nationally owned reform processes that include exploring the most appropriate governance arrangements for the security sector. The scoping missions highlighted that there is a complex and diverse regional security environment and relatively well-developed regional security cooperation and integration. However, local stakeholders during the missions have highlighted gaps that require further cooperation at regional and national levels. This section of the publication provides five country case studies: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu based on background research and interviews conducted in the target PICs during late 2008 and early 2009. The analysis here is best described as a scoping study, which had the purpose of assessing if there was added value in developing assistance programmes to improve security sector governance in the region. The scoping study mapped the regional and national contexts, key security sector governance challenges, existing security frameworks and structures in place, existing programmes of assistance, and the identification of opportunities to enhance security sector governance. The findings were presented and went through a validation process during the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference, held in Tonga from 27 \u2013 30 April 2009. Each country had delegations consisting of representatives from government including defence and police ministers and permanent secretaries, members of Parliament, Ombudsmen, civil society and security sector officials. Delegations were given the opportunity to review the findings, provide inputs and they made presentations in response highlighting key national priorities based on their collective experiences (please go to www.undppc.org.fj for a list of those consulted during the scoping missions and regional conference). It should be noted that the scoping study only provides a \u201csnapshot\u201d of the local context with the findings being neither comprehensive or complete and only tentative in nature. It also only focuses on formal governance systems, while noting that any reform efforts will have to take into account the local context in particular the relationship between formal and traditional and informal systems. The scoping has provided an opportunity to identify programming options and where more detailed assessment is required. The second phase of the programme development entails strategic planning sessions with key stakeholders in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu to identify areas where assistance from UNDP and PIFS could add value. Subsequent programme development would require a full assessment, which would provide an overview of the national context, the drivers and opponents of change and the needs of different stakeholder groups. It would also identify if more detailed sector-specific needs assessments are required. The following country case studies are structured as follows: Brief situation analysis Key security sector governance challenges Opportunities National priorities \u2013 determined by country delegations during the Regional Conference.

FIJI SECURITY SECTOR OVERVIEW 99 Fiji PART 2 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 100 101 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Fiji PART 2 Social tensions in Fiji are the result of a range of structural factors (e.g. land management, segregated service provision in education, polarized identities primarily \u2013 but not exclusively \u2013 between Fijians and Indo-Fijians) that have originated in the colonial past of the country. In more recent history, ethnic based tensions have manifested in political coups between 1987 and 2006. Local and national tensions have been exacerbated by a lack of inclusive dialogue on key issues (land, employment, natural resources, political governance system etc).

In addition, the trade deficit deteriorated in the first half of 2008.85 In 2009, the economy is further expected to contract by 1 percent, due to decline in earnings from tourism and exports partly as a result of the global economic crisis. However, growth is expected to return in 2010, due to a pickup in tourism. The government devalued the Fiji dollar by 20% in April in an effort to stimulate exports and tourism and so boost declining foreign reserves. The reserves have increased since that policy took effect, but it \u201cremains less than half the target of four months of import cover.\u201d The devaluation also significantly increased inflation to 5 percent in June 2009. It is argued that rising inflation could erode export competitiveness, which would undermine any gains from the devaluation. The ADB forecasts that there is a risk that fiscal constraints will further delay much-needed public works and, more broadly, reduce development spending unless the Government reins in its operating costs.86 Fiji has significant human development challenges. Since 1996 the percentage of the population living below the basic needs poverty line has increased from 25.5 to 34.3 in 2003. The depth of poverty as measured by the poverty ratio gap is the highest in Fiji at 11.2 percent (2003). This indicates that the average income/expenditure of poor households is about 11.2 percent below the basic needs poverty line. This means it would take an increase in real income of at least eleven percent on average to enable poor households to rise above the poverty line. It is estimated that since 2008 real incomes of the poor have fallen sharply, bringing more households into poverty. Figure 9 highlights Fiji\u2019s progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. It is one of six countries in the region that is \u201cslightly off track\u201d and/or demonstrating \u201cmixed progress.\u201d The most acute is efforts to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases.

The decision to undertake the PSDA in Fiji was guided by a desire to obtain a comprehensive overview of wide cross-section of society\u2019s perceptions of the issues/problems around peace, stability and development to complement available knowledge and understanding. The PSDA provided entry-points and options for government, civil society and the international community to address the causes and dynamics of social tensions in Fiji. From the nationwide consultations, UNDP, the Ecumenical Center for Research, Education and Advocacy and the Ministry of Multi Ethnic Affairs and National Reconciliation and Unity produced a synthesis document, \u2018The People\u2019s Strategy for Peace, Stability and Development\u2019, which brings together in an action-orientated framework the concerns, aspirations and messages of consulted individuals. There was also a framework for action formulated with entry-points and recommendations in four main areas: (i) strengthen constructive and inclusive governance; (ii) strengthen government and civil society capacities; (iii) strengthen peacebuilding and build confidence amongst stakeholders; and (iv) focus on inclusive and pro-poor development in key sectors for people in Fiji.

This included crime, burglary, theft and home invasions, domestic and sexual violence, drug abuse and prostitution. It recommended that the police needed to be empowered with adequate training and resources, as well as to make neighbourhood watch/ crime prevention committees more effective. As well, continued support to the judiciary was noted as important to tackle corruption and ensure the rule of law is upheld at all times. \u201cExtensive efforts are being undertaken to improve the performance of the justice sector as a whole. The newly established (2006) Family Court provides an opportunity for improved access to justice for women, children and their families; police training and institutional strengthening has resulted in tangible improvements in policing but these may be concentrated in urban centres \u2013 increased efforts to extend community safety initiatives out to isolated communities and rural areas may be required; extensive efforts have been made to strengthen the judiciary \u2013 judicial training continues to be a high priority \u2013 particularly at the level of the Magistrates\u2019 courts. Equitable distribution of resources throughout the justice system needs careful consideration to ensure equal access to justice for residents (victims and offenders) in rural and outer areas, as well as those within urban areas.\u201d It also recommended that active work was needed to reduce violence against women and minorities. In Fiji national research on domestic violence and sexual assault found that 80 percent of survey respondents had witnessed violence in their home. The figure below highlights other findings. However, it was found that 74 percent of female victims did not report violence to the police and counsellors at the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre believe that \u201cthe Fiji police records are not representative; assault of women is a commonly recorded offence but most women who have been assaulted do not report it, because they have been taught to accept violence, or because of family pressure, or because of fear of reprisals if complaints are made.\u201d89 Suffered repeated physical violence Reported being hit while pregnant Women reported abuse by their parents 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% Figure 11: Violence Against Women in Fiji 90 % of survey respondents Violence Against Women in Fiji As well as these challenges, there has been growth in serious crime in recent years and the emergence of transnational crime such as people and drug smuggling, fraud and money laundering. The recent working group three: role of Fiji\u2019s security forces in national development, as part of the People\u2019s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress expanded on these challenges: \u201cThe main issues that these law enforcement agencies face include inadequate enforcement of legislation in light of manpower, equipment and resource constraints; a backlog of cases in the judicial system; access to law and justice; defense and security; weaknesses in internal discipline; prison overcrowding, and the need for human resource development within law enforcement agencies to deal with more sophisticated crimes such as white collar and internet fraud. Related to terrorist activities but also to corruption and wider economic crimes is the need to monitor flows of funds through the financial system both domestically and internationally.\u201d Given these significant development, security and governance challenges in 2008, UNDP and PIFS agreed that Fiji would be a target country of the regional security sector governance initiative. Discussions were initiated with representatives of the Interim Administration, security services, parliamentary staff, human rights commission and civil society organisations. Following the consultations, a delegation from the Fiji Islands was invited to attend the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference in April 2009. The aim was to prepare the ground for possible future engagement when the political situation permits. On 9th April 2009 the political environment in Fiji significantly changed with the purported abrogation of the 1997 constitution by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. Consequently, on 2nd May 2009, the current administration in the Republic of the Fiji Islands was suspended from full participation in the Pacific Islands Forum.

The first involves suspension of participation by the leader, ministers and officials of Fiji from all forum meetings and events arranged by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, including the annual Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting. The second measure involves ensuring the military regime in Fiji does not benefit directly from forum regional cooperation initiatives or any new financial or technical assistance, other than assistance facilitating the restoration of democracy.92 Security Sector Governance Challenges Since independence there have been serious challenges to civilian control of security institutions. In 1987, the coalition of the newly formed Labour Party and the National Federation Party, led by Timoci Bavadra, won the general election and set about forming a government. On May 14th 1987, one month after the government was formed, Lieutenant-Colonel Sitiveni Rabuka, third ranking military officer at the time, led a military coup, which resulted in the overthrow of the coalition government. It was the first action of its kind in the Pacific region. On 28th September 1987, Rabuka perpetrated a second coup, subsequently proclaiming Fiji a Republic on 7th October 1987. In 2000, a group lead by businessman George Speight executed a civilian takeover of parliament, deposing the democratically elected People\u2019s Coalition Government led by Mahendra Chaudhry. The coup was supported by the Counter Revolutionary Warfare unit of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces (RFMF) established by Rabuka during the 1987 coup. The RFMF played a crucial but also controversial role in the response to the coup and returning Fiji to a constitutional path.93 Following months of disagreements between the military and the government on 5th December 2006, military commander Commodore Bainimarama announced that he had assumed executive power, that he had dismissed the elected government of Fiji and declared a State of Emergency, justifying his actions principally by reference to the Doctrine of Necessity. Subsequently, on 4 January 2007, Commodore Bainimarama returned executive authority to President Iloilo, who then appointed him as interim prime minister. The commodore set a broad agenda of reform including: commitment to upholding the constitution, validating the legality of the military\u2019s actions, an enquiry into the judiciary, investigation into alleged corruption by the ousted government (including plans to establish an anti-corruption commission), and the conduct of a census and the undertaking of electoral reforms, to precede the holding of a democratic election in an as yet unspecified timeframe. This subsequently has been broadened further into the \u2018People\u2019s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress\u2019, the overall objective of which is to \u201crebuild Fiji into a non-racial, culturally-vibrant and united, well- governed, truly democratic nation that seeks progress, and prosperity through merit-based equality of opportunity, and peace.\u201d94 The People\u2019s Charter aims at providing a road map to address the underlying causes of instability, amending the constitution and in particular the electoral system. The People\u2019s Charter process has received a mixed reaction from key stakeholder groups in Fiji and the region. The reasons for the 2006 coup are hotly debated, which is a result of Fiji\u2019s complex history and politics.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c01ed55a-4eb9-4690-be3d-bfa637334f88": {"__data__": {"id_": "c01ed55a-4eb9-4690-be3d-bfa637334f88", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9c7daa3a646659631b71a95b2661d66fb3757a4c898076d3112f54f46f7a32c4"}, "2": {"node_id": "eaa247e9-e466-4c01-8014-2abb3dd65240", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ab1254e33a746aa595c5c82bc773113d78115f45ac95c8d336621638144319fd"}}, "hash": "d286f3ad33ebb7bf870dd6ecbba4072da914e8e5d294145ec6d37c839162abcd", "text": "Despite this, however, a number of issues have been highlighted: Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua (SDL) attempts to pardon coup perpetrators of 2000; Attempts to remove Commodore Bainimarama from office and review of the RFMF; Police investigations of Commodore Bainimarama relating to sedition and his alleged role in the death of four Country Revolutionary Warfare soldiers in 2000; Introduction of alleged racially decisive legislation and the RFMF\u2019s role in politics; and Issues relating to the conduct of the 2006 election and alleged widespread corruption.95 Since the December 2006 coup there have been a number of processes initiated to try to resolve the political situation.

At a Special Leaders Retreat at the beginning of 2009, the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders called on the interim administration to take actions to demonstrate its commitment to the restoration of parliamentary democracy. Fiji did not respond to this call and also, again, ceased engagement in the Joint Working Group from the end of January 2009. Following the purported abrogation of the constitution on 9th April 2009, and in accordance with the Port Moresby Forum Leaders\u2019 Retreat outcome, the military regime was suspended from the Pacific Islands Forum effective immediately from 2nd May 2009. At the national level, former President Ratu Josefa Iloilo initiated the President\u2019s Political Dialogue Forum (PPDF).

A number of Leaders of Political Parties meetings were held to determine the terms of reference, scope of the PPDF and the selection of mediators, the last of which was on the day of the Court of Appeal decision regarding the legality of the interim administration. The agreed topics of discussion at that time included: a) the democratic experience in Fiji; b) electoral reform; and c) the People\u2019s Charter. However, since the events of Easter 2009 the PPDF has been abandoned and the regime had announced new processes for possible national dialogue, which involved restrictions on the scope of subjects and limits on eligibility for participation that would not meet international calls for Fiji authorities to pursue a genuinely inclusive dialogue without preconditions and pre-determined outcomes. Looking into the future before and after the proposed elections in 2014, it is clear that inclusive dialogue needs to take place to agree on the following: The role of the RFMF in the affairs of the state. This requires overcoming different interpretations. For example, the abrogated Fiji Constitution (Amendment) Act 1997, does not define the role of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces except to say that \u201cthe Republic of Military Forces established by the Constitution of 1990 continues in existence.\u201d This leaves open claims that the repealed 1990 Constitution\u2019s definition remains in force, namely: \u201cIt shall be the overall responsibility of the Republic of Fiji Military Forces to ensure at all times the security, defence and well being of Fiji and its peoples.\u201d According to the Forum Eminent Persons Group Report in 2007, this situation has led the RFMF to believe the \u201cConstitution Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 106 107 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Fiji PART 2 provides it with a political mandate to influence government policy in the interests of Fiji, however they may be defined.\u201d97 Before the 2006 coup, there was discussion of the president referring the case to the Supreme Court for clarification. Any new constitution will need to determine the role and responsibilities of the RFMF i.e., defending Fiji from external aggression; rationale and methods for their involvement in providing internal security; role and responsibilities of the police, prison service, customs and immigration; and the mandate for oversight of security institutions. Strategic security policy, which identifies national priorities, the values underlining the policy, the legal basis for the policy and the role of key actors. Given the fragile relationships between the security services, political parties, chiefs, churches and CSOs, participatory consultations, dialogue and debate will be needed to ensure public confidence in the process and outcomes. The terms of reference, role and composition of the NSC and whether a parallel broader security forum should be created to include the views of civilian experts and relevant citizen groups.98 The future role of parliament in overseeing security policy", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47b3baa8-1d14-40f3-a4f6-03878c5af35b": {"__data__": {"id_": "47b3baa8-1d14-40f3-a4f6-03878c5af35b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "427358d022f1b40e56471f250c8f113b6eaebd5543510c0d17e106041a36f5cc"}}, "hash": "427358d022f1b40e56471f250c8f113b6eaebd5543510c0d17e106041a36f5cc", "text": "and institutions, including whether a specific committee on security is needed and how it can be a moderator between government and the security sector.

Opportunities Currently, there are very few SSG opportunities evident, which will remain the case until there is a restoration of democracy and human rights in Fiji. However, it is important to note that The People\u2019s Charter for Change, Peace and Progress included a Working Group on the role of Fiji\u2019s security forces in national development. The working group came up with a number of recommendations to reform law enforcement agencies and security institutions (see box 21). With this in mind, the People\u2019s Charter views are one of many possible views, which will need to be considered once the basic principles of SSG have been restored. National Priorities During the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference, each country delegation was given a chance to discuss their key priorities. The Fiji delegation provided the following, detailing key areas, activities and support required: There is a need to initiate discussion on the most effective security system in Fiji in order to provide good and just governance; These discussions need to be supported by dialogue, reviews, reforms, capacity building, and developing effective information and communication channels: In particular, an inclusive and result-oriented dialogue process is needed to start discussions on security sector governance; There is a need to build the capacity of parliament to deal with security governance issues in the future. In specific terms: The National Council for Building a Better Fiji (NCBBF) calls for a national dialogue on the RFMF\u2019s role. There are also a number of consequential recommendations for increasing ethnic and gender representation in the military, for parliamentary oversight of the military and for improving the relationship between the public at large and the military. Fiji\u2019s national security policies should be reworked to take account of contemporary national security threats and the new paradigm of human security. In addition, a comprehensive national security framework for systematic and participatory engagement between the state and its citizens should be put in place to bridge the gap between the state and the community. This framework will identify how state security institutions such as the police and military can take part in normal institutional engagement with civil society organisations, religious organisations and other community organisations in various programs. This institutional engagement should be an ongoing process. The NCBBF proposes that the National Security Council expand its membership to incorporate wider representation \u2014 including the military and police, civil society organisations, women\u2019s organisations, academic institutions and community groups. In addition, mechanisms such as the National Intelligence Committee and the proposed National Peoples Charter Council should be established.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA SECURITY SECTOR OVERVIEW 108 109 Papua New Guinea PART 2 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 110 111 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Papua New Guinea PART 2 Papua New Guinea has over 850 different languages spoken by a population of close to six million people. There is little sense of national identity, with the ethnic composition both diverse and extremely fragmented. Ethnic groups are small and multiple, with no dominant majority ethnic group. Ethnic identity as a political factor tends to be played out at the tribe, clan and sub-clan level. Distortions of tradition have negatively impacted on the status of women in Papua New Guinea. The unequal status and power relations of women\u2019s conditions in Papua New Guinea are most graphically illustrated by extreme forms of GBV. Papua New Guinea suffers from some of the highest rates of domestic violence per capita in the world and also has high frequencies of rape and sexual assault. GBV both reflects and reinforces inequalities between and among men and women and compromises the health, dignity, security and autonomy of its victims and survivors. National research highlighted that two out of three women experience domestic violence as a national average and 60 percent of men interviewed for a national study participated in gang rape. For the same study 50 percent of married women interviewed said their husbands had forced them into sex either by beating them or threats.99 Papua New Guinea faces severe human development challenges. In recent years there has been growing rural poverty and urban migration with less than 10 percent of the population employed in the urban- based formal sector. The Human Development Index (HDI)100 in 2007 was 0.541, which gives the country a rank of 148th out of 182 countries with data. The Human Poverty Index101 is 39.6%, which ranks it 121st among 135 countries. Papua New Guinea is last among Pacific countries on both indexes. There has been a significant increase in the percentage of the population that lives below the basic needs poverty line from 37.5 percent in 1996 to 53.8 percent102. In terms of progress towards the MDGs Papua New Guinea is one of three countries in the Pacific region that is off-track in meeting the goals103. These indicators highlight significant economic and social disparities.

It also directly limited the provision of basic services. However, there is has been recent improvement in economic performance and two major resource projects have the potential to further improve the government\u2019s revenue position. Estimates for the gas project point towards an increase in government revenues by 10 to 20 percent. The anticipated increase in revenues should enable the government to focus on its development priorities; however, in the past public expenditures have not been well targeted to the government\u2019s high-priority development goals.106 Papua New Guinea has a history of changes in government coalitions and leadership from within parliament during the five-year gaps between elections. It has been argued, that the frequent changes in government led to the long-term deterioration of the integrity of budget institutions and systems, significant political instability and lack of consensus on strategic development issues.107 Recent legislation has significantly affected this situation. With new governments legally protected from votes of no confidence for eighteen months after an election and votes of no confidence not permitted twelve months before an election. Papua New Guinea has had to deal with significant violent conflict on Bougainville (box 22). Despite a relatively successful weapons collection programme following the 2001 Peace Agreement, Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) are still readily available. The presence of SALW in Bougainville poses a continuous threat to human security, with guns being used to extract compensation and money at check-points and road-blocks. Overall security has also been affected recently in some parts of the island, with the area around and south of the former provincial capital Arawa being particularly exposed. The presence of small arms also poses a future threat in terms of their potential destabilising impact in the lead-up to the referendum on Bougainville\u2019s future.108 GDP Growth Rate 8.0% 6.0% 4.0% 2.0% 0.0% -2.0% -4.0% -6.0% *1998 *1999 *2000 *2001 *2002 *2003 *2004 *2005 *2006 *2007 *2008 *2009 Figure 14: Papua New Guinea GDP Growth Rate from 1998 to 2009105 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 112 113 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Papua New Guinea PART 2 While the situation in Bougainville appears to be improving, the law and order and security situation on the mainland of Papua New Guinea is increasingly worrying. Its principal manifestations are land disputes; ethnic tensions; protracted inter-group tribal fighting in parts of the Highlands - it is estimated that around 100 people are killed every year in tribal fighting and that 20 percent of the population is affected by such fighting, most of whom live in highland regions;109election-related violence; raskol gangs in urban centres; sexual violence; violence against women and children; robbery, armed hold-ups and banditry along major highways; and growing levels of corruption and white-collar crimes. The widespread availability of SALW is further undermining security and safety in Papua New Guinea. Homemade guns are widely possessed and used in the tribal conflicts, while leakages from state armouries and illegal weapons imports mean that high-powered weapons are also readily available. The incidence of armed violence in urban centres, such as Port Moresby, Goroka and Lae, are now amongst the highest in the world.110The relatively easy access to guns is also contributing significantly to the vulnerability and human security concerns of women and young men.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d667c540-d263-4ea5-b6d6-92ac9a9d342c": {"__data__": {"id_": "d667c540-d263-4ea5-b6d6-92ac9a9d342c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "432d60ce9b0429572283de62090220f9b9d0a3e61f15b110e17050f671a23169"}, "2": {"node_id": "50d23bd2-2481-4c20-9929-b7c0cb4a883d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "56829cdaf8934ce48688a9abfb094453d0f7920c583747e853fcaa647c913eb0"}}, "hash": "a97274b4c7c355ea86a31df294a0f00f51d7f2c7ffcc5be61dd04cab7d2419c3", "text": "In late 2004, the then Minister of Internal Security ordered a complete review of the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary in response to escalating violent, social unrest and use of SALW.

Much of Papua New Guinea\u2019s post-independence prosperity was due to a copper mine in Bougainville, a region which had always deliberately protected its distinct local culture and traditions. In the late 1980s, a group of Bougainville locals demanded a larger share of the mine\u2019s revenues and compensation for the environmental degradation caused by the mine. Dissatisfaction with the government response to the claims, led to the creation of the BRA and its sabotage of the operations of the mine. The situation further escalated when the Papua New Guinean government deployed troops to quell unrest. The ensuing confrontation led to a violent conflict over the island that lasted for a decade. Due to a blockade by the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF), the civilian population not only suffered from armed conflict and human rights violations but also from disease and starvation. About 60,000 people were displaced and an estimated 10,000 people died. In August 2001, a Comprehensive Peace Agreement was reached in which the government conceded autonomy to Bougainville and held out the prospect of a referendum on independence in 10 to 15 years. The Peace Monitoring Group that was led by Australia but included as well Fijian, New Zealanders and ni-Vanuatu ensured the peace process until the end of June 2003. The first autonomous government of Bougainville was elected in 2005; a referendum on the final political status of Bougainville is to be held no later than 2015. The mandate of the UN Observer Mission in Bougainville expired in June 2006. well as significant evidence of illegitimate political interference.113 Responsibility for this situation was attributed to: Lack of government support and direction; Ineffective police leadership; Inadequate and unreliable provision of resources to do the job; Unpaid allowances and entitlements; Barely adequate salaries; System-wide lack of discipline, accountability and self-respect; Almost total absence of community trust and respect; and Political interference in police operations. However, it has been argued that part of the problem with law and order in Papua New Guinea has been the quite unrealistic expectations that key agencies can deal with the challenges given prolonged government neglect and under-resourcing. Furthermore, these agencies have been expected to deal with the complex fallout from broader processes of social and economic change over which they have little control but are nevertheless regularly blamed when levels of lawlessness and disorder increase.114 The police are still in the process of implementing the recommendations of the Administrative Review. It has been noted the long-term challenge to dealing with Papua New Guinea\u2019s law and order problems is to build the regulatory capacities of both state and local (non-state) institutions and enhance complementarity between them. Moreover, state justice needs to be rendered more accessible, accountable, and responsive to local needs, while community justice practices need to [be] brought into a human rights regulatory framework. Among other things, the successful mobilization of local cultural resources \u2014 at little or no cost to the state \u2014 will relieve some of the pressure on the over-burdened and extremely costly formal justice system.115 The PNGDF is responsible for defending Papua New Guinea\u2019s territory; assist in the fulfillment of international obligations; provide assistance to the civilian authorities in meeting civil disasters, the restoration of public order and security and meeting national emergencies; and contribute to national development tasks. The objectives of defence policy and the role of the PNGDGF have been reviewed on several occasions since independence against the background of growing problems of internal security culminating in the Bougainville conflict of 1988\u2013 2001, increasing pressures on government resources, occasional tensions between the PNGDF and civil authority, and recurring problems of discipline within the PNGDF .116 The PNGDF have played a significant role in ensuring regional security by assisting the Vanuatu Government to put down the Santo secessionist rebellion and its participation in RAMSI since 2003. It has also supported the RPNGC in internal security operations. However, the record of defence policy-making and implementation has been a mixed one, with changing (and sometimes conflicting) objectives, poor follow- through in policy decisions, and a perception, both within the PNGDF and amongst many outsiders, that the resources allocated to defence have been less than adequate and often poorly managed.117 There has also been a long history of strained relations between the police and the defence", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f0dc8f9-59ca-4092-a5c4-2631628330ab": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f0dc8f9-59ca-4092-a5c4-2631628330ab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45e6b60b075a61c0aa0189319afc8048d7866411ab78d09a7fc68aa4c83ab5d1"}}, "hash": "45e6b60b075a61c0aa0189319afc8048d7866411ab78d09a7fc68aa4c83ab5d1", "text": "force in Papua New Guinea and specific instances of challenges to the principal of civilian control of security institutions. In 1987, the Military Commander Ted Diro made it clear he would spark a coup if he was disciplined for alleged misconduct. In 1988, the PNGDF defied the government\u2019s directive to close the Lae Air Force Base. In March 1989, approximately four hundred soldiers marched on parliament demanding a pay increase that they believed was overdue. In 2001, the Commonwealth Secretariat supported the government Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 114 115 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Papua New Guinea PART 2 to undertake a security and defence review that led to an army mutiny in Port Moresby. The review made recommendations on the future roles and tasks, structure, size, capabilities and financial requirements of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. The recommendation to halve the size of the PNGDF and to sell military real estate resulted in an army mutiny at the military barracks in Port Moresby due to lack of consultation with the PNGDF. The government quickly reversed its decision and agreed to consult the military on any reforms. Also it should be noted that in both 1997 and 2001 the police helped contain the army mutinies and prevent them from escalating into political takeover attempts.118 In March 1990, Police Commissioner Paul Tohian announced over the police radio his intention to mount a coup. This ended up being known as the \u2018barbe- coup\u2019 as it was later found that he was intoxicated at a barbeque at the time. He was charged for treason along with two other senior police officers but the charges were later dropped. Despite these significant challenges, according to the previous Justice Minister Jack Genia, the country\u2019s ethnic diversity provides natural checks and balances that would neutralize any plans for a coup in Papua New Guinea.119 It also may, according to many analysts, play in favour of accountable governance. Key agencies of the security sector, such as the police or the armed forces, tend to be organised in such an ethically heterogeneous way that no one group dominates inside these agencies, while centre-based civilian politics is itself so heterogeneous as to act in most cases as a relatively neutral agent on ethnic issues.120 Given this context, the principal challenge facing Papua New Guinea\u2019s security sector is the growing problem of public insecurity in urban areas, high prevalence of GBV, maintaining law and order in remote areas, and managing financial and human resources to ensure security for citizens across the country. Security Sector Governance Challenges Consequently, there are a number of key security sector governance challenges: There is no overarching security policy identifying threats, priorities and institutional reforms and financial and human resources needed to ensure security and law and order in Papua New Guinea. Security legislation needs to be updated to deal with emerging security threats such as transnational crime and to formalise the police and defence complaints handling process. The security sector faces severe capacity and resource constraints, which hinders its ability to provide justice and security services to rural and urban areas. The capacity of parliament to work on security sector oversight issues needs to be addressed as it is \u2013 despite the considerable infrastructure available to parliament \u2013 heavily underdeveloped. Parliament has limited capacity to revise legislation, lacking legal experts with the ability to re-draft acts submitted by the government. Also, there is a lack of capacity to scrutinise expenditures and enforce accountability for budget management. There is currently a lack of civil society groups that promote security policy development through research, analysis and advocacy mechanisms. There are high levels of GBV and a lack of women in leadership positions, especially in parliament and the public sector. Opportunities The MTDS sets the government\u2019s broader development goals. The MTDS retains the philosophy of the former development strategy, namely that government will help out, not hand out, and that broad-based development must principally arise from the collective efforts of ordinary Papua New Guineans. Recently, the government launched its 2050 strategic vision, which includes a pillar on security and international relations. Papua New Guinea stakeholders have already begun addressing many of the key reform challenges needed to create the basis for security sector oversight, not least in the justice sphere. With the support of AusAID, the government has taken a sectoral approach to the law and justice system (see example 7).

Moreover, there are many well-trained and well-motivated professionals working in relevant government agencies. This provides a potential model that could be replicated to improve the coordination and delivery of security services. Government The government already has in place a sophisticated national security decision-making structure, which is supporting strategic planning towards the development of a national security policy. This provides an opportunity to set comprehensive security priorities; determine the role of security institutions and any institutional reforms required; strengthen the capacity of civilians to coordinate security actors; determine oversight mechanisms with parliament; determine the proper accountability mechanisms of the sector through formal legislation; and determine the financial and human resources needed to maintain security and law and order in Papua New Guinea. Parliament Given the Parliamentary Committee structure, which includes security, defence, law and order specific committees and the request articulated by the committee chairman and committee support staff, opportunities exist to support the building of capacities and skills to monitor and oversee security sector policy development, practices and budgeting issues. Parliament could also be supported to develop appropriate mechanisms to improve their interaction with civil society to provide inputs from the community level on security oversight issues. Ombudsman Commission The Ombudsman Commission is actively engaged on security sector oversight issues, having received complaints about human rights violations by the police as well as military personnel. Via a Memorandum of Understanding with the police signed in June 2007, the ombudsman is able to ensure that police officials accused of serious crimes are held accountable and cannot be promoted, while jointly investigating complaints against personnel (see example 5).121 There are also discussions underway to formalise police complaints handling with legislation. This practice provides an excellent model to be replicated with other security institutions such as PNGDF and customs. Civil Society Given that the Ministry of Community Development is supporting the establishment of a Centre for Civil Society, this could provide an entry-point to enhance the research, advocacy and analytical capacities of a core group of CSOs to constructively engage with parliament, government and the security sector on developing and implementing comprehensive security policy. Security Sector Given that the minister of police has initiated a process to increase the human resource strength of the police to 10,000 by 2010, there is an opportunity to enhance the training of new cadets on engaging with communities, strategic planning, accountability, leadership and financial management. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 116 117 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Papua New Guinea PART 2 The government of Papua New Guinea\u2019s Nation Building Programme with the UN Country office includes specific work on enhancing the police response to GBV, which provides a platform to improve overall internal accountability of the police. The military is currently assessing the issue of a military ombudsman in coordination with the Ombudsman Commission. The MOA between the Ombudsman Commission and police provides a model for the PNGDF, and the opportunity to harmonise approaches in practice and legislation. Also the military, in particular the Intelligence Division, is undertaking a security assessment process in the provinces, which could benefit from additional support in terms of strategic policy formulation and implementation. National Priorities During the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference, each country delegation was given a chance to discuss their key priorities. The Papua New Guinea delegation endorsed the opportunities identified by UNDP and PIFS and provided some additional comments: The Papua New Guinea government is currently working on a National Security Policy as part of a government plan as a whole of Government Business that takes on board the Medium Term Development Plan and the 2050 Strategic Vision: A wide consultative approach is required in developing the National Security Policy; Governance of Private Security Companies (by revisiting the Security Act); and Assistance will be required in formulating this policy. There is a need to reinforce the capacities of relevant Parliamentary committees: Assistance will be required. The Parliamentary Committee on Ombudsmen needs to work in close consultation with the Ombudsmen Commission. There is a need to revisit functions of the Community Justice Liaison Unit (CJLU), which is the mechanism by which the Law and Justice Sector (LJS) seeks to work with civil society and the formal law and justice agencies. The CJLU works to promote the engagement of civil society organisations in the law and justice sector with a focus on crime prevention, restorative justice and partnerships for change.

On 17 January 2000, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) raided the police armoury at Auki (the capital of Malaita), and officially began its own military offensive against the IFM, using police weapons.

On 3rd August the government signed a ceasefire between the combatants, which was followed by the signing of the Townsville Peace Agreement (TPA) on 15th October 2000. The ceasefire and peace agreements became enabling mechanisms for the facilitation of development assistance. During the conflict, the Solomon Islands Police became embroiled in the conflict and were directly involved in the June 2000 coup. The TPA endorsed a police restructuring process that allowed for one hundred members from each warring faction to join the Special Constabulary division of the Royal Solomon Islands Police (RSIP). It has been argued that leaders of the coup within the police inducted many MEF members as special constables, who were culpable in human rights violations.122 As the new special constables had not entered the constabulary through normal recruiting channels, including approval by the police commissioner and circumventing the regular police budget, the special constables were receiving large sums of money through un-transparent and unaccountable means. By demanding payment (sometimes with the threat of force) for full-time employment, the special constables drained public finances and fuelled insecurity across the country. In short, rather than helping to improve the country\u2019s law and order situation, the special constables were often identified as a major problem. In July 2003, Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) arrived in the Solomon Islands. RAMSI intervened to restore law and order and help rebuild the machinery of government.123 The first phase of the intervention was targeted at the law and order sector (approximately 2,200 police, defence and civilian personnel were on the ground in Solomon Islands, covering the capital Honiara and all provinces). Since then, RAMSI has continued to evolve, progressively shifting the focus away from operational work towards building the capacity of the personnel and institutions of the Solomon Islands public sector. The recent Foreign Relations Parliamentary Committee report summarised the achievements of RAMSI from 2003 \u2013 2009 as follows: The immediate restoration of law and order in Solomon Islands upon its arrival following the 1998 \u2013 2003 period of ethnic tension, with weapons seized and removed permanently from the community and militant leaders arrested. The building of stable long term security arrangements with the rebuilding of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, the Correction Service of Solomon Islands and the courts. The stabilisation of government finances and the balancing of the national budget with the assistance of advisers deployed to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury. Government revenue has increased by over 50 per cent, and Solomon Islands\u2019 economy has grown by an average of 5 per cent per year since RAMSI\u2019s arrival. Machinery of government reforms such as the developing of a professional and committed Situation Analysis Public Service, and the strengthening of formal accountability institutions such as the Office of the Auditor General and the Office of the Ombudsman. Rebuilding of Solomon Islands infrastructure. However, in April 2006, the fragile peace was highlighted by serious riots and looting in the main business district of Honiara following the election of the Hon. Snyder Rini as prime minister. The riots signal the lack of resolution to long-standing grievances and the inability of the political processes of Solomon Islands to address them through non-violent conflict resolution systems. The subsequent Commission of Inquiry also highlighted the disastrous consequences of an un-prepared police force, a finding which has resulted in the development of a police response team trained in all aspects of public order management. There are still long-standing and unresolved disputes over land rights and the distribution of natural resource revenues, which have the potential to re-ignite conflict and cause insecurity if not dealt with appropriately. In 2004, the United Nations Development Programme commissioned a Peace, Conflict and Development Analysis in Solomon Islands to examine the root causes of the Tensions. The report identified five themes as core issues affecting peace, conflict and development in Solomon Islands that were seen as integral to understanding the root causes of the tensions. The five themes were: Land (fundamental to Melanesian people\u2019s identity, group allegiances, spiritual beliefs and livelihoods); The clash between traditional and non-traditional authority structures; Government services, public resources and information; Economic opportunity; and Law and justice.124 The recent Foreign Relations Parliamentary Committee noted that the underlying causes of the ethnic tension identified remain the same today. As such, many of the issues were raised during the committees\u2019 hearings.125 GDP Growth Rate 15.00% 10.00% 5.00% 0.00% -5.00% -10.00% -15.00% -20.00% *1998 *1999 *2000 *2001 *2002 *2003 *2004 *2005 *2006 *2007 *2008 *2009 Figure 15: Solomon Islands GDP Growth Rate between 1998", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4cde6885-41b7-4434-9bd1-88662b19d719": {"__data__": {"id_": "4cde6885-41b7-4434-9bd1-88662b19d719", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8521a44167f314b27ef26ba265e02a41744e50f6a1ea58bdbd3e5ab8877841a"}}, "hash": "c8521a44167f314b27ef26ba265e02a41744e50f6a1ea58bdbd3e5ab8877841a", "text": "and 2009126 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 122 123 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Solomon Islands PART 2 The economy in Solomon Islands was severely impacted by the conflict from 1998 to 2002 (see page 26). It has a narrow base with more than 80 percent of the population relying on subsistence agriculture and fishing. However, since the conflict it has recovered with average economic growth between 2003 and 2008 of 7.2 percent (see figure 15). In 2009 the economy was affected by the global economic crisis, bad weather and a sharp drop in logging volumes. GDP in 2009 is projected to be flat, from a revised estimate of 2.2 percent and government revenues fell short of expectations by 11% in the first quarter of 2009. According to the ADB, as the government is committed to avoid borrowing, it will need to consider a combination of trimming expenditure, raising additional revenue, and refocusing public resources to prioritize basic needs such as health and education.127 A key challenge will be to broaden the economic base beyond forestry and fisheries. Solomon Islands have critical human development challenges. In 2007, the Human Development Index was 0.610 placing Solomon Islands at 135th in the world and second lowest among all Pacific Island Countries. Solomon Islands are on track to meet Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 2: achieve universal primary education and MDG5: improving maternal health. However, it faces serious challenges to meeting the other goals, in part due to lack of capacity to provide essential services. Solomon Islands have the lowest per capita gross national income (GNI) in the Pacific region at $730 in 2007. In terms of Solomon Islanders living a long and healthy life, having access to education and a decent standing of living, the country ranks 80th in the world. In terms of poverty and hardship, 22 percent of the population in Solomon Islands live below the basic needs poverty line.129 Poverty reduction efforts are affected by the post- conflict recovery situation, social dislocation, history of underinvestment in public services, and fragile political institutions. The most pressing issues for the country are creating sustained economic growth, adapting to the global economic crisis, increasing employment and income-generating opportunities for its fast growing population, ensuring access to basic services and improving human and institutional capacity.130 This will only be possible if the multiple root causes of the conflict are addressed in a timely manner, The current Coalition for National Unity and Rural Advancement (CNURA) is clearly reform minded and has developed policy and legislation to deal with pertinent structural and long-standing issues. The government\u2019s policy statements clearly establish that \u201creconciliation is the number one priority of the government.\u201d131 In this regard, in 2008 the parliament approved the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission\u2019s main objective is to engage stakeholders in a reconciliation process premised on truth seeking, examination of the root causes of the ethnic conflict and the Honiara riots and development of strategic policies to prevent recurrence of conflict. In the same year, the Cabinet approved a socio- economic rehabilitation package for ex-combatants, vulnerable groups and hosting communities. The objective is to reduce the recurrence of violent conflict by providing \u2018front line\u2019 former combatants with training and socio-economic rehabilitation Figure 16: Solomon Islands Progress Towards the Achievement of the MDGs128 Goal 1 Goal 2 Goal 3 Goal 4 Goal 5 Goal 6 Goal 7 Goal 8 Eradicate Extreme Poverty & Hunger Achieve Universal Primary Education Promote Gender Equality & Empowerment of Woman Reduce Child Mortality Improve Maternal Health Combat HIV/ AIDS and other Diseases Ensure Environmental Sustainability Develop Global Partnership for Development Low level of Food Poverty On-track Off-track Weak data On-track Weak data Some data gaps and slightly off- track Data gaps, slightly off- track packages. The strategy is to adopt a holistic approach that moves away from monetary based approaches to strategic interventions such as capacity development, vocational training and income generation. The government is also in the process of establishing the National Peace and Integrity Council to strengthen institutional mechanisms to safeguard against future conflicts. The CNURA government has acknowledged the longstanding land tenure issues on Guadalcanal and has established a Commission of Inquiry to review the sale of land on Guadalcanal. This is linked to ongoing post-conflict reconciliation processes. Alongside these reforms since 2000, the Solomon Islands have been undergoing a constitutional reform process as required by the TPA. Importantly, the agreement allowed for a Constitutional Council to rewrite the constitution, giving more autonomy to the provinces.132 A Constitutional Reform Unit exists", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da499113-b6c7-4fd7-81b4-29041c3f4695": {"__data__": {"id_": "da499113-b6c7-4fd7-81b4-29041c3f4695", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bb7db81ac9231d6a79431faaaae344a4180446181983fc12b7dc0a0c0e646d79"}}, "hash": "bb7db81ac9231d6a79431faaaae344a4180446181983fc12b7dc0a0c0e646d79", "text": "within the government to focus on such constitutional changes, not least to reflect the diversity of the islands. A new constitution is expected by the end of 2009. The government is also addressing key governance concerns such as: corruption, through the ratification of the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) and the development of a national anti-corruption policy; promoting freedom of information; improving political stability through the enactment of a political parties\u2019 integrity bill; launch of a new public service code of conduct; and establishing a task force to coordinate the implementation of governance reforms. Since 2008, Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Australian Overseas Development Aid Program (AusAID) have been supporting the Solomon Islands government to understand the pervasiveness of GBV and child abuse. The newly published Family Health and Safety Study (see figure 17) shows that 64 percent of women aged 15 to 49 who have been in a relationship have reported experiencing physical or sexual violence, and sometimes both, by an intimate partner.133 This research is forming the basis of a national strategy to eliminate violence against women and child abuse in Solomon Islands.

While the focus of much re- training and re-equipping through RAMSI, the police retain a controversial image as many citizens \u2013 particularly women \u2013 are still opposed to police rearmament. There remains doubt in the ability of the police to address internal security problems due to capability as well as organisational discipline. There is no overarching security policy in Solomon Islands, which takes into account the post-conflict and statebuilding challenges and starts to envision a future without RAMSI. Designing the appropriate role and oversight of the security sector as part of the constitutional reform process. There is insufficient numbers of trained public servants to deal with security matters in particular policy development and oversight of practice and budgets. There is a generalized concern that there is a lack of substantive human and other resource constraints within civil society and currently a lack of formal engagement processes between civil society, government, parliament and security institutions. This is particularly acute in terms of security issues. High levels of domestic violence and lack of women in leadership positions, especially in parliament. The increase in discretionary budgets assigned to government departments is indicative of the inability of the wider public service to coordinate expenditure and implement planning, and this applies to most government ministries. Symptomatic of this problem, the lack of auditing records and transparency and accountability procedures renders every line ministry open to ongoing efficiency problems. Opportunities Entry points already exist in several areas to address the longer term needs of key stakeholders on security governance issues not only during the current RAMSI mission but after its conclusion. Moreover, the representatives of RAMSI perceive a clear need for such programming as a complement to rather than a duplication of existing activities. Government The government\u2019s priorities are clearly articulated in the respective policy statements and MTDS. Following the parliamentary review of the International Facilitation Act, it is an opportune time to discuss the need for an overarching security policy that provides a long-term vision, bearing in mind a future without RAMSI. If the government decides to develop a comprehensive security policy, the Prime Minister\u2019s Office will need capacity enhancement to ensure policy direction, adequate public consultations and coordination of the process. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission provide a space to address concerns of police involvement in the conflict and offers an opportunity to develop appropriate preventative and corrective measures for the future. Parliament On security issues, the Foreign Affairs Committee has already taken a field survey across Solomon Islands to address public perceptions of RAMSI and its effectiveness (see example 4). The survey was a component of a parliamentary inquiry to review the International Facilitation Act conducted from July 2008 onwards, inviting submissions on the act and the work undertaken by RAMSI \u2018and to suggest any improvements or changes to the functions and relationship between RAMSI, assisting countries and the people and Government", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2034249c-3ce3-4759-b5d6-39d925281294": {"__data__": {"id_": "2034249c-3ce3-4759-b5d6-39d925281294", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "329c1017753260fa3291189e8311ebfe48d3451887bf4747cb43627118915791"}}, "hash": "329c1017753260fa3291189e8311ebfe48d3451887bf4747cb43627118915791", "text": "of the Solomon Islands\u2019.135 This is a significant example of effective parliamentary scrutiny in a post-conflict recovery situation and provides initial thinking on an exit strategy for RAMSI.136 With the establishment of a law and justice committee in parliament, it is an opportune time to discuss the needs and priorities of the new committee. Support could be provided through the existing UNDP/ AusAID Parliamentary Support Project on security oversight norms and good practices, relationships with the government, executive, civil society and the security sector, as well as policy development and consultation processes. The establishment of the new Parliamentary Committee provides an opportunity to establish horizontal accountability measures with National and Provincial Crime Prevention Councils. Constitutional and Electoral Commission The ongoing constitutional and electoral reform process provides an entry-point for establishing appropriate and context specific legislative oversight mechanisms for the security sector. This includes establishing ultimate objectives of security policies, drawing the institutional design of the security sector, delimiting the powers of the security sector and establishing professional standards and codes of conduct. Anti-Corruption Task Force The establishment of an Anti-Corruption Task Force provides an entry-point for determining which accountability institutions should be responsible for receiving and dealing with complaints and corruption claims against security institutions. Civil Society The activities of the National Peace Council and the network of church groups throughout Solomon Islands were the fertile ground within which civil society grew in Solomon Islands. In particular, the activities of women\u2019s groups were an important part of the peace process and dialogue that led to the end of organized hostilities in 2000. There has also been some active dialogue between CSOs and government agencies since the end of the tensions in the country. For example, the Law Reform Commission consulted with CSOs during the formulation of the new Penal Code. In the security governance field, activities have included community outreach on human security (particularly gender) issues, efforts to facilitate better coordination of security provision and creating platforms for citizens to express their insecurity concerns. However, engagement with government and parliament is generally unstructured with no \u2018formal\u2019 partnerships on or platforms for engagement on policy development. There exists a cluster of CSOs sufficient to begin a substantive start-up capacity development programme focusing on enhancing research, analytical and advocacy skills to engage with relevant security institutions constructively. Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 126 127 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Solomon Islands PART 2 National Priorities During the Regional Security Sector Governance Conference, each country delegation was given a chance to discuss their key priorities. The delegations stressed that Solomon Islands is in a post-conflict context, with numerous efforts under way to improve governance, the economy and law and order. However, prioritization is difficult, especially considering the lack of human capacity and resources, which can be linked to the devastating effect of the earlier tensions in the country. They also stressed the need to broaden the focus on security. They came up with a number of priorities: Strengthen capacity in the Prime Ministers Office Policy and Evaluation Unit \u2013 because then they can more strategically assess and advise on security sector governance issues National Security Council \u2013 support them to address broader security concerns Creation of an independent National Research Institute Inform evidence-based policymaking Develop National Security Policy That is underpinned by a broad understanding of security It needs to be inclusive and participatory, however this might be costly The policy needs to envision long-term security, which lasts beyond a single government Provide support to the Anti-Corruption Taskforce Long-term support needed to strengthen capacity of government to better manage natural resources for the country\u2019s benefit Within context of ongoing RAMSI work, strengthen the police force in key ways Capacity building to be: (i) sustainable, (ii) culturally sensitive, and (iii) draws on the experience and expertise of other Pacific Island countries Strengthen Police Domestic Violence Unit Explore future options for new Public Response Team Exchange skills across the region, including in particular on women and security Capacity building for civil society in research, analytical and advocacy skills Provide capacity building for new Security and Justice parliamentary committee and to all MPs on security sector governance Strengthen mutual assistance across the region to deal with transnational crime such as small arms and light weapons smuggling Capacity building for Ministry of Women to input into security sector governance policy development Support to increase women\u2019s representation in national parliament through temporary special measures by reserving 10 seats Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 128 129 Enhancing Security Sector", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "649ab785-ce07-4f3c-b062-2e0185b361af": {"__data__": {"id_": "649ab785-ce07-4f3c-b062-2e0185b361af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26347085217fc67a37506094ca64fe969786508e8cf1a86443370a412a3bceb4"}, "3": {"node_id": "271e1056-9305-4b88-87ea-ec1f6661da57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/enhancing-security-sector-governance-pacific-region-strategic-framework", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a1af046ad22897697c369c312f7328daa88ad03f0857622df1b3b285ac6bcce6"}}, "hash": "6610d383943b784e585e2b43d2c8bdc5003e7692153bcfe129edaf245319c0bd", "text": "Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Tonga PART 2 Tonga Population 2008: 103,566 Political System: Constitutional Monarchy GDP (US dollars at current prices) 2008: $264 Million GDP Growth Rate 2008: 1.2% GDP Per Capita (PPP US$) 2007: 3,748 \u2013 Rank 120th Human Development Index 2007 : 0.768 \u2013 Rank 99th MDG Progress 2009: One of five countries in the region which is on track Actors in the Security System Core Security Actor: Tonga Defense Services (TDS) Tonga Police Force (TPF) Correctional Service (Part of the Tonga Police Force) Customs Department Management and Oversight bodies: Ministry of Police, Prisons and Fire Services Fale Alea (Legislative Assembly): Finance Committee (the equivalent of most Pacific countries\u2019 Public Accounts Committee), Standing Committee on Privileges Law and Justice Sector: Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, the Police Magistrate\u2019s court, a general court, and a court of review for the Inland Revenue Department.

TONGA SECURITY SECTOR OVERVIEW 128 129 Tonga PART 2 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework 130 131 Enhancing Security Sector Governance in the Pacific Region: A Strategic Framework Tonga PART 2 In comparison to other countries in the region, Tonga is a relatively homogenous and stable country. It\u2019s people have a single language and culture, a single religion (with very minor exceptions) and no land boundaries with other countries or separatist movements. However, the riots of November 2006 highlighted the potential for certain underlying tensions to become violent, exacerbated by growing criminality. Tonga also has other security concerns including violence against women and children and the presence of deportees in Tonga \u2013 and their alleged involvement in criminal activities. The Tonga economy has a narrow export base in agricultural goods \u2013 squash, vanilla beans and yams are the main crops \u2013 and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food \u2013 mainly from New Zealand \u2013 and remains dependent on external remittances and other aid as sources of foreign currency. Following foreign aid and remittances, tourism is the second- largest source of hard currency. The GDP growth rate has fluctuated significantly in the last decade. It is one of five in the region that has been projected to contract in 2009, primarily because of the global economic slump has eroded income from tourism and remittance. It is estimated that the contraction will be about 0.5 percent. Growth is expected to resume in 2010 at about 0.5%.137 In 2009 government revenue and grants received at the end of the first quarter were about 20% under budget.

Also the rate of growth in the population and numbers entering the labour market far outstrip the number of jobs being created. In Tonga the employment to population ratio over the last decade has significantly reduced from 50.7 percent in 1996 to 37.2 percent in 2006. High unemployment among the youth, a continuing upturn in inflation, pressures for reform, and rising civil service expenditures are some of the most pressing socioeconomic issues facing the government. The political governance system in Tonga is a constitutional monarchy, which gives its King authority and power. The King oversees a Privy Council of cabinet ministers, presides over the governors of Ha\u2019apai and Vava\u2019u island groups and appoints the cabinet ministers and governors of the legislature. The 33 Nobles of the Kingdom select the 9 nobles\u2019 representatives and Tongans aged 21 and over elect 9 peoples\u2019 representatives. In 2004, a motion for the formation of a National Committee of the Kingdom of Tonga on Political Reform was passed by the Legislative Assembly. The National Committee was tasked with considering submissions, holding consultations and facilitating talanoa related to political and constitutional reforms and recommending legislation and/or other changes with a view to building national unity and promoting the social and economic advancement of the people of Tonga. In 2006, the National Committee on Political Reform (NCPR) recommended that all seats in parliament be subject to elections, while also proposing ways to ensure policy continuity and ensure the views of Tongans living overseas are taken into account.141 Riots occurred in Nuku\u2019alofa in November 2006, triggered, for some, by increased demand for democratic reforms,142 partly by the preceding year\u2019s strikes by public workers, and for others instigated by criminal elements led by citizens deported from other countries. During that period the Emergency Power Regulation 2006 was enforced following the burning of central Nuku\u2019alofa on Nove
