Brief description and characteristics of the Vjosa River Valley The Aoos-Vjosa River runs for 272 km from its sources in Greece to its mouth in southern Albania, where it drains into the Adriatic Sea. The first 80 km are in Greece. The total catchment area covers 6,704 km2, of which 4,365 km2 lies in Albanian territory. The Vjosa River and its tributaries can be classi- fied as a gravel-dominated, laterally active, ana- branch rivers with high sediment yields, where the bedload supply is higher than the actual transport capacity of the channel. This is reflect- ed, particularly in the middle section of the river, in extensive gravel plains up to 2,000 m wide, crossed by several lateral and parallel rovers, ox- bows and side channels. Another criterion of lat- erally active, anabranch gravel bars are specific forms of break-off at high flow velocities, which is reflected in the rapid abandonment of the main river channel during extreme flood events, and the formation of a new, parallel river channels in former floodplains.

Brief description and characteristics of the Vjosa River Valley The upper section of the Vjosa River is char- acterised by a steeper slope of the watershed and a succession of steep gorges between the settlements Permet, Kelcyra, and Dragot, in- terspersed with areas of large alluvial fans and islands. Downstream of the Dragot town area, the river valley widens, with the exception of two gorges in the river course: Kalivaci and Pocemi. The middle section of the river, between the towns Selenice and Tepelena, is a typical river floodplain. The middle section is known for the large gravel and sand banks formed by the branching river. The valley is wide, and the floodplains of Vjosa River are recognised as one of the most magnificent riparian ecosystems of the Balkan Peninsula, characterised by their natural, dynamic hydromorphological pro- cesses. A wide main stream with anabranches, open gravel banks and islands, lined by pioneer vegetation and bushes of willows, poplars and tamarisk, give the Vjosa floodplain an exception- al character. The river gradient is low over the last 40 km before it drains into the Adriatic Sea. Here the river changes from a branching to a meander- ing course over a narrow stretch of about 15 km, ending in the Vjosa Delta, which comprises over 15 km of river course and almost 30 km of coast- line, including the Narta Lagoon in the south (20,000 ha). The lower section is characterised by the widening of the Vjosa River and the for- mation of wide meanders. Between the towns of Fieri and Vlora, the Vjosa River crosses the Myzeqe lowlands and flows towards the Adriatic Sea. The river delta is located north of the Narta Lagoon, where the river reaches the sea. Middle section of the Vjosa River \u00a9 Jaka Subic 3 .

Management objectives for the future protected area in the Vjosa River Valley Most protected areas, including the proposed future Vjosa River Valley protected area, have multiple objectives and values. The authority responsible for the protected area may need to decide what the primary objective is among the many relevant objectives, in order to properly assign a protected area category.

The definition of the management objectives for the future Vjosa River protected area should be based on the following points: \u2022 The Vjosa River valley contains representa- tive examples of significant biological and ecological features or landscapes where native plant and animal species, habitats, and geodiversity sites are of special spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational, or tour- ism significance. Research and studies, implemented in the middle section of the Vjosa River in recent years have revealed a high number and den- sity of species and a variety of habitats cate- gorised as endangered at the EU level. The presence of several globally and nationally critically endangered species has been con- firmed. The extent of some well conserved EU threatened river habitat types found along the middle section of the Vjosa River and its tributaries is exceptional. At least eight habitat types of the highest conservation importance at the EU level are found in the middle section of the Vjosa River. No less than 1,175 species from all tax- onomic groups have been recorded in this area, including 13 globally threatened animal species and 2 vascular plants. There are at least 148 species of European interest listed on Bern Convention, 41 bird species and 78 animal and plant species listed on the EU Birds List and on the Habitats Directives. At least 50 animal species and 24 vascular plants are included in the national Red Lists of Albania. The whole river corridor is important for migratory species (e.g., endangered eel species) and areas where large concentra- tions of organisms occur for spawning and/ or breeding. \u2022 The Vjosa River system is a natural ecosys- tem in dynamic equilibrium, governed sole- ly by natural forces. The gradient of human 6 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 3 . Management objectives for the future protected area in the Vjosa River Valley impacts on the landscape increases with the elevation of the natural floodplain areas, and is more pronounced in the lower sections of the river course. The area contributes to the maintenance of ecological functions and processes, includ- ing the unaltered/undisturbed hydrolog- ical and geomorphological regime of the river, the last of its kind on the Balkan Peninsula. The floodplains of the Vjosa River in southern Albania are considered one of the most magnificent river ecosystems in Europe. \u2022 Natural biodiversity and ecological processes can only be preserved if the integrity of the flow regime along the entire Vjosa River and its unmodified tributaries is main- tained. Changes in water volume and levels, and sediment transport induced in one part of the river would be reflected in all other sec- tions of the river, upstream and downstream, and also in its estuary. Protection of the entire river, characterised by a high rate of sediment loading, is essen- tial for maintaining river dynamics and for the proper functioning of important coastal and marine environments. \u2022 The area is of sufficient size and ecological quality to maintain ecological functions and processes that would allow the long- term survival native species and communi- ties, with minimal management intervention. Presence of the transition zones between the main ecosystem types is essential for the maintenance of genetic or biological diversity. \u2022 Much of the biodiversity composition, struc- ture and function in the river corridor is in a natural state or has the potential to be re- stored to such a state (floodplain forests to be restored), with a relatively low risk of success- ful invasion by non-native species. \u2022 There are a number of unique or rare natu- ral, historical or cultural resources at the national, regional and even global/universal scales and traditional activities and intan- gible cultural values that show relevant or significant examples of harmony and inte- gration between socio-economic activities and natural landscapes. \u2022 Tourism and recreation resources have the potential to allow for a wide range of use options, especially in the areas of ecotourism and cultural tourism, which can be consid- ered an attractive sustainable development option for this area.

Compliance of the Vjosa River Valley with the IUCN definition of a protected area Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards \u2022 7 4. Compliance of the Vjosa River Valley with the IUCN definition of a protected area The first step in the IUCN protected area catego- ry assignment process should answer the follow- ing question: does the site in question meet the IUCN definition of a protected area? For IUCN, protected areas can only be those whose primary objective is conservation; this may include many areas with other manage- ment objectives, but in the case of conflict, the conservation objective takes precedence. A protected area is defined as: \u201cA clearly defined geographical space, rec- ognised, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associ- ated ecosystem services and cultural values\u201d (Dudley, 2008, 2013). According to the IUCN standards, every protect- ed area should: \u2022 Conserve the composition, structure, func- tion and evolutionary potential of biodiversity. \u2022 Contribute to national conservation strategies. \u2022 Conserve the diversity of the landscape and habitats and associated species and ecosystems. \u2022 Be of sufficient size to ensure the integrity and long-term maintenance of the identified conservation objectives. \u2022 Sustain the identified values in perpetuity. \u2022 Be operated under the guidance of a man- agement plan. \u2022 Have a clear and equitable governance sys- tem in place. \u2022 Conserve significant landscape features, geo- morphology and geology. \u2022 Provide regulating ecosystem services. \u2022 Conserve natural and scenic areas of national and international importance for cultural and scientific purposes. \u2022 Provide benefits to resident and local com- munities (in accordance with management objectives). \u2022 Provide recreational benefits (consistent with management objectives). \u2022 Facilitate scientific research and monitoring. \u2022 Help provide educational opportunities. \u2022 Help develop public support for actions. The Vjosa River Valley meets the IUCN defi- nition of protected area. This is demonstrated through the compliance of the Vjosa River Valley with the common set of objectives for protected areas, as outlined in the IUCN protected area definition. The IUCN definition of the protected area should be applied in the context of several accompany- ing principles, including the following: \u2022 Protected areas must prevent, or eliminate where necessary, any exploitation or man- agement practice that will be harmful to the objectives of designation. \u2022 Protected areas should usually aim to main- tain or, ideally, increase the degree of natural- ness of the ecosystem being protected. \u2022 The choice of category should be based on the primary objective(s) stated for each pro- tected area and should be applied to at least three-quarters of the protected area \u2013 \u201cthe 75% rule\u201d. 8 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 4.

The water quality and quantity, as well as the extremely high sediment load of the Vjosa River and its tributaries, should be maintained to protect aquatic species and water resources. The pro- tected area in the Vjosa River Valley should be designated to limit excessive and harmful human use and alteration in certain places, to preserve representative ecosystems with their full biodiversity, and to derive associated goods and services for people. There are other examples of protected areas (national parks) that have formed around all or a large part of the river.

The river length is about 165 km, and its catchment area covers 7,051 km2. The area of the Biebrza Marshes is one of the largest wildlife refuges in Europe, and the breeding birds attract ornithologists and nature lovers from all over the world. The Biebrza River, its tribu- taries and most of the natural floodplain of the Biebrza River are under strict protection ensured by the Biebrza National Park (park boundaries marked in red on the map, and the buffer zone in green). The park was established in 1993 and this is the largest national park in Poland (592.23 km2). Almost the entire Biebrza River (about 155 km) is located within the Biebrza National Park. \u2022 Population density and economic interests in the area: the establishment of stricter pro- tection zones for the Vjosa River and its trib- utaries is envisaged only for the narrow area of the riverbed where there are no major hu- man activities, such as the exploitation of nat- ural resources or agriculture or urbanisation.

Small-scale farming practices and the use of natural resources (gravel extraction, collection of wood for fuel, etc.) for subsistence purposes were not identified as a major threat to the bio- diversity and conservation potential of the Vjosa River Valley, and therefore could continue if car- ried out on a sustainable basis. Existing activities based on the use of natural resources, such as agriculture and grazing are mainly located on the higher floodplains, outside the core protection zones. The Vjosa Valley is one of the least developed parts of Albania. New development models for the area, such as sustainable and adventure tourism, should be developed within the future proposed protected area. 5 .

IUCN protected area category Primary management objective Category Ia (strict nature reserve) set aside to protect biodiversity and also possibly geological/ geomorphological features, where human visitation, use and impacts are strictly controlled and limited to ensure protection of the conservation values. \u201cNo- go\u201d areas and not or just sparsely inhabited. Often small. Category Ia: To conserve regionally, nationally or globally outstanding ecosystems, species (occurrences or aggregations) and/or geo diversity features: these attributes will have been formed mostly or entirely by non-human forces and will be degraded or destroyed when subjected to all but very light human impact. Category Ib (wilderness area) are usually large, unmodified or slightly modified areas, retaining their natural character and influence, without permanent or significant human habitation, protected and managed to preserve their natural condition. Fulfils the criteria for \u201cwilderness\u201d and covers one or more ecosystems. Usually large. Category Ib: To protect the long-term ecological integrity of natural areas that are undisturbed by significant human activity, free of modern infrastructure and where natural forces and processes predominate, so that current and future generations have the opportunity to experience such areas. Category II (national park) protect large-scale ecological processes, along with the complement of species and ecosystems characteristic of the area, which also provide a foundation for environmentally and culturally compatible spiritual, scientific, educational, recreational and visitor opportunities. Usually large. Category II: To protect natural biodiversity along with its underlying ecological structure and supporting environmental processes, and to promote education and recreation. Category III (natural monument or feature) protect a specific natural monument, which can be a landform, sea mount, submarine cavern, geological feature such as a cave or even a living feature, such as an ancient grove. Usually small. Category III: To protect specific outstanding natural features and their associated biodiversity and habitats. Category IV (habitat/species management area) protect particular species or habitats, where management reflects this priority. Many will need regular active interventions to address the requirements of particular species or to maintain habitats, but this is not a requirement of the category. Protect individual species/habitats or only fragments of ecosystem. Often small. Category IV: To maintain, conserve and restore species and habitats. Category V (protected land-/seascape) protect areas where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant ecological, biological, cultural and scenic value and where safeguarding the integrity of this interaction is vital to protecting and sustaining the area and its associated values. These areas are cultural landscapes that have been altered by humans over longer period of time and rely on continuing intervention to maintain their qualities, including biodiversity. These areas and not natural ecosystems. Usually large. Category V: To protect and sustain important landscapes/ seascapes and the associated nature conservation and other values created by interactions with humans through traditional management practices. Category VI (protected areas with sustainable use of natural resources) protects ecosystems and habitats, and associated cultural values and traditional natural resource management systems.

Threats to the Vjosa River Valley Threats such as large-scale changes to the up- stream water regime (e.g., construction of a large reservoir) may simply negate the benefits pro- vided by downstream protected status, contrib- uting to further declines despite good intentions. Conversely, large-scale gravel extraction could lead to increased erosion of the coastal area, but also affect the upstream flooding regime. River and freshwater protected areas need to be custom-designed to fully overcome the chal- lenges of water extraction, pollution, cumulative threats and lack of ecosystem connectivity. 1. Selenica area 2. Narta Lagoon (airport), seashore (construction of tourism facilities) 3. At the time of writing, plans to build the HPPs on the Vjosa River have been abandoned. Otherwise, the construction of the HPPs would be one of the biggest threats to the ecological character of the Vjosa River.

Most appropriate IUCN protected area category models for the Vjosa River Valley protected area 7.1. Selecting the right category or more than one category Once an area has been identified as a protected area under the IUCN definition, the next step in classification is to determine which category most closely fits the overall management objec- tives of the protected area. The area of the Vjosa River Valley under consider- ation for protection, is specific in several respects; it has a distinct longitudinal dimension, there are multiple targets in different parts of the area, and there is a striking difference in land use between the unaltered narrow riverbed profile and the adjacent landscape on the higher floodplains. According to IUCN standards (Dudley, 2008: 36), large protected areas may contain several pro- tected areas within them. The Vjosa River and its tributaries are divided into three sections: in the upper section, the river flows mainly through gorges and canyons and the adjacent land does not provide conditions for intensive agricultural or urban use; in the middle section, the river flows over a wide area with parallel currents and extensive gravel bars and land use is developed on the upper level of the floodplain; and in the lower section, the river is meandering and the area is often flooded, which in turn limits the intensity of land use for agriculture and urban- isation. Such marked differences in ecological character, as well as in the intensity of land use, in a narrow belt along the river course over a dis- tance of more than 200 km could lead to consid- erations of designating separate protected areas within the larger protected area. 7.2. Parameters for determining the protected area category Most protected areas, including the proposed future Vjosa River Valley protected area, have multiple objectives and values. The authority responsible for the protected area may have to decide on the primary objective among many relevant objectives in order to properly assign a protected area category. 7.2.1. Primary objective and the \u201c75% rule\u201d The IUCN guidelines for protected area catego- ries (Dudley, 2008, 2013) state that the category of a protected area should be based on its primary objective and that this objective should be ap- plied to at least three quarters of the area (the \u201c75% rule\u201d). Although it has already been demonstrated that the primary management objective for the fu- ture protection of the Vjosa River Valley \u2014 which should apply to the Vjosa River and its tributaries \u2014 must ensure the long-term protection of the undisturbed river and its natural dynamics in or- der to safeguard the main natural values of the area, there are still differences in understanding how the Vjosa River and its tributaries are per- ceived in the wider environment. Given its size, 18 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 7 . Most appropriate IUCN protected area category models for the Vjosa River Valley protected area complexity and the various natural processes that still shape the character of the river, is the Vjosa River is large enough to be considered an ecosystem in its own right, with associated migration routes and catchment functions? Or should it be considered as the \u2018blood of the wider cultural landscape\u2019 and an important part of the protected landscape? IUCN suggests the most appropriate protected area category for inland wetland ecosystems that encompass the entire catchment \u2014 the model proposed for the Vjosa River Valley \u2014 is the use of IUCN protected area categories I or II (Dudley 2008: 63).

Category IV areas are often based on regular management interventions rather than on leaving natural processes in- tact.

Essential components of the description of the protected area category in the context of the Vjosa River Valley Table 5 shows the specific parts in the descrip- tion of the different categories of protected areas and how they apply to the Vjosa River Valley (by section). Analyses based on the descriptive parts of the IUCN protected area categories show that categories Ia, Ib and VI are not appropriate for all sections of the Vjosa River. Categories IV, V are excluded for the upper and middle sections. The analyses also allow the upper section of the Vjosa River to be considered either as a cluster of natural monuments (category III) or as a national park (category II), and suggests the use of cate- gory II for the middle section of the Vjosa River Valley. 7.2.3. Distinguishing features by different parts of the Vjosa River Valley The middle part of the Vjosa River Valley Extensive studies of the biodiversity values in the middle part of the Vjosa River emphasise that the vast majority of habitats of international conser- vation importance (according to the Annex of the EU Habitats Directive) maintain and preserve their high conservation value because there has been no interaction of man and nature in the hydrology of the river and the narrow riverbed of the river. The same can be stated for the exten- sive list of rare, endangered and even endemic species present here. It can be concluded that the middle part of the Vjosa River and its trib- utaries is a natural ecosystem, whose functions and values are not supported by interactions with the wider man-made landscape on the higher floodplains. Distinguishing features of the middle part of the Vjosa River Valley: \u2022 Large and functioning ecosystem of sufficient size and ecological quality so as to maintain ecological functions and processes that allow the native species and communities to persist in the long term, with no to minimal manage- ment intervention. \u2022 Contains representative examples of a major natural region, biological features and scen- ery, where native plant and animal species, habitats, morphology and geodiversity sites are of special scientific, recreational, tour- istic and educational significance, and the composition of the biodiversity remains in a natural state. 7 .

Focusing only on the riverbed with the narrow strips along it (only the longitudinal profile of the river), the overall size of the upper section is relatively small; the upper section is characterised by steep slopes and ravines that could be considered a set of consistent natural features. Gorges are typical natural features that are part of the IUCN category III protected areas. Rough estimate: if only a narrow part of the terrain along the river in a width of 3 m on average along the upper section of the Vjosa River is included in the protected area, the area of such a \u201cNatural Monument\u201d across the entire upper section would be about 50 ha. 20 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 7 .

The upper part of the Vjosa River Valley Physical barriers and obstacles (gorges, can- yons...) in the upper part of the Vjosa River Valley prevent extensive use of natural resources and urbanisation of the area. The natural biodiversi- ty and processes are well preserved and their existence is not at all affected by the interac- tion between man and nature. The high con- centration of natural features (gorges, canyons, springs, and also cultural monuments, such as historical bridges, etc.) could be seen as a series of natural monuments, but functioning as a natural ecosystem. This implies two proposed options of protected area category for the core conservation area in the upper part of the Vjosa River Valley: Distinguishing features of the upper part of the Vjosa River Valley: \u2022 Large and functioning ecosystem of suf- ficient size and ecological quality so as to maintain ecological functions and processes that allows the native species and commu- nities to persist in the long-term, with no to minimal management intervention. \u2022 Contains typical examples of a major natural region, high density (series) of natural and cultural features and scenery, where native plant and animal species, habitats, morphol- ogy, geodiversity and cultural sites are of special scientific, recreational, tourism and educational significance and the composi- tion of the biodiversity remains in a natural state. IUCN suggest that a \u201cprotected area containing an important natural monument (normally category III), but nonetheless man- aged primarily for its ecosystem functions (normally category II) should be categorized as II rather than III\u201d (Dudley, 2008: 35).

Map compiled by the report author. The lower part of the Vjosa River Valley In its lower reaches, downstream of its conflu- ence with the Shushica River, the Vjosa River runs in a \u201cmeandering course.\u201d The pressure of human activities and uses of natural resources is high and the river here flows through the human shaped landscape. However, the river retains two key features of its natural course: regular flooding and a heavy sediment transport load that has strong impacts on the estuary and seashore. In addition, this part of the landscape contains some extremely important natural fea- tures, such as the Narta Lagoon, natural beaches and the coastline. Although not directly linked in the ecological context to the freshwater river ecosystem of the River Vjosa estuary, the brackish Narta Lagoon is of significant conservation value at the national and even global scales. The coastal lagoon cov- ers an area of 59 km2. Its national conservation value was already recognised in 2004, when the area became part of Vjose-Narta Protected Landscape. Its European conservation potential is reflected in the site\u2019s inclusion in the possible future Natura 2000 list. The Narta Lagoon is a Key Biodiversity Area (KBA), as a site with inter- national conservation value. The spatial unit of Vjose-Narte covers about 20,000 hectares and is the second most impor- tant area in Albania due to the high presence of water birds that use the area during the winter- ing, migratory and breeding seasons. In addition to the magnificent landscapes, this area includes 22 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 7 . Most appropriate IUCN protected area category models for the Vjosa River Valley protected area a wide range of valuable habitats that make the Vjose-Narta ecosystem quite unique along the entire Adriatic coast, including elements such as the sea lagoons, salt pans, a lowland forest, sand dunes and vast fields, in combination with a wealth of cultural and historical values. Distinguishing features of the lower part of the Vjosa River Valley: \u2022 Landscape, coastal and seascape of high and distinct scenic quality, with significant associated habitats, flora and fauna and undisturbed fluvial dynamics and hydromor- phology in the river and sea, combined with cultural features. \u2022 Rare and endangered coastal lagoon that contains a variety of rare habitats of suffi- cient size and ecological quality to maintain ecological functions and processes that allow native species and communities to survive over the long term. \u2022 Contains representative examples of signifi- cant natural regions, biological features, and landscapes where native plant and animal species, habitats, morphology, and geodiver- sity sites are of special scientific, recreational, tourism, and educational importance and where the composition of biodiversity re- mains in a natural state. Although the lower Vjosa River area includes several important ecosystems (river, coast, sea) and habitats (coastal lagoon with salt flats, dunes and others), these are not completely natural ecological units, as they are strongly affected by the impact of fragmentation and other cumula- tive influences of human activities. Two components of the wider Vjose-Narte area require particular attention for protection: the lower section of the Vjosa River, downstream of the confluence with the Selenica River, where any change in the currently predominantly undisturbed hydrological regime would have dramatic effects on both the lower reaches (in- creased erosion or siltation of the coastal sea) and on the upstream Vjosa River section (impor- tant migration corridor for species such as eel) and the Narta Lagoon.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1084972b-9c00-4031-8d34-f8cd2117d31c": {"__data__": {"id_": "1084972b-9c00-4031-8d34-f8cd2117d31c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protection-study-vjosa-river-valley-based-iucn-protected-area-standards", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protection-study-vjosa-river-valley-based-iucn-protected-area-standards", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "70caf477175c4ff680a4debea669a8893f12087694f054c43aaaef43e9fa51cc"}, "2": {"node_id": "11cc71b9-2535-4a8f-add1-567f7fc25b25", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/protection-study-vjosa-river-valley-based-iucn-protected-area-standards", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ca58240124058ff638783447b4555adf5584defb6a2f7a470e65ae0ecd7b7a35"}}, "hash": "032fe1587ce8b91bb390f369f2780f574bcfab91ba082fca375ee26957336223", "text": "All protected area categories must prevent or, if necessary, eliminate any exploitation or management practises that could harm the objectives of the designation; however, the IUCN standards also say that the category does not re- flect management effectiveness, which includes enforcement of management requirements.

Protected area category Description and aims Category II \u2013 National Park 1. A national park may be declared for extensive territories, usually not less than 1,000 hectares, unique for their national and international values, which are protected and managed for the protection of ecosystems, species, education and recreation (leisure, entertainment), and which regulates the sustainable use of resources by humans. 2. The level of protection is applied to the national park with the aim of preserving the territory in its natural state, conserving the biotic communities, species and genetic resources in order to ensure ecological stability and diversity, and where: a) human intensive occupation or exploitation is excluded; b) use of land with intensive technologies, means and manners that cause fundamental changes to its biodiversity, structure and functions of ecosystems, or that damage irreversibly the land surface is prohibited; c) construction of urban areas, highways, railways, high voltage power lines and long-range oil and gas systems is prohibited; d) alternation of the natural state of water reservations, sources, lakes and wetland systems is prohibited; e) any other activity contradicting the objectives for the preservation of the area is prohibited. 3. Activities that provide for spiritual, scientific, educational, and recreational opportunities may be carried out in accordance with environmental and cultural requirements, but only after the approval of state institutions is obtained and if their aim is: to conserve the area in its natural state or as near to its natural state as possible; to treasure the ecological and geomorphological values, sacred or aesthetic objects, for which the area is taken under protection; to take into consideration the needs of local residents, including fishing, grazing and firewood, to the extent that they do not harm other objectives of management. 4. Upon the written and justified proposal of the protected area authority, the National Agency of Protected Areas (NAPA) may approve: a) grazing and passing through of livestock and construction of light or temporary structures to house them; b) putting up stands, signboards, advertisements, signs and posters; c) sailing in boats, canoes and other means of sailing (not motorised); d) non-military flights in helicopters, balloons, delta planes etc.; d) driving and parking vehicles out of the assigned roads and spaces; e) mountain climbing, skiing, camping and lighting of fires outside the defined spaces; f) collecting of plants, fruits, seeds and fungi; g) performing of seasonal tourism activities, that do not require the permanent occupation of the land. 5. Where the park protection authority notes that the purpose for which the park was declared a national park is violated, it may temporarily restrict or prohibit the movement of vehicles, fishing and other allowed activities. 6. Upon proposal of NAPA, the Minister may adopt an instruction on procedures for temporary prohibition of allowed activities where the purpose for which the area was declared protected is violated. 7. The management plan of the national park, should clearly define, according to management zones, the detailed activities that are allowed, prohibited or that require permission from responsible authorities according to existing legislation. 8 .

A managed nature reserve or nature park shall be declared for those territories that are not very large and represent areas of active human intervention for management purposes of species and habitats, in order to ensure the preservation of habitats and meet the specific requirements of species of regional and local importance, as well as areas used for research, educational and cultural purposes. 2. A nature park is declared for the following main objectives: ensuring the protection of habitat conditions necessary to protect significant species, groups of species, biotic communities or physical features of the environment, that require special intervention for optimum management; facilitating scientific research and environmental monitoring as primary activities associated with the sustainable management of natural resources; enabling the local population encompassed within the area to obtain economic benefits, as one of the objectives of management. establishing special areas for the environmental education of public, assessment of habitat features and efforts to manage the species in nature; 3. Within the nature park the following activities are prohibited: the alternation of the natural state of water reservoirs, springs, lakes and wetland systems; the exploitation and occupation of the area with activities that are incompatible with the purposes for which it is put under protection; 4. Upon the prior written approval of the protected area authority, the following activities may be carried out: driving and parking vehicles out of the assigned public roads and parking spaces; collection of plants, minerals, palaeontological discoveries and stones; establishment and operation of facilities for military and protection purposes. placement of stands, signboards, advertisements, signs and posters, without prejudice to those that provide data on the objectives of the protected reserve; skiing, camping and lighting of fires outside the designated areas. 5. In order to comply with the protective measures set forth in the management plan, the rules for short-term visits or passing through of visitors or tourists shall be approved by Instruction of the minister, upon proposal of NAPA. 6. the management plan of the nature park, should clearly define, according to management zones, the detailed activities that are allowed, prohibited or that require permission from responsible authorities according to existing legislation. 8 .

In a protected landscape the degree of protection, which ensures the following main objectives, shall apply: to strengthen the balanced interaction of nature and culture for the protection of the landscape, the traditional land uses and building practices, and the typical social and cultural manifestations of the area; to provide opportunities for well-being and economic activities that are in harmony with nature and the preservation of cultural and spiritual values of local population; to eliminate where necessary, and to prevent the use of land and performance of other activities which are deemed inappropriate in scale and/ or in content; to create opportunities for the public to enjoy recreation and tourism, in accordance with the character and scope of the essential features of the area; to encourage scientific and educational activities, that may assist in the long- term development and welfare of local populations and ensure the wide public support for the preservation of the environment in those protected areas; to bring economic benefits and contribute to the improvement of the welfare of local populations through exploitation of natural products/such as forests and fish production and services/clean water or income derived from appropriate forms of tourism. 4. Activities that alter the use of the territory, i.e., construction, sewage treatment in farms, interventions to areas greater than 2 hectares, construction of highways, sailing canals and urban areas, and other similar activities may be allowed only if the entity seeking to perform such activities is issued the environmental permit. 5. The written approval of the protected area authority shall constitute sufficient authorisation for excising the activities stated below: use of chemicals and pesticides in agricultural lands; lighting fires out of designated places and areas; driving vehicles out of roads and assigned places; this rule does not apply to state agricultural and forestry vehicles and machineries, to fire engines, ambulances, to veterinary services and water management machinery; organisation of cars, motorbikes and bicycles racing; practice of unique or traditional use of land and social organisations emanating from human settlements, local customs and religious beliefs, should be allowed upon requisition of an environmental permit. 6. The management plan of the protected landscape, should clearly define, according to management zones, the detailed activities that are allowed, prohibited or that require permission from responsible authorities according to existing legislation. Table compiled by report author . 8.1. Zoning within protected areas Protected area legislation, including Act 81/2017 in Albania, recognizes the concept of zoning as a management tool. Zoning is particularly useful for dealing with large multi-purpose and mul- ti-dimensional protected areas and for providing linkages between core areas. Albanian legislation allows the use of flexible zoning for inner zones in the national park, managed nature reserve and protected landscape. The legislation indicates that the management plan for a given area can divide the area into zones or units to define different management needs (strictly protected areas, tourism areas, restoration areas...). 30 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 8 . National protected area categories in Albania and their application for the Vjosa River Valley Alternatively, zones within a protected area can have their own protected area categories, per- manently defined not only in the management plan but also in the law. The first option provides flexibility for adaptive management and adjustment of zone catego- ries through the management plan. The second option provides greater legal cer- tainty regarding the primary conservation ob- jectives of the zone, but category change would only occur by law. 8.2. Recommendations for the use of zoning in the proposed protected area Vjosa River Valley According to Article 13 of the Protected Areas Act (81/2017), zones shall be established within the national park, managed nature reserve and protected landscape as follows: \u2022 Core sub-zone \u2022 Traditional and sustainable use sub-zone \u2022 Recreational sub-zone \u2022 Buffer sub-zone \u2022 Heritage and cultural landscape sub-zone The first level of protection (strict) applicable in the core sub-zone aims for the comprehensive conservation of biodiversity and guarantees an undisturbed natural area. Article 48 (Act 81/2017) further divides the core zone (first level of protec- tion) into levels A and B. For the proposed core sub-zone of the Vjosa River Valley in the upper and middle sections, protection level A would be required. The following human activities are prohibited in the Core Zone (Level A protection) zoning model: a. Cutting of trees and shrubs; b. Use of chemicals and fertilizers; c. Construction activities of any kind; d. Extraction of minerals and peat; e. Fire making; f.

For the proposed landscape park option in the lower section of the Vjosa River Valley, includ- ing the lower section of the Vjosa River (down- stream of the confluence with the Shushica River to the sea) and for the Narta Lagoon, the Level B zoning model should be applied.

The second level of protection is applied in the Traditional and sustainable use sub-zone, which is primarily aimed at preserving biodi- versity, while ensuring a somewhat disturbed natural area with traditional and ecotourism activities. The third level of protection is applied in the Recreational sub-zone and aims to preserve nature and biodiversity in harmony with the development of socio-economic and tourism activities, including infrastructure for residents and businesses. The buffer zone of the Vjosa River should follow the model of the \u201cnational park region\u201d used in some EU countries (Italy, Austria), where the area included in the buffer zone provides logistical support and infrastructure for the national park, and where local communities benefit from the protected area by developing tourism, tradi- tional food production and other services used by visitors to the protected area. Heritage and cultural landscape sub-zones should include cultural heritage and monuments within other zones of the proposed protected area. 32 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 8 .

Tourism as a development potential for the Vjosa River valley The IUCN guidelines for national parks in the II category (Dudley, 2013) include visitor education and recreation as an important component of national park management. In most countries around the world, national park authorities have no legal obligation to promote tourism in the region. Rather, tourism promotion and develop- ment is usually part of a regional development strategy. The national park authority, however, should be actively involved in the management of tourism in the broader region where the park is located, such as through the establishment and promo- tion of a regional tourism board liaising with the various tourism entities in the region. In the case of the Vjosa River Valley, the broader Vjosa River catchment area should be actively involved in shaping tourism and development policy. Certain tourism activities should also be run by the national park authorities. One such example is the national park visitor centre, offering a vari- ety of interactive programmes for visitors.

Instead of building large-scale new infrastruc- tures (e.g., accommodation facilities, large hotels, etc.) in the core protection zone of the national park, such objects and supporting structures are placed in the outer zones. Permet, Tepelena, Selenica and other settlements are ideal for providing accommodation and other facilities for visitors to the Vjosa River Valley. The example of Gjirokastra, which provides accommodation for visitors to the UNESCO World Heritage Site, should be highlighted as an example of good practice. The main difference in planning tourism within national parks is that these areas do not encour- age or stimulate mass gatherings of visitors or permit motorised access or transport in core protected areas. As an example, consider the So\u010da River Valley in Slovenia, which is part of Triglav National Park (see box). There are other examples of national parks in Europe that are visited by a large number of visi- tors: Gran Paradiso NP in Italy (1.7 million visitors/ year), and Plitvice Lakes NP (1.8 million visitors/ year) and Krka NP (1.3 million visitors/year), both in Croatia. Some national parks contain true wil- derness areas or natural monuments, but with careful planning and visitor management, they can also accommodate large numbers of visitors (wilderness area within Peneda-Geres NP in Spain: 250,000 visitors/year; Krimmler Waterfalls and River in Austria within Hohe tauern NP: 400,000 visitors/year). The number of visitors to Durmitor NP in Montenegro has increased from 80,000 in 2012 to 190,000 in 2017, due to the in- crease of \u201cgreen tourists\u201d).

Tourism as a development potential for the Vjosa River valley Mavrovo NP attracts more than 3% of all tourists to that country. Tourism in Majella NP in Italy brings annual reve- nues of EUR 200 million annually, while revenues in the wider region of the park are estimated at EUR 570 million. Point Pelee NP is a small park in Ontario, Canada, located along the bird migration route. Bird mi- gration is most active in May, and visitors spend no less than CDN$ 3.8 million in this national park during that month. The main spending categories of park visitors are: 27.2% on travel/ transportation, 26.3% on food and 22.5% on ac- commodation. On average, day visitors spend CDN$ 54 at the park, and those staying for two to three days spend, on average, CDN$ 74. Sustainable tourism is an essential component and a landmark of successful national parks worldwide. The national park label is an increas- ingly recognised brand and additional attraction for tourists across the globe, generating reve- nues for protected area management and also for the local communities surrounding them. Box 2: Triglav National Park (So\u010da River Valley), Slovenia Bovec is a settlement in the outer zone of Triglav National Park, characterised by a mountain landscape and one of the most beautiful rivers in the Alps: the So\u010da River. The territory of the municipality of Bovec covers 368 km2, with a population of about 3,100. Tourism in Bovec is based on adventure and hiking: rafting, canoeing, swimming, cycling and mountaineering. Tourism generates more than EUR 5.1 million annually, and provides 11% of all jobs. Tourism-related activities (trades, handicrafts...) generate another EUR 10 million each year for the local community. Bovec offers small-scale accommodation in the form of agrotourism on farms and small guesthouses or private rooms. Each year 2.5 million visitors are registered as visiting Triglav National Park. 10 .

The nationally, regionally and globally sig- nificant native biodiversity and outstanding scenic values of the Vjosa River Valley are the result of undisturbed river hydromorphology and fully functioning natural processes, which need to be protected along the entire Vjosa River and its main tributaries: any change in water volumes and sediment transport would dramatically alter the last river ecosys- tem of its kind in the Balkans and on a wider European scale, and disrupt the migration route of globally endangered fish species. 2. The protection of the existing natural phe- nomena and features, together with the rich cultural heritage, should be based on the establishment of a protected area, where the core protection sub-zone should be con- centrated along the narrow riverbed (wider only in the middle section of the Vjosa River) and its tributaries and the brackish, coastal Narta Lagoon. Protection of the narrow wa- tercourse must be secured along the entire course of the river in order to achieve basic protection of the \u201ccontinuity\u201d of the water- course and sediment transport, since any potential disturbance along the course can have upstream and downstream effects. It should be noted that the strict protection of the narrow riverbed includes only those areas that are predominantly not used or exploited by humans. 3. The concept of protecting the wild river and its tributaries is based on strict protection of the entire narrow riverbed of the rivers, while allowing existing traditional land use activities (such as agriculture and grazing) to continue if managed for subsistence use and not on an industrial scale, with the possibility of developing the entire Vjosa River Valley as an excellent area for green, cultural and rec- reational tourism. 4. Although the brackish Narta Lagoon is not directly connected to the freshwater river ecosystem of the River Vjosa estuary in an ecological context, it is of significant conser- vation value at the national and global scales, and should be part of the Vjosa River Valley protected area. 5. The Vjosa River Valley meets the IUCN defi- nition of a protected area, as evidenced by compliance with the common objectives for protected areas derived from the IUCN pro- tected area definition. 6. Management objectives for the Vjosa River Valley have been defined for the three main sections of the river; \u2022 the upper section, characterised by a number of natural and cultural features and representing an undisturbed natural ecosystem, 36 \u2022 Protection study of the Vjosa River Valley based on IUCN protected area standards 10 .

The following points were considered in pro- posing the most appropriate protected area categories/models for the Vjosa River Valley: \u2022 the physical and ecological characteristics of the three main sections of the Vjosa River Valley (upper, middle and lower sections); \u2022 the description of the protected area cat- egories in the Albanian system of nature protection; \u2022 the concept of zoning within protected areas, as described in Act 81/2017. Pursuant to Article 13 of the Protected Areas Act (81/2017), zones within a national park, managed nature reserve and protected landscape, are de- fined as follows: \u2022 Core sub-zone \u2022 Traditional and sustainable use sub-zone \u2022 Recreational purposes sub-zone \u2022 Buffer sub-zone \u2022 Heritage and cultural landscape sub-zone Due to the specifics of the proposed protected area Vjosa River valley, with its exceptional longi- tudinal extent, the Core Sub-zone is designated as Zone 1, while the Traditional and sustainable use sub-zone and the Recreational sub-zone have been designated as Zone 2 of the protect- ed area.

In this core zone of the national park, zoning model level A should be applied. The lower section of the Vjosa River and the Narta Lagoon should be part of the landscape park, where the zoning model level B (as de- scribed in the national protected area legislation, Act 81/2017) should be applied.

Conclusions MODEL 2: NATIONAL PARK ALONG ALL THREE SECTIONS, but with different zoning for the upper + middle and for lower section (b) The second option is to list the entire narrow riverbed of the Vjosa River and its tributaries within the national park, but under different zoning concepts, where the middle and upper sections are part of the national park core sub- zone (Zone 1), while the lower section is in the Traditional and sustainable use sub-zone of the national park (Zone 2). The Narta Lagoon would also be part of the national park (Zone 2), but is listed as a Recreation sub-zone. Zone 2 of the national park, which is composed of the Traditional and sustainable use sub-zone and the Recreation sub-zone, should be desig- nated along the core sub-zone along the entire course of the river. In these sub-zones, the tradi- tional activities of the local population should be maintained. Figure 9. Model 2 - Entire river Vjosa River and its tributaries as a national park .

In all the protection proposals presented above, the buffer zone for the protected area Vjosa River should follow the model of the \u201cnational park region\u201d used in some EU countries (Italy, Austria) where the area in the buffer zone provides logistical support and in- frastructure for the national park, and where local communities benefit from the protect- ed area by developing tourism, traditional food production and other services used by visitors to the protected area. Heritage and cultural landscape sub-zones should include cultural heritage and monuments within other zones of the proposed protected area. The buffer zone is not intended to be part of the protected area. 2.

The area includes a range of habitats from forest grading through maquis to low over-grazed scrub with sand deposits and rocky habitat on the peninsula, as well as a range of habitats of varying salinity on the plain, from saltmarsh through dunes to agricultural land and a small number of water bodies. Apart from the tip of Jebel Nadhour from Sidi El Haj Embarek to Ras Ettarf and parts of the saltmarsh and coastal dunes south of Ghar El Melh Lagoon, all habitats in the area have been dramatically modified and are degraded. All of the plain on which the soils are not too saline has been converted to agriculture or settlements. The area supports more than 230 vascular plant species, including Allium duriaeanum and Daucus rouyi that are globally classed as Endangered and Stipa tenacissima which is Vulnerable, as well as Desmazeria sicula which is classed as Near Threatened. In addition, a species of Linaria has been recorded in the area which appears to be new and requires formal description. There is a need to collect more data on the vegetation of the saltmarsh and dunes to complement data on Jebel Nadhour and provide a comprehensive assessment of the plant conservation of the two KBAs. Of the 7 species of Amphibians in Tunisia, 5 are found in this area. Among these species reported with certainty, only the Berber toad, Sclerophrys mauritanicus, is common and even abundant in the studied area. All other species are rare and some of them are threatened with extinction globally such as Pleurodeles nebulosus which is Vulnerable. The reptile population of Ghar El Melh is rich and diverse, with 16 of 17 species confimed; the total species richness present in this area represents about 28% of the total number of species in Tunisia. The most significant threat to natural habitats throughout the area is the decline in water quality which ultimately affects most habitats but is particularly important for surface water systems, including the lagoons. Dam Beach Sidi Ali El Mekki. Photo: \u00a9Ugo Mellone iv 5 construction is also having a significant effect on the quantity of fresh water flowing into the lagoons. The combined effects of reduced freshwater inflow from the catchment and increasing wastewater discharge into the lagoon have potential to tip the ecology of the lagoon beyond its capacity to recover. The second most significant threat to natural resources is construction. In the area, the most damaging current construction project is the development of the new road between Tunis and Aousja via Kalaat el Andaluus. Other construction threats to the natural habitats in the area arise from the poorly controlled construction of facilities, including houses, recreation facilities and accommodation associated with tourism east of Ghar El Melh and around Sidi Ali el Mekki which are affecting the woodland and scrub, as well as the rocky coast on Jebel Nadhour. The increase in tourist pressure, linked to the development of both temporary and permanent facilities will have a significant effect on much of the coast. Not only is there already damage and degradation of rocky coastal habitats and the upper margins of sandy beaches, but many subsidiary effects are taking place, such as increases in wastewater discharge into the lagoons and coastal waters, loss of mature trees along the base of Jebel Nadhour to make way for buildings, degradation of both fixed and mobile sand dunes and planting of invasive non-native plants such as Opuntia ficus-indica as hedges. Other threats such as the expansion of small-scale agriculture, the increasing spread of non-native species and over-grazing are less important than the direct impacts of human activities, however they too are contributing to the degradation of natural habitats. It is also highly likely that the impacts of many of these threats will be exacerbated by climate change. The wetland area (paralic environments) as well as the borderd of the lagoon are the most impacted habitats for herpetiles. Road killings of amphipians during its breeding season, filling the lagoon claiming new areas for agiculture and water pollution are the main threats for the herpetiles in the area. The most effective method of achieving most, if not all, of the conservation actions needed within the area is to prepare a conservation management plan.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d3b789b0-c873-4c31-ba19-c944f3dfe194": {"__data__": {"id_": "d3b789b0-c873-4c31-ba19-c944f3dfe194", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Characterisation and conservation assessment of terrestrial biodiversity in the Ghar El Melh area", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "77b44eb66eed8ad55052fe97b812a03538bcfcefff543d7019b2bbe2a6658615"}, "2": {"node_id": "335a1b6d-3e66-42dd-bc35-b9da2983d865", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "98ad90dab8cd3fe3448991bb65501ecbf749e57382f7882dd5b25579c2a907ed"}}, "hash": "894e4fa22c271d978bd509f70f97c7bb29ce87d14f352ac04b4e4e2c1600ecab", "text": "This must include a hydrological assessment to provide alternative long-term water supplies to replace those currently provided by dams on rivers and streams.

V\u00e9la Chapter 1 __________________________________ Characterisation and conservation assessment of terrestrial habitats at Ghar El Melh 2 1.1 Introduction This report presents the results of surveys of the habitats around Ghar El Melh Lagoon, combined with data from the literature to characterise the vegetation of the lagoon and its surroundings. The area covered by this report extends from the outskirts of Tunis in the south, north to Raf Raf and east to the settlement and peninsula of Sidi Ali el Mekki, mainly following the C69 from Tunis through Utique and Aousja toward Raf Raf in the west (Figure 1). The report forms part of a series of documents supporting work toward the conservation of the Ramsar Site: Lagune de Ghar El Melh et Delta de la Mejerda (see https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/1706), Jebel Nadhour and Ghar El Melh KBA and Sidi Ali el Mekki KBA. The lagoon is located in north-eastern Tunisia, approximately 50 kilometres north of the capital, Tunis (see Figure 1) and 40 kilometres east of the town of Bizerte. Data were collected by walked surveys of all different habitat types, noting general characteristics of the vegetation, as well as any notable plant species.

Benth. by PoWo. 4 1.2 Habitat description and conservation assessment 1.2.1 General characteristics The habitats represented within the area can be divided into three groups (see also the habitat map reproduced as Appendix A). \u2022 Areas heavily influenced by salt which extend from the base of Jebel Nadhour around the lagoon margin and the coastal fringe to the south. \u2022 Low-lying agricultural land which occupies the less heavily salt-influenced areas of the plains. \u2022 Forest and scrub with associated habitats on higher ground, mainly on Jebel Nadhour. Almost all of the habitats within the area have been heavily and extensively modified by humans, to the extent that the only remaining natural habitats are on the eastern extreme of Jebel Nadhour between Sidi Ali el Mekki and Ras Ettarf and some lagoon habitats around Sebkhet el Ouafi Lagoon, Sidi Ali el Mekki Lagoon and the coastal fringe south of Sebkhet el Ouafi Lagoon. Apart from some areas of saltmarsh (presumably on very saline soils), the entire plain has been converted to agriculture, with remnant areas of semi-natural habitat now restricted to the margins of ditches and oxbows. On Jebel Nadhour the woodland has been degraded through, fire clearance and grazing or has been converted to agriculture around settlements such that there is a gradation from low forest on the tip of the peninsula, grading through tall scrub to low over-grazed scrub with scattered arable fields on the slopes above the settlements of Ghar El Melh and Raf Raf. 1.2.2 Lagoons (Habitat 13.4) Ghar El Melh Lagoon is shallow (<1.9 m deep) and quite strongly saline (37-42 \u2030) due to the broad connection to the sea (El Boughaz), with a muddy, anoxic sediment (Scapani et aL. 2008). Sidi Ali el Mekki Lagoon is lower (< 0.55 m deep) and more strongly saline (40-60 \u2030) with a sandier substrate. The vegetation of Ghar El Melh Lagoon can be divided into three zones (Scapani et aL. 2008): \u2022 The northern area is dominated by the alga Ulva rigida and appears more eutrophic, presumably due to wastewater discharge from the village of Ghar El Melh. \u2022 The Central and western parts are relatively species-poor, dominated by Ruppia cirrhosa and Cladophora sp(p). \u2022 The area around El Boughaz supports a greater diversity with 18 species (Shili et aL. 2002) recorded, including Cymodocea nodosa and small plants of Posidonia oceanica, as well as the invasive alga Caulerpa racemosa. 5 Figure 2 Ghar El Melh Lagoon from the south, with Jebel Nadhour in the background.

Threats The lagoon is already somewhat degraded as a consequence of development pressures such as along the road from the village of Ghar El Melh to Sidi Ali el Mekki, construction of the fishing port of Ghar El Melh (Daoud- Bouattour 2007) (Threats 1.3, 6.1) and other increasing pressure from tourism, combined with domestic wastewater discharge from the village of Ghar El Melh and other settlements around the margin, industrial effluent discharge from the complex at Utique and inflow of water polluted by pesticides and fertilisers through the drainage network (Threats 7.2, 9.1, 9.2, 9.4). The quantity of water reaching the lagoons and even coastal waters is critical for the maintenance of the existing ecology, particularly in the light of potential increases in extreme weather events including droughts due to climate change.

The combined effects of reduced freshwater inflow from the catchment and increasing discharge of wastewater and pollutants into the lagoon have potential to tip the ecology of the lagoon beyond its capacity to recover. 7 Conservation Action \u2022 A review of existing facilities for wastewater collection and treatment, combined with identification of potential for installation of additional facilities for Ghar El Melh and Sidi Ali el Mekki, as well as for houses along the road between the two, as well as upgrading the existing facilities at Aousja and Kalaat el Andaluus would go a long way toward reducing eutrophication in the lagoons. Such a review should include potential for use of vegetative water-treatment systems wherever possible. \u2022 Imposition of a requirement for adequate wastewater treatment for all new buildings would also contribute to reducing the pollution of the lagoons and coastal waters. \u2022 There is also a need for a hydrological assessment of the area, combined with a review of current and predicted water requirements to identify alternatives to dams for provision of water for the area and for Tunis. 1.2.3 Saltmarsh and other halophyte communities (Habitats 5.16, 5.17) Figure 4 Saltmarsh on then south-western margin of Ghar El Melh Lagoon. Photo: \u00a9 R. Lansdown The influence of salt on the vegetation can be seen from the coastal fringe inland, at least along water courses, as far as Utique. The margins of all the lagoons support a broad fringe of saltmarsh grading from vegetation dominated by Sarcocornia fruticosa, through Arthrocnemum macrostachyum to Halocnemum strobilaceum, then to Juncus maritimus and J. subulatus, through Phragmites australis or Bolboschoenus glaucus to oxbows supporting species such as Typha domingensis and Ruppia sp. (Daoud-Bouattour in litt. 2019). South of Ghar El Melh Lagoon, there is a gradation from the bare sand of the beach, through mobile dunes (see 2.2.5 below) to a zone of seasonal and large, permanent water bodies and saltmarsh. This zone is characterised by shrubby species such as Atriplex halimus, Halocnemum strobilaceum, Juncus acutus, Limbarda crithmoides, Obione portulacoides, Suaeda vermiculata and S. maritima, with patchy occurrence of Limoniastrum monopetalum, Limonium virgatum, Plantago coronopus and Salicornia patula (S. europaea agg.). In less saline habitats, particularly around the small-holder cultivation on the eastern side of Sidi Ali el Mekki Lagoon and along the 8 northern margin of both this and Ghar El Melh lagoon, there is a range of typically coastal or salt-tolerant species such as Hordeum marinum, Parapholis filiformis, Silene coeli-rosa and Torilis nodosa f. bratiosa, as well as fringing stands of Phragmites australis and Juncus species (Daoud-Bouattour in litt. 2019). Notable Taxa No notable plant taxa have been recorded in the saltmarsh and associated halophile vegetation in the area. However, whilst there is good information on the perennial vegetation, there has yet to be a thorough survey of annual plants or vegetation. It is likely that such a survey would find notable species in these habitats. Threats Much of the saltmarsh habitat is relatively intact and appears to be in good condition, mainly because it has not been possible to convert it to other uses. There are areas where it is degraded, such as around the port of Ghar El Melh, wherever settlements are located on the margin of the lagoons such as to the east of Aousja, around seasonal pools in the plains and along creeks and ditches. The ongoing construction of the road from Tunis to Aousja via Kalaat el Andaluus has already affected some saline habitats and is likely to have an increasing effect as the hydrology of the plain will be significantly disrupted (Threat 4.1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9a11a50-31a1-4c1f-8e68-c6e5ef2b0cbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9a11a50-31a1-4c1f-8e68-c6e5ef2b0cbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Characterisation and conservation assessment of terrestrial biodiversity in the Ghar El Melh area", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8c35b66d5192748e7543b7b184fec1a3d0af4e0fa961c1bb70b7e2bf6e18680d"}, "2": {"node_id": "27b7753b-7b9d-4ac8-be40-e70fef2699aa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9819551760eea5df54233364bf8335c3caf9738672e8b5d2abb13adf8704d7d4"}}, "hash": "148e045ce59be1d99ba22a224d4ea9dbe458707ed9b9dc8b0fb0e60f5e557379", "text": "Conservation Action \u2022 There is a need for a thorough survey of the annual vegetation of the saltmarsh (and of the coastal dunes) to complement data on perennial plants. \u2022 There is a need to document the settlements which are located in the saltmarsh, including waste treatment and other potentially harmful effects on the habitat. \u2022 There is a need to develop a detailed map of the distribution of saltmarsh, agriculture and development (settlements and industry) on the plains.

Photo: \u00a9 R. Lansdown Intensive agriculture occupies most of the plain between the saltmarsh and the hills to the west. Cereals, pumpkin and a few other crops, together with scattered orchards are separated by hedges, ditches or lines of trees and scrub along the lines of former streams and rivers. Small fields on Jebel Nadhour typically occupy the gentler slopes with easy access from the settlements of Raf Raf and Ghar El Melh. They support no notable plants species but appear to suffer less herbicide and other pesticide application than the more intensive agricultural land and consequently allow a reasonable species diversity to persist in the margins and between fields. The allotments occur wherever there is sufficient depth of soil and a layer of freshwater over the groundwater to enable cultivation and where soils are sufficiently saline to preclude cultivation by other methods. They are not subject to pesticide or other chemical treatment and consequently support a wide range of native species., grading on their margins into the less halophyte- dominated saltmarsh communities. Notable Taxa No notable taxa are associated with agricultural land in the area. Threats Intensive agricultural habitats and the small fields on the hills are not threatened except by the expansions of settlements and industrial complexes (Threats 1.1, 1.2) but may themselves pose a threat to other habitats and species. Areas of traditional, extensive agriculture are threatened by intensification and industrialisation of agricultural processes. The allotments are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change as well as other factors which may affect the hydrology of the lagoons. They are also critically dependent upon the balance of fresh to saline water and consequently could become unsustainable as a consequence of the construction of dams on streams 10 flowing into the lagoon from Jebel Nadhour. There is also a risk that if no measures are put in place to treat wastewater from new buildings in Sidi Ali el Mekki, the groundwater will become contaminated which could increase the risk of diseases among people using vegetables produced from the allotments. Conservation Action The allotments represent an ancient traditional cultivation method which is unintensive and therefore enables the persistence of a wide range of native plant species, it also has potential to contribute to cultural aspects of tourism. It is important to ensure that this practice is allowed to continue. Areas need to be identified and designated for this use, particularly in the face of increasing development pressure in the area.

Lansdown A range of wetland types occurs within the area: \u2022 Two arms of the Mejerda River which flow from the hills in the west, to the sea south of Ghar El Melh lagoon. Both of these water courses have been heavily modified, with trapezoid channels and engineered flood relief bunds. They support very little marginal vegetation and even less channel vegetation., all of which appears to be very species-poor. The former floodplains have been converted to arable and support no vegetation of note. \u2022 A number of small seasonal streams flowing off Jebel Nadhour south into Ghar El Melh and Sidi Ali el Mekki Lagoons. These small streams are generally reasonably intact, although small dams are being constructed on an increasing number for water supply to houses in Ghar El Melh and the ribbon development to the east.

Most of those which still have a natural structure and hydrology are situated in remnant patches of saltmarsh or Juncus stands around settlements. They are typically polluted, eutrophic and otherwise degraded, supporting only low plant species diversity and no notable taxa. In a few areas, particularly in the southern part of the plain around the new road, there are extensive seasonally inundated areas in fields where the crop has failed due to inundation. Most of these are largely bare, supporting only a few scattered halophytes, but one immediately adjacent to a junction on the road supported a good stand of Damasonium bourgaei.

Lansdown \u2022 In a few places, large oxbow lakes occur, remnants of the former dynamic hydrology of the plain. Most of these are overgrown by dense scrub and or polluted and support no species of note, although one area along a former river channel is shaded by trees supported extensive carpets of acrocarpous mosses such as Aloina, Barbula and Didymodon species, with liverworts of the genus Fossombronia. One oxbow just outside Utique, although much degraded in parts, supports a wide range pf wetland-dependent plants dominated by beds of Phragmites australis, Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and Typha domingensis, with Chara connivens, Ruppia sp., Ulva flexuosa and Vaucheria species in the water and the banks covered with Tamarix sp. supporting a large stand of Cynanchum acutum. \u2022 There are a few water storage small reservoirs on the plain. Notable Taxa No globally threatened species have been recorded in association with non-lagoon wetlands in the area. However, Chara connivens and Damasonium bourgaei are remnants of what may have been important wetland vegetation in the past and it is possible that restoration of freshwater wetlands could restore species from the seed or spore bank. The main conservation value of freshwater and less saline wetlands in the area is as habitat for animals, apart from the oxbow at Utique which could support other species, particularly charophytes, of note and some of the small streams on the hills which could support notable bryophytes. 14 Figure 10 Construction of the crossing of the River Mejerda by the new road from Tunis to Kalaat el Andaluus. Photo: Google Earth Threats Apart from a few of the small seasonal streams flowing south off Jebel Nadhour, all water bodies in the area suffer from some level of water quality decline (Threats 7.2, 9.1, 9.2, 9.4). This is caused by a range of factors, including: \u2022 Sediment mobilisation and run-off due to increased erosion as a consequence of actions such as grazing, use of unmetalled roads, arable farming without adequate buffer zones and development. The degree of sediment mobilisation from the new road from Tunis to Aousja is striking with all flowing water extremely turbid and deposits of silt throughout when the site was visited in October 2019. This will have significant effects on streams, rivers, lagoons and coastal waters. \u2022 Un-treated or inadequately treated domestic waste water discharge. This is a particular risk with new development along the road east of Ghar El Melh and around Sidi Ali el Mekki where the space available for wastewater treatment is very limited and will become increasingly constrained with ongoing development. It also appears highly unlikely that any of the small settlements on the margins of the lagoons will have adequate wastewater treatment facilities. There is a need for formal planning and provision of water collection and treatment facilities for all settlements, linking in small and isolated settlements with systems installed for the larger villages and towns. \u2022 Water abstraction, either directly from springs, from underground sources or by construction of dams, affects all flowing water bodies in the area.

Photo: \u00a9 R. Lansdown Psammophilous (sand-loving) vegetation occurs in three main places in the survey area: \u2022 Fixed dunes and sand deposits on Jebel Nadhour. Most of this habitat on the north face of Jebel Nadhour east of Raf Raf is planted with Pinus pinea, along the crest of the hill, throughout much of the peninsula, there are extensive areas where Acacia cyclops is dominant or actually forms monospecific stands. It is not clear whether these have replaced former areas of indigenous forest or whether these areas were formerly bare. This area supports little natural vegetation apart from the planted trees on most of the 16 slopes but along the lower part of the hill, above the sea there is a reasonably diverse band of vegetation, including species such as Linaria heterophylla var. dichroa. \u2022 The beach and narrow fringe of dunes below Sidi El Haj Embarek and extending almost to Ras Ettarf support sparse vegetation including: Aeluropus litoralis, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum, Atriplex portulacoides, Cakile maritima, Elymus farctus subsp. farctus, Eryngium maritimum, Euphorbia paralias, Limonium spp., Lotus creticus, Polygonum maritimum and Salsola kali. Similar sandy areas along the coast support other species such as Cyperus capitatus and Eryngium maritimum. \u2022 Between the beach and the saltmarsh, south of Ghar El Melh Lagoon there is a band of mobile dunes supporting species such as Cakile maritima, Crucianella maritima, Eryngium maritimum, Euphorbia paralias, Plantago coronopus and Rumex bucephalophorus. Notable Taxa Psammophilous habitats on Jebel Nadhour support a range of notable taxa, particularly Daucus rouyi which occurs in large, dense populations in sandy areas both on the crest and above the rocky coast, as well as patchy Linaria heterophylla var. dichroa among the planted pines near Sidi Ali el Mekki. No notable taxa have been recorded in the beach and mobile dune but there has been no comprehensive survey of the coastal dunes in the southern part of the KBA. Threats In addition to the extensive Pinus pinea plantation on fixed dunes and the apparent preferential colonisation of open areas on sand by Acacia cyclops on the crest of Jebel Nadhour, the main threat to the vegetation of these habitats is from increasing tourism (Threats 1.3, 6.1). This is particularly apparent along tracks over sandy ground between Sidi Ali el Mekki beach and Ras Ettarf, where casual use of the tracks has caused them to spread to a width of up to 10 m of bare sand. Equally, the mobile dunes south of Ghar El Melh Lagoon are vulnerable to uncontrolled vehicle access, as well as destabilisation as a result of the many people walking over them. Improved access to this area and Sidi Ali el Mekki beach provided by the new road from Tunis through Kalaat el Andaluus to Aousja will almost certainly increase pressure on these habitats. Conservation Action \u2022 It is difficult to see how the beach between Sidi El haj Embarek and Ras Ettarf can be protected from tourism, given that it is the focus of intensive establishment of tourist facilities.

Photo: \u00a9 R. Lansdown Threats The rocky coast between Sidi Ali el Mekki beach and Ras Ettarf is already becoming degraded both by intentional actions associated with the construction of tourist facilities and by increasing casual access by tourists moving out from the beach (Threats 1.3, 6.1). The ongoing installation of facilities supporting beach recreation, such as wooden shelters, buildings which often have electricity through generators and formal construction of steps, ramps and platforms, as well as planting of non-native Opuntia ficus-indica as hedges, Figure 11 The coastal zone and Ghar El Melh Beach, showing the gradation from the marine fringe through bare sand to scrubby juniper-dominated vegetation. Photo: \u00a9 R. Lansdown 19 are all adversely affecting the vegetation of the coast. This is likely to continue and increase significantly as more affluent tourists are ferried by boat to the more remote areas. Conservation Action It is difficult to see how development of tourist infrastructure along this coast can be controlled except by designation and enforcement of zones within which no infrastructure is allowed, including temporary structures. 1.2.8 Indigenous woodland and scrub (Habitats 1.4.4, 3.8.1, 3.8.2, 3.8.3) Indigenous woodland extends from the fire break west of Sidi Ali el Mekki to the tip of the peninsula at Ras Ettarf (see Figure 13). The upper canopy is characterised by Pinus halepensis and Juniperus phoenicea subsp. turbinata, with Quercus coccifera subsp. pseudococcifera and Juniperus oxycedrus subsp. macrocarpa over lower shrubs or bushes of Pistacia lentiscus and Phillyrea species. Gaps in the vegetation support shrubby Cistus salvifolius, Erica multiflora, Genista aspalathoides, Retama raetam subsp. bovei, Rosmarinus officinalis subsp. officinalis and Thymbra capitata, over a diverse ground flora. On the east-facing slope from Ras Ettarf north the woodland is lower and shrubbier. The woodland is more species-rich and varied in the eastern part of the peninsula from Sidi Ali el Mekki eastward, west of which it is more impoverished with fewer Juniperus oxycedrus, J. phoenicea and Quercus coccifera and the canopy in places is almost entirely dominated by Pinus halepensis. Fire breaks typically support species which elsewhere form the shrub layer and provide an indication of the vegetation which develops when trees are cleared, including Acacia cyclops, Brachypodium ramosum, Cistus salvifolius, Dittrichia viscosa, Ephedra fragilis, Fumana scoparia, Genista aspalathoides, Globularia alypum, Hippocrepis multisiliquosa, Phagnalum rupestre, Retama raetam subsp. bovei, Rhamnus myrtifolia, Rosmarinus officinalis var.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54c3931f-9362-45bb-a5bb-a6ace2399048": {"__data__": {"id_": "54c3931f-9362-45bb-a5bb-a6ace2399048", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Characterisation and conservation assessment of terrestrial biodiversity in the Ghar El Melh area", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "88dc62cdadd6dc2d8c99b3e794c962daefa1bed23e426bb8079de5c14a8eb51b"}, "2": {"node_id": "b69d032f-71eb-4a49-89b6-1a2b5b22c5c6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a6cec9ac0b0ac4c1da7e63e5c8ce6d503848bd7c8174c97296a570a7b0dea145"}}, "hash": "ca80c9b0987e44a3c64a3175dcb536bf3eea36cdd7c30a1905522ba243634bba", "text": "prostratus, Satureja barceloi, Sedum sediforme, Stipa tenacissima and Thymbra capitata. 20 Figure 13 The southern face of t Jebel Nadhour looking west from Sidi El Haj Embarek, showing the gradation from diverse woodland in the east to species-poor Pinus halapensis-dominated woodland in the west.

However, there is an 24 area above the town of Ghar El Melh where the influence of past overgrazing is becoming exacerbated by current grazing. The effects of over-grazing can most effectively be monitored through use of aerial imagery to map the extent of extant woodland, compared to scrub and open habitats.

This needs to be quantified and controlled. Some habitat is also being lost to expansion of small-scale agriculture. \u2022 Non-native species such as Acacia cyclops, A. karoo, A. saligna, Agave americana, Carpobrotus edulis and Opuntia ficus-indica are widespread and increasing, colonising open habitats as well as displacing native species. This spread is exacerbated by planting of some of these species for ornament and as hedges. Conservation Action Apart from the ongoing loss of mature trees along the base of the hill, most of the woodland and scrub on Jebel Nadhour appears either to be in good condition, to be providing temporarily suitable habitat for notable herbs or to be recovering toward good condition. There is therefore a need to monitor the condition of different elements of this habitat, particularly in relation to development and the expansion of small-scale agriculture, but also as the suitability of the habitat for notable species changes. The most effective way to do this is to use remote tools, supported by infrequent ground truthing. There is also a need to monitor the condition of the mature trees along the base of the hill. This could best be done by tagging all of the trees in combination with remote methods for monitoring construction. 25 1.2.9 Cliffs and other rock exposures (Habitat 6.2) Cliffs and rock outcrops occur throughout Jebel Nadhour. These vary from a discontinuous line of outcrops along the northern face of the crest, mirrored by other more broken lines on the slopes above Raf Raf, to isolated boulders and bedrock exposures in gorges and the predominantly rock slope above Ras Ettarf. Notable Taxa In many places shelves and hollows in the rock faces have filled with soil and these support a wide range of plants, including Allium duriaeanum and Satureja barceloi. However, no specific saxicolous taxa of note have been recorded. Threats No threats specific to this habitat have been recorded. Where vegetation is cleared away from rock faces, this leads to a decline in humidity and ultimately loss of the bryophyte flora and where goats have access to these rock exposures, they will often graze and trample the pockets of soil, leading to the loss of all vegetation. However, these threats are not yet widespread. Conservation Action There is no need for specific action to conserve these habitats for their vegetation, as they are rarely threatened. However, they are likely to be extremely important both for bat roosts (in caves) and for reptiles. it is therefore important that the condition of these outcrops is monitored. 26 Figure 17 Rock outcrops along a valley above the village of Ghar El Melh.

The largest of these are Kalaat al Andaluus, Aousja, Raf Raf, Ghar El Melh and Sidi Ali el Mekki. These areas include a wide range of habitats, from hedges and gardens to open, waste ground between housing plots. In addition to planted species, these areas generally support a diverse range of ruderals and many non-native species such as Arundo donax and Symphyotrichum squamatum. These habitats are generally of very low conservation value but occasionally where they have suffered little damage, they may support notable species. Some of these areas from Sidi Ali el Mekki to Ghar El Melh, including gardens and areas between housing plots are now important for the remaining mature Quercus coccifera and Ceratonia siliqua trees.

This arises through a range of influences, from untreated or inadequately treated domestic and industrial waste water discharge into water bodies, discharge of industrial effluent into water bodies and sediment mobilisation and run-off from erosion resulting from poor management of agriculture and unmetalled roads. Most habitats throughout the area are affected by the decline in water quality, but the most severely affected are the lagoons and coastal waters which are the last stage of dispersal of pollutants and sediment. Dam construction on streams flowing off Jebel Nadhour is also having a significant effect on the quantity of fresh water flowing into the lagoons from the north, as is construction of dams on the upstream reaches of the rivers flowing into the lagoons from the west. The combined effects of reduced freshwater inflow from the catchment and increasing wastewater discharge into the lagoon have potential to tip the ecology of the lagoon beyond its capacity to recover. The second most significant threat to natural resources is construction. In the area the most damaging current construction project is the development of the new road between Tunis and Aousja via Kalaat el Andaluus. This road is already disrupting the hydrology of the plain and causing mobilisation of large quantities of sediment into water courses but will have dramatic impacts on natural species and habitat for years to come through increased access to vulnerable areas and particularly the increase in tourism associated with Sidi Ali el Mekki. Other construction threats to the natural habitats in the area arise from the poorly controlled construction of facilities, including houses, recreation facilities and accommodation associated with tourism east of Ghar El Melh and around Sidi Ali el Mekki which are affecting the woodland and scrub, as well as the rocky coast on 29 Jebel Nadhour. Expansion of other settlements, including development of industrial facilities in the plain are also damaging natural habitats. The increase in tourist pressure, linked to the development of both temporary and permanent facilities will have a significant effect on much of the coast. Not only is there already damage and degradation of rocky coastal habitats and the upper margins of sandy beaches, but many subsidiary effects are taking place, such as increases in wastewater discharge into the lagoons and coastal waters, loss of mature trees along the base of Jebel Nadhour to make way for buildings, degradation of both fixed and mobile sand dunes and planting of invasive non-native plants such as Opuntia ficus-indica as hedges. Figure 18 Hillside between the village of Ghar El Melh and Sidi Ali el Mekki dominated by the non-native Opuntia ficus-indica with Agave americana. Photo: \u00a9 R. Lansdown Other threats such as the expansion of small-scale agriculture, the increasing spread of non-native species and over-grazing are less important than the direct impacts of human activities, however they too are contributing to the degradation of natural habitats. It is also highly likely that the impacts of many of these threats will be exacerbated by climate change. 1.4 Conservation Three plans have been produced to inform management of parts of the area (APAL 2010, WWF-DGF 2011, WWF-DGF 2012).

There is a need to develop a conservation management plan for the area of influence of both KBAs. This would necessarily include both 30 faces of Jebel Nadhour, both lagoons and the coastal strip south beyond Kalaat al Andaluus, possibly as far as Mariana on the northern border of Tunis, as well as the plain and aspects of the Mejerda catchment. This must include a hydrological assessment to provide long-term water supplies to replace those currently provided by dams on rivers and streams. The management plan must include a review of all wastewater treatment and disposal within this area, particularly the capacity of existing facilities, as well as all disposal and quality of treated water. It must also include identification of locations for installation of wastewater collection and treatment facilities for the villages of Aousja, Ghar El Melh, Sidi Ail el Mekki, Kalaat el Andaluus and Sidi Ali el Mekki, as well as imposition of a requirement for installation of facilities to deal with wastewater on all new developments. This work should include a review of isolated dwellings, particularly along the margins of the lagoons and should be liked to mapping of the distribution of saltmarsh, agriculture and development (settlements and industry) on the plains. This provision of services will contribute to reducing water pollution both in small standing water bodies, streams and rivers and more significantly in the lagoons. Reinstatement of meanders to the Mejerda could include creation of areas of vegetation within the channel through which the water would be allowed to flow and which would improve water quality. Similarly, upgrading of wastewater treatment should include consideration of potential to use vegetative treatment systems to improve water quality before discharge.

This should involve extension of the boundary to include the entire Jebel, as far west as the road from Aousja to Raf Raf. The boundary of the Sidi Ali There is a clear need for local action to address the causes of habitat degradation in the area, including provision of defined and marked access routes on the beach, the rocky coast between Sidi El haj Embarek and Ras Ettarf and the coastal dunes, ensuring that methods for harvesting Pinus pinea plantations minimises damage to the soil structure and mobilisation of the sand and designation and enforcement of zones within which no infrastructure is allowed. Data collected on the distribution and abundance of aquatic plants in the lagoons will also serve to inform habitat and species conservation action. However, data are not currently adequate to assess the conservation value and species diversity of the saltmarsh and coastal dunes. There is therefore a need for thorough survey of these habitats. 31 Raf-Raf forest. Photo: \u00a9 R.

Ouni 32 2.1 Introduction The herpetofauna of Tunisia has a total of 68 species: 7 Amphibians and 61 species of Reptiles without counting sea turtles (Nouira, 1996 and 1998). The latter are represented by 3 chelonians (two freshwater turtles is one terrestrial), 1 amphisbaena, 34 saurians (lizards) and 23 ophidians (snakes: snakes and vipers). Among the latter, a certain number is found in the region of Ghar El Melh. The purpose of this work is to identify the species, draw up the taxonomic list of herpetofauna and analyze its importance in relation to that of the country.

The herpetofauna associated with the various plant formations and various environments was 33 determined by direct observation and indices of the presence or recognition of species based on the traces of reptiles, in particular on sandy soils, burrows, or even the sound in the case of Amphibians. Due to the time allocated to this work, the hibernation season of the animals and the climatic conditions during our field investigations, several techniques could not be applied to determine the density of the populations. Its assessment is therefore expressed in terms of abundance according to expert\u2019s experience and by comparison of populations of the same species studied at the same time in other sectors of Tunisia. The frequency of a specie is assessed indirectly by the type and number of habitats that are likely to harbor the species in relation to the total of habitats surveyed. The specific composition of the herpetofauna was determined based on field observations and available literature data. The results obtained during this study are analyzed and interpreted; the status of the species is defined and the peculiarities and ecological interest are identified. 2.4 Taxonomic Structure Of Ghar El Melh Herpetofauna The population of Amphibians is very rich in species: five out of the seven species in Tunisia are found in the study sector; this presence is due to the existence of wetlands and water points favorable to these animals. Reptiles, more adapted to arid areas, are less numerous in humid and sub-humid climates; only the species with Palaearctic affinity that characterize northern Tunisia are present. The following is a complete taxonomic list of the Herpetofauna of the Ghar El Meh region. 2.4.1 Amphibians: Analysis and status of taxa A.

Order : Anura Family Alytidae o Discoglossus pictus Family Bufonidae o Sclerophrys mauritanicus o Bufotes boulengeri Family Ranidae o Pelophylax saharicus Of the 7 species of Amphibians in Tunisia, 5 are found in the study area. Among these species reported with certainty, only the Berber toad, Sclerophrys mauritanicus, is common and even abundant in the studied area.

Although they are often limited or even reduced in surface area, are terrestrial or aquatic, dry or wet, low or medium altitude, sandy or clay soils, with dense or sparse vegetation, etc., they constitute a mosaic of favorable biotopes for the various species that colonize them according to their adaptations, preferences and ecological requirements. Some of these species are found in very specific environments; others, which are more tolerant and opportunistic, are found in various types of habitats, which allows the stand to structure and organize itself differently from one environment to another. Some biotopes are thus richer in species than others, and some species form metapopulations often composed of small, spatially fragmented, isolated populations with low numbers. These elements constitute the particularity and even the singularity of the local herpetofauna, which is both continental and insular in the ecological sense of the term. 37 In this context, the study of this population is of paramount importance both in fundamental and applied terms for the management and conservation of biodiversity. 2.5.2 The paralic environment The topography of the area marked by the mouth of the rivers that flow into the lowest areas, its proximity to the sea and its relationship with the lagoon, the large expanses of low marshy areas\u2026 make the area a special and unique environment that is home to a great diversity of flora and fauna. All these natural wetlands are grouped together under the name of the paralic environment, which is made up of a mass of water in transition between marine and continental environments, as well as the mouths of the rivers, marshes, mudflats and drainage channels, water sources and wells, small ponds and perennial or temporary puddles. In the southern part between the lagoon and the old course of the Medjerda river, there are mudflats and drainage channels and in the agricultural area there are several springs and wells. The southern marshy area is home to some of the rarest species, including Discoglossus pictus, Pleurodeles poireti and Emys orbicularis. The Mauritania toad Sclerophrys mauritanicus is more dependent on wells, pits and drainage and irrigation channels. This species is unfortunately massacred by road accidents during the breeding period when the animals cross roads and move between water points favorable for egg laying. The more water-dependent green frog Pelophylax saharicus is found in permanent ponds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5f942da-a9ca-4d42-a0f9-97dbc462184e": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5f942da-a9ca-4d42-a0f9-97dbc462184e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Characterisation and conservation assessment of terrestrial biodiversity in the Ghar El Melh area", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c8b72b40ff35fbaab00bd45a6f38c6dd76a179f08eb1943589b92b13b2911adf"}, "2": {"node_id": "83158f52-e5b1-49e6-ba49-fe5fba7a17ad", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/characterisation-and-conservation-assessment-terrestrial-biodiversity", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "987eef0e77b0ba26b5aa7865259bd0027b686247bbf1bdd3e34bd7f74e0f2525"}}, "hash": "c914777ab2677da6c8b8428c4ea344f53eb686c9891de46f9ac51d847a0010a1", "text": "In total, 8 species can be found in this mosaic of wet biotopes: the two freshwater turtles: Emys orbicularis and Mauremys leprosa; the five amphibians: Pleurodeles poireti, Discoglossus pictus, Pelophylax saharicus, Bufotes boulengeri and Sclerophrys mauritanicus, and the viperine snake Natrix maura. 38 2.5.3 Lagoon borders Closely linked to the previous environment, the lagoon\u2019s coastal edges and borders, about 20 km long, represents a wetland covered with hygro-halophilic vegetation mainly composed of Salicornia fructicosa and Arthrocnemum sp., Juncus maritimus, Scipoides holoschoemus and common marsh reed (Phragmites). This wetland is a very favorable environment for herpetofauna. It is home to several species of reptiles (Table 8), particularly the Saurians: Chalcides calcides, Timon pater and Tarentola mauritanica and some snakes that use it as a hunting, exhibition and resting area.

In addition, the construction of new houses on the edge of the lagoon and on the way to the beach reduces the natural areas and transforms the landscape. These multiple aggressions fragment the biotope and reduce the surfaces favorable to wildlife. The decrease in Reptile numbers in these areas does not favor the maintenance of the ecological balance of this small, peculiar and fragile ecosystem. Preliminary studies prior to each filling operation are essential to reduce impacts and minimize the destruction of reptile habitats. Figure 20 Lagoon borders. Photo: \u00a9 R. Ouni Figure 20 Lagoon borders. Photo: \u00a9 R. Ouni 39 2.5.4 Micro-island habitat: the lagoon islets The microhabitats in the form of islets dispersed in the lagoon are often used for agricultural purposes, especially for vegetable gardening (potato, pepper, tomato \u2026 and legumes), shelter some lizards and amphibians species whose populations are often very low. The most common are Saurians: Chalcides chalcides, C. ocellatus, Timon pater and Psammodromus algirus. Among the Amphibians, we find the two toads Bufotes boulengeri and Sclerophrys mauritanicus and the discoglossus Discoglossus pictus. The intensive use of chemicals (pesticides and others) threatens the local herpetofauna populations. 2.5.5 Coastal Dunes and the backshore The locally narrow dune barrier shelters sparse and scattered vegetation of thorny plants such as dune thistle (Eryngium maritimum) and tall clumps of white broom, Retama monosperma. Only Acanthodactylus blanci is found on these coastal dunes, while the backshore is home to three species of Acanthodactylus blanci and in places Chalcides ocellatus and the insignitus Malpolon snake. Further east, and on the way to the Sidi Ali El Makki marabout, the sandy dunes become wider and higher. This very special environment is an artificial pine forest (Pinewood, Aleppo pine and maritime pine) with dense undergrowth in places but very poor in Reptiles species; it only shelters the chameleon Chameleo chamaelon and probably Psammodromus blanci. Figure 21 Micro-island habitat. Photo: \u00a9 R. Ouni 40 2.5.6 The rocky coast The rocky coastal part between the beach of Sidi Ali El Maki and the beach of Rafraf is a very poor habitat in terms of species; it only shelters the two rupicolous geckos Tarentola mauritanica and Hemidactylus turcicus. 2.5.7 The Garrigues and Maquis In addition to the paralic environment, the terrestrial and less humid landscape is marked by an important dominant matorral, garrigues and maquis, which characterize the study area. Similar plant formations are found throughout the area (eastern flank of Ennadhour Mountain, particularly between the forest of Sidi Ali El Mekki and the village of Bejou); they consist mainly of mastic grass, kermes oak, oleaster, oxychedron and Phoenician juniper, filaria, calico, rosemary \u2026 and in places, the carob tree and agaves.

At least 14 species depend on this habitat: Psammodromus algirus, Chalcides chalcides, Chalcides ocellatus, Timon pater, Tarentola mauritanica, Hemidactylus turcicus, Hemorrhois hippocrepis, Malpolon insignitus, Natrix maura, Testudo graeca, Discoglossus pictus, Sclerophrys mauritanicus and Bufotes boulengeri. To these species we must add the Macrovipera lebetina viper which descends to the plains bordering the mountains in case of drought and lack of prey or even in case of floods or torrential rains at the beginning of the rainy season. 2.5.10 The Urban Habitat The urban environment corresponds exclusively to the agglomerations (cities of Ghar El Melh and Raf-raf, or other small villages in the region). The other human dwellings in rural areas are part of the other natural biotopes described: agricultural fields, orchards, etc. The urban environment is poor in animal species; only two species of geckos are frequently found: Tarentola mauritanica and Hemidactylus turcicus and rarely reptiles with anthropophilic tendencies: the horseshoe snake Hemorrhois hippocrepis and Seps Chacides ocellatus.

At least 5 species out of the seven in Tunisia are inferred to this environment. \u2022 In terms of Abundance and Frequency, the composition of this population locally reflects that of the whole Tunisian batrachofauna. Indeed, and at the scale of the region, the most common and abundant species is the North African green frog (Pelophylax saharicus). The Painted Discoglossus (Discoglossus pictus), a species considered invasive, and the Berber Toad (Sclerophrys mauritanica), are very frequent, common, ubiquitous and widely distributed, but always in low numbers. The green toad (Bufotes boulengeri), on the other hand, is increasingly rare in Tunisia, both in presence and in numbers. Finally, the oyster mushroom (Pleurodeles nebulosus) is a very rare species, limited to northern Tunisia. \u2022 This rich and diversified population deserves to be further studied from an ecological point of view (population dynamics and organization of the population), especially in the areas that shelter it. \u2022 Surveys beyond the limits of the sector are also necessary to look for rare and discrete species likely to exist in the region. And about the Reptile result, we conclude: \u2022 That the specific richness of the Reptile population in the region of Sidi ali El Meki is at least 16 species identified with certainty; 1 other whose presence is highly probable remains to be sought, the Psammodromus blanci.

CTSG collaborates with others to plan, conduct, or evaluate any conservation programs that involve translocations in the wild, or releases arising from breeding, propagation, or headstarting. Through science, policy, guidance, training, action, and outreach, CTSG can help enable effective reintroductions, reinforcements, assisted colonization, or ecological replacements spanning all terrestrial, freshwater, or marine ecosystems. www.iucn-ctsg.org/ Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi Established in 1996, the Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD) is committed to protecting and enhancing air quality, groundwater as well as the biodiversity of our desert and marine ecosystem. By partnering with other government entities, the private sector, NGOs and global environmental agencies, we embrace international best practice, innovation and hard work to institute effective policy measures. We seek to raise environmental awareness, facilitate sustainable development and ensure environmental issues remain one of the top priorities of our national agenda. www.ead.ae/ Calgary Zoo The Calgary Zoo\u2019s vision is to be Canada\u2019s leader in wildlife conservation. In close alignment with IUCN, this vision is pursued through a mix of Canadian and global conservation initiatives regarding two strategic pillars: 1) conservation translocations, such as reintroductions, to avert species extinction and strengthen ecosystem function; and 2) community conservation to bring mutual and sustainable benefits for local livelihoods and biodiversity.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "375fcf3c-44dc-4b20-8ef9-2da7ae0edb71": {"__data__": {"id_": "375fcf3c-44dc-4b20-8ef9-2da7ae0edb71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ddba8e7c9fb0da600824ce8fbe1d0dadf7fcdd06abf99f87ff4300c1b0c721b7"}, "2": {"node_id": "77dc86f5-14c8-4540-b6af-f3faa791015e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2d57cb7fc1b6ee336ee91b4acc61133754a6c631685540231c8b476369fbca30"}}, "hash": "d8e4ad9a2928c54bb66fb3bd1de9f35144f708a876bf1b3ddec6aaed59f5a265", "text": "The Calgary Zoo engages in collaborative partnerships around the world to develop the innovation and application of science-based solutions to achieve long-term benefits for conservation. www.calgaryzoo.com/ iv Wildlife Reserves Singapore Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) is dedicated to the management of world-leading zoological institutions - Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, River Safari and Singapore Zoo - that aim to inspire people to value and conserve biodiversity by providing meaningful and memorable wildlife experiences.

The case studies are as varied as ever covering cray\ufb01sh in Australia, desert \ufb01sh in restricted waterbodies in Las Vegas, deer in China to large\u2010scale rainforest restora\ufffdons in Brazil. The Reintroduc\ufffdon Specialist Group has now had a name change to the Conserva\ufffdon Transloca\ufffdon Specialist Group which was \ufffdmely as there are many new conserva\ufffdon ac\ufffdons which now \ufb01t under the \u201cconserva\ufffdon transloca\ufffdons\u201d umbrella. In this issue plants cover 35% of the case studies, and I am glad to report that we have an example of a plant restora\ufffdon project from the region speci\ufb01cally from Abu Dhabi, UAE. The White saxual is a species living on the extreme edge of its distribu\ufffdon range and is challenged by many factors such as increased aridity, and the Environment Agency \u2010 Abu Dhabi\u2019s (EAD) e\ufb00orts have resulted in restora\ufffdon of this species in its na\ufffdve habitat. The EAD has also been working diligently on the iconic Scimitar\u2010horned oryx reintroduc\ufffdon project in Chad which was comprehensively covered in the 2018 issue with currently 350 individuals in the wild. We have also released 50 Addax antelope and with Dama gazelle and Red\u2010necked ostrich planned for the future. This will be a large\u2010scale restora\ufffdon of ecosystem func\ufffdon with these releases in Chad in the Sahel region of Africa. Finally I would like to thank Pritpal Soorae for compiling these case studies and the support of partners such as the Calgary Zoo, Wildlife Reserves Singapore and The Aspinall Founda\ufffdon who have come together to ensure best prac\ufffdces in species and ecosystem restora\ufffdon are available for the wider conserva\ufffdon community. viii Dr. Axel Moehrenschlager Chair, Conserva\ufffdon Transloca\ufffdon Specialist Group, Calgary Zoo This is a book about ac\ufffdon. It is about saving species and ecosystems to yield profound bene\ufb01ts for nature and humanity. This book is also about courage. It is about amazing teams working together, some\ufffdmes against all odds, to make a di\ufb00erence. I am so grateful to my friend Pritpal for once again inves\ufffdng his passion, skill, and \ufffdme to bring these stories into the limelight. Overarching analyses of previous case studies in leading scien\ufffd\ufb01c journals illustrate the collec\ufffdve power and poten\ufffdal of our approaches. Once again, I hope global e\ufb00orts and successes on the pages to come inspire you as much as they inspire me. Despite a 30\u2010fold increase in the last 30 years, future projec\ufffdons call for even greater use of our techniques. Why? Because more species need help in a changing world, other conserva\ufffdon approaches are o\ufffden insu\ufb03cient on their own, and our science\u2010based ac\ufffdons are increasingly e\ufb00ec\ufffdve. Building on a proud 30\u2010year history as the Reintroduc\ufffdon Specialist Group, the recent Renaissance as the Conserva\ufffdon Transloca\ufffdon Specialist Group (CTSG) escalates our role to meet future needs and opportuni\ufffdes through\u2026. \uf0b7\uf020 Our Vision: A world where courageous ac\ufffdon repairs nature\u2019s past damage and secures against threats of the future. \uf0b7\uf020 Our Mission: To empower responsible conserva\ufffdon transloca\ufffdons that save species, strengthen ecosystems, and bene\ufb01t humanity. Our new 10\u2010year plan strives for even greater impacts felt in the oceans, deserts, grasslands, lakes, forests, and mountains of our world. With deep gra\ufffdtude to the Calgary Zoo, Environment Agency of Abu Dhabi, Wildlife Reserves Singapore, The Aspinall Founda\ufffdon, and the Species Survival Commission, I also invite others to come join this cause!

I am very pleased that our own projects are included in this series. We contributed one case study to the very \ufb01rst edi\ufffdon of the series back in 2008, concerning the reintroduc\ufffdon of Western gorillas to the Bat\u00e9k\u00e9 Plateau region of Gabon and Congo in Central Africa. The project has con\ufffdnued to develop and \ufb02ourish and has now seen over 70 gorillas released and over 30 births within the two re\u2010established popula\ufffdons. In this edi\ufffdon we summarize similar projects for three primate species in Java, Indonesia, totaling 159 released primates in \ufb01ve popula\ufffdon reinforcement projects. These highlight the bene\ufb01ts that the release of primates rescued from the illegal pet trade can have on isolated or locally\u2010 ex\ufffdrpated popula\ufffdons. They also demonstrate that zoo\u2010born primates can be incorporated into such projects, but that zoo\u2010born individuals may have lower survival and reproduc\ufffdon rates than rescued primates. Another case study highlights the successful welfare release in South Africa of a single Brown hyaena, born in a European zoo, illustra\ufffdng that it can be possible to release zoo\u2010born carnivores. Our \ufb01nal contributed case study showcases the return of Europe\u2019s largest land mammal, the European bison, to Romania. The European bison remains one of the surprisingly few examples of how zoo popula\ufffdons can bring species back from ex\ufffdnc\ufffdon in the wild. The case studies in this series show us that habitats and popula\ufffdons can be restored when su\ufb03cient will and resources are put to the task. They o\ufb00er hope and inspira\ufffdon at a \ufffdme when our planet needs ac\ufffdon more urgently than ever before. xi Dr. Jon Paul Rodriguez Chair, Species Survival Commission (SSC) Once again, our colleagues of the Conserva\ufffdon Transloca\ufffdons Specialist Group (CTSG) deliver a new volume of Global conserva\ufffdon transloca\ufffdon perspec\ufffdves. Edited by Pritpal S. Soorae, the seventh edi\ufffdon increases the tally of case studies to 418.

Jointly, the 69 studies cover all of IUCN\u2019s eight statutory regions, while an examina\ufffdon of their success rate indicates that only 4% of them are classi\ufb01ed as failures, 24% were highly successful, 50% successful and 22% successful.

Soorae, Editor Introduction This is the 7th issue in the Global conservation translocation perspectives series and has been produced in the same standardized format as the previous six to maintain style and quality. The case studies are arranged in the following order: a) Introduction, b) Goals, c) Success Indicators, d) Project Summary, e) Major Difficulties Faced, f) Major Lessons Learned and g) Project outcome - with reasons for success or failure. Case studies per issue The following numbers of case studies have been collated for the last seven issues: 1) 2008 issue - 62 case studies, 2) 2010 issue - 72 case studies, 3) 2011 issue - 50 case studies, 4) 2013 issue - 52 case studies, 5) 2016 issue - 54 case studies, 6) 2018 issue - 59 case studies and 7) 2021 (this issue) - 69 case studies. This is a total of 418 case studies in all seven issues. IUCN Statutory Regions The IUCN Statutes have established a total of eight global regions for the purposes of its representation in council. The IUCN\u2019s \u201cstatutory regions\u201d are a list of States by Region, as per article 16 and 17 of the Statutes and Regulation 36 of the Regulations. All eight global regions are represented within these case studies and the numbers of case studies in the regions are as follows: \uf031\uf02e\uf020 North America & Caribbean - 9 case studies \uf032\uf02e\uf020 West Europe - 14 case studies \uf033\uf02e\uf020 South & East Asia - 10 case studies \uf034\uf02e\uf020 Oceania - 15 case studies \uf035\uf02e\uf020 West Asia - 1 case studies \uf036\uf02e\uf020 Africa - 3 case studies \uf037\uf02e\uf020 Meso & South America - 18 case studies \uf038\uf02e\uf020 East Europe, North & Central Asia - 8 case studies There are 69 case studies with a total of 78 species as some case studies have multiple species. xiv Figure 1. Success / failure of projects according to major taxa Success/Failure of projects The projects presented here were ranked as Highly Successful, Successful, Partially Successful and Failure. Out of the 69 case studies, there were some cases of multiple rankings, as some projects had multi-species restorations. A total of 19 projects were Highly Successful (24%), 39 were Successful (50%), 17 were Partially Successful (22%) and 3 were listed as Failures (4%). Success according to the taxa An analysis was done to gauge the three different levels of success (highly successful, successful and partially successful) and failure against the seven major taxa i.e. invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, mammals and plants as can be seen in figure 1.

It formerly occupied grassy heaths and chalk downland within Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire in an area bounded by the River Arun to the east, the Solent to the west, the River Wey to the north and the Isle of Wight to the south. During the 20th century it disappeared from most of its historic range, due to loss of heathland and downland resulting from changes in land use, including afforestation. Lack of disturbance by livestock and increased rates of succession on the remaining fragmented heaths reduced their suitability for Field crickets. By 1991, the UK population was confined to one site in West Sussex with fewer than 100 individuals and was expected to go extinct. In 1991, the species was placed on English Nature\u2019s Species Recovery Program (SRP), and by 2007 it had been restored to four additional locations across Surrey, Sussex and Hampshire thanks to a program of captive- breeding and reintroductions (Pearce- Kelly, 2008).

Project Summary Feasibility: The project was established in 1991 through English Nature\u2019s Species Recovery Program, once it was clear that the Field cricket was at risk of going extinct in the UK. The early stages of the project are detailed in Edwards et al., 1996 and Pearce-Kelly, 2008. They involved instigating suitable habitat management at its indigenous site and establishing an ex situ breeding program and health screening protocol at ZSL. Nymphs were taken from the indigenous site and between1992 and 2007 the breeding program provided in excess of 17,000 late-instar nymphs for reintroductions. Ten sites in the Field cricket\u2019s former range were identified and managed appropriately and captive-bred nymphs were released at seven of these. Four of the seven field colonies established with the ex situ bred crickets were still extant in 2007, the longest of which was shown to have persisted to the 8th generation. The presence of gregarine parasites in the captive population was confirmed in 1996 and 1997, and releases of captive-bred Field crickets ceased. (Subsequently the parasites were found to be present in wild populations and are not considered harmful). By this time both the indigenous population and some of the reintroduced Catching Field crickets at Lord's Piece in April 2018 \u00a9 Jane Sears, RSPB 3 populations were considered sufficiently robust to withstand small numbers of nymphs being taken for translocations, under license from Natural England. Further sites have been identified including two RSPB reserves on which conifer plantation was being removed to restore grassy heathland. Implementation: Releases to new sites commenced in 2010 with a protocol of releasing around 12 late instar nymphs of equal sex rations in April of each year. Donor sites are chosen with the aim of being as local to the release sites as possible, depending on the size of the available population. Three years of releases was found to be most successful although a crash in numbers at the donor sites in 2012 led to some sites only having two years of releases. Crickets are caught by hand by trained staff and volunteers (under license) and transported individually in plastic bags with some moss and grass for cover. They are held in the bags for no longer than one hour. Arable reversion to heathland has been undertaken by a landowner on a private estate adjacent to the indigenous site, providing an extensive area of suitable habitat for a meta-population to establish. Field crickets have naturally colonized this, by dispersing from the indigenous site, and have managed to walk across a small road.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e1d7b85-fba0-4dae-9949-17ec19ddc341": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e1d7b85-fba0-4dae-9949-17ec19ddc341", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e5569e0bec2bbc17d71eee4eec49bfa448898df37092903d34a3b7e69f62c59b"}, "2": {"node_id": "9cdaf91a-c891-4a0e-97a5-d2b81e11869d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d63c2a8b6a55c1f86b47b1f0163785060cfdca347fe1ac1fb21c1fd405057dc7"}}, "hash": "fe8a6e493b5519de66a46dc52d1c5123ffe1d1b02a06cb449c10eb95a5925f69", "text": "At another location the crickets have expanded from a release site on private land onto an adjacent golf course which is now being managed appropriately.

Transects aim to cover as much of the suitable habitat as possible and map all the singing male crickets heard. At least two visits are made to each site: 1. Early visit at the start of the season to ascertain if crickets are singing and where they are likely to be. 2. Main visit at peak season. This figure is usually the maxima for the year. 3. In some cases a third visit is made to ascertain the occupied range. Visits are made during the afternoon or evening on still, warm and dry days of at least 17oC. Monitoring is aborted if the weather becomes adverse, and singing crickets are marked on maps/aerial photographs showing locations of trees and paths.

The species was once broadly distributed across ~12,500 km of lotic waterways; but has experienced substantial decline in range and abundance over the past 50 years due to river regulation, pesticides and pollutants, habitat degradation and harvest pressure and blackwater disturbance. Most recently over 2010 - 2011, the species was significantly impacted by extreme blackwater disturbance, with an 81% population loss in an affected reach of the Murray River. The magnitude of the impact prompted a threatened species listing in New South Wales and substantial amendment to the recreational harvest of the species, including area closures, implementation of a slot limit and a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7b15af62-51ec-4e58-b4b5-774541914ddd": {"__data__": {"id_": "7b15af62-51ec-4e58-b4b5-774541914ddd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "724956174a61a44d75283e9b14b9885dcc225090ae996b2cf25e25590ac8e16d"}, "3": {"node_id": "3dd1e34e-3ba2-42bc-8ba4-01f239bcccf4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94d9a12b5811683818033df9f151e5b12ec17651eddddc6ae5eac3f67b79016b"}}, "hash": "09a0279b5b9a1d355e5cdd63a2ef0ee21213c4a7a3da6568c9c23e66cf95f3fe", "text": "reduction in bag and daily limits. The species is listed internationally as Data Deficient (under International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species 2010) and whilst not Murray crayfish \u00a9 Nick Whiterod 7 nationally listed (under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999), it has threatened status under regional jurisdictions, so proactive management actions, such as conservation translocations, are prudent. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Develop a feasible translocation strategy for the species. \uf0b7\uf020 Demonstrate a positive trajectory of recovery (based on short-, medium- and long-term indicators of success) for the reintroduced population. \uf0b7\uf020 Re-establish a self-sustaining and resilient reintroduced population. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 A robust translocation strategy developed. \uf0b7\uf020 Short-term: Detection of crayfish and presence of wild reproduction in the reintroduced population. \uf0b7\uf020 Medium-term: Increasing relative abundance and presence of juveniles over time in the reintroduced population. \uf0b7\uf020 Long-term: Demonstrate reintroduced population is genetically robust and maintain broad population structure. Project Summary Feasibility: Previous stocking for fisheries purposes (in the early 1900s) led to the establishment of populations with low levels of genetic diversity outside its natural range. To avoid a similar outcome, the present translocation relied on a robust multi-faceted strategy informed by contemporary research and monitoring. An important initial decision was reached to reintroduce into areas that supported the species immediately prior to the blackwater disturbance as minimal recovery had been observed. The rationale being that these areas would support the reintroduced population, but due to restricted dispersal and population fragmentation, natural recolonization was unlikely. As captive-breeding or head- starting has not been established, wild-to-wild reintroduction was selected. Both the potential reintroduction site and source populations were contained within a large interbreeding population revealed by genetic analyses - thus the risk of outbreeding depression was deemed minimal. Population modelling was used to assess the optimal number and elements of the population (e.g. juveniles, females with eggs or all collected individuals) to be released. It was concluded, in part for pragmatic reasons, that releasing 200 individuals, annually for five years would not only be feasible but also maximize the likelihood of achieving the reintroduction goals and minimize impacts to source populations. The modelling also revealed that successful establishment of the reintroduced population would take time (e.g. decades), due to the life history of the species, which was important to convey to project stakeholders. The support of these stakeholders - including fisheries managers and compliance officers along with recreational fishers and environmental managers - was 8 another aspect that made the reintroduction feasible. Without this support, it was unlikely that there would be adequate funding and resources or protection of the reintroduced population. Implementation: Annual reintroductions commenced in 2017 and will continue until 2021. Within the area that previously supported the species, a 2 km reintroduction site was selected on the basis of targeted surveys (to confirm absence) and assessment of prevailing habitat characteristics, water quality as well as logistical considerations (e.g. ability to access the site for releases). It was necessary to obtain permits to translocate the species, which assess the benefits of the reintroduction against any likely risks. Prior to reintroductions each year, an appropriate source population was selected based on knowledge of population status and proximity to the reintroduction site - the location of the source populations has changed each year so as to minimize risks. From source populations each year, 200 individuals were collected using standard sampling methods (see below) with the specific information recorded (weight, length, sex and for females the stage of maturity and presence of eggs) and a genetic sample obtained, from all collected individuals.

Project Summary Feasibility: Red-spotted apollo butterfly is a representative Endangered Species Level I in Korea. Ecological research by Wonju Local Environmental Administration and HECRI revealed that the Red-spotted apollo butterfly occurred in small populations across the Korean peninsula and in most of its former habitats has become totally extinct in the wild. The Samcheok population also has been under threat of extinction. Despite of the vulnerability of P. bremeri, there is no any exact biological information around the world. We observed all stages of the life cycle of P. bremeri under natural conditions after the establishment of a rearing system. The total developmental period for a generation was Recording butterfly numbers in the field 13 approximately one year. It has a unique summer diapause period of more than six months (~194 days) extending from summer to winter. Moreover, the egg contained the pharate 1st instar stage (live in the egg), and the period of embryogenesis through the pharate 1st instar was ~15.7 days. Additionally, the 1st instar underwent development at low temperatures, ranging from -20.5 - 5.2\u00b0C (-4.3\u00b0C on average). The unique, biological characteristics of P. bremeri provide valuable information for understanding the mechanism of adaptation to low temperatures and for the conservation of this endangered species. Understanding its biology and physiology are essential for establishing an appropriate conservation system. The Red-spotted apollo butterfly require very specific conditions such as host plant and geographic characteristics, open landscapes on forest steppe as well as slopes up to the alpine zone (1,500 m). Samcheok which used to be original habitat is mainly is composed of over 800 m highland mountain area and was the best site to release Red-spotted apollo butterfly.

A few sites in Samcheok were designed and manipulated as sustainable habitat for Red-spotted apollo butterfly by planting host plant and clearing timber to receive more sunlight continuously. A total of 240 individuals of P. bremeri have been released in Samcheok from 2011 - 2015 (20, 40, 60, 60, and 60 individuals, respectively). More precise knowledge on how to maintain populations and Overview of butterfly release site 14 sustainable habitat could be used as a basis to establish effective conservation strategies. However more important key to the success of restoration program to date has been the harmonious collaboration of scientists, government and local residents. Considerable publicity through newspaper column, frequent broadcasting and social networking service has played a major role. Post-release monitoring: Monitoring was carried out to find the estimation of the population size of Red-spotted apollo butterfly by using Mark-Release-Recapture (MRR) that has a 95% reliability level. Ten times (26th May, 27th May, 28th May, 29th May, 30th May, 31st May, 1st June, 2nd June, 3rd June, and 5th June 2016) collection was carried between 09:00 - 15:00 hours by five HECRI researchers. During the monitoring period, the picture of every captured species was taken by the smart phone camera embedded GPS system. Patches were classified by marking fore- wings or hind-wings with different colors mainly red and blue. During the monitoring period, 421 individuals (female: 188, male: 233) were captured and 177 individuals (female: 89, male: 88) were recaptured. The results showed that the meta-population of the release site is from 125 individuals (minimum) to 1,844 individuals (maximum) and recapture rates were 42%. Average of survival day was 3.59 and maximum survival day 11. This species moved outside of the patch but came back inside of the patch during the monitoring period. The migration tendency seems to be sedentary but one individual was recaptured 5.6 km from the first collected site. This suggests that even though they have a sedentary tendency, they try to go out to better or new habitat. According to MRR estimation, restoration seemed to work successfully so far and the population size is stable. The heterozygous diversity showed almost 99% that means no inbreeding depression. Colonies have spread naturally to other sites and become established. This indicates that dispersal, habitat use and abundance has been successful over time. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Lack of budgeting for sustaining staff and captive-breeding system. \uf0b7\uf020 Captive breeding of Red-spotted apollo butterfly is a labour-intensive Marking of captured individuals 15 project, which may lead to no co-workers. \uf0b7\uf020 An anthropogenic or natural removal of local habitat patches may prevent seasonal migration of Red-Spotted apollo butterfly according to host plants, which may result in collapse of local populations. \uf0b7\uf020 A global warming due to climate change may accelerate the reduction of P. bremeri. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Identification of the species\u2019 life cycle exactly including ecology and physiology led to the ultimate success of the restoration plan. \uf0b7\uf020 Governmental budget should be sufficient for sustainable management. Successful start of rearing system is important, but more important is to keep greater numbers of individuals for future releases. \uf0b7\uf020 Practical, executive, professional conservation institute and passionate researchers should be combined with local volunteers to make progress. Accessible technical volunteers can support restoration program.

Its situation in the Czech Republic is even worse hence it is classified as Critically Endangered in the Red List of Invertebrates in the Czech Republic. The Action Plan for the Scarce fritillary in the Czech Republic has been implemented since 2010. As there is only one surviving population of this species in the Czech Republic and this species vanished from >95% of formerly occupied area, the return of the Scarce fritillary to some historical localities is one of the main goals in the Action Plan. Currently the Libick\u00fd luh National Nature Reserve, where the species occurred until 1990s, has been chosen as the most suitable place and the reintroduction attempts started there in 2018. Although the preliminary results seem to be good it is yet too early for proper evaluation. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To establish a captive -breeding program for the Scarce fritillary butterfly. \uf0b7\uf020 Medium-term goal: To reintroduce the Scarce fritillary to the Libick\u00fd luh National Nature Reserve. \uf0b7\uf020 Long-term goal: To restore 3 - 5 former localities in the Polab\u00ed lowland region. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Confirmed successful breeding by monitoring the number of silken nests, which are Scarce fritillary butterfly 18 made by the gregarious caterpillars. \uf0b7\uf020 Increasing the reintroduced population to >500 butterflies. Project Summary Feasibility: The Scarce fritillary is an endangered forest butterfly whose host plant is the European ash (Fraxinus excelsior). As its host plant is very common, it is endangered because it inhabits only woodlands with a low canopy cover, a type of habitat which nearly disappeared in Central Europe. After the disappearance of old growth forest, traditional types of forest management, such as coppicing, were able to provide a large area of suitable habitat. In the first half of the 20th century the Scarce fritillary still occurred in many localities in Central Bohemia (Polab\u00ed lowland), Central and South Moravia. However coppicing was abandoned in the second half of 20th century and since then the Scarce fritillary has disappeared from almost all localities. Currently only the population in the Dom\u00e1novick\u00fd les Nature Reserve in the Polab\u00ed area persists. To achieve a successful reintroduction it is essential to choose the most suitable localities. These localities are mentioned in the species Action Plan and they must include sufficient number of young Ash trees (the females do not lay egg on old trees) and suitable vegetation. All these localities are now too dark, so the reintroduction cannot start without previous habitat management. At first it is necessary to lower the canopy cover (0.4 - 0.6 is optimum) or to create as many small forest clearings as possible. It is also necessary to have enough nectar sources for the imagoes. Implementation: The easiest way of reintroduction is to transfer sufficient number of individuals from another locality.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f92f8a9c-c6b5-412b-9e6d-04d62a44df18": {"__data__": {"id_": "f92f8a9c-c6b5-412b-9e6d-04d62a44df18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8a467df1426dc4617d8321f994631ebf643d855f1a30bba3a3f79f9966f5845a"}, "2": {"node_id": "62281174-2a75-4fd6-9d65-f55050340ad8", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "81fdbb2a425241bc82c28403610f1d7e8d314b80365e54e0a3cf6f7b43e1936e"}}, "hash": "aa7cb124f385da262eb95d2e819c8e2d0e6dceb59d9d854d6bde99ce6d5b5373", "text": "However we were not able to use this strategy, because the number of imagoes at the Dom\u00e1novick\u00fd les Nature Reserve was still too low and we did not want to endanger the only surviving population.

It is not worth to release imagoes because they have bindings to the place were they hatched and released imagoes can be confused and leave the locality. In the summer of 2019, 26 egg clutches were found, which proved successful breeding at the locality and confirmed successful reintroduction attempts. The supplementations will continue in 2020 and 2021. 19 Post-release monitoring: After releasing the larvae the locality is visited several times during the end of May and June to confirm the presence of imagoes, and in June - July to monitor number of larvae nests. The monitoring was unsuccessful in 2018 which either meant there were no imagoes and reproduction in 2018 or the number was so low that we failed to confirm their presence. The monitoring scheme is derived from the monitoring which takes place in the Dom\u00e1novick\u00fd les Nature Reserve. Probably the most useful method is the calculating of larvae nests, because skilled person can find them quite easily and there is only very small chance that a significant number can be overlooked. Simple monitoring of the imagoes is problematic, because they can spend a lot of time in treetops and can be quite elusive. Every 2 - 4 years we use the mark-recapture method to calculate the exact number of butterflies. This method has not been adapted in the Libick\u00fd luh Nature Reserve yet, but it is planned in the coming years. Finally, we confirmed the presence of imagoes and reproduction both in 2019. It means that conditions in the Libick\u00fd luh Nature Reserve for these species are good enough for successful reproduction, however it is too early for a proper evaluation.

Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 The reintroduction has just started, so impossible to evaluate it properly. Maybe the results are successful or even highly successful in fact, but we will know it in the following years.

This land use change has resulted in most stream habitats changing from narrow, cooler, fast flowing, rocky- bottomed creeks (still found in some of the rainforest remnants) to wide, exposed, slow flowing, mud bottomed creeks choked with Para grass. Recent intensive sampling has documented a decline in the distribution of the species, and identified hybridization with Eastern rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida splendida) as a key threatening process (facilitated by habitat and climate change). As a recently identified unique species, the Malanda rainbowfish is yet to be assigned a formal Australian federal conservation listing. However, the Australian Society for Fish Biology listed the species as Critically Endangered in 2016, following IUCN criteria. To guard against Malanda rainbowfish (male) \u00a9 Keith Martin 22 extinction several planned introductions occurred into two tributaries of the North Johnstone River and several local farm dams within the catchment. The tributaries, Ithaca River and Mungalli Creek each have high downstream waterfalls which prevent the upstream migration of Eastern rainbowfish. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Establish several populations in farm dams as artificial refuges which separately conserve the genetic diversity of remaining natural populations. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a translocated riverine population protected from introgressive hybridization with Eastern rainbowfish. \uf0b7\uf020 Ensure the allelic diversity of new populations represents the allelic diversity of the founding populations. \uf0b7\uf020 Demonstrate that conservation actions for smaller species do not necessarily require large budgets and that interest groups in the aquarium hobby can substantially contribute to successful conservation actions. \uf0b7\uf020 Demonstrate that without basic monitoring of species with restricted ranges some species will be lost before decline can be detected and prevented.

Project Summary Feasibility: The objective was to prevent the extinction of the rapidly declining Malanda rainbowfish. The species is not commercially important but is becoming appreciated by aquarists around the world (e.g. Allen, 1995). A larger growing generalist species, the Eastern rainbowfish is gradually progressing upstream, invading the range of Malanda rainbowfish and replacing them via introgressive hybridization (Unmack et al., 2016). This is the primary immediate threat to Malanda rainbowfish habitat \u00a9 Keith Martin 23 Malanda rainbowfish. Consequently, translocating Malanda rainbowfish into discrete waterbodies devoid of Eastern rainbowfish continues to be a priority since eradicating Eastern rainbowfish (and preventing introgression) is typically not feasible. Fortunately, the Ithaca River - a tributary of the North Johnstone River has two waterfalls which prevented the upstream dispersal of Eastern rainbowfish. In addition, farm dams are common in the area and few contain rainbowfish thus they were available as translocation sites, with this refuge approach being shown as an important part of the conservation efforts for species in a similar critical situation (Hammer et al., 2013). All of this work took place on private land so we were fortunate that landholders were willing to facilitate the conservation of this species. Implementation: Intensive sampling undertaken between 2014 and 2018 identified six remaining populations of Malanda rainbowfish, three in various parts of Williams Creek, an unnamed tributary to Molo Creek, in several instream dams on an unnamed tributary of Thiaki Creek and an unnamed creek (referred to as Wallace Road). One Williams Creek population is on the verge of extirpation while a major population from the mid Ithaca River and its tributary Thiaki Creek were largely extirpated by 2014. In November 2016, 780 Malanda rainbowfish were moved to six new homes in each of the three catchments identified at that time. The upper Ithaca River received 300 fish, consisting of an equal number of fish from all three wild populations identified at the time (upper Molo Creek tributary, two Williams Creek populations and Wallace Road).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb70ac3e-07a9-4d32-bf57-01c2e79d0f7b": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb70ac3e-07a9-4d32-bf57-01c2e79d0f7b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f7a4cfd3dc3bb8c127002644113c676541374bea9f4dae37a9cf0b08b61e2546"}, "2": {"node_id": "be285b9f-f371-424e-8ea9-1138fd88e24f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f4b2295f75d0c7625656f62d3e0d4a7175c51b5b095c40a6568322783d826c9"}}, "hash": "6a7b998a4ac62ad66db4f60f39d34fb89f6a9f2ad62fc13737acfd2bd01cb2f4", "text": "The upper Ithaca River was deemed the best release site due to the presence of two large waterfalls which have prevented rainbowfish from moving upstream.

In May 2019, 400 fish, consisting of 100 fish from each of four populations at Molo Creek tributary, Thiaki Creek tributary, Williams Collection of Malanda rainbowfish 24 Creek East Branch and Wallace Road were translocated to Mungalli Creek above a major waterfall. Post-release monitoring: Since translocation, there have been two monitoring events for the Ithaca River and farm dam populations. Fish were sampled using a seine net and box traps. Four months after release in March 2017 juvenile Malanda rainbowfish were detected in Ithaca River. Fish had moved approximately 100 m downstream since their release. By May 2019 Malanda rainbowfish were detected up to 1.3 km downstream. Releases into farm dams have been difficult to assess as they are difficult to sample due to dense aquatic vegetation and reduced water clarity. In May 2019, fish were found in three of the dams (one of which had an existing population that we had been unable to catch in our first attempts), one dam had no evidence of rainbowfish and one dam remains to be sampled. To some degree, substantial depth and soft benthos compromises access and thorough sampling to definitely conclude absence of rainbowfish from these dams. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Initial confusion regarding taxonomy and identification due to increasing introgression throughout the range of the species. \uf0b7\uf020 It was necessary to DNA sequence all populations prior to translocation to ensure that only pure fish were translocated. \uf0b7\uf020 All remnant populations and translocation sites only occur on private property. \uf0b7\uf020 Lack of a formal description for the species and lack of any formal conservation listing precluded it from Government funding, so the project relied on a small amount of crowd funding and opportunism. \uf0b7\uf020 Limited suitable translocation sites hindered conservation options.

This is epitomized in the current conservation status of pygmy perches in the Basin. The SPP lineage has experienced large- scale extinctions from most of the middle MDB, and survives now only in very small population fragments mainly in tributaries of the upper Murray River and in pockets of the lowermost reaches of the basin. The MDB YPP lineage, originally restricted to the lower reaches of the basin, has not been detected in the wild since 2015 and in 2019 it was considered extinct. The SPP is listed as critically endangered in South Australia, threatened in Victoria and endangered in New South Wales.

Project Summary Feasibility: Freshwater fishes are globally recognized as being highly susceptible to decline following anthropogenic disturbance. The highly-altered MDB ecosystem typifies the extinction crisis faced by freshwater fish populations. This is the most important agricultural region of Australia, with water being both the life blood and most critical resource of this inland basin. However, allocation of water for agriculture and extended drought (possibly heralding a changed climate regime), has gripped southeastern Australia in the last two decades. The environmental impacts have been strongest at the terminus of the MDB, which relies on upstream water management to sustain important habitats. The lower reaches of the Basin suffered rapid and dramatic lowering in water levels in 2006 (detailed in Hammer et al., 2013). By 2008 much of the lower MDB was dry, leading to extensive and unprecedented loss of freshwater habitats and aquatic biodiversity. This was especially the case for poor dispersive fish species such as pygmy perches that rely on off-channel, tributary stream and wetland environments. The SPP found in the lower MDB are geographically isolated, locally adapted and genetically divergent from other regional populations (Brauer et al., 2016). The YPP of the lower MDB are an endemic lineage classified as an evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) isolated since the Pleistocene (Brauer et al., 2013). Most of the focus for fish conservation programs in the MDB has previously been on large-bodied fishes. Implementation: In response to the crisis, a collaboration of government agencies, a University genetics lab, a NGO and the community was formed to Yarra pygmy perch (left) & Southern pygmy perch (right) \u00a9 Michael Hammer 28 undertake urgent conservation actions for small-bodied fishes under very high risk of extinction (Hammer et al., 2013). The team implemented in situ habitat monitoring and response (e.g. watering), fish rescue, captive-breeding programs, reintroductions and population monitoring. Pygmy perches were rescued from Lake Alexandrina in the lower MDB (catchment area of ~1.061 million km\u00b2) before their habitat dried out. The YPP were sourced from three discrete locations and the SPP from two locations. A total of 84 adult YPP and 65 adult SPP were available for genetic-based breeding programs aimed at minimizing inbreeding and preserving genetic variation. For each species, the putative breeders were fin -clipped for DNA extractions, and genetic diversity and relatedness were estimated using microsatellite DNA markers (Attard et al., 2016).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "db3a6604-334e-4bde-8f81-59ebae488ad5": {"__data__": {"id_": "db3a6604-334e-4bde-8f81-59ebae488ad5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "39c7ef75f01430d7b5092e6af78030f400fe3fedece7190efab3599ec1a4e34b"}, "2": {"node_id": "25c4cc67-4615-4f5e-bc78-79ffa5125b7a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c59ea7579ec1abcb2f02574500512006417f8ed62c2cfcd7c5c18e7ad4587e87"}}, "hash": "4508ff31f4491256b53d01a7fb4d3152445ffe3c67053598dd45f0b95f7ac472", "text": "Little information on captive husbandry was available for these species, but pond spawning had been previously achieved for SPP.

A contingency plan was also put in place in the event that self-sustaining wild populations were not established; this consisted of maintaining individuals from multiple family groups in captive breeding, both at Flinders University and in artificial refuges monitored by government agencies. Reintroductions of the two species began in the Lake Alexandrina region during spring 2011 using equal numbers from each family group. Post-release monitoring: Post-release monitoring at the reintroduction sites Representative YPP habitat (left) & SPP habitat (right) \u00a9 Nick Whiterod 29 demonstrated persistence and recruitment of SPP in subsequent years. YPP on the other hand failed to respond to the reintroductions and are now considered extinct in the MDB. This was observed despite higher numbers of reintroduced YPP (~5,850) compared to SPP (~1,350). Genetic data from 71 SPP captured during the three years after reintroduction confirmed that 19 of those were born in captivity, with the remaining 52 assigned as wild-born offspring of the genetic- based captive bred fish. Subsequent monitoring (as of December 2019) demonstrated persistence and recruitment of SPP, with 100s of individuals captured in and near the released sites. For YPP, only 13 individuals were captured during the first three years following release. These were classified as putative offspring from the genetic-based breeding program. Despite broader monitoring across its former range, including an occupancy study where triplicate surveys of 32 former and reintroduction sites were carried out in November and December 2018, the species has not been detected in the Basin since 2015. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 The unprecedented temporal and spatial extent of environmental perturbation in the lower MDB, especially habitat desiccation, a) hindered habitat recovery for suitable reintroduction sites, b) provided ongoing pressure on fish establishment (e.g. difficult to manage threats from invasive fishes), and c) led to a partial mismatch in the capacity of the reintroduction project and the required scale of actions in a large system. \uf0b7\uf020 Limited information about species life-history, husbandry and habitat requirements for both SPP and YPP, against critical time-frames for implementing a captive program. \uf0b7\uf020 Low levels of genetic diversity of both species made relatedness and parentage analyses challenging. \uf0b7\uf020 Lack of necessary governmental commitment and long-term continuing funding for planning and implementation in terms of fish surveys, rescue and post-release monitoring, as well as for large-scale hatchery production and fish husbandry. \uf0b7\uf020 Broader uncertainty in water management relating to habitat availability and SPP captured in the field \u00a9 Scotte Wedderburn 30 recovery (although environmental water is increasingly seeking to create habitats that would be suitable for both species).

Formerly bullhead was common in Flanders (North Belgium). Due to water pollution, habitat degradation and fragmentation however, cottid populations and distributions declined dramatically. Consequently bullhead is listed as IUCN Vulnerable in the national Red List (Verreycken et al., 2014). Until the discovery of a relict population in the Dorpbronbeek (2003), Cottus perifretum was thought to be extinct from the entire Demer River basin. The status of this population was extremely precarious because of the small population size, restricted habitat area, and many external stressors. In 2008, Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO) and Agency of Nature and Forest (ANB) initiated an ex situ culture and a reintroduction program to prevent the loss of this unique population. In 2015, after successful introductions in the Demer basin, we shifted the focus towards the Dyle basin where no bullhead populations were present in Flanders (only in Wallonia, south part of Belgium). Bullhead is listed as an Annex II species. The main targets for the bullhead in Flanders are: to contain the current range of the species and to increase the number of populations. Moreover, specific goals were set for the Special Area of Conservation of the Dyle (Natura, 2000 BE2400011).

Project Summary The survival of the population in the Dorpbronbeek is at risk because of local habitat deterioration, its small population size, and restricted habitat size. Measures were taken to conserve the unique bullhead population in the Dorpbronbeek in situ. The population was locally protected by the restoration of its habitat e.g. reforestation of river banks, land use change, and both temporal and permanent measures to decrease erosion from adjacent agricultural sites. However, a local watercress farm still poses a high risk. The farm adds fertilizers at the instream and taps water from the headstream by blocking the upper part of the brook with a dam. This activity threatens the long-term survival of the entire bullhead population despite all previous conservation measures taken. Therefore INBO and ANB launched a restoration project by reintroducing cultured juveniles originating from the relict population to other suitable habitats in the same river basin. In 2015, after successful introductions in the Demer basin, we shifted the focus towards the Dyle basin. Because of different genetic strains between the Demer and the Dyle basin, we started another program using the same approach, but with different genetic lines. Feasibility: The feasibility study consisted of a genetic study, a captive-breeding program, a habitat suitability study and a qualitative electrofishing survey to make 34 sure that no remnant bullhead populations were present (which was not the case). A genetic study using microsatellites revealed that the Dorpbronbeek population is indeed a relic of the Demer River basin population, with a high similarity to other bullhead populations in the Scheldt River basin but also with five unique alleles. Previous genetic research showed that the genetic diversity of bullhead in Flanders is low and the different populations are extremely fragmented (Knapen et al., 2003). To prevent substantial loss of genetic variability of bullheads in Belgium, management should aim to protect and conserve as many of these populations as possible. A captive-breeding program was developed at the aquaculture facilities of INBO to spawn and rear bullhead in captivity in order to provide sufficient individuals for a possible reintroduction. The broodstock for the Demer basin was collected from the source population in the Dorpbronbeek. The program started in 2004 and has become increasingly successful over time. Because of different genetic lines between Demer and Dyle basin, we started a new program in 2015 in cooperation with the angler Service of the Walloon Authority of Nature and Forest (DNF), with bullheads originating from the Blanc Ry, a tributary headwater of the Dyle located in the Walloon part of Belgium. This population was also genetically screened and found suitable as broodstock. Habitat suitability of potential headstreams within the Demer and Dyle river basin was assessed on a macrohabitat and microhabitat scale prior to reintroduction. On a macrohabitat scale, water quality, habitat structure, food availability, and the present fish community were screened in nine and five brooks of the Demer and Dyle basins, respectively (see figure 1).

We expect that due to larval drift and downstream dispersion of juveniles and adults the entire sub-basin of the Molenbeek will get colonized. Similarly, in the Nellebeek, a fast population growth is also expected, and downstream colonization of the IJse will most likely occur. 35 Implementation: In 2008 and 2009, respectively 1,220 and 345 cultured young of the year bullhead were released into the headwater of the Zevenbronnenbeek. To enhance the habitat and to increase the breeding success at the release site even more, 68 ceramic tiles were added to the stream as additional artificial spawning substrates and shelter (Knaepkens et al., 2004) before the first introduction in the Zevenbronnenbeek took place. In the Schoorbroekbeek, 1,285 YOY were released in 2010, 5,291 in 2011 and 420 in 2012. In the Waarbeek-Deesbeek 641 YOY bullhead were released in 2011, 385 in 2012, 724 in 2014 and another 519 in 2015. Worth mentioning is the fact that in the Waarbeek-Deesbeek in 2014 habitat amelioration was performed downstream of the release sites. The introduction cycle in 2014 was therefore focusing on this section. In 2015, due to a miscommunication, a thorough sediment clearing was carried out, impacting the entire population. Therefore, after taking restoration measures (restoring sinuosity and re-entering woody debris, boulders and stones), we decided to prolong our introduction strategy for another year. In 2016, 50 adults were released in the Sint-Annabeek, and 354 YOY were released in the Dorpbronbeek in 2017 to reinforce the original population. In the Dyle basin, 1,006 YOY were released in the Bruelbeek in 2015, 602 in 2016 and 208 in 2017. In the Nellebeek 849 YOY were released in 2015 and 600 in 2016. In the Mollendaalbeek 600 YOY were released in 2016 and 1,177 YOY in 2017. Post-release monitoring: The conservation status of bullheads is assessed based on habitat quality and demographic population parameters (Coeck et al., 2008). All habitat quality indicators of the release locations are in favorable conditions. For the demographic population parameters \u2018unfavorable\u2019 conditions are defined as degraded populations (C) when fish abundance is <0.1 bullheads/ m\u00b2 and population structure is showing only one age-class. Favorable conditions are defined as \u2018sufficient\u2019 (B) or \u2018good\u2019 (A) when bullhead abundance is between 0.1 - 0.3 bullheads/m\u00b2 or >0.3 bullheads/m\u00b2 respectively, and the age-distribution Schoorbroekbeek \u00a9 Van Liefferinge 36 histogram is showing the presence of different age- classes (B), or is having a proportion of >50% YOY (A). Reproductive success in the first introduced population in the Zevenbronnenbeek was assessed during the first year by visual inspection of the presence of territorial males, gravid females or egg clutches underneath the ceramic tiles. Field observations showed that a high proportion of the cultured fish were sexually mature in the year after the release. Throughout the natural breeding season about 40% of the tiles were occupied by territorial bullhead, but also natural substrates were used as nesting places. Notwithstanding the fact that these artificial nesting places could easily be monitored, we decided not to add ceramic tiles at the other brooks because sufficient natural nesting places (e.g. wooden debris, rocks and boulders) were present at the release sites. Until 2019, we monitored the introduced populations every year by means of electrofishing, not only at the release sites but we also included downstream stretches and rivers.

Historically, the Preserve contained three springs that flowed into riparian meadows. These spring systems were once inhabited by the Las Vegas dace (Rhinichthys deaconi), an extinct species described from museum specimens (Miller, 1984). Today, the Preserve is privately-owned by the Las Vegas Valley Water District (LVVWD), the local municipal water purveyor. As part of ongoing restoration efforts, ponds were constructed at the Preserve to rewild the federally endangered Pahrump poolfish (Empetrichthys latos), a species considered critically endangered by the IUCN. This endemic fish was extirpated in 1975 from Manse Spring in Pahrump Valley, Nye County, Nevada. Although Manse Spring was lost to groundwater pumping for agriculture, some fish were translocated proactively to establish three refugia populations (Minckley & Deacon, 1968). Recently, two of these refugia were decimated by the illegal introduction of non- native species, in particular Goldfish (Carassius auratus), Western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and Red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The establishment of a population at the Preserve further protects the species from stochastic events that can lead Pahrump poolfish adult (above) and fry (bottom) \u00a9 Aaron Ambos 42 to extinction.

Project Summary Feasibility: To assist with conservation of the critically endangered Pahrump poolfish, additional public education and refugia populations are required. The Preserve was identified as a potential translocation site because: 1) it is a secure property that will reduce the likelihood of illegal introductions of non-native species, 2) it hosts two museums that promote conservation and public education, and 3) it is only about 65 km from Manse Spring. The Preserve, however, encompasses a 44 ha operational groundwater well-field that provides water to meet Las Vegas\u2019 peak municipal demands. In order to maintain operations of the active well-field, while ensuring the safety of an endangered Pahrump poolfish population, a 15-year Safe Harbor Agreement was ratified in 2017 by LVVWD and the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). The legally- binding document spelled out the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of both parties (LVVWD & USFWS, 2017). Implementation: The design and construction of a pond mesocosm suitable for Pahrump poolfish was potentially the most challenging part of the project. At the Preserve, 10 previously-built ponds were evaluated for their potential suitability for Pahrump poolfish and imperiled Relict leopard frogs (Rana onca). Three ponds were selected because of their larger sizes and/or ease of access for future public education, although none had supplemental aeration or filtration. The suitability of these ponds was tested for Pahrump poolfish by first introducing approximately 50 Moapa White River springfish (Crenichthys baileyi moapae) into each pond in August 2013. Although the fish thrived initially, the death of large quantities of 43 green algae (Chara sp.) in the fall of 2013 led to anaerobic water conditions in the test ponds. Trapping surveys in November 2013, revealed that only two of the fish had survived in a single pond. Supplemental aeration and filtration was necessary in order to establish refugia populations at the Preserve. In order to move forward with the Pahrump poolfish refugium at the Preserve, two other existing ponds were chosen because of the availability of power for aeration and filtration systems. These ponds had not been selected previously because of the effects of decomposing leaves from overhead Cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii) on water quality. Once additional funding and approvals were secured, a new low-maintenance pond mesocosm was designed in August 2016. The new design included two interconnected concrete ponds with shared aeration systems (i.e., bubblers, waterfalls) and both natural filtration (i.e., emergent macrophytes) and mechanical filtration (i.e., high-capacity skimmer baskets, settling basin).

Although the population size stabilized in 2019, it represents a 58% decline from the October 2018 survey. This may be partially explained by the presence of hundreds of imperiled Relict leopard frog (Rana onca) tadpoles in 2019, which may have altered the primary productivity, and thus carrying capacity, of the system. As of 27th November 2019, there has been no observed recurrence of mortalities as a result of immunosuppressed Pahrump poolfish. Recruitment is still occurring, as schools of Pahrump poolfish fry were observed from 14th May until 3rd October 2019. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Prior to the addition of aeration and filtration systems, there was an unanticipated decline in water quality because of large quantities of decomposing leaves in the fall and winter. \uf0b7\uf020 Mature fish were succumbing to opportunistic aquatic bacteria and fungi. Fish pathologists speculated that mortalities were likely the result of the synergistic effects of anthropogenic (i.e. mark-recapture survey) and environmental (i.e. drastic temperature drop) stressors. \uf0b7\uf020 Manse Spring was a thermal system with a constant spring pool temperature of 24\u00b0C; however, translocated fish were known to survive temperatures as low as 4\u00b0C under ice (Selby, 1977). The two Preserve ponds are not heated and dropped to 0.5 and 1.5\u00b0C during the unusually cold winter of 2018 - 2019. \uf0b7\uf020 The mechanical aeration system (i.e., bubblers) had to be adjusted so that the bubbles did not prevent falling leaves from reaching two large skimmer baskets. Given the closed nature of the system, large quantities of decomposing leaves could still potentially lead to water quality issues. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Small pond mesocosms require supplemental aeration and filtration. \uf0b7\uf020 Mark-recapture surveys must occur before precipitous seasonal declines in water temperature, which can compromise the immune system of Pahrump Pahrump poolfish pond habitat \u00a9 Raymond A. Saumure 45 poolfish. This recommendation was implemented in 2019 and no further post-handling mortalities were documented. \uf0b7\uf020 The rewilding of the Preserve generated a surprising amount of positive local media coverage. This media coverage was leveraged to educate the public about the plight of endangered species and the damage caused by the illegal introduction of non-native species to native fauna. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 The initial buy-in and subsequent commitment from partner agencies to see the project through, despite temporary setbacks, was critical to the success of the project. \uf0b7\uf020 The pond was redesigned to be a low-maintenance mesocosm that provided redundant natural and mechanical aeration and filtration systems. \uf0b7\uf020 Managed the outbreak of a virulent pathogen and adapted procedures and protocols to decrease the likelihood of a recurrence in subsequent years. \uf0b7\uf020 Public education followed a multifaceted approach, including interpretive panels, site tours, and public television. These activities resulted in additional reporting in local print and social media, generating even more public interest.

This thermal endemic species was historically found in approximately 25 warm springs (30 - 32\u00b0C) and the upper 16 km of stream forming the Muddy River. Currently, Moapa dace inhabit approximately 38% (9.5 km) of historic stream habitat, including four spring systems and the mainstream Muddy River. Major threats include invasive non-native fishes, habitat alteration for agriculture and recreation, and municipal water development. Conservation measures for the Moapa dace have been a collaborative effort between federal and state agencies, and the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA). Efforts have included the acquisition of private land for the creation of the Moapa Valley National Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) and Warm Springs Natural Area (WSNA). These areas protect 541 ha, including the headwaters of four of five major springs and 7.9 km of fluvial habitat. Active recovery efforts occur in these areas to ensure Moapa dace \u00a9 Aaron Ambos 47 the preservation of the species. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Protect and restore Moapa dace habitat. \uf0b7\uf020 Minimize impacts of non-native fishes. \uf0b7\uf020 Monitor abundance of Moapa dace. \uf0b7\uf020 Protect instream flows. \uf0b7\uf020 Re-establish Moapa dace in five spring systems, using translocation if necessary. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Protect Moapa dace habitat and instream flows in three of five occupied spring systems for reclassification from Federally \u201cEndangered\u201d to \u201cThreatened\u201d and in all five spring systems for five consecutive years for removal from the Federal Endangered Species list. \uf0b7\uf020 Confirm that non-native fishes and parasites no longer adversely impact the long-term survival of Moapa dace. \uf0b7\uf020 Document recruitment of Moapa dace via evidence of three age-classes (larval, juvenile, adult) occurring in three spring systems. \uf0b7\uf020 Document that 75% of historical habitat across the five spring systems and upper Muddy River provide spawning, nursery, cover, and foraging. \uf0b7\uf020 Demonstrate an annual abundance of 4,500 fish for reclassification from \u201cEndangered\u201d to \u201cThreatened\u201d, and to 6,000 fish (across five spring systems) for five consecutive years for removal from the Federal Endangered Species list. Project Summary Feasibility: Although heavily impacted by habitat modification and invasive species, the geographic range of thermophilic habitat historically and potentially available to Moapa dace is small (16 km). As such, the logistical concerns oftentimes encountered in large river systems such as piscicide effectiveness, uninstallation of concrete structures, and restoring connectivity are financially tractable. The USFWS ranks the Moapa dace within its highest category of recovery potential. The restricted geographic range of this species also limits the number of managing government agencies, municipalities and private landowners, each with overlapping, but varied missions. The small number of Moapa dace survey \u00a9 Aaron Ambos 48 parties involved makes it much easier to meet regularly for discussion and coordinate recovery actions. Using a combination of land purchases and agency cooperation, historical challenges associated with private lands have largely been resolved. Implementation: Private land in the Moapa Valley was purchased for the creation of the Refuge and adjacent WSNA. The Refuge was established by purchasing individual parcels of land between the 1970s and 2010s. Overall, the Refuge protects three of the five major springs on 43 ha of land and approximately 6% of historical Moapa dace habitat. The establishment of the WSNA by the SNWA in 2007 protected the majority of Moapa dace stream habitat (~76%), as well as one additional springhead. These adjacent properties make it possible for the USFWS, the Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW), the SNWA, the Moapa Band of Paiutes, Coyote Springs Investments, and the Moapa Valley Water District to work together in an active collaborative planning and restoration process for the Moapa dace and its habitat.

For example, Moapa dace were extirpated from Big Muddy Creek in 2003. Big Muddy Creek transects a 29 ha private inholding and is one of the few remaining swimming recreation facilities in the area. One dace was seen there in August 2011 and again in February 2012. No Moapa dace were seen there again until February 2015 when several fish began to recolonize this reach. Since February 2018, the 868 m Big Muddy Pederson Channel construction \u00a9 David Syzdek 49 Creek reach has supported an average of 32 Moapa dace. Concerned with the absence of natural recolonization after piscicide treatment in the North Fork (544 m) and the South Fork (1,138 m), biologists from USFWS, NDOW and SNWA translocated 59 Moapa dace adults into the South Fork in early 2019. Surveys in August 2019 found 30 adult and 10 juvenile Moapa dace in this reach, indicating successful reproduction occurred in 2019. More translocations are planned in the South Fork in early 2020 and subsequently in the North Fork after restoration. Post-release monitoring: Due to species-specific life-history attributes and efforts to reduce harm, biologists estimate population size via intensive snorkel surveys with 100% coverage of the historic range of Moapa dace. Surveys are conducted with biologists swimming and crawling upstream to count individual fish. These surveys have been confirmed to be accurate using mark/recapture studies. Snorkel surveys were periodically conducted beginning in 1985. Since 2008, surveys have been conducted biannually in the spring and fall seasons to inform both winter survival and document annual reproduction, respectively. Historical habitat has been split into 18 reaches for management. Each reach is snorkeled by trained biologists familiar with fish species in the system. In addition, life-stage is estimated by total length as adult (>45 mm), juvenile (20 - 45 mm), and larvae (<20 mm). Total numbers are grouped by reach and counts are compared year-to-year. Biologists from SNWA, USFWS, NDOW, along with other stakeholders, generally meet monthly to plan fish counts, research, restoration actions, and/or outreach. Moapa dace \u00a9 PhotoArk.com 50 Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Pervasive invasive species, such as tilapia, are difficult to remove and require sustained effort and complex planning for successful eradication. \uf0b7\uf020 Natural and artificial barriers to fish passage, while sometimes useful in blocking the movement of invasive species, also prevent recolonization by target species. \uf0b7\uf020 Some private landowners restrict access, highlighting the need for coordination. \uf0b7\uf020 Wildfire carried by non-native invasive plants can cause severe habitat damage but can improve access for piscicide treatments by temporarily removing vegetation. \uf0b7\uf020 Property acquisition, habitat restoration, and engineering projects such as fish barriers are extremely expensive.

Bombina pachypus is listed as Endangered in the IUCN Red List (Andreone et al., 2009). The species was formerly common in suitable habitat. However, it has declined in most of its range (with the exception of Calabria, where several populations remain stable) over the last 20 years. The species occurs in ephemeral shallow, unshaded pools where spawning and larval development takes place. Threats to this species were identified in the loss and fragmentation of wetlands to drainage for agricultural purposes. However, many populations appear to have declined or gone extinct in areas of presumably intact habitat. In most places the population are reduced to 6 - 20 individuals, thus being highly prone to stochastic extinctions. This species might also be threatened by chytridiomycosis. The very small size of most populations suggests restocking with captive-bred animals as the main conservation measure after removing the possible causes of decline. We report a pilot restocking project in two demes in central Italy that underwent dramatic decline with population size <10 individuals. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Mitigate the main threats for the selected demes prior restocking: early drought of pools and alteration of wetlands by Wild boars (Sus scrofa). \uf0b7\uf020 Produce a suitable captive-bred population of one year old metamorph individuals from wild caught eggs from the same place Apennine yellow-bellied toad \u00a9 L. Vignoli 53 selected for restocking. \uf0b7\uf020 Release of one year old captive-bred individuals into the wild in four yearly restocking events from 2014 - 2017. \uf0b7\uf020 Double (at least) the pristine population (i.e. N>20) after the fourth year of restocking. \uf0b7\uf020 Create two long-term self- sustainable populations of Bombina pachypus. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Significant reduction or elimination of the main threats to the selected populations. \uf0b7\uf020 Total captive bred individuals released during the four years of restocking and recaptured at the end of the fifth year of the project. \uf0b7\uf020 Reproduction achieved of the released captive bred individuals after one year from restocking. Project Summary Feasibility: Bombina pachypus was declining all over its central and northern range. The species may be declining due to the loss of wetland habitat as a result of agricultural damage but also it faces a threat from Chytrid fungus (Canestrelli et al., 2013).

After two years from the concrete conservation actions (2014), no population growth was observed. Implementation: Since no population increase was observed after two years from the fulfilment of concrete actions, in 2014, we started a four year project aimed at increasing the population size through restocking of individuals collected from the selected demes at the egg stage and raised in ex situ facilities until one year from metamorphosis. The release of metamorph individuals close to age maturity allowed the individual recognition by means of ventral coloration pattern and was supposed to significantly decrease the mortality rate that has a peak at the egg and larval stages (Mirabile et al., 2009). Overall, a total of 67 unsexed individuals were released (20 in 2014, 19 in 2015, 16 in 2016, and 12 in 2017). Post-release monitoring: The post-release monitoring revealed that toads re- capture rate was highly variable across years of release. For instance, toads released in 2014 were 100% re-captured in 2015 and 50% in 2016 - 2018, whereas for the toads released in 2015, just two out of 19 were re-contacted in the following years. In 2018, we re-contacted a total of 21 restocked individuals (10 released in 2014, two in 2015, four in 2016, and five in 2017). The pristine population remained stable (13 individuals out 19 re-captured in 2018) with a few new recruited animals and a few losses. At the end of 2018, a net increment of 21 released individuals plus some from natural recruitment allowed to double the original population size. Moreover, restocked toads bred repeatedly over the years and captive-bred individual were ready to breed just after 13 months, well before the reported age at maturity for wild animals (three years). Considering the positive outcome of the restocking of the captive bred population, the release of further individuals in the considered demes was stopped but the monitoring is still ongoing. Given that further suitable sites where the species presence is not reported are available in the protected area, the reintroduction of the species in one or a few new sites has been proposed as a further action within the project of B. pachypus conservation.

Male parental care of eggs (1 - 2 clutches, each with 2 - 13 eggs) are laid on land (e.g. under stones or inside dead tree-fern trunks). The tadpole stage is bypassed within the eggs, and upon hatching, froglets complete their metamorphosis on an adult\u2019s back. The total duration of development is approximately three months and has been observed between October and February. Longevity of the species is 25 - 35 years and maturity is reached between 3 - 5 years of age. The combination of the biology and ecology of L. archeyi, and the current threats Leiopelma archeyi \u00a9 Phil Bishop 57 reported for this species (e.g. predation by introduced rat species and the presence of chytrid fungus in wild populations) make L. archeyi a prime candidate for translocation (IUCN/SSC, 2013). Here we summarize available information for the conservation translocation (sensu IUCN/SSC, 2013) of L. archeyi frogs from Whareorino Forest to Pureora Forest in 2006 and 2016, review the context that triggered the decision to translocate, and provide the most up to date demographic estimates for the population in Pureora Forest. Goals 2006 Goals: \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a new wild population of Leiopelma archeyi in Pureora Forest. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a chytrid free population of Leiopelma archeyi. 2016 Goals: \uf0b7\uf020 Enhance the genetic and demographic profile of Leiopelma archeyi in Pureora Forest. \uf0b7\uf020 Improve the likelihood and rate of establishment of a long-term viable population of Leiopelma archeyi in Pureora Forest. Success Indicators 2006 Indicators: \uf0b7\uf020 High and long-term survival rate of frogs in the release site with at least 60% survival during the first year. \uf0b7\uf020 Recruitment is recorded at the release site within three years of transfer (i.e. 2009). \uf0b7\uf020 The first generation of offspring from the release site successfully breed and the second generation of offspring survive. 2016 Indicators: \uf0b7\uf020 100% survival during transfers and less than 5% mortality during quarantine in captivity. \uf0b7\uf020 Recapture of 20% or more of release frogs during any subsequent monitoring, and an increase in the number of new frogs at the release site. Project Summary Feasibility: In New Zealand, native frogs (Leiopelma spp.) are treasured species (taonga) for indigenous M\u0101ori people, such that native frog translocations are culturally sensitive processes (Cisternas et al., 2019). In the M\u0101ori worldview (te ao M\u0101ori), translocations affect the genealogical interconnectedness of all elements from the natural and supernatural realms (M\u0101ori concept of \u2018whakapapa\u2019), as well as traditional M\u0101ori guardianship responsibilities (kaitiakitanga). Thus, during translocations, representatives from the local M\u0101ori community at donor sites are required to transfer guardianship responsibilities for 58 these treasured species to representatives of the local M\u0101ori community at release sites. Additionally, three biological components should be considered to maximize the chances of a successful translocation: 1) genetic viability of the translocated population, 2) habitat quality/ availability of release sites, and 3) knowledge of species\u2019 biology, thereby reducing stress during translocations.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df7d5bbf-6748-47aa-89b8-16942e53388f": {"__data__": {"id_": "df7d5bbf-6748-47aa-89b8-16942e53388f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "360c853baef95306c013254902b3722aa849f1e63b6565da9a546d90d1271ed7"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e07578f-e3c5-4b6d-8284-478f2e718a23", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "344921268f8f5c928d3d44bc3573e3cc4eb44ca0a039ba358ec6896330987bd3"}}, "hash": "5921c57e9c50bd529d8eca2d8f5ce70ad976f7c968bf85518013eed59034d7d3", "text": "However, the 2006 translocation was performed during a biosecurity emergency (the presence of Chytrid fungus on frogs in Whareorino was expected to cause a significant population decline, as observed on the Coromandel Peninsula between 1999 - 2001), and under these circumstances, a rapid response was prioritized over the additional time necessary for quantitative translocation assessments or in situ habitat measurements. Habitat at the release site and the population\u2019s genetic diversity were only subjectively considered during the 2006 translocation because no detailed information was available (see Appendix A in Cisternas, 2019).

The main focus during capture and transport of the frogs was to avoid rapid fluctuations in temperature and humidity, thereby preventing physiological stress in the translocated frogs. This species is nocturnal, therefore emerged frogs were caught by hand at night for both translocations. However, in 2006, frogs were also collected from inside their retreat sites during the day.

Frogs were transported inside chilly bins by hand inside the forest and by car between sites (collection-quarantine-release). To reduce the likelihood of releasing chytrid positive frogs, they were kept in quarantine and screened for disease. In 2006, frogs were kept at Hamilton Zoo for three months (mortality of frogs - 2%). In 2016, frogs were kept at Auckland Zoo for six months (mortality of frogs - 4%). Despite the increased mortality in 2016, the captive husbandry procedures were greatly improved by the provision of UV light, and a varied diet high in \u2018natural\u2019 prey items enriched with calcium. In Release site in Pureora Forest \u00a9 Javiera Cisternas 59 addition, the sex of the frogs to be released was determined by measuring urine hormone metabolites, hence the extended quarantine duration. In 2006, 28 frogs were retained by institutions for a captive-breeding program at Auckland Zoo and chytrid studies at the University of Otago, while the remaining 70 frogs were released around midday (during the oviposition/parental care period) in a 10 x 10 m grid. In contrast, in 2016, 17 frogs were retained at Auckland Zoo for the captive colony and 60 frogs (28 males, 17 females, 15 of undetermined sex) were released after dusk, during the early breeding season. To enhance the habitat quality of the release site, frogs were released into an area enclosed by a herbivore-resistant fence (enlarged in 2016), and predator control for rats has been carried out since 2006. In 2016, a trial was set up to test the effect of fern coverage on the post-release dispersal of the frogs. Post-release monitoring: A capture-recapture post-release monitoring program was initiated at the release site, Pureora Forest, in April 2007. The site was searched for frogs once or twice a year, during four consecutive nights, inside the 10 x 10 m release grid. Identification of individual frogs was carried out manually using photographs of natural markings in individuals. Multiple changes were made in the monitoring program between 2013 and 2017 in order to improve its design and increase the recapture rate of frogs (e.g. the search area was increased from 100 to 280 m2) (Cisternas, 2019). As of 2018, the apparent bi-annual survival of the translocated frogs was estimated as 0.49 (CI= 0.15 - 0.69, using Cormack-Jolly-Seber models), and the abundance of frogs was estimated as 132 frogs (CI = 91 - 199, using Jolly-Seber Schwarz-Arnason models). The model selection criteria used in these capture-recapture analyses are adapted from Cisternas (2019). Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Low recapture rate of frogs and infrequent analyses of monitoring data: Monitoring (sensu IUCN/SSC, 2013) provides essential information for determining translocation success or failure. In addition, monitoring results inform adaptive management to improve translocation outcomes. In these translocations, formal capture-recapture monitoring analyses could only be performed 12 years after the first release of frogs at Pureora Forest by Cisternas (2019). This delay was due to a low recapture rate of frogs and technical limitations (e.g. insufficient funding, lack of staff capacity or time delays in identifying individual frogs). In the absence of capture-recapture analyses, management decisions were based on descriptive statistical summaries of accumulated counts of frogs captured during monitoring (e.g. capture counts, mean, range). Thus, prior to 2018, the absence of probabilistic statistical analyses made it impossible to include error associated with frog detectability (e.g. due to weather conditions) and spatial variation (e.g. due to misrepresentation of the sampling area) in estimates of population size. Recent coordinated work of practitioners, stakeholders, and researchers has improved the situation by testing different monitoring methods. Regression analyses concluded that the 60 monitoring method applied in 2017, with 4 - 6 people searching for frogs at night inside a fixed 280 m2 grid, should obtain enough data for robust capture-recapture models (Cisternas, 2019).

Vegetation regeneration inside the fenced area, coupled with the predator control program carried out at the release site, should improve the future habitat quality and therefore the translocation outcomes. Nonetheless, robust experimentation is required to corroborate these hypotheses. \uf0b7\uf020 Unknown genetic diversity: While obtaining sufficient DNA from skin swabs of the 80 frogs collected in 2016 proved problematic, the preliminary analysis of existing specimens held in storage suggested that the Whareorino population suffers from low genetic diversity relative to other populations of Leiopelma spp. Genetically depauperate populations have a poorer ability to adapt to environmental changes, are more susceptible to novel diseases, and are typically associated with inbreeding depression. However, in an attempt to select a genetically diverse group of individuals for release at Pureora Forest, the translocation in 2006 involved the collection of frogs from three sites located at least 10 km apart, while the 2016 translocation involved collecting frogs from four sites spaced approximately 100 m apart. Assessing the genetic diversity of the source and translocated populations is thus important to determine how genetically viable (and thus adaptable) these populations are, especially given the unprecedented environmental changes that will likely occur in the future (Easton, 2018). \uf0b7\uf020 Lack of opportunity to build experimentation in translocation procedures (especially in 2006): A translocation should be designed as a management learning process, thus translocations need to be planned as experiments (or trials) to test the effectiveness of different translocation procedures. In these frog translocations, there were no experimental designs associated with the processes of capture, transport, captivity or release. The only exception being a release trial tested in 2016 which, in time, may offer learning outcomes about sex differences on post-release dispersal of frogs released in different microhabitat conditions (Cisternas, 2019). We acknowledge that often translocations cannot be designed as \u2018ideal\u2019 experiments because of limitations in sample size or lack of replicates or a control group. Easton (2018) and Cisternas (2019) offer a baseline of procedures that could be used as a reference point for the design of future translocations with this species. 61 \uf0b7\uf020 Uncertainty of the agent of decline: To identify and neutralize an agent that causes a population decline, it is essential to use the scientific method with testable hypotheses that determine, and not assume, why and how a population has declined. It was assumed that Chytrid fungus was responsible for the declines in populations of L. archeyi on the Coromandel Peninsula during 1996 - 2001. Thus, it was presumed that the presence of chytrid-positive frogs in Whareorino Forest might result in a similar decline. Research carried out during and after the first translocation determined that chytrid was geographically widespread in New Zealand (Shaw, 2012). Furthermore, studies conducted between 2006 - 2010 revealed a chytrid prevalence of 16% and 6% in frogs swabbed in the Coromandel and in Whareorino, respectively (see Shaw, 2012 and references therein). Currently, monitored Coromandel populations are stable but at levels much less than before population declines and showing an apparent female bias (only big frogs survived). The Whareorino population has not exhibited any declines related to chytrid since monitoring began in 2005. Further research is required to fully understand the reasons for this species\u2019 decline in the Coromandel Peninsula. Furthermore, based on fossil evidence from the eastern and northernmost areas of the North Island, New Zealand, Easton (2018) inferred that the historical distribution of L. archeyi has dramatically contracted to its current state. Thus, this restricted distribution, together with poor genetic diversity within this species, could be the result of prolonged exposure to human-induced activities (e.g. introduction of mammalian pests, habitat destruction, etc.). However, even if the chytrid strain present in New Zealand is not the major agent of decline, biosecurity should be maintained as a precautionary action, considering the link between chytrids and worldwide declines of amphibian populations, and the potential impact of novel chytrid strains on this frog species.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d6cdc63-49a8-42bd-910e-69d47d519e79": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d6cdc63-49a8-42bd-910e-69d47d519e79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5a2c5f6b6ad55da61216ca1d132e1a8d32c776751eef79843ba407ca9cd3e80c"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f23f5fc-0db9-4c7e-8af4-cfc9c29da430", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bc9dbcb2f1d8c0cb7667fcb1f896d56cf55869317c5cf1145ea71d869009670"}}, "hash": "1f7750bbcb88bae6ab6820275f92e4aafaf231246722cf7ea586511915ce99d6", "text": "Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Well planned translocations take time: Planning translocations for L. archeyi are problematic due to a lack of basic biological knowledge about the species (Cisternas, 2019).

Indeed, size was the criteria used in these translocations to determine the cohort of frogs collected. In 2016, a novel technique measuring hormone metabolite levels in frog urine was used to determine the sex of the frogs to be released in the second translocation while frogs were held in quarantine. This technique could again be used in future studies to determine sex ratio in the wild and as part of the collection procedures for any future translocation endeavors. Likewise, an optimal design should include the recording of temporal changes on the resources available for this species at the translocation sites (i.e. habitat temporal variation). As the target species of this translocation is a terrestrial anuran, we propose that, at the very least, 62 temporal variation of climatic conditions should be included to assess the suitability of the release site (i.e. monitor climatic conditions for greater than one year). Additionally, translocations in New Zealand require time to coordinate with relevant stakeholders, including governmental institutions (e.g. Department of Conservation) and local indigenous communities, due to The Treaty of Waitangi (New Zealand\u2019s founding document) (Cisternas et al., 2019). Based on the experience acquired during these translocations, we suggest that an optimal translocation design for this species would require about three years to allow the development of: 1) habitat (including climatic) studies to select a suitable frog release site, 2) a relationship between interested parties (especially the government institutions and the local M\u0101ori communities), and 3) the criteria used to select the founding individuals (e.g. determine the number of founder frogs to be translocated based on population viability analyses [e.g. Easton, 2018]). \uf0b7\uf020 Leiopelma archeyi translocations require a long-term commitment: Leiopelma archeyi is a long-lived species (25 - 35 years [B. Bell pers. comm. 6th October 2017]), with parental care of a small number of offspring and first reproduction estimated to occur five years after metamorphosis. Thus, post-release monitoring to assess the establishment of this species at a new site should continue for at least one generation length after translocation (i.e. 16 - 17 years [B. Bell pers. comm. 6th October 2017]). Similarly, the resources associated with monitoring and management actions at the release site (e.g. improve habitat quality, predator control) must be budgeted for the long-term (IUCN/SSC, 2013). Finally, only a long- term commitment with the translocation project would allow current and future generations of local M\u0101ori communities the opportunity to interact meaningfully with this treasured species (Cisternas et al., 2019). \uf0b7\uf020 Interdisciplinary and intercultural teams improve translocation outcomes: The use of interdisciplinary teams leads to better translocation processes if they utilize the expertise and knowledge of each of the members. In these translocations, there has been an increasing involvement of practitioners and stakeholders. In 2006, the Department of Conservation (DOC) initiated the translocation with participation of the local M\u0101ori community. Researchers also became involved to determine the impact of chytrid on Leiopelma species, and later they assisted with the capture-recapture program. Auckland Zoo retained the frogs collected from Whareorino Forest in 2006 and 2016 that were not released in Pureora Forest, to Frogs collected for translocation \u00a9 Luke Easton 63 supplement the captive program for this species. Researchers from the University of Otago and Auckland Zoo, and the local Maori community, continue to support DOC in their monitoring efforts to assess translocation outcomes. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Preliminary monitoring results showed apparent lower survival of frogs at the release site than the value estimated for apparent survival in the donor population (Cisternas, 2019).

Further research is recommended to determine the genetic and demographic viability of this translocated population using, for example, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and population viability analyses, respectively. Additionally, investigations of pedigrees will need to rely on genetic markers (e.g. SNPs) given that there is no other current method to reliably determine the relatedness of individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Pureora Forest is not chytrid free. To assess the presence of chytrid on frogs in the translocated population, all frogs captured during the fourth night of monitoring were swabbed and tested for chytrid. In 2016, chytrid was detected for the first time: two frogs tested positive with zoospore counts of 188 and 751 (i.e. a frog tested negative has zero zoospore Highly Successful Successful Partially Successful Failure 64 count). Since then, frogs have tested negative. A frog infected with chytrid fungus can develop the disease chytridiomycosis, although the relationship between immunity and the presence of Chytrid fungus in L. archeyi is currently unclear (Shaw, 2012). Given that all the frogs released in both translocations had tested negative for chytrid three times before release, the finding of chytrid in the translocated population demonstrates the difficulty in maintaining any wild frog population as chytrid free despite quarantine protocols (e.g. cleaning boots with disinfectant, changing gloves between handling frogs, etc.). It may also be possible that chytrid is prevalent in the environment and spread via other means (e.g. other wildlife). References Cisternas, J.

Factors that contributed to the decline of this species include introduced predators, infection with diseases (e.g. chytridiomycosis), habitat loss and degradation (development, pollution, etc.), climate change, and extreme climatic events (fires, droughts, and floods). In 2002, this species was federally listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and is also recognized as endangered by the IUCN and the state of California. Beginning in 2006, the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research (ICR) was tasked with developing a conservation breeding program for individuals from the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountain ranges, with the goal of developing breeding methods and establishing a stable captive population with sufficient reproductive success to produce individuals for reintroduction into the wild.

Project Summary Feasibility: While some of the threats that contributed to this species\u2019 decline still exist in the wild, others have been mitigated. Trout removal has taken place in many critical Mountain yellow-legged frog habitats, and several sites currently or formerly inhabited by this species fall in protected areas, including national parks and forests. Chytrid fungus is regularly detected at release sites, but the historical and current impact of chytrid on southern California populations is not well understood. Implementation: In 2006, 86 tadpoles from the San Jacinto Mountains were collected as a salvage effort and transported to the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research (ICR) to serve as founders for the conservation breeding program. In 2015, an additional 20 tadpoles were collected and brought into captivity to increase the genetic diversity within the captive population. Between 2011 - 2015, six juveniles and eight adults were collected from the San Bernardino Mountains and transported to ICR to establish a captive San Bernardino mountain population for breeding and release to the wild. Captive-breeding and husbandry: The adult breeding colony at ICR currently consists of nine adult individuals from the San Jacinto population and 13 adult individuals from the San Bernardino population, in addition to numerous tadpoles and juvenile frogs. A husbandry protocol was developed in which all individuals are monitored daily and water quality is assessed regularly. Animals are fed a variety of insect species to increase dietary diversity (e.g. crickets, fruit flies, horn worms, phoenix worms, flies). In 2010, a brumation experiment was conducted to determine whether exposing captive animals to winter temperatures would impact reproductive success. Results indicated that brumated frogs were significantly 67 more likely to breed in the spring than un- hibernated frogs (Santana et al., 2015). Since adopting a brumation protocol for all animals, the colony has produced an average of ~400 eggs per female per year, with ~30% fertilization success. To further improve captive reproduction, we have implemented research on assisted reproductive technologies (Calatayud et al., 2019), mate choice, and genetic management. Pre-release conditioning: Prior to release, all animals are weighed and measured. Sufficiently large individuals are tagged with 8 mm passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags. In some years animals that were insufficiently large for PIT tags were instead tagged/identified using visible implant elastomer, alpha tags, and/or photo identification based on unique spot patterns. Prior to release veterinarians conducted health assessments and a subset of animals were tested for chytridiomycosis (all tested negative). We used experimental approaches to test the utility of a variety of pre-release treatments, taking advantage of the fact that PIT tags enable assessment of individual fates. Research has examined ties between post-release survival/movement and the pre-release manipulations including brumation, vegetative cover availability, experience with water currents, soft vs. hard releases, and treatment with the anti-fungal probiotic Janthinobacterium lividum. Data are still being analyzed from these studies. Preliminary results suggest that exposure to naturalistic environmental conditions (e.g. brumation in captivity; matching vegetative cover in captivity to that available in the field) may increase post-release survival. Release: Release sites within this species historical range were selected in the San Bernardino and San Jacinto mountains. Habitat assessments took place prior to release, and only locations that were uninhabited by introduced trout and bullfrogs were used. Releases of tadpoles (approximately two months old) and/or froglets (approximately one year old) took place at one or both mountain ranges between June - September of 2010 - 2019 (Table 1).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1d2c9fc2-af9c-451f-b8c6-40a13e4bc18a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1d2c9fc2-af9c-451f-b8c6-40a13e4bc18a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95ae48f27dd5c638d27da59dec8f29077ed381e1c2b371e970176b6b8734d0bc"}, "2": {"node_id": "2adb4fe8-55b5-4485-a14f-276598fd4ff9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8581e58a9df941d4181ce0e479abfb90f51fd3e5b9dc6972e6eb1ba14a88b27b"}}, "hash": "c89dd85fb7e4e2509095bd7e318f9241f04384e880779f438fb93c1fb86bd02d", "text": "Post-release monitoring: Post-release monitoring surveys took place in all years but were more frequent in 2016 - 2019, when they occurred at least weekly for the first month after release, then at least monthly until October, and then at least annually thereafter.

However, surveys have revealed relatively high, upstream movement rates in many froglets (as far as 2.5 km in some individuals).

Currently we are assessing new techniques to increase detection of frogs after release, including camera traps, scent detection dogs, PIT tag readers, and radio-telemetry transmitters. In 2019, a long-range PIT tag reader was deployed, which increased re-detection rates. In 2016 - 2019, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis skin swabs were collected from re-captured individuals.

Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Adding a brumation period to captive husbandry protocols can be critical to improve reproductive success in amphibians that inhabit mountain streams and should be tested more broadly with other species. \uf0b7\uf020 To improve survival after release to the wild, it is important to integrate the natural habitat conditions to which species are adapted into captive environments (e.g. cover, etc.). \uf0b7\uf020 Designing and implementing conservation breeding and reintroduction programs in an adaptive management framework allows for meaningful modifications and improvements of husbandry protocols and means that results may be more generalizable to other systems. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Husbandry and breeding protocols were experimentally tested and improved from year to year, as determined through increased survival and reproduction in the assurance colony. \uf0b7\uf020 Many hundreds of animals are consistently produced annually and released into the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 Some individuals were recaptured years after initial release, indicating captive born animals can survive in the wild at the selected release sites.

Consequently, L. aurea is listed as Vulnerable under the IUCN Red List and Australian Commonwealth legislation, and endangered under NSW State legislation. The pathogenic Chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) (Stockwell et al., 2010), habitat loss, and predation by invasive mosquitofish, are the major threats. This reintroduction took place on Kooragang Island (KI) at the mouth of the Hunter River north of Newcastle, NSW, Australia. KI contains one of the largest remnant L. aurea populations in Australia. Land use on KI includes industry (predominantly coal), exotic pasture, and natural freshwater and saltmarsh wetlands. Litoria aurea can be found in waterbodies within each of these land -use types, although its distribution is patchy. This reintroduction took place in two stages across four created habitats. First, we released L. aurea tadpoles into two small- scale experimental trial sites. Findings from these sites were then Green & golden bell frog 71 incorporated into the creation of two large-scale compensatory wetlands. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To assess the effectiveness of created habitat mosaics to support a reintroduced population of Green and golden bell frogs. \uf0b7\uf020 To assess the efficacy of these habitat mosaics in reducing chytrid pathogen prevalence, through manipulation of environmental factors unfavorable for the fungus. \uf0b7\uf020 Create large-scale habitats based on experimental findings to increase occupancy of sites on KI, bolster wild populations, and extend the meta- population distribution. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 The persistence of a reintroduced population at experimental habitat mosaics for four years, including the detection of breeding within constructed ponds. \uf0b7\uf020 Reduced severity and prevalence of chytrid infection within the reintroduced populations compared to wild sub-populations. \uf0b7\uf020 The need for little active intervention to support frog populations within constructed habitats. \uf0b7\uf020 No invasion of predatory mosquitofish. \uf0b7\uf020 Extension of the distribution of the metapopulation on KI through persistence, colonization, and breeding in the large-scale compensatory habitats. Project Summary Feasibility: The reintroduction was funded by industry partners required to compensate for habitat loss. This involved creating habitat mosaics in areas not already occupied by the species. Two enclosed experimental habitat mosaics were constructed first, to test the efficacy of certain habitat features in supporting a L. aurea population. These habitat features included a mosaic of permanent and ephemeral ponds, increased salinity in a subset of ponds, fencing to exclude predators and prevent L. aurea dispersal, and rock piles for shelter. As chytrid is present in this landscape, and currently impossible to eradicate, our primary aim was to test if these features increased population survival in the presence of this pathogen. Outcomes from the experimental sites were then incorporated into the design and construction of two large compensatory wetland habitats. Implementation: Released tadpoles were reared at the University of Newcastle\u2019s outdoor breeding colony, established with L. aurea originally collected from KI. Before large-scale releases, we placed a subset of tadpoles into 1 m3 mesh cages secured inside the constructed permanent ponds to ensure water quality suitability. These \u201csoft releases\u201d allowed easy and accurate monitoring of tadpole survival. With survival confirmed, over 10,000 tadpoles were released into half the permanent ponds at each experimental site in two stages. The staggered 72 reintroductions were to bolster population viability, as females are not sexually mature until two years of age. Rock salt was added to half the experimental ponds to try and mitigate chytrid. We raised salinity levels from an average of 0.3 ppt to 2.5 - 3 ppt, a concentration known to reduce chytrid growth and motility (Stockwell, et al., 2012 & Stockwell et al., 2015). Salt was incrementally applied over six weeks to allow salt to dissolve and to prevent over-dosing. Salt was added after tadpoles had metamorphosed and left the ponds at Experimental Site One and prior to tadpole reintroductions at Site Two.

Each compensatory site contained \u201cclusters\u201d of ponds, creating a mosaic of permanent, semi-permanent, and ephemeral ponds, with emergent and fringing vegetation. After a flood, invasive, predatory mosquitofish colonized some ponds within Compensatory Wetland One. In response, earthen walls (bunding) were constructed around the perimeter of most ponds to prevent future colonization of mosquitofish via the flow of water overland during high rainfall. Passive chytrid mitigation was achieved by constructing permanent ponds that intersected the groundwater, providing a permanent salinity profile. Ephemeral ponds were designed to periodically dry out to reduce the presence of the aquatic chytrid fungus. In Compensatory Wetland One (157 ha) 40,000 tadpoles were released to a subset of permanent ponds over a three year period (2015 - 2017).

Tadpoles were not released into Compensatory Wetland Two (2.6 ha), as natural colonization occurred rapidly after construction. Post-release monitoring: We performed weekly mark recapture surveys at the experimental habitats over four years to determine frog growth and population size. Chytrid prevalence was monitored by skin swabs analyzed with qPCR. The reintroduced populations survived the four year monitoring period, however, the relative abundance of frogs declined each year. In Experimental Site One, no breeding was recorded, and mosquitofish colonized one of 10 ponds. Breeding was recorded in 2014 at Experimental Site Two, but mosquitofish entered 12 out of 16 ponds shortly after, and no further breeding was detected. Multi-state Chad Beranek compensatory pond 73 models showed that chytrid reduced monthly frog survival at Experimental Site One. Comparative surveys between Site One and wild KI populations, indicated that chytrid levels were lower in wild frogs. At both experimental sites, frogs readily used salted and unsalted ponds, but avoided salinities over 9 ppt (reached during drought). Chytrid did not impact monthly survival at Experimental Site Two, suggesting that the mosaic of salt levels might bestow a beneficial effect on the population through a complex interaction of frog movement, disease transmission and survival. Mark recapture was also conducted across both compensatory habitats during breeding seasons (September - March between 2014 - 2015 and between 2019 - 2020). After metamorphosis, released animals dispersed to five out of seven constructed wetland clusters. Adults mostly dispersed from constructed ponds to brackish natural wetlands after significant rainfall recharged wetlands. Due to floods during construction, mosquitofish invaded 40% of ponds in Compensatory Wetland One, and 18% of ponds in Wetland Two. Bunding prevented further invasions, and fish were naturally lost from six ephemeral ponds after pond drying. Across four years, breeding has been detected six times in Compensatory Wetland One, and 27 times across eight ponds at Wetland Two. Breeding was detected only once in a pond containing low abundance of mosquitofish. Recruitment has been so successful at Compensatory Wetland Two, that population size has increased by 1,200% in three years. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 The impact of chytrid on released populations at the experimental habitats significantly lowered survival and was not reduced by one of our habitat designs compared to wild populations. \uf0b7\uf020 The addition of salt to waterbodies to mitigate the effects of chytrid required active intervention during extreme weather conditions. \uf0b7\uf020 Juvenile dispersal into terrestrial habitats was explosive and random in orientation, making any assessment of terrestrial habitat suitability problematic. \uf0b7\uf020 Uncoupling effects of tadpole predation and chytrid within the first compensatory site was difficult due to continued colonization of experimental ponds by predatory fish. Experimental permanent pond 74 \uf0b7\uf020 There was difficulty in ensuring mosquitofish did not enter permanent ponds during their construction. Flooding, transportation via wading birds, or pre-existing occupancy of fish in the construction zone, may all have contributed to the presence of mosquitofish in compensatory ponds. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Without recruitment into a released population, mortality due to chytrid will likely drive the loss of all individuals within three years. \uf0b7\uf020 Litoria aurea readily used artificially salted ponds. Furthermore, constructed ponds set within a brackish saltmarsh habitat maintained higher frog abundance than ponds set within a pasture landscape, suggesting that higher salinities may be a useful tool to mitigate the effects of chytrid across the landscape. \uf0b7\uf020 A habitat mosaic design was successful in supporting sub-populations at our constructed habitats as it provided year-round aquatic habitat (via permanent ponds, which act as refuge habitat during dry periods) plus a higher proportion of fish-free ponds for recruitment (via ephemeral ponds, which also exhibit good water quality after recharge).

Furthermore, the large size of the habitat (157 ha) means monitoring is less intensive and breeding events are more likely to be missed.

These spring systems were once inhabited by the Vegas Valley leopard frog (Rana fisheri), which was once presumed extinct but has persisted in central Arizona, USA. Today, the Preserve is privately-owned by the Las Vegas Valley Water District (LVVWD), the local municipal water purveyor. As part of ongoing restoration efforts, ponds were constructed at the Preserve to rewild the state-protected Relict leopard frog (Rana onca), a species considered Endangered by the IUCN. This frog species was once presumed extinct, but populations persisted along drainages of the Virgin and Colorado rivers in Arizona and Nevada, USA (Jaeger et al., 2001). Since then, eight natural populations have been documented and 13 refugia sites established. In spring 2018, surveys at all known sites documented a total of 1,125 frogs; although, the actual number was likely several times larger. The establishment of a population at the Preserve further protects the species from stochastic events that can lead to extinction.

Project Summary Feasibility: To assist with conservation of the Relict leopard frog, additional public education and refugia populations are required. The Preserve was identified as a potential translocation site because: 1) it is a secure property that will reduce the likelihood of illegal introductions of non-native species, 2) it hosts two museums that promote conservation and public education, and 3) it was historically inhabited by the extirpated Vegas Valley leopard frog. The Preserve, however, encompasses a 44 ha operational groundwater well-field that provides water to meet Las Vegas\u2019 peak municipal demands. In order to maintain operations of the active well-field, while ensuring the safety of a Relict leopard frog population, a 15-year Landowner Cooperative Agreement was ratified in 2017 by LVVWD and NDOW under a programmatic Candidate Relict leopard frog tadpole \u00a9 Aaron Ambos 78 Conservation Agreement with Assurances between the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and NDOW. The legally- binding document spelled out the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of the parties (LVVWD & USFWS, 2017). Implementation: The design and construction of a pond mesocosm suitable for Relict leopard frogs was potentially the most challenging part of the project. Two previously-built ponds at the Preserve had been negatively affected by decomposing leaves from overhead Cottonwood trees (Populus fremontii). Supplemental aeration and filtration was necessary in order to rectify water quality issues. Once funding and approvals were secured, a new low-maintenance pond mesocosm was designed in August 2016. This design included two interconnected concrete ponds with shared aeration systems (i.e., bubblers, waterfalls), and both natural filtration (i.e., emergent macrophytes) and mechanical filtration (i.e. high-capacity skimmer baskets, settling basin). The intricacies of the unique aeration and filtration systems were detailed in Wallace (2018). Relict leopard frog eggs were collected in spring 2018 and 2019 from natural populations in Lake Mead National Recreation Area, Clark County, Nevada. Tadpoles were reared in a laboratory setting by biologists from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Once the ponds were working as designed in May 2018, 100 newly metamorphosed Relict leopard frogs were released into the ponds. An additional 101 tadpoles and 111 newly metamorphosed frogs were translocated from March to May 2019. Post-release monitoring: Since the ponds can be visited regularly by staff, post- release monitoring has occurred almost daily. Upon the release of the initial 100 young frogs in May 2018, a female Mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) was observed consuming several frogs as they floated on the surface of one of the ponds. These laboratory-raised frogs appeared to have not developed effective flight response, which was compounded by a lack of dense cover in the newly- planted riparian areas. Few frogs were observed during subsequent diurnal visits. A nocturnal visual encounter survey (VES) in July 2018 noted the presence of only six Relict leopard frogs. By October 2018, four (one male and three females) large adult-sized frogs were captured and PIT tagged during a nocturnal survey. Pond mesocosm in pond \u00a9 Raymond A. Saumure 79 Although little is known about the overwintering habits of this species, dataloggers revealed that water temperatures in the two ponds decreased to 0.5\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C, respectively, over the winter of 2018 - 2019. All extant natural populations of Relict leopard frogs inhabit geothermally influenced systems, where water temperatures can reach 30 - 55\u00baC at sources (Bradford et al., 2005). Nonetheless, refugia populations have been established at sites with colder water (Conservation Team, 2016). In March 2019, a nocturnal survey revealed the presence of two adult Relict leopard frogs. A male was captured at that time and its identity confirmed via PIT tag. This male, released as a newly metamorphosed frog in May 2018, was calling prior to capture, and thus already sexually mature. In April 2019, in situ reproduction was confirmed when hundreds of small tadpoles were observed in the ponds.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "70c4e9b6-5de8-4464-b156-c6212ecd1146": {"__data__": {"id_": "70c4e9b6-5de8-4464-b156-c6212ecd1146", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f5d4857a8e9b0c7c214307d29ee397ee2975a5afd922f12adcea157a4896ca13"}, "2": {"node_id": "de7949f3-3722-43c9-9cba-b9edd55f8b04", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d0a54af95a1e517630f20b7408440adcd1380637ffc1985f80565bba62dab355"}}, "hash": "4269509438744cd9bb32e778ff183a376a49bc6ed33989a813b252c3ee0f34a2", "text": "Although no egg mass was observed, Relict leopard frog egg masses can contain up to 1,100 eggs (Conservation Team, 2016).

Although the vast majority of the frogs were young and had not yet overwintered, the presence of so many frogs is promising in terms of their potential contribution to the overall status of this species. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Prior to the addition of aeration and filtration systems, there was an unanticipated decline in water quality because of large quantities of decomposing leaves in the fall and winter. The 2012 International Swimming Pool and Spa code recently adopted by the City of Las Vegas requires any body of water built deeper than 46 cm to be surrounded by child-proof, unclimbable, security fences. After consultation with the City of Las Vegas, it was determined that the ponds met the code requirements of a man-made lake used for recreational, scenic, or landscape purposes; therefore, no pool fencing was required. \uf0b7\uf020 In spring 2018, the density of native plants in the riparian zone did not provide the translocated frogs with sufficient cover from previously undocumented avian predators. Riparian plant growth by 2019 appeared sufficient to resolve this issue. \uf0b7\uf020 In 2018, most of the lab-raised young Relict leopard frogs did not appear to exhibit a sufficient flight response upon release to avoid avian predation. The contrast in wariness was especially evident in 2019, as the young frogs that developed in situ, or from tadpoles released at the site, had 80 pronounced flight responses. \uf0b7\uf020 The mechanical aeration system (i.e., bubblers) had to be adjusted so that the bubbles did not prevent falling leaves from reaching two large skimmer baskets. Given the closed nature of the system, large quantities of decomposing leaves could still potentially lead to water quality issues. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Small pond mesocosms require supplemental aeration and filtration. \uf0b7\uf020 In 2019, modifications to the translocation protocol were implemented in an attempt to reduce the impact of diurnal avian predators: 1) all translocations were scheduled at dusk to allow animals to acclimate prior to experiencing potential diurnal avian predation, and 2) large tadpoles were released in addition to the newly metamorphosed frogs. \uf0b7\uf020 Although plant cover was substantial by 2019, cover was further enhanced in 2019 by placing several partially-submerged large sandstone slabs in the riparian zone. These slabs were heavy enough that ducks could not dislodge them, with access only under the edges. Subsequent monitoring has documented numerous metamorphs and young frogs sheltered under these slabs. \uf0b7\uf020 Survivorship of young frogs that developed from the eggs deposited in situ was probably higher than the translocated lab-reared young frogs. \uf0b7\uf020 The rewilding of the Springs Preserve generated a surprising amount of positive local media coverage. This media coverage was leveraged to educate the public about the plight of imperiled amphibian species in the Mojave Desert. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 The initial buy-in and subsequent commitment from partner agencies to see the project through, despite temporary setbacks, was critical to the success of the project.

Populations of both western (T. h. hermanni) and eastern sub-species (T. h. boettgerri) are fading throughout their geographic range (Livoreil, 2009). Listed on the Appendix II (A) of CITES, it is classified as \"Near Threatened\" on the IUCN World Red List, but the western sub- species is considered \"Vulnerable\" on the French National Red List. The situation of the western sub-species is particularly worrying. Continuous declines since the beginning of the 20th century in Italy, France and Spain resulted in strongly fragmented and reduced populations. In continental France, only one population located in and nearby the Maures Mountains (Var district, South east) persists. Classified as \u201cEndangered\u201d (IUCN regional status) this population is particularly vulnerable due to habitat loss, forest fire, and illegal harvesting. Conservation projects involve sensitization, habitat management and translocation. We tested the efficiency of using rescued individuals to re-enforce the most weakened populations. Following preliminary experiments, we present the results from a second monitoring of successful translocation. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Checking sanitary and genetic profiles of the rescued candidates. \uf0b7\uf020 Selecting suitable releasing sites and monitoring resident host populations. \uf0b7\uf020 Releasing adults, sub -adults and juveniles from a pool of rescued animals. \uf0b7\uf020 Radio-tracking of translocated and 83 resident tortoises during two years to assess survival, settling rate and body condition. \uf0b7\uf020 Testing resetting- translocation to the release point in case of over dispersal. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Obtaining official agreements and permits. \uf0b7\uf020 Accurate monitoring of juveniles, sub-adults and adults of both translocated and resident tortoises. \uf0b7\uf020 High survival rate (>80%) and stable body condition of translocated individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 High settlement rate (>50%) of translocated tortoises following initial release and possible resetting-translocation to the release point. \uf0b7\uf020 Evidence of reinforcements, e.g. sexual behaviors between translocated and resident tortoises. Project Summary Feasibility: The Hermann\u2019s tortoise exemplifies the worrying impact of habitat loss in the Mediterranean areas that threatens many endemic species. Thanks to strict protection, wild specimens must be displaced before habitat destruction under the framework of the Avoid-Reduce-Compensate plan (ERC). This strategy aims at ensuring that economical development does not result in any net loss of biodiversity. Rescued specimens collected over time represent excellent candidates for population restoration (i.e. reinforcement translocation). Nevertheless, translocation of reptiles requires robust feedback before being generalized. For example, homing or persistent dispersal may compromise the establishment and the survival of the released tortoises. A project to build a college planned on a site where an isolated population of tortoises prompted ERC mitigation procedures. The SOPTOM was mandated to conduct a rescue operation, and to perform translocations and scientific monitoring of released individuals.

Expectedly, individuals prone to over dispersal may surrender and eventually decide to settle into the targeted area. Implementation: In fall 2015 and spring 2016, tortoises rescued and maintained temporarily in the SOPTOM center were selected. This sample includes four adults (>11 years old), four sub-adults (6 - 11 years old), and five juveniles (3 - 5 years old). To our knowledge, this study is the first to involve the monitoring of young individuals.

The release site was large (>40 ha), located in the historical range of the species but 30 km away from the SOPTOM center and from the native site of tortoises to prevent homing. Habitats were favorable (e.g. mosaic of open and forest patches) while land management was under control. Previous census of the resident host population indicated that density was low (<1 individual/ha), probably due to the impact of recurrent forestry work over years. We hard released individuals in spring 2017, a technique already validated in this species. In addition to the translocated individuals, four resident adults from the host population and six from a nearby control population were also radio-tracked. Each tortoise was located 3 - 5 times per week during 15 months after release enabling us to precisely describe movement patterns, notably the timing and location of settlement. Post-release monitoring \u00a9 Magalie Aferiat 85 Post-release monitoring: Most (85%) of the released individuals did not settle, showing over dispersal and moving beyond that limit of 1 km targeted in this project. Therefore they did not remain within the boundaries of the protected host area. Our previous studies showed that tortoises are more likely to experience mortality during prolonged dispersal, especially when they cross unfavorable habitats or dangerous obstacles. Only two juveniles settled under the 1 km limit the first year. Therefore, we put over-dispersing individuals back to the initial release point. A single resetting-translocation was successful for 50% of the over dispersing tortoises; further resetting-translocations (1 - 2) were successful for 21% more tortoises. Overall, following (1 - 3) resetting-translocations, only ~25% of the released individuals did not settle in the targeted area. After 15 months, high survival rate (100%) and stable body condition of the individuals suggested that translocation procedures were successful. Importantly, this included supposedly highly vulnerable juveniles. Our results show that individuals adapted well to their novel environment, finding enough trophic resources to maintain their body condition within a normal range (i.e. not different compared to resident host tortoises). Resident individuals did not display any sign of perturbation due to the introduction of exogenous individuals.

The river basin extends for 1,123 million km2 covering almost 75% of Venezuela\u2019s territory and nearly 35% of Colombia\u2019s (Seijas, 2011). This crocodile is classified as Critically Endangered (A2bcd; C2a(i)) by the World Conservation Union-IUCN (Balaguera-Reina et al., 2018). As a result of this intense overexploitation, the range of C. intermedius in Venezuela was reduced to a small fraction of its historical extent, and only two ecologically viable sub-populations currently survive in the country: 1) one located in the Capanaparo River in Apure state and, 2) the other in the Sarare-Cojedes River System, Portuguesa and Cojedes states (Seijas, 2011). The captive-breeding of the Orinoco crocodile in Venezuela starting in 1978 with captive adults and achieving the first brood of 15 newborn crocodiles the next year. Since then, 10 breeding facilities have been active in Venezuela, although to this day, only four are operating at minimum capacity due to severe financial constraints. The National Strategy for the Conservation of the Orinoco crocodile in Venezuela and its Action Plan (GECV, 2007) establish comprehensive strategies to achieve the recovery of this Orinoco crocodile 88 species, including regular monitoring, conservation driven research, emphasis about in situ conservation, captive-breeding to reinforce and reintroduce populations and encourage public awareness. Nevertheless, through the last three decades, the only action maintained along the years is the reinforcement of the wild populations with captive-bred young crocodiles, so the present account will be restricted to analyze the results of this population reinforcement. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Reinforce extant wild populations of C. intermedius and reintroduce new ones by releasing captive-bred young crocodiles. \uf0b7\uf020 Enhance the genetic diversity of reinforced populations releasing wild born individuals collected from various localities. \uf0b7\uf020 Increase the annual number of released crocodiles adding the breeding of captive newborn individuals with the collection and rearing (ranching) of wild born hatchlings. \uf0b7\uf020 Train national park rangers, zookeepers, university students and government officers to join the population reinforcement program. \uf0b7\uf020 Integrate national zoos with Orinoco crocodiles in its inventory to the captive-breeding and reinforcement activities. \uf0b7\uf020 Develop tolerance and responsible attitudes of local inhabitants toward crocodiles and explain the ecological importance of the restoration and preservation of this species. Success indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Increased abundance of extant populations of C. intermedius and reintroduce new populations in suitable habitats. \uf0b7\uf020 Good adaptation of released individuals in their new wild localities. \uf0b7\uf020 Increased the number of captive reared young crocodiles released annually. \uf0b7\uf020 Zoos breeding C. intermedius manage to release young to the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 Professionals and students qualified to contribute to the ex situ conservation of the species. \uf0b7\uf020 Reduced killing of crocodiles and nest poaching by local inhabitants.

During the last decade, three locally reintroduced populations have been confirmed (Velasco et al., in press). All of them paradoxically are located in cattle ranches (El Fr\u00edo, El Cedral and Santa Rosa) with no suitable habitat for the development of large crocodile populations, mainly composed by small streams and savanna lagoons without proper reproductive conditions such as deep rivers and sand banks, but with strict protection of its borders. This apparent contradiction clearly reveals that the main factor affecting the success of the reinforcement and reintroductions is the awareness and law enforcement that prevents the unlawful killing of released crocodiles, as happens in Capanaparo and Cojedes rivers. The main concern is that the main populations that throughout the last 30 years were reinforced with thousands of captive-bred 90 individuals are not increasing, although in the case of Capanaparo river a slight increase in nests numbers was detected, perhaps as a result of the release 10 years ago of 30 semi- adult female individuals (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2017). These facts support the reality that the recovery of the Orinoco crocodile in Venezuela will not be achieved only with the reinforcement strategy without the effective protection of wild populations and the conservation of its habitats, as well as strict law enforcement, educational policies and socio-economic alternatives directed to local inhabitants in order to induct tolerant attitudes towards this big predator. Through the years, there has been a sharp decline in the number of breeding centers in Venezuela, from 10 facilities fully operating a decade ago to currently just two. Moreover, these remaining facilities operate with increasing financial constraints, affecting the supply of food, maintenance of infrastructure and logistic needs to perform the releasing activities in remote areas. This state of affairs is mainly due to the lack of financial resources and the fact that the government expropriated cattle ranches where three important facilities were located, which are now inactive or operating at minimum capacity. As the result of these circumstances, form an all-time record of 795 crocodiles released in 2009 is expected a number lower than 100 in 2020. A strategy to improve the efficiency of this ex situ conservation scheme is based on collection of wild born hatchlings in order to rear them during at least one year. Reproductive populations in Capanaparo, Cojedes and Manapire rivers, as well as in El Fr\u00edo and El Cedral ranches, provide the wild hatchlings that will reinforce these and other areas together with crocodiles born from captive parents. The intention is to increase the number of individuals annually released and enhance the genetic variability between physically isolated populations, preventing inbreeding and genetic drift. Regarding to the contribution of national zoos, efforts to motivate administrative and operative personnel to manage their captive Orinoco crocodiles have been ineffective. Since 2005, 11 courses have been carried out as an effort to train people in techniques for in situ and ex situ conservation of Venezuelan crocodiles. Eight courses trained 155 students in biology, veterinary medicine and related fields at the final stage of their careers, which have the intention to pursue professional careers in crocodilian conservation. Four undergraduate thesis on wild Juvenile crocodiles prior to release 91 populations and four in captive breeding resulted from these courses. In addition, three courses were focused to National Park Rangers and Zoo Managers, related with crocodile management and conservation, training 77 people, including National Guard members and government officers.

From the time of the Spanish colony to the present day, there has been a steady population decline due to the consumption of its hatchlings and eggs, but mainly because of the hunting of reproductive females on the nesting beaches (Pritchard & Trebbau, 1984). The Red Book of Venezuelan Wildlife considers it \u201cCritically Endangered\u201d by criteria A2abd (Hern\u00e1ndez & Mar\u00edn, 2008). When in 1800 Alejandro Von Humboldt arrived to the Orinoco region, he found records that between La Urbana and Pararuma, 5,000 oil jars were produced that year, (each jar equivalent to 25 bottles), estimating that 200 eggs were required to produce an oil bottle. So based on the average number of 75 eggs per nest, he projected that during that year at least 330,000 turtle nests were exploited on these islands alone. Based on these figures, Humboldt estimated the presence of at least two million turtles in the Orinoco River. For the year 2019, only 794 nests, were recovered in this same region.

Project Summary In 1989, the Arrau Turtle Wildlife Refuge (RFSTA) was created to protect the main nesting beaches in the Middle Orinoco. From that year until 2018, the Ministry of Environment (MINEC) carried out a conservation program in this refuge with the law enforcing support of the National Guard. It included in situ (transplantation of nests at risk for flood, vigilance of nesting areas, rescue of hatchlings, release of young turtles and population monitoring) and ex situ management (captive rearing of hatchlings for 12 months each year and research on captive growth), additionally to an environmental education program (Hern\u00e1ndez & Mar\u00edn, 2008). By 1992, the MINEC started the captive rearing of wild born hatchlings with the purpose of increasing their survival during the first year of life and then releasing them to reinforce population. Throughout the years at least 15 turtle farms participated in this activity, pioneered by the Foundation for the Development of Physical, Mathematical and Natural Sciences (FUDECI). The first release of young turtles raised in captivity was in 1993 and until 2019, 733,334 captive reared P. expansa yearlings have been released, according to official figures. However, these figures do not fully coincide when comparing different publications and reports prepared by this Ministry and other sources. The vast majority of these turtles Orinoco turtle release 95 (89%) have been released in the middle Orinoco River inside the limits of the Arrau Turtle Wildlife Refuge, but also in other localities, such as two National Parks, two Wildlife Reserves, a Wildlife Refuge, a Biosphere Reserve, a Forest Reserve, several localities of the Orinoco and three cattle ranches. It is estimated that females take between 15 and 28 years to mature (Mogollones, 2005; Hern\u00e1ndez & Esp\u00edn, 2006), so the turtles released at the beginning of the captive-rearing program should already be breeding adults, but so far there has been no evidence of a significant increase in the number of nesting females in the Arrau Turtle Wildlife Refugee, where the number of nests is monitored year after year. It\u2019s expected that their recovery will only be possible after many decades of effective protection to avoid the illegal hunting of nesting females. However, sampling conducted in the years 1998, 2000, 2001 and 2004 showed an increase in the proportion of young females, suggesting that the specimens released in previous years survived and grew up, so every year there is a certain level of recruitment of new specimens of the bigger size classes (Mogollones, 2005). However, the species is relentless hunted by the riverside inhabitants, fisherman and farmers, for consumption and sale. Assessments made in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008 in localities near the Arrau Turtle Wildlife Refuge, determined that of the three species of turtles consumed, P. expansa represented between 72 - 78%, and about 95% of these recorded specimens belonged to individuals in the juvenile and sub-adult classes, indicating that part of these consumed individuals belong to the released specimens raised in captivity (Hern\u00e1ndez & Esp\u00edn, 2003; Pe\u00f1aloza et al., 2013). If this persistent illegal consumption of young and adult specimens continues, the recovery of the population by means of reinforcement is not guaranteed. Currently and since the last two years (2018 and 2019) the Arrau Turtle Wildlife Refuge have very limited personnel presence from the Ministry of Environment (MINEC), so the vigilance and law enforcement are not being carried out and it is assumed that the hunting pressure on the species should be increasing. The monitoring of population abundance and its consumption has not been addressed since 2008, therefore the current state of the population is mainly unknown.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47f80e70-9fba-4715-9422-fe27c0efc042": {"__data__": {"id_": "47f80e70-9fba-4715-9422-fe27c0efc042", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6ed90bf3308eeea8e89874aad4166f8f87d715a9c6e781de629654072a1bf71"}, "2": {"node_id": "6cf2f3dc-6458-4f30-bbb6-39d098ee6ccf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c98ba478579022f86778f23a2303fa4e00f50556bf4d3f28c933f5b449b6ca52"}}, "hash": "d026b7e1801dfa5cd8c2836a85f068bc2eb94b9cf94d2a038c20ffc3fa47f585", "text": "Post-release monitoring of turtles 96 Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 In the last decade, there was an implicit policy from the government to exclude Environmental Civil Society Organizations from this conservation program, but the government itself is not carrying out the functions that these organizations previously accomplished, therefore, an information vacuum has been", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fe272c1e-3123-47e4-a758-10d1d12f85cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "fe272c1e-3123-47e4-a758-10d1d12f85cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0fde69888bfdb3540b7dda60532d6e774f8608a44411ac65ac2ead6dbcdb7b18"}, "3": {"node_id": "2f26a510-1159-4bfa-b083-d8787b8817d4", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c767289c89b7a3df2bbec253e139b6ff91674dc7c3ad72514ee8030898c56b5d"}}, "hash": "831d787ca4d5c6c5513fc11764c47650091b0eade5f43a8d51b7154be5a9a1e7", "text": "created on the current situation of the populations of this species in Venezuela. \uf0b7\uf020 The lack of financial support has been another great difficulty to keep the in situ and ex situ conservation activities for population reinforcement, monitoring and environmental education. \uf0b7\uf020 The absence of environmental vigilance and law enforcement has surely caused an increase in the illegal hunting of turtles of all sizes, as well as the poaching of nests by river communities, so the recovery of the species in Venezuela is not guaranteed.

Both species are rapidly declining (Raine et al., 2017) due to collisions with power lines, light attraction, predation by invasive feral mammals and introduced Barn owls and habitat degradation by feral ungulates and invasive plants. Given the challenges in protecting nesting birds in their rugged, montane habitat, it has long been desirable to create protected populations of both species in more accessible locations.

Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Establish the first fully protected colonies of Hawaiian petrel and Newell\u2019s shearwater to reduce extinction risk for both species. \uf0b7\uf020 Create a predator-free translocation site for Hawaiian petrel and Newell\u2019s shearwater. \uf0b7\uf020 Locate and monitor suitable burrows from which to translocate birds. \uf0b7\uf020 Translocate and rear until fledging up to 100 individuals of each species over a five year period. \uf0b7\uf020 Use social attraction to attract translocated and wild birds to the site. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Proportion of translocated chicks that fledge \u226570% in year one; \u226580% afterwards. \uf0b7\uf020 Wing and mass measurements of translocated chick are larger than those of wild chicks at fledging, indicating good health. \uf0b7\uf020 Proportion of translocated chicks that return to KPNWR is expected to be 15 - 40%, which is the estimated return rates in existing colonies. \uf0b7\uf020 Some wild birds from other colonies also visit the translocation site. \uf0b7\uf020 Number of birds (both translocated and fledged from other sites) that recruit to the new colony is about \u226515% (estimated return rate of existing KPNWR colony) and 33% (rate of survival in unprotected colonies from Greisemer & Holmes, 2011) and by year six. Project Summary Feasibility: Three years of planning and scoping were done prior to commencement of translocation. The translocation protocols were based on methods developed in previous projects and the translocation team visited similar projects in New Zealand to learn translocation, predator exclusion and habitat restoration techniques. From 2012 - 2019, potential source colonies of Newell\u2019s shearwater and Hawaiian petrel were located with visual, auditory, and ground searching methods in montane areas of Kaua`i. The source sites chosen had high call rates, high burrow densities to provide an adequate number of chicks for translocation, and had active predator control operations in place to offset any potential impacts of the monitoring. Finally, several community meetings and multiple government consultations were conducted to keep stakeholders informed on the project and allow the public the opportunity to comment. Implementation: In preparation for the translocation, as well as for the predator exclusion fence, a total of 17 permits or consultations were completed. A complete list of the permits and processes followed can be found in Young et al. (2018). In 2014, a 650 m long predator fence was constructed enclosing 2.8 ha and all mammalian predators were eradicated. Approximately 70% of the fenced 100 area was cleared of non -native vegetation using heavy machinery and herbicide application. A water catchment and irrigation system were installed and over 18,000 native plants of 37 species were out- planted in the restoration area. Fifty artificial burrows were installed in the restored area to house and facilitate the feeding and care of the chicks. From 2015 - 2019, a total of 90 Hawaiian petrel and 67 Newell\u2019s shearwater were translocated from source colonies to the translocation site. Upon arrival at the translocation site, chicks were placed in artificial burrows and hand-fed until they fledged 2 - 6 weeks later. Chicks were fed a mixture of fish, squid, fish oil, and vitamins that was developed by previous successful translocation projects. Morphometric monitoring was done daily to measure chick growth and health and the majority of birds appeared to be in excellent health. All (100%) of Newell\u2019s shearwater survived to fledge over the four years of translocations and 98% of Hawaiian petrel survived to fledge during five years of translocation.

The species is listed as Least Concern by IUCN. However, in the British Isles, the population has become fragmented with less than 500 breeding pairs. Choughs died out on Jersey (117 km2), and the other British Channel Islands, at the turn of the 20th century. Changes in agricultural practices and, to a lesser extent, human persecution (egg collecting) led to their demise. Birds On The Edge, a multi- partner project, was established in 2010 to restore Jersey\u2019s depleted coastland bird populations through management of coastal farmland, and to reintroduce chough, which, as a very visible flagship, will help drive habitat restoration. Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust manages the reintroduction with a captive-breeding program at Jersey Zoo. Paradise Park (Cornwall, UK) provided the donor stock for breeding (which were originally of wild UK origin) and most of the birds used in the release.

Project Summary Feasibility: Red-billed chough are sedentary, very poor dispersers and the likelihood of a natural recolonization on Jersey is remote. Historic population sizes in the Channel Islands are unknown. Their demise was in large part due to the removal of sheep in the 19th century which resulted in bracken invading coastal farmland making their main food, soil and dung invertebrates, inaccessible. Conservation grazing began on the north coast using Manx loaghtan sheep in 2009. Feasibility studies concluded this grazing site was the most suitable for the choughs. Durrell\u2019s conservation experience, and lessons from a chough reintroduction attempt in the UK, informed this restoration. This was the first licensed reintroduction in Jersey. Staff liaised with the States of Jersey and stakeholders. Perceived negative impacts to farmland crops were assuaged following staff consultation. Implementation: Jersey Zoo started captive-breeding in 2010. Soft-releases were conducted between 2013 and 2018; where 43 choughs were reintroduced. Birds were released in eight cohorts of 3 - 8 (mean 5.4) replicating normal family group size. The intention was to release chicks shortly after fledging. Low productivity at Jersey Zoo resulted in Paradise Park having to provide sub-adults (1 - 2 year olds, and a four year old) for the initial release. Subsequent releases used juveniles (<6 months old) (60 - 159 days, mean 103 days). There were no releases in 2017. In 2018, three 1 year old males were released to address the sex ratio imbalance. Jersey Zoo developed artificial incubation and hand-rearing techniques, resulting in eight hand-reared chicks released (58 - 71 days old at release). These birds were held in the release aviary for 15 - 150 days. The aviary was 18 x 8.5 x 3.6 m high, made of semi-circular poly-tunnel hoops covered with nylon netting. At one end a smaller covered area (3.6 x 8.5 x 3.6 m) served as a shelter and service area. The flight was divided in two, with interconnecting doors and hatches, so the birds could be separated if necessary. The birds left and entered the flight via hatches (0.6 x 0.4 m) high up at one end of the flight. They were trained to associate a whistle with food, enabling staff to call birds into the aviary if they need to be re-captured. 105 The birds first bred in the wild in 2015 in buildings within a working quarry <1 km from the release site. The year before, five nest boxes had been installed along the cliffs at the release site. The birds chose not to use them until 2019 when three were occupied; none fledged chicks. An additional two boxes were placed in quarry buildings in 2017 to discourage nesting on machinery. One was used and fledged five chicks from three breeding attempts. The other was not used until 2019 and fledged three chicks. Future efforts will focus on understanding feeding ecology, allowing supplemental feeding to be minimized, shifting the birds from a current mixed diet to a pellet diet, and protection of wild nests. Further release, of unrelated birds may be attempted to increase genetic diversity. Post-release monitoring: Monitoring was undertaken by a Durrell staff member (EC) and volunteers.

In 63% of cases (n = 19) cause of disappearance was unknown. Nesting attempts were monitored. Chicks were ringed at 3 weeks old for those nests that were accessible. Between 2015 and 2019, 18 different pairings, and 36 pair years, produced 36 nesting attempts where eggs are believed to have been laid; 19 (53%) fledged at least one young. In total, 36 young fledged. Excluding chicks hatched in 2019, 70% of the 20 chicks that fledged survived to one year. Clutch size was four (n = 3), and mean brood size at fledging of those fledging young 1.9. In 2019, a chick fledged from a natural nest site 5 km from the release aviary. Once the birds survived their first year at liberty survival is high. From 2015 to 2018, during 95 bird years, annual survival was 93.7%. By July 2019, Staff in field tracking chough \u00a9 Elizabeth Corry 106 Jersey\u2019s chough population was 48, of which 24 were hatched and reared in the wild, including 13 fledged that year. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Limited success with captive breeding at Jersey Zoo meant sub-adults were used in the first year which relied on imported birds. \uf0b7\uf020 The design of the aviary was not optimal for socializing birds imported from the UK, since it was difficult to adequately separate and mix birds. Planning laws and landowner prerequisites meant that the aviary had to be a temporary structure restricted in square footage. The operational design and materials used for the release hatches led to management problems. Salt air corrosion and exposure to adverse weather resulted in regular repairs. The choughs learnt how the hatches operated and avoided entering if staff were present. \uf0b7\uf020 Health and Safety regulations at the working quarry created problems during initial releases. A bird refusing to leave the quarry might be in an inaccessible location for staff to provide supplemental food. In two cases this resulted in death by starvation. \uf0b7\uf020 Birds imported from the UK have always tested positive for Syngamus trachea parasites. Stress levels due to aviary confinement pre-release elevate the problem. Treatment was successful in all cases pre-release. Once released, treatment depends on the ability to recapture an individual. One individual that tested positive, and evaded capture, was predated by a Peregrine falcon. In 2017, all four wild-reared chicks tested positive at or soon after fledging. Two were trapped in the aviary, treated, and survived. Two evaded capture and died. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Greater success is achieved by releasing choughs under six months of age. The one year post-release survival for birds released <1 year old was 25 out of 30 (83%) with the loss of three occurring after living free for more than six months. Survival of birds released at \u22651 year old was 8 out of 13 (63%) with four losses occurring less than three weeks post-release. The oldest bird released, a four year old male, flew away from the group upon release and was never seen again. \uf0b7\uf020 Hand-reared birds, because they do not fear their manager, are easier to look after, are orientated to the release Chough aviary \u00a9 Elizabeth Corry 107 aviary, and act as anchor for the flock at the release site. \uf0b7\uf020 Supplemental feeding supports the population during times of limited wild food availability. The three birds that died of starvation were recently released birds that became stranded in the quarry and could not access supplemental feed. \uf0b7\uf020 Socialization with siblings or other young choughs is important prior to release for them to learn social and foraging skills; individuals reared alone without siblings are more likely to fail in the wild even if parent-reared in captivity.

Globally, it is considered as a Near Threatened and decreasing species, and CITES Appendix I. Andean condor populations have decreased critically in the northern part of their range, while southern populations are healthier, however they are showing signs of retraction. The population in Chile has declined due to persecution and reduction of food resources, except in the southernmost tip of the country, where it may be stable. Central Chile\u2019s Andean condor population is declining due to habitat loss, hunting, and reduction of food resources. This species was classified in Chile as Vulnerable by the Chilean law. However, it is classified nowadays by the Ministry of Environment as Near Threatened, according to the IUCN classification criteria. In addition to its ecological importance as scavenger, the Andean condor has been important to Andean cultures during centuries as a biocultural element. The Chilean Ornithologists Union (UNORCH) manages a Center for Condors and other Birds of Prey, promoting knowledge about these species and their population health, including, among other areas, field research, rehabilitation, captive-breeding, releases and educational work with the communities. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Implement a conservation program including captive management, rescue, rehabilitation and release of Andean condors in Chile. \uf0b7\uf020 Generate useful information for conservation strategies of the Andean condor, by means of casuistic of the cases received in the Center and satellite monitoring after releasing. Andean condor in flight \u00a9 Eduardo Pavez 109 \uf0b7\uf020 Spread a message on nature conservation, by means of explaining to the public the work of rehabilitation and showing release cases of charismatic species, such as the Andean condor. \uf0b7\uf020 Implement an educational program in rural areas, before the condor\u2019s release, in order to change the false image of them being livestock predator.

Project Summary Feasibility: Once dependent on the wild camelids and other large mammal predated by pumas throughout the Andes, the Andean condor is a carrion-eating species that now relies mostly on livestock. In the northern part of its range it is rare and Chile and Argentina host the largest proportion of the world\u2019s population. The Andean condor has an exceptionally low natural mortality and reproductive output, having one of the highest survival rates among birds. Condors may breed every two years or even longer, depending on food supply, having their first fertile egg-laying only over eight years of age. Therefore, any increase in their mortality due to human persecution, may jeopardize the population\u2019s persistence. Among demographic factors of the population regulation of raptors, mortality is probably the most difficult factor to assess because most deaths are not easily detectable. This makes it particularly difficult to accurately assess mortality over large areas and long periods of time. The study of raptors received in rehabilitation centers provides information on mortality issues faced by their population, helping to identify risk factors to which they are exposed. Quantitative assessment of these risk factors might allow managers to improve their Andean condors at release site \u00a9 Caroline Moreno 110 approaches to the conservation of wildlife.

Implementation: In 1991, the Center for Condors and other Birds of Prey began to operate. Statistics of the cases admitted to the Center are an important source of information on the threats that the Andean condor faces currently in Chile. A total of 144 wild Andean condors were admitted in the Center between 1992 - 2019. They were obtained from the following areas of Chile - northern (1), central (112) and southern (31). The sample includes areas with human population density which is contrasting: low in Southern Chile and high in Central Chile. Southern Chile: Most commonly admitted birds were young condors captured by humans shortly after leaving the nest (68%). Some other condors had unspecific trauma and symptoms of starvation and 25% of radiographed birds had ammunition in their bodies. Condors were admitted with no discernible peaks in temporal distribution and there were not cases of poisoning. Central Chile: Most frequent causes of admission were poisonings (52%) and collisions with power lines. There were also cases of starvation, and a few birds were admitted with evident gunshot wounds. Among birds for which X-rays were taken, 72% had ammunition in their bodies, mainly adults, indicating they were shot during their life. Most condors (95%) were found in the wintering period for livestock, when they move to lowlands and, therefore, are more exposed to people and infrastructure. Results point out a strong effect of anthropogenic factors on mortality in central Chile. Condor poisonings in central Chile occur in two contexts. Firstly, birds may ingest poisoned carcasses placed in the field by ranchers, mainly to control feral dogs, particularly during the calving season for cattle. Secondly, condors may be poisoned by ingesting toxic products in landfills. The proportion of adult/non-adult birds received from central Chile was significantly higher than in the south, suggesting therefore, that the causes for admission of condors from central Chile are related to age-independent factors (e.g. poisoning, collisions with power lines and hunting), which tend to affect adults and juveniles equally. In long-lived species, high mortality among adults may result in catastrophic effects, due to its negative effect on reproduction. Condor at release site \u00a9 Francisco Croxatto 111 Post-release monitoring: Twenty- seven condors (36% of total released condors) were equipped with radio telemetry and/or satellite tags, jointly with intense field work, allowing close monitoring of released birds. Two condors with transmitters died shortly after their release (7%), due to poisoning and shooting; one and eight months after being released, respectively. Satellite monitoring allows us to study several important parameters for conservation. For instance, the same individuals use both, Chilean and Argentinean slopes of the Andes, with a home range between 14,169 and 266,624 km2, extending it in summer whereas reducing it in winter and spring. In central Chile, condors occupied higher areas in summer and lower areas in winter, what was probably related to distribution dynamics of extensive livestock. Condors using landfill regularly for feeding have much shorter home range. The wide area where condors move, including Chile and Argentina, reveals the need to coordinate bi-national conservation efforts, and to consider strategies that include large territories with extensive human uses. For this reason, Fundaci\u00f3n Bioandina Argentina and UNORCH work coordinately since 2001.

The species is categorized as Least Concern showing a wide distribution, but the population trend is declining in most of its range due to intensive farming, hunting and egg harvesting. All of these impacts have been identi\ufb01ed as primary limiting factors for Darwin\u2019s rheas (IUCN, 2019). Recently, the northern Patagonia population of this ratite species has been listed in Chile as endangered, due to both the small population size and population fragmentation (MMA, 2018). Internationally, the species is listed in CITES Appendix II. The Darwin\u2019s rhea recovery and conservation program in Patagonia National Park in southern Chile began in 2015, beginning with a remnant population of less than 15 birds that remained in the wild. The long-term objective of this species conservation project has been to ensure the persistence of a viable wild population of rheas in the only protected area of the region. This is the first effort to rewild the species in suitable habitats in Chile, along with the Guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the endemic Darwin\u2019s rhea represents a significant proportion of native animal biomass on the Patagonia steppe. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 To avoid local extinction and reaching a minimum population of 100 mature Darwin's rhea \u00a9 Cristi\u00e1n Saucedo 114 rheas in the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 To double the range distribution of the species in the new National Park. \uf0b7\uf020 To diversify the genetic pool of the local wild population through the addition of individuals from other wild populations. \uf0b7\uf020 To manage and breed a captive rhea population in a wild environment. \uf0b7\uf020 To document social integration and subsequent reproduction of individuals released into the wild. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Wild rhea population surveys have consistently documented a small population of <30 birds (2008 - 2015). Recently, an increase to 45 - 50 birds (2018 - 2019) has been documented. \uf0b7\uf020 Expand the current distribution of rheas in the national park by at least 30% (4,000 ha in total) of their former range. \uf0b7\uf020 Use of at least three geographically distinct rhea populations as genetic sources for breeding and eggs in the management plan. \uf0b7\uf020 Annual breeding success in captivity and employing artificial incubation during four subsequent seasons. \uf0b7\uf020 Release 24 rheas into the wild population as these birds were hatched and raised at the breeding center and maintain an annual mortality rate of <10%.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "47aee48b-378d-4493-a8e5-8dc343133266": {"__data__": {"id_": "47aee48b-378d-4493-a8e5-8dc343133266", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "440f04c567d3d191875e10a1520270690bfe96863b80272bc7bcad53f4fc1f14"}, "2": {"node_id": "2130c2c8-8e21-4704-9ffa-c12eda95da90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8ff29c4c46b8d9c873ac12153f548c2e0793cefd634ddb76376bb55fd304759"}}, "hash": "189052d761f56225086a4c466db22e9b39c98b48f92e0aa2f44fbeb2cb4bbaa7", "text": "Rhea individuals demonstrate social integration from 2016 - 2019 and display reproductive behavior with wild birds (2019). Project Summary Feasibility: The early conservation actions developed focused on converting the traditional land use of the area from a fenced ranch to a proposed national park through the removal of 30,000 domestic sheep and associated dogs and fences which have been historically responsible for population fragmentation. In 2014, the first park wardens were created for rhea monitoring, and to control of threats such as poaching and egg collection. A study of the available rhea habitat for the local area was conducted by experts from the University of Chile who concluded that large tracts of land with suitable rhea habitat remained (Estades, 2013). This provides a unique conservation and recovery opportunity that is enhanced by the proposal for an official designation of the area as a national park by the Chilean government. The local rhea population was also extremely small and isolated. Technical meetings and field work with species experts, Daniel Sarasqueta (Argentina) and Jurgen Rottmann (Chilean Ornithologists Union), were organized to discuss the feasibility of establishing a rhea breeding center. One major difficulty identified was access to adult and mature breeding birds in captivity.

This triggered the Chilean wildlife authority (SAG) to authorize the creation of the breeding center for reintroduction purposes, the first wildlife facility of its kind in the district. In order to maximize the success of the breeding program, a unique special aerial 115 transport of 12 rhea chicks from commercial breeders up north to Patagonia (covering 1,000 km in a single day) was organized by Fauna Andina and Tompkins Conservation. The genetic origin of the chicks was from two Patagonia populations and they were tested for possible diseases by the health authorities. Implementation: One major challenge has been the operation of the breeding facilities in a very remote and isolated mountain area in the park, which is very close to the to the Argentina border and is exposed to severe wind storms and heavy snow. Currently, the program infrastructure is highlighted by three features components: 1) Reproductive pens: 3,000 m2, 2) Management and acclimation pens: 1,400 m2 and 3) Pre-release pens: 72 ha. The first two areas have both perimeter fences and are electrified. They were constructed in rhea habitat. Native vegetation was utilized which allowed an important nutritional contribution for rheas grazing inside the pens, incorporating food-based supplements, pellet food, alfalfa hay, vitamin and mineral intake (Saucedo et al., 2019). Information about the care, management and design of facilities for rheas with commercial purposes were available, but only under controlled conditions to maximize profitability. In this case, we made adaptations for the management of a captive population in a natural harsh environment that is exposed to natural wild predators and we used native rhea food complemented with food pellets. During the first breeding season, artificial incubation and chick adoption by breeding males were attempted by taking advantage of excess eggs that were available. We also identified one wild healthy population of rheas located 300 km north on private land that served as an egg donor and established a partnership with the local land administrator. This type of wildlife management that yields successful results maximizes the chances of adding eggs and subsequent rhea chicks to wild populations. In captivity we decided to evaluate some methods for marking individual rheas, which was not an easy task. We initially used a simple Multi-Loc system and combined that with VHF transmitters fitted on the neck with acceptable results, but with a high rate of losses (Saucedo et al., 2018). The wise involvement and education efforts for neighbors and local communities has been a permanent component since the early days of this initiative. This provided permanent local support by establishing a network of collaborators and partners. Darwin\u2019s rhea at release site 116 Post-release monitoring: Park wardens were established in the area to develop regular patrols employing direct point counts to monitor the local rhea population in the wild. Population counts recorded less than 30 birds for 2008 - 2015, showing an increase to 45 - 50 birds during 2018 - 2019. As a consequence of fence removal and the release of 24 rheas during 2016 - 2018, the area of habitat used by the species increased to 4,000 ha, representing an increase of 30%. All released birds were marked with plastic collars, but less than 10% retained the mark for over three months, which affected the record of detailed individual data. Marking rheas for monitoring purposes represents an ongoing challenge. A new system of neck and leg rings is in place for 2020. After three months in an acclimation enclosure of 72 ha, the released rheas in all cases were able to explore greater distances (3 - 6 km) into new habitats and interact with wild individuals. Potential positive breeding and mating behaviors have also been recorded in the wilds of Chile for first time in August 2019. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Limited access to incorporate adult captive rhea individuals into the breeding program. \uf0b7\uf020 Remote environmental and access conditions which complicate the maintenance of operational infrastructure and optimal size. \uf0b7\uf020 The access to a reliable marking and tracking system for released birds has been especially challenging. \uf0b7\uf020 Unexpected impact of a puma predation event that killed 22 rheas in pre- acclimation pens during the second reproductive season (2018).

Each group is highly territorial, with low dispersal rates between groups. Given the species extensive territorial requirements, ranging from 80 - 200 km2, groups outside of protected areas often span several privately-owned properties, which complicates implementation of census or conservation actions. The species is a savanna and grassland habitat generalist, primarily favoring short grass, open foraging areas, tall roost trees, and a nest (tree cavity, cliff crevice, or earth bank burrow). The species is culturally revered and lives relatively unharmed and in association with human settlements in many parts of its range, moving comfortably through villages and farms. This provides more opportunity for reintroduction sites, if the known threats of electrocution, poisoning, lead toxicosis, trade for rituals, medicine, or aviculture can be mitigated or managed. Socio-political: With the human population increasing in density, affluence and consumption, the conservation status of ground-hornbills can change swiftly at the whim of a new development, fashion, or fad (e.g. the Helmeted hornbill (Rhinoplax vigil), another k-selected species that recently suffered sudden massive population declines as new trade threats emerged). Where known threats can be mitigated and managed, reintroduction of founder groups is the only way of rebuilding populations, and without it, captive populations would be ecologically meaningless. One of the primary ways this is being tackled is through working with traditional leadership structures to strengthen or reignite the profound cultural protection that used to exist for this species across its range. Economic: There is sufficient global support for this program at present to start growing the scale of the reintroduction efforts. All efforts are made to ensure this support continues. The species, when reintroduced offers an ecotourism potential, with weekly tours ongoing for one of the bush-school sites. The species is a top-order predator feeding on rodents and snakes, much to the joy of rural Southern ground-hornbill \u00a9 Heinrich Nel 120 communities, and also forages on agricultural invertebrate pest species which can reduce crop damage. Implementation: The use of redundant, second- hatched, chicks as source stock for reintroductions is viable, supporting the 'insurance' hypothesis in obligate brood reduction. Despite these chicks being artificially reared, they can effectively function as founder and mentor stock, breed successfully, and rear a new generation, provided that behavioral factors are adequately addressed. Their wild harvest has no known negative implications for the dynamics of the wild population, thus granting more experimental leeway than removing individuals from an already small and endangered population. Initial reintroductions have shown that naive stock had a low chance of survival without constant management and that without managing habituation to humans, behaviors of stock birds were too aberrant. To negate this a specialized rearing facility that maximally enhances socialization of rearing stock chicks has been constructed. The use of wild-experienced alpha males to mentor a naive mate and helpers in \u2018bush-schools has been replicated successfully. As a technique for ensuring correct behavior in artificially reared individuals, this best supports complex social learning requirements. All reintroduced birds are released only if a custodianship agreement between the reintroduction project and the landowner is in place. The rearing center can also be used to produce stock, harvested intentionally to fill gaps in the captive global insurance population(s), offset demands for wild ground-hornbills and retain maximum genetic diversity with no further harvest from the wild. Establishment of neighboring groups to the existing 'bush schools' becomes the next challenge as any inherent territorial aggression must be managed. Post-release monitoring: Ground-hornbills are extremely difficult to recapture and so unlike other programs where birds can be recaptured annually, e.g. Californian condors (Gymnogyps californianus), for lead chelation, to replace transmitters, and monitor physical condition, it is not always possible to maintain these levels of monitoring. However, it is only necessary to track a single individual to locate the group to check their daily status. Monitoring has been varied over time but, where possible, a daily visual check is the minimum requirement. Currently, the released birds are not habituated to humans and will not allow a monitor within 100 m of them before they fly away.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d4a5c2f-9c38-4869-a67b-cada17454452": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d4a5c2f-9c38-4869-a67b-cada17454452", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3a293d6bbfd97c0a31506f0c640de53e855820ce3757c096ee494c9549421df1"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f5b6b67-72a7-4721-bdd3-cfb70c92e838", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9f1861f892e413170f90417262c7e7925a70cf2900674422dee0e057ef328b7f"}}, "hash": "a4df638b67f8099c2e2bc5fb0eb9b3400ac7a5ad94e1d487b9c8f7e312e21425", "text": "This increased flight distance made monitoring of these birds for foraging and social behavior DNA sampling on ground hornbills 121 more difficult, but ensures they are unlikely to encounter direct harm from humans (though they are still vulnerable to indirect threats such as poisoning and electrocution).

Reynolds Wildlife Biologist, PO Box 682, Volcano Hawaii 96785, USA drdukmhr@gmail.com Introduction Previously widespread in the Hawaiian Archipelago, Laysan teal (Laysan duck (Anas laysanensis)) went extinct on the main islands approximately 800 years ago primarily due to invasive predators. By 1850, the Laysan teal existed only on two remote atolls; Laysan and Lisianksi Islands. By 1870, a single island population existed. Although these dabbling ducks can fly, today they do not migrate or disperse from Laysan Island, where there are no mammalian predators. The species was listed as state and federally endangered and Critically Endangered by the IUCN because of its small population and restricted range (<4 km2). Laysan teal are vulnerable to anthropogenic and natural disasters, including climate change. To lessen the risk of extinction from random disasters, a population was reintroduced via wild-to-wild translocation from Laysan Island to Midway Atoll in 2004 - 2005, and from Midway to Kure Atoll in 2014 (Reynolds et al., 2008). Both reintroduction sites eradicated invasive rats before the translocations. These reintroductions to additional small low-lying isolated islands (total range now 11 km2) will not eliminate its extinction risks; however, the probability of continued species existence increased since the number of island populations greatly influences a species' extinction likelihood from random catastrophes (Melbourne & Hastings, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "423f2dd6-f30d-480c-8780-53f0084247d6": {"__data__": {"id_": "423f2dd6-f30d-480c-8780-53f0084247d6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "12654ac95ce603f4e5d81579f2511eda6d987eb6f226fabb770ad7f715065324"}, "3": {"node_id": "af74ef61-5b0b-451d-be2c-3c030c764678", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cdbce7b00adaa601d278eb6056071a0d03de44de385d62756f869038100bff1d"}}, "hash": "34637a6d80f77f944512a50b283bf70420c4e0af4e6459edaa5aa78e45d738b1", "text": "Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Provide \u201cinsurance\u201d for the single remaining isolated population. \uf0b7\uf020 Reduce extinction risk by restoring populations to additional islands. \uf0b7\uf020 Restore and increase the range of the species. \uf0b7\uf020 Increase abundance of Laysan teal as potential source birds for future reintroduction to a Duckling brood at Kure Atoll \u00a9 Naomi Worcester - DLNR 124 larger higher elevation island, after invasive predators removals.

Project Summary Feasibility: Prior to reintroduction attempts on other islands with different habitats, research was conducted to determine if the range of resources used on Laysan Island was broad enough to include prey and habitat available on other islands. Translocation feasibility and site assessments were made for all Hawaiian Islands. Next a population viability analysis and a structured decision ranking with the US Fish and Wildlife Service ranked translocation site suitability (USFWS, 2009). The absence of mammalian predators, abundant invertebrate prey, fresh water sources for ducklings, and dense vegetative cover are habitat requirements. Removal of invasive species was recommended prior to translocations, however Midway Atoll was selected as the most suitable site because it met habitat requirements and its protected status as National Wildlife Refuge, and easier logistic access by air for biologists to conduct post-release monitoring. Kure Atoll, a State of Hawaii Wildlife Sanctuary was ranked the third best site for translocation and had prioritized restoration and habitat enhancements for Laysan teal. Lisianski Island was ranked second, but no translocations have been attempted there. Both Kure and Midway Atolls removed Black rats (Rattus rattus) prior to reintroduction of Laysan teal and restored fresh water wetlands and native sedges. Kure Atoll eliminated most weeds and attempted eradication of invasive Big-headed ants (Pheidole megacephala), before the translocation. Challenges included biosecurity and the remoteness of the population on Laysan Island (1,463 km from Honolulu), translocation sites (>1,930 km from Honolulu) and access to remote islands only by Offloading of Laysan teal at Kure Atoll \u00a9 Matt Saunter - DLNR 125 boat. Availability of non- sibling independent juveniles in good condition as candidates for translocation was uncertain as the birds do not breed annually at Laysan Island. On Laysan, we monitored the population size and trend and the breeding success of the source population from March to September to target non-sibling juveniles as candidates for translocation in 2004 - 2005. Midway Atoll and Kure Atolls were ecosystems lacking the large hypersaline lake, fresh water seeps and mudflat wetland ecosystem dominating Laysan Island. Implementation: Thirty juvenile non-sibling ducks were fitted with radio- transmitters on Laysan to facilitate relocation and capture during 2004 and 2005. These young birds could fly and had not formed pair-bonds or attempted to breed on Laysan at the time of translocations. Several adult were also translocated mistakenly. At Midway, 42 founders were released. Translocation from Midway to Kure selected 28 juveniles of different ages from different parts of the atoll to maximize probability of selecting non-siblings for founders. Capture and selection of candidate founders was conducted at night with approximately 8 - 48 hours on islands while the transport ship waited. Parasite treatments (ivermectin) were given to prevent infestation of the nematode Echinuria uncinata, a significant cause of mortality on Laysan Island. Kure candidates were given a single vaccine (Botumink) for avian botulism, a significant cause of mortality on Midway. A soft release was implemented on Midway, and a quick release at Kure Atoll. Post-release monitoring: All birds were given unique color band combinations and Midway founders were fitted radio transmitters.

Recent population sizes were estimated around 600 post fledglings at Midway Atoll indicating a post tsunami recovery after eight years. The Kure Atoll founder cohort (N = 28) had 100% survival 18 months post release but survival dropped 39% during the first botulism outbreak. Today, 10 of 20 founders and a population of 50 - 70 birds persist on Kure Atoll in 2019. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Avian botulism (neurotoxin type C) outbreaks annually at Midway and Kure Atoll due in part to high bird carcass and fly densities. \uf0b7\uf020 Sea level rise, tsunamis, and storm intensity due to climate change threaten all three small populations on low lying islands. \uf0b7\uf020 Management conflicts: Invasive species eradications after, instead of before translocation of Laysan teal at Midway Atoll have caused conflicts. Weeds are used as nesting and foraging habitat by the species and delays occurred replacing habitat (replanting habitat with native vegetation). Next, after herbicide applications, de-vegetation and drought, invasive mice began attacking Laysan albatross. \uf0b7\uf020 Invasive species management conflicts: Mouse eradication using aerial distribution of brodifacoum toxicant is planned at Midway Atoll in 2021. Laysan teal are highly susceptible to primary and secondary poisoning with brodifacoum. A plan proposed by the USFWS indicates up to 200 birds will be captured and held in captivity on the atoll for up to 22 weeks during the toxicant application. The USFWS has allowed take (mortality and injury) of more than 1,000 adult and juvenile endangered Laysan teal at Midway Atoll (USFWS, 2019). Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Wild juvenile birds were adaptive to novel foods and novel habitat; birds translocated as independent juveniles were most likely to breed successfully at translocation site compared to older birds. \uf0b7\uf020 During the feasibility phase, emphatic emphasis on the potential management conflicts with the mangers and their successors if staff turnover is frequent (e.g. weed and mouse eradications to benefit seabirds require extensive and complex mitigation to reduce negative impacts to Laysan teal). \uf0b7\uf020 Implement genetic management as soon as possible while the project has momentum, since the logistic complexity or project apparent success may lower priority to meet minimum number of founder or minimum immigration goals. \uf0b7\uf020 Avian botulism vaccination and subsequent booster vaccination for translocated birds and annual vaccination for new offspring may substantially reduce the mortality. \uf0b7\uf020 Shorter transport and holding times conserved body condition of birds and quick (hard) release was as effective as soft release. 127 \uf0b7\uf020 Sea level rise, severe storms and tsunamis threaten small low lying islands. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Populations reproduce successfully most years with adequate rainfall but survival of adults and juveniles are limited by avian botulism (type C) which may increase with climate change as botulism epizootics are associated with extreme temperatures, droughts and sudden flooding that mobilize spores, create carcasses, and other conditions favorable for toxigenesis. \uf0b7\uf020 Duckling survival is highly variable at Kure Atoll. Poor brood survival is coincident with dry conditions. \uf0b7\uf020 Laysan teal use novel habitats and prey, and during the early post release phase at Midway demonstrated breeding at younger ages and producing larger clutches under ideal habitat conditions and when below carrying capacity. \uf0b7\uf020 Range and numbers of birds were approximately doubled by the reintroductions, genetic management to reduce loss of limited genetic variability is recommended.

The loss of habitat and collection for the pet trade have driven the species\u2019 decline (Chassot & Monge, 2012; Snyder et al., 2000). In Costa Rica, where this effort took place, the macaw is found in the Caribbean lowland rainforest. Of the 40 active nests currently monitored by the Macaw Recovery Network and partners 85% of nests are found in Mountain almond trees (Dipteryx panamensis). This emergent tree is a key food resource but is also highly desired by people for its durable wood and has undergone dramatic declines until it was protected in Costa Rica in the 1980s (Chassot & Monge, 2012). The impact of habitat loss has been compounded by collection of chicks for the pet trade and hunting (Snyder et al., 2000) and consequently the macaw is locally extinct from areas of its natural range despite some remaining areas of suitable habitat. Once such area was the Southern Caribbean Coast (Fraixedas, 2014). Goals Goals and success indicators were not formally or explicitly established prior to project initiation. Retrospectively we can assert the following are relevant. \uf0b7\uf020 Reduce the risk of extinction. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a self- sustaining sub- population. \uf0b7\uf020 Restore a flagship species to inspire conservation awareness.

Project Summary Feasibility: This reintroduction took place on privately owned land within the Gandoca Manzanillo Wildlife Refuge, which protects a total of over 4,856 ha of land. The protected status allows mixed use, including residential development. Large areas of primary and secondary rainforest are found in the reserve and these include mature Mountain almond trees. Conservation awareness in the region is generally high and community members were expected to be receptive to the reintroduction, having lost this species within their lifetimes. No formal biological or socio-cultural study was conducted prior to the reintroduction; however, a separate feasibility study was coincidentally conducted in 2010 using a neighboring reserve as the study area and published after the reintroduction (Fraixedas, 2014). Implementation: Reintroduction candidates were bred in captivity in the San Jose area, from rescued or confiscated individuals that had been illegally collected. Outside of the macaw\u2019s natural range and at an altitude of nearly 1,000 m the breeding center was climatically quite different to the reintroduction site. Great green macaws are known to inhabit higher areas seasonally and this was not an issue. All released birds were ringed (banded) with closed or open stainless steel rings, and disease screening was conducted prior to moving birds to the reintroduction site. The birds were held in the release aviary (approximately: 18 x 6 x 3 m) prior to release and were fed a base diet including seeds, pulses and fruits with wild foods added as available including Mountain almond. The reintroduction took place prior to the author\u2019s involvement and no formal reporting was made, however the following information comes from anecdotes and has been gleaned from various informal articles. It is included here as the project achieved success despite a somewhat Author climbing to nest box \u00a9 Sarah Williams 130 unconventional release methodology. The first 10 birds reintroduced were between 4 - 7 years old, as were additional birds released subsequently. This first cohort included an equal mix of males/ females and parent/hand reared. The individuals were not human fearful and no human aversion training was conducted. They were held at least four months prior to release and then released individually or in pairs at intervals of up to one month. Over the following two years a further 35 birds were released. Released birds were encouraged to use feeders and supplemental food was provided twice daily. Food has ranged from sunflower seeds, fruits and pelleted diets to wild food including readily available non-native Beach almond (Terminalia catappa) nuts gathered by volunteers. Food was not restricted due to some fear from the land owners that the birds would roam near humans and be vulnerable if forced to forage independently beyond the immediate area.

The latter were greatly aided by anecdotal reports from the community, which were encouraged through local media and network. Occasionally birds in distress were reported and in at least 10 cases it was possible for those individuals to be rescued and returned to the site for rehabilitation and re-release. The primary method of monitoring involved observing individuals using the feeder. The availability of food at the reintroduction site presumably reduced any drive to disperse. The released birds continue to use/depend on the feeder although there is an apparent drop in visitation when the Mountain almond trees are fruiting. Whether the offspring will continue to use the supplemental food or forage more widely over time is yet to been seen. monitoring at the feeder presents a challenge. If numbers drop no information is available as to whether individuals have left the area and become independent, or died. Five birds have been confirmed dead with the project being alerted by the local community. Approximately 30 of the original founders continue to use the feeders daily, therefore survival has been high with at least Macaws at a feeder \u00a9 Tom Lewis 131 66% of birds accounted for eight years after reintroduction. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Monitoring of macaws presents a considerable challenge. Survival to one year has some value but really we need longer term tracking. Furthermore not being able to determine the fate of individuals that do not use the feeder leaves many questions. \uf0b7\uf020 Parrots being considered for reintroduction that are not human fearful may have high survival at the reintroduction site. This could be useful as a strategy where an initial flock is established which supports a very-soft reintroduction, but it can also present a range of long-term challenges, particularly with macaws which are long-lived. Challenges include a commitment to that location, as well as the financial burden of staffing and the provision of food for those individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Dependency on feeders will require long-term provision of food. Such management may be acceptable in founders but if their offspring do not gain independence the value of the reintroduction is questionable. \uf0b7\uf020 Private land owner involvement can be valuable but well thought through agreements are necessary prior to project implementation. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 Despite several unconventional approaches this reintroduction achieved some success. The long-term value for the species is yet to be seen. \uf0b7\uf020 Macaws are complex social species and we may need to adjust post- release expectations. Some individuals may never achieve independence however if carefully managed their offspring might and as such those individuals make a contribution to the population. \uf0b7\uf020 A technological solution is needed to enable long term monitoring in order to refine reintroduction methodology. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 The project has established a breeding cohort of Great green macaws in an area where they were previously extinct. \uf0b7\uf020 Current management of the reintroduced birds assures their continued dependence on feeders. \uf0b7\uf020 Feeders have enabled released birds to be productive.

With its huge range the species is considered Least Concern (IUCN) however, numerous local extirpations have occurred, particularly in Central America. In Costa Rica, there remain only two large wild populations (>250) of Scarlet macaws.

Prized for centuries, the Scarlet macaw continues to suffer from the collection of chicks from nests for the international pet trade (Toft & Wright, 2015). Although legal protections were introduced in 2005 which prohibit keeping native species for pets, trade remains a problem and Scarlet macaw populations have not recovered. Prior to reintroduction efforts, only one wild population of 15 macaws remained on the Nicoya Peninsula. Elsewhere on the peninsula they had been extinct for over 60+ years.

Project Summary Feasibility: Following a decrease in the price of beef in the 1980s, extensive land -use change resulted in an increase in forest cover on the Nicoya Peninsula (Calvo-Alvarado et al., 2009). Additionally, private reserves around the village of Punta Islita ensured further available forests, with a degree of protection. It was calculated that there was sufficient habitat to support Scarlet macaw reintroductions, with enough forest cover to provide adequate food for an increasing population. The Scarlet macaw has also shown a capacity to adapt to a somewhat degraded habitat. The secondary forest is lacking some ecological functions, with the most important being the deficiency of mature trees with cavities. However, limited nesting opportunities can be mitigated by providing artificial nest boxes until mature trees develop. Following community outreach and engagement initiative, the Punta Islita community has been shown to value the reintroduction of macaws. Many from the local community are employed by the nearby luxury hotel and are aware of the value the of the macaws as a driver of tourism. Local support for this project is high. Implementation: The Macaw Recovery Network (formerly The Ara Project) acquired Scarlet macaws through rescues and confiscations. These individuals are unsuitable for reintroduction themselves, but are capable of producing healthy offspring. Previous releases in Punta Islita had been conducted using birds bred in the San Jose area prior to the authors\u2019 involvement. However, since then our breeding centre, which holds around 40 Scarlet macaws, has been moved to Punta Islita. Our current approach is to be hands- off when possible, but as we closely monitor breeding pairs we will facilitate parent rearing when it is needed. Fledglings remain with their parents until weaned, then they are housed in large social aviaries and prepared for release. Wild foods are increasingly provided prior to release. Dry forest release site \u00a9 Sam Williams 135 In 2017, we developed and conducted a pre- release assessment of social ability prior to releasing 13 individuals. The results of this pilot study indicated that individuals with poor social skills are less likely to make good release candidates. We conducted a soft release where food was placed on a shelf outside the specially constructed aviary and individuals were able to climb to the shelf or fly from the open aviary as and when they chose. We provided daily supplementary feeding to help support the macaws that gradually decreased from 100% to around 10% of their daily intake. We still provide 10% of their daily dietary requirements at a feeding station. We believe the cohort being reintroduced benefited from the established flock but lack data to confirm this. Post release monitoring: The chicks were ringed with stainless steel rings prior to their fledging, however these do not enable identification of individuals unless in the hand. Individuals were also marked prior to release with a combination of non-toxic nail polish on their beaks and unique patterns cut into their outer tail feathers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da1b90ce-e1fa-42c8-ab55-47f76c49d6e1": {"__data__": {"id_": "da1b90ce-e1fa-42c8-ab55-47f76c49d6e1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6d0f2bbd5233b84656181d1356fb9d4ddd0bb48d1990b4e313ca1033582584d0"}, "2": {"node_id": "0b9055f6-df9a-4437-97e4-e5bab111a7f2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8eaed20dc5bd8d67652c9b414572ac08595e25c816b7199266a45ce20236ec4e"}}, "hash": "c9e7f9054f3967698118f4859ff2de2141c1598b9a1e4c5b657e041e5f6ee7a6", "text": "We conducted on-site observations at the feeding stations, where food is provided twice daily.

In recent decades the global population has declined within remaining habitat due to drought, and a series of catastrophic wildfires (Brown et al., 2009). In 2014, the last remaining population in South Australia was destroyed by wildfire, and subsequently the global population of the species has been restricted to a small number of Victorian reserves. In today\u2019s fragmented landscape, Mallee emu- wren have little capacity to naturally re- colonize recovering habitat following extirpation from individual reserves (Brown et al., 2013). Without management intervention there is a high likelihood that these remaining populations will be lost to successive wildfires (Verdon et al., 2019). Translocation has been identified as a priority conservation strategy for the Mallee emu-wren (Boulton & Lau, 2015). Successful translocations would increase the global population of the species, provide insurance populations", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7418022-a608-429c-8073-141b0a37f321": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7418022-a608-429c-8073-141b0a37f321", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fa3ad12e828c66be171655dad245a75599607f2691bc384b17a73a576768d4b2"}, "3": {"node_id": "005aafdf-24f8-431d-b79a-cca6ac1bbb65", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc9069cd127fdc22bfb33995a41d601cac7f56f1ed4712590bfa4a4970a426ea"}}, "hash": "65b93ec3bbb22eeb059d725acb2498515d719e59a9a53dd0ddd56c8344f575d1", "text": "against the threat of catastrophic wildfire in currently occupied habitat Mallee emu-wren (male) \u00a9 Thomas Hunt 138 and pave the way for larger-scale reintroductions.

Project Summary Feasibility: Mallee emu-wren have adapted to move rapidly through the complex tangle of spines that form a Triodia hummock and are, therefore, adept at avoiding and escaping mist-nets. Rate of capture was a major feasibility concern for the project. How Mallee emu-wren would respond to captivity was also unknown. Alternative capture methods and husbandry protocols were first trialed using the closely related Rufous-crowned emu-wren (Stipiturus ruficeps, IUCN Least Concern). In May 2017, eight birds were captured using a modified throw net technique initially developed by S. Brown, and successfully transported and housed. Due to their small size (~5 g), cryptic nature and complex habitat, leg bands and VHF transmitters presented a risk of entanglement for Mallee emu- wren. Several marking methods were trialed on captive Rufous-crowned emu- wren before a two-color nail-polish marking on the tail tip was selected for a field trial during the first Mallee emu-wren release. As identification proved difficult 139 using this method, two-color epoxy-coated Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme (ABBS) bands were subsequently trialed first in captivity then in the field during the second release. The release site in Ngarkat Conservation Park (NCP) was selected due to the presence of suitable Triodia-heath habitat and because it was formerly occupied by Mallee emu-wren, prior to wildfires in 2006. Western Murray Sunset National Park (MSNP), Hattah-Kulkyne National Park (HKNP) and Nowingi State Forest (NSF) were chosen as suitable source sites due to expected high Mallee emu- wren abundance and road accessibility. Implementation: In 2018, we released 78 wild-sourced Mallee emu-wren in NCP, South Australia. Releases were structured to test the effects of season and familiarity of release group (based on association at capture) on post-release persistence, dispersal and reproductive output. During autumn, Mallee emu-wren aggregate into social groups of up to eight birds and only loosely maintain territories. As spring approaches, groups split into smaller breeding units and territories become more defined. We were concerned that higher dispersal in autumn might reduce the probability that translocated emu-wrens would form a cohesive population.

Post-release monitoring: Translocated Mallee emu- wren were monitored during two distinct phases. First, a team of skilled observers carried out daily area searches during the fortnight immediately following release and recorded the location and identity of all birds encountered. For subsequent monitoring, Mallee emu-wren occupancy was estimated using repeated call-playback surveys at 122 key habitat points, characterized by high Triodia abundance. Occupancy surveys were completed in July and October 2018; and April and August 2019 (two and 12 months after each release). Surveys were also carried out at source and control sites to assess the impact of removing birds for translocation, which will be repeated in the future to track recovery. Mallee emu-wren released in spring were more likely to persist at the release site than those released in autumn and less likely to disperse in the fortnight following release. Amongst groups containing familiar birds, group cohesion remained high and there were fewer dispersive movements of both individuals and groups. However, familiarity of release group did not impact short-term persistence. Birds released in spring were more likely to successfully reproduce in the first breeding season following release than those released in autumn. In total, seven groups were confirmed to have produced either nestlings or fledglings (Hunt et al., 2019), while another three groups exhibited behavior indicative of breeding. Mallee emu- wren occupancy declined following releases and by July 2019, no birds could be detected at the NCP release sites or surrounding habitat. This apparent decline could be attributed to poor detectability, dispersal or stochastic environmental conditions. During the translocation period NCP experienced below-average rainfall and Mallee emu-wren numbers declined in Victorian source populations. Future reintroduction attempts should aim for late winter or spring releases of socially cohesive groups. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Mallee emu-wren weigh ~5 g and are adapted to move rapidly through complex vegetation.

Although listed as \u201cLeast Concern\u201d in the IUCN Red List, the species suffered from dramatic decline in many parts of Europe, including Bulgaria, where it was almost brought to extinction in the 20th century and is now listed as \u201cEndangered\u201d in the national Red Data Book and protected by the National biodiversity law. It is also included in the Bern convention, CITES and Birds Directive. A small colony of the species re-established naturally in late 1970s and since then the number of pairs slowly increased in Eastern Rhodopes, but for decades it was unable to re- colonize other historical areas of the species in other parts of Bulgaria. Thus a plan for local reintroductions was put in motion along five sites in the country. Kresna Gorge in South-western Bulgaria was one of them and the first releases of birds started in 2010. The location was chosen after evaluation of multiple factors - habitats suitability, strategic geographical position, socio-economic and logistical specifics of the area. Meanwhile, the reintroduction activities also started in three more locations in the country along Balkan Mountains. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Establishment of a breeding colony of the species in South-western Bulgaria. \uf0b7\uf020 Establishment of vulture safe area in Kresna Gorge as a stepping stone for migrating vultures from Balkans. \uf0b7\uf020 Providing a \u201cbridge\u201d and linking the existing colonies of the species in eastern Rhodopes, northern Greece Griffon vulture \u00a9 Hristo Peshev 144 and North Macedonia. \uf0b7\uf020 Identification and neutralization of conservation risks for the vultures in the area. \uf0b7\uf020 Boosting the national (Bulgarian) and Balkan Peninsula\u2019s populations of the species. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 A year-round presence of a sufficient group of individuals (8 - 10) of the species. \uf0b7\uf020 A regular presence of migrating birds from other parts of the region. \uf0b7\uf020 A breeding colony producing at least 10 chicks/year established. \uf0b7\uf020 Creating another source colony of Griffon vulture in the Balkans. \uf0b7\uf020 Creating positive attitude for the species in local people and support for conservation and threats\u2019 mitigation measures. Project Summary Feasibility: Widespread in the past, the Griffon vulture was almost extinct in Bulgaria in the 20th century, mainly due to the use of poison baits against large carnivores and birds of prey - an already illegal, but still implemented practice in the country and in many parts of the species distribution areas. After the improvements of the local and the international biodiversity legislation, and the build capacity of conservation experts, an initiative for the species reintroduction in Bulgaria started in 2010. Kresna Gorge was selected for the implementation of the plan, combining data for the historical presence of the species with relatively easy access, suitable nesting conditions, food presence and low levels of disturbance. The gorge is situated along Struma River, between Pirin and Maleshevska mountains and consists of rocky slopes, cliffs, scrublands and pastures. Implementation: The reintroduction activities in Kresna Gorge started with the import of Griffon vultures from Spain and France, which included both rehabilitated wild birds and birds hatched in captivity by the partnering zoological gardens. After the arrival, the vultures spent 1 - 6 months in acclimatization aviary and were released individually or in groups afterwards. The vultures fixing and survival in the reintroduction area was supported by the establishment of feeding station, where carcasses were provided intensively during the whole process. A large system of local contributors, mostly farmers, was made constantly during time, which provided actual information for any dead domestic and farmed animals in the region, which were fast delivered to the vultures by the Fund for Wild Flora and Fauna (FWFF) team. The estimated quantity of food delivered on Griffon vulture release \u00a9 Hristo Peshev 145 the feeding station per year was between 35,000 - 60,000 kgs.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "678fbbed-3707-456c-9fa8-ba2d49a0d925": {"__data__": {"id_": "678fbbed-3707-456c-9fa8-ba2d49a0d925", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a5f2499ae3a1e2a69fd8c0a69ddd2fe1c255f3d596dc0ebf9ede6d554a896b54"}, "2": {"node_id": "406f1357-ae17-42ad-8c4b-20aeaca9254e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0576f9ddd0ba567bed47b8ea580d81d3cbe18a4ce3b3f5d2b126910d3052dddb"}}, "hash": "b680030d86cc64cdf1e6b7dbaa506b11dc9367415406497a9fa11b27b7763a28", "text": "Post-release monitoring: From the beginning of the reintroduction activities, an active year-round monitoring was conducted in the area.

Then few more birds were released in short time, to support the consolidation of a new group by the remaining few individuals and to recreate the colony, but also to intensify the conservation threats monitoring by using of GPS-GSM transmitters, attached to the newly released individuals. Soon, a local group of vultures was re-established, together with other migrating and roaming individuals, and this process led to the recovery of the local colony to such extent, that over 70 individuals, five pairs and three new nests were observed in the beginning of 2020. The monitoring of transmitter-equipped vultures showed very promising results for the success of reintroduction, especially as a tool for early identification and addressing of poisoning incidents all along the Balkan Peninsula - the major threat for the species. Other threats as electrocution were also identified to act on large scale for the species and were locally addressed. Consequently, the number of installed transmitters was increased as much as possible in order to cover and monitor larger areas in the whole region and everyday intensive monitoring was planned. Three more poisoning incidents in other locations were timely detected and addressed using this method and a new concept for local conservation of the griffon vulture was proposed: The so-called vulture safe areas must combine: 1) Concentrated conservation measures against multiple and hardly controlled threats, and 2) Constant presence of as much individuals as possible in the area.

Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 The Griffon vultures despite flying large daily distances tend to concentrate in areas with conspecifics, which at present are only six territories in mainland Balkans. \uf0b7\uf020 Griffon vultures can be concentrated by establishment of well managed and strategically placed feeding sites, situated close to existing or newly created through assistance colonies of the species. \uf0b7\uf020 Concentration of both - conservation measures and vultures in Vulture Safe Aras is a necessary tool to protect this group of species in the Anthropocene. Following the first lesson learned, the birds will spend most of the time in these areas or moving between them. \uf0b7\uf020 New technologies, such as the more affordable and precise GPS-GSM transmitters provide for in time monitoring and addressing of otherwise hidden and hardly controlled threats, such as the wildlife poisoning. \uf0b7\uf020 Establishment of early-warning system for wildlife poisoning and poaching based on intensive GPS-GSM tracking of vultures in marginal populations is an irreplaceable tool. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 The species is constantly present and restored as breeding in the area. \uf0b7\uf020 The local people are aware of the vultures\u2019 importance and support their conservation. \uf0b7\uf020 The Kresna Gorge reintroduction area serves as a \u201cstepping stone\u201d along the migration route of the species and is connecting the colonies in eastern Rhodopes and North Macedonia. \uf0b7\uf020 The Vulture Safe Areas concept based on concentration of conservation efforts and the vultures was established, developed and proven working. \uf0b7\uf020 The early-warning system for wildlife poisoning and poaching based on intensive GPS tracking of vultures was established, developed and proven working.

The Great-billed seed finch (Sporophila maximiliani) has been intensively trapped due to their melodious song. As a consequence, it has experienced a fast and disastrous population decline, becoming one of the most endangered bird species in South America (Ubaid et al., 2018). However, despite its virtual absence in the wild, the species reproduces well in captivity and a large number of captive birds are known. The species is classified as \u2018Endangered\u2019 by IUCN (BirdLife International, 2019) and as \u2018Critically Endangered\u2019 by the Red List of Brazil (MMA, 2018). In 2014 we started a series of studies aiming to implement an unprecedented reintroduction program of Great- billed seed finch in the Brazilian Cerrado. We conducted searches in more than 50 locations in Brazil, accumulating an effort of ~7,000 hours of fieldwork, yet only two small and isolated populations were located and studied. Our results supported the reintroduction program in a private reserve (RPPN Porto Cajueiro) in a Cerrado area of the Minas Gerais state, SE Brazil. This region is part of the Sert\u00e3o Veredas- Perua\u00e7u Mosaic, which houses a set of protected areas in the left bank of the S\u00e3o Francisco River. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Establish genetic, morphological and sanitary protocols for the selection of pure (non-hybrid) specimens appropriate for Great-billed seed finch 149 reintroduction. \uf0b7\uf020 Design appropriate management methods for reintroducing the species, including evaluation of physical and psychological aptness of individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Evaluate the adaptation of reintroduced Great -billed seed finch to the natural environment. \uf0b7\uf020 Establish a free-living reproductive population from individuals born in captivity. \uf0b7\uf020 Contribute to the species downlisting. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Number of individuals surviving in the wild one year post-release. \uf0b7\uf020 Observation of natural feeding, avoidance of natural predators, and behavior similar to the natural populations. \uf0b7\uf020 Number of individuals dispersed, occupying and defending territories. \uf0b7\uf020 Breeding events (nest building and laying) recorded. \uf0b7\uf020 Improved knowledge of the biology and ecology of the species. Project Summary Feasibility: Despite the agricultural expansion and habitat degradation in Cerrado regions, we were able to find some extremely preserved areas in conservation units where the species was extirpated. Habitat availability favors reintroductions, although trapping still stands as the most important threat to the Great-billed seed finch. Therefore, the success of the reintroduction program relies on the selection of a well-preserved place with restricted and controlled access by the people. The selected site for the reintroduction, a private reserve in the state of Minas Gerais (RPPN Porto Cajueiro), fulfills the requirements, thus reducing the chance of trapping.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e2a1e868-30c6-499c-99f6-37981270b9b3": {"__data__": {"id_": "e2a1e868-30c6-499c-99f6-37981270b9b3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Global conservation translocation perspectives : 2021", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "78f5b3dd839e5513f4bc456fe297b4ad34e03a8aea63fa72842f44cf673e165b"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f62f0bf-6780-49b7-b3c2-8645f2ed9456", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.iucn.org/resources/grey-literature/global-conservation-translocation-perspectives-2021", "Author": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Publisher": "International Union for Conservation of Nature", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e8a87487938a3b9daa7847a1829c4c988d4209f347543d079f33529dfd35a659"}}, "hash": "f3c43383c732feb7a36543aed04735f81a7a465833b210a3ac447ac92fd2fc4b", "text": "We estimate the global population of the Great- billed seed finch to be less than 1,000 mature individuals and, in Brazil, it should not reach more than 100 free-living birds. Although on the verge of extinction in the wild, there is a large captive population, accounting for more than 180,000 individuals in cages spread across the country (Machado et al., 2019). Despite this large captive population, we found a great number of hybrids with other taxa, and the use of individuals for conservation purposes depends on rigorous genetic, morphologic, and morphometric protocols, as well as the severe protection of the areas (Machado et al., 2019). Habitat at release site \u00a9 Fl\u00e1vio Kulaif Ubaid 150 Implementation: Since 2018, our team has released 24 Great-billed seed finches (12 pairs) in the RPPN Porto Cajueiro. We have not detected any deaths from the released birds, although some have disappeared. Some birds have dispersed over great distances from the release point, making monitoring logistics unfeasible. Techniques for the reintroduction of passerine birds are poorly developed in the Neotropics, and monitoring individuals which good capacity of dispersion is challenging due to the lack of effective tracking devices compatible with the weight of the birds.

Post-release monitoring: Since the first release, our team has been monitoring the birds almost daily. Monitoring is carried out by biologists and park rangers. Thus, the monitoring protocol involves a combination of standardized and opportunistic methods. The environment occupied by the Great-billed seed finch occurs in a linear way along the paths and is surrounded by a predominant matrix of cerrado stricto sensu. The access to the paths is made by roads that follow a large part of its perimeter, through which biologists access the flooded areas. Each reintroduced bird received one or two rings with a unique color combination, allowing its individualization at a distance with the aid of binoculars. Our greatest indication of the success of the reintroductions and the effectiveness of the management methods adopted, was the verification of a couple's reproductive activity three months after the release. We located two nests with eggs that were unfortunately preyed upon. In general, Great-billed seed finches adapt in a few weeks to the natural environment, recognize the food available naturally and in a short time acquire great flight autonomy. We located birds reintroduced by our project more than 20 km away from the release point, outside the reserve. This proves that birds are naturally dispersed along the paths and can colonize adjacent areas. Major difficulties faced \uf0b7\uf020 Techniques for the reintroduction of passerine birds are poorly developed in the Neotropics, and monitoring individuals which good capacity of dispersion is challenging due to the lack of effective tracking devices compatible with the weight of the birds. \uf0b7\uf020 Reduce nest predation. \uf0b7\uf020 Increase the control of criminal fires in the vicinity of the protected areas. \uf0b7\uf020 Complex bureaucracy and lack of communication and common protocols. \uf0b7\uf020 Funding for long-term studies (>5 years) are hard to obtain in Brazil, compromising the monitoring of birds and the continuity of the project. Major lessons learned \uf0b7\uf020 The major limiting factor for the survival of the Great-billed seed finch in the 151 wild is the illegal trapping, not the availability of suitable habitats. \uf0b7\uf020 Feed supplementation provided continuously post-release facilitated the monitoring and management (when necessary) of the birds. \uf0b7\uf020 We learned that the reintroduction of individuals who are less skittish to human presence facilitated all stages of the program. \uf0b7\uf020 The pre-release pairing of individuals significantly increased the chances of reproduction in the first months after release. \uf0b7\uf020 The use of artificial nests induced laying and facilitated the monitoring of the nests. Success of project Reason(s) for success: \uf0b7\uf020 Rapid adaptation of birds to the natural environment. \uf0b7\uf020 Multiple breeding attempts few months post-released. \uf0b7\uf020 Individuals monitored for more than 1 year. \uf0b7\uf020 The birds performed long distance flights (>2 km), attesting to the effectiveness of pre-release training. \uf0b7\uf020 Establishment of a wild population of the Great-billed seed finch in an area where it has become extinct.

They used to be widely distributed in the wetlands of the Yangzi River basin and Yellow River basin (Cao et al., 1990). Its historical distribution ranged from 18\u00b0N to 45\u00b0N, east of the 110\u00b0E in China. As a result of climate change and expansion of human activities, milu went extinct in the wild (Yang et al., 2003; Cao, 1985). And the last captive population was lost at Nanhaizi, Beijing in 1900 (Cao, 1985; Jones, 1951). Milu was listed on the IUCN Red List as Extinct in the Wild (EW) (IUCN, 2016), and the China Key List-I (Maddison et al., 2012). However, two founder populations, a total of 79 individuals, were reintroduced into Nanhaizi of Beijing and Dafeng City of Jiangsu Province in China from England from 1985 to 1987 (Thouless et al., 1988; Maddison et al., 2012). Even though the exact extinct time of milu in this area was unknown, Poyang Lake, the biggest freshwater lake of China, located in the middle of Yangzi River basin, was the historical distribution area of the species. This project involved a preliminary fenced reintroduction into a wetland park, then releasing to the wilderness, and also involved a continuous monitoring program. It is a milestone in the history of wildlife protection. 153 Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Successfully release individuals into the fenced area of the Poyang Lake National Wetland Park (PLNWP) to have a wild population. \uf0b7\uf020 Raise awareness of milu and wildlife conservation for local residents by eco -tourism and media campaigns. \uf0b7\uf020 A steady population growth of milu in PLNWP. \uf0b7\uf020 Reintroduce a second group into PLNWP after the first one adapts to the habitat and climate, and then release both to the wild. \uf0b7\uf020 The released population adapts to the wild, utilizes suitable habitat, and reproduces. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Successfully reintroduced 10 individuals into PLNWP in 2013, an annual growth rate of 10% or above of this population. \uf0b7\uf020 Reintroduced second group of 30 individuals to PLNWP in 2018. Release them together with the former group to the wild in Poyang Lake wetland area. \uf0b7\uf020 The released population found their adaptive habitat in the wild, fawns were born and survived the flood period with adult individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Protection and propagation of this species nationwide. \uf0b7\uf020 Introduce policies of ecological compensation and try to alleviate human- wildlife conflicts. Project Summary Feasibility: Immediately after National Forestry and Grassland Administration (NFGA) (former named SFA (State Forestry Administration)) proposed reintroduction of milu into Poyang Lake area, the scientists and managers of Beijing Milu Ecological Research Center (BMERC) of Beijing Academy of Science and Technology (BJAST) and Wildlife Protection and Administration Bureau of Jiangxi Province (WPABJP) mobilized experts to make assessment of habitat suitability for milu in 2012. The assessment included wetland plants, water, temperature and topography. The result showed that PLNWP of Jiangxi Province (N 39\u00b046\u203233\u2033, E 116\u00b027\u20324\u2033), located in the southeast of Poyang Lake, with an area of 362.85 km2, including 351.16 km2 wetlands, eligible for the reintroduction project. In addition, the area of Poyang Lake wetlands was, conterminously, 2,698 km2, and located in the hilly and plain area, with an elevation of 30 - 300 m.

The 47 healthy individuals (23 males & 24 females) were released into the wild of Poyang Lake area on 3rd April 2018. For the purpose of raising public\u2019s awareness of milu conservation, the national and local mainstream media had made lots of reports since 2013. Furthermore, right after the population was released to the wild in 2018, an announcement about the release event and protection initiatives were posted on notice-boards in every village and town of Poyang County. To solve the problem of human-wildlife conflict caused by milu, the local government had established an ecological compensation mechanism. In 2018, the loss caused by milu and water birds was given to the victims, 1.5 million to 2 million Yuan (~US$ 216,241 - 288,321) in total. On 3rd January 2019, Forestry Bureau of Jiangxi Province promulgated \u2018Regulation of Compensation Fund for Ecological Benefits of Poyang Lake National Wetland Park\u2019. Post-release monitoring: The reintroduced population was released into the wild at the fenced site and we monitored the released population regularly. In addition, the local wildlife protection department hired nine volunteers to do the job. The patroller consisted of researchers of BMERC, staff from the local wildlife protection department and nine volunteers. There were three dispersal groups. One group migrated northward to the wetland near Douli Mountain in Yaquehu Town one week later and in October 2018, 17 individuals were located there. In December 2018, they migrated to the wetland of Beihu in Yinbaohu Town a short distance away, and 15 individuals (3 males, 9 females & 3 fawns born in 2018) were found here on 11th March 2019. The first fawn born in 2019 of this group was found on 18th April and as of 8th May, four fawns Monitoring Milu at Yinbaohu Town 155 were born in this population. Another group, 11 individuals (4 males & 7 females) came back to the fence zone on the release day, the fence was closed and they were left in the semi-free area. But on 26th September 2018, they escaped from the fence with their three fawns and migrated southwards. The third group migrated southward and nine individuals were found in the wetland of Lianhu Town on 16th May 2018. In July and August of 2018, 11 individuals (10 males & 1 female) and 15 individuals (3 males & 12 females) were seen respectively in the farmland inside the Poyang Lake dam of Shuanggang Town. In August 2018, nine male individuals were found in the wetland of Changshandao of Shuanggang Town. In the same month, nine individuals (1 fawn & 8 males), were spotted in the farmland in Lianhu Town. On 22nd September, 2018, eight individuals (6 females and 2 fawns) were found in Changshandao in Shuanggang Town. Unfortunately, a three year old male individual was found dead in Waxueba village of Lianhu Town on 20th December 2018 and there was no evident injury and a post-mortem could not reveal the definite cause of death. Two male individuals were trapped by fishing nets in Dongtang Town of Yugan County, and Dalianzihu of Lianhu Town of Poyang County, they were rescued by police and patrolling volunteers respectively. Though a male milu was found dead in Shuanggang Town with an antler trapped by an abandoned fishing net on 3rd May 2019. There were five individuals wearing GPS positioning collar in the released population, of which two females lost their collars, and another two had their collars either broken or with no signal. The last collar the signals showed that it had been moving southward along the river to the mountains of Yingtan County since 6th August 2018. But we did not receive any signal after 31st August 2018. Currently the released population dispersed and distributed into four groups, including Beihu in Yinbaohu Town, Changshandao in Shuanggang Town, Hanchihu and Dalianzihu in Lianhu Town.

Project Summary Feasibility: Considering that most of the land in the southern shore of Villarrica Lake has been deforested and urbanized, the conversion of a \u201cfarm\u201d into a reserve on the northern side, with pudu habitat, would create a corridor amongst the few remaining forested lands with public and private properties of good quality habitat. Since social attitude toward pudu is mostly positive, the project could indirectly protect other threatened species (including diverse ecosystems) such as Gui\u00f1as cat / Kodkod cat (Leopardus guigna), Monito del monte (Dromiciops glyroides) and Puma (Puma concolor puma) which are continuously hunted, poisoned and trapped in the area (Vidal, 2014). The reintroduction project not only aims to return the Southern pudu, but also initiate an ex situ / in situ project for one of the most charismatic Chilean temperate forest mammal. This will hopefully eventually increase population numbers via the \u201ccorridor\u201d in the temperate forest of Lake Villarrica ecosystem. Implementation: In 2000, after presenting the project and initiative to the Chilean wildlife authorities, Servicio Agricola y Ganadero (SAG), obtained the legal permit to start a breeding center for Southern pudu and other species such as the Gui\u00f1as cat (Leopardus guigna). Aiming not to capture free roaming animals, the center got focused in individuals that were orphans or had been attacked by dogs. Under the supervision of SAG wildlife officers (Villarrica bureau), the center started receiving wounded animals, for rehabilitation or as a breeders in case they could not be returned to the wild. The first three years were the hardest, since all the previous management experiences with exotic deer, such as Fallow deer (Dama dama) and Red stag (Cervus elaphus), were useless! The team had to understand the importance and effect of \u201cnutrition\u201d and \u201cstress level handling\u201d, plus social structure and behavior for this small deer. After five years of operation, the project was able to rehabilitate about 70% of individuals attacked by Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), and released back 160 to the wild by SAG officers into national parks. The center also had a continuous breeding success, forming several breeding units and groups in separated pens. After about a decade, the project team got a private piece of land donation to start a private reserve. A complex restoration effort started by stopping logging and livestock activities. After removing cows, horses and sheep, the team also initiated a reforestation plan with native species, mostly Nothofagus species. A restoration process controlling exotic species, including Domestic dogs, was also initiated. The team captured (chemical immobilization and darting) pudu and transported all the animals into the reserve, to start the breeding process in one big pen. As a legal framework the project and reserve were registered on the Chilean Environmental Ministry \u201cMinisterio del Medio Ambiente\u201d as a \u201cconservation\u201d and \u201cpreservation\u201d private reserve unit. During the reserve operation, the team detected that the site was being visited by pumas often, thus a capture/radio-collaring and monitoring process began with the permit of SAG to approach and understanding the ecology and behavior of pumas in the proposed reintroduction site.

Their seed stealing-relocation behavior enhance distance and efficiency dispersal of large seeds. They are currently listed on IUCN and Brazilian Red Lists as Least Concern because of their wide range and large populations (Emmons & Reid, 2016). Agoutis indeed thrive in large forested areas, especially in the Amazon, but in small degraded fragments of Atlantic Forest they are absent or scarce (Galetti et al., 2017). Agoutis are not listed on CITES Agouti leaving release pen \u00a9 Peterson de Almeida 164 Appendices and its global population trend is considered stable, but the species is extensively consumed as bushmeat. The species is distributed from Paran\u00e1 to Bahia states in the Atlantic Forest, a severely fragmented and defaunated biodiversity hotspot (Galetti et al., 2017). Tijuca National Park (TNP) is an Atlantic Forest remnant within Rio de Janeiro. The history of habitat loss and dense urban surroundings explain its impoverished fauna and impossibility of unassisted recolonization. In the past, agoutis were locally extinct due to illegal hunting and fragmentation. The species had not been recorded in the Park for at least three decades, despite release efforts during the 1970s. Goals \uf0b7\uf020 Reestablishment of a self-sustaining population. \uf0b7\uf020 Restoration of ecological interactions such as seed dispersal. \uf0b7\uf020 Development of effective translocation techniques. Success Indicators \uf0b7\uf020 Establishment of home ranges by the reintroduced individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Breeding of released individuals. \uf0b7\uf020 Unassisted growth of population. \uf0b7\uf020 Evidence of restoration of ecological interactions. \uf0b7\uf020 Population reaching regulation stage. Project Summary Feasibility: Agoutis are frugivore rodents with a plastic diet, consisting mainly of seeds and pulp. They are seed dispersers, and their seed scatter-hoarding and stealing-relocation behaviors enhance distance and efficiency of large seed dispersal. These generalist habits allow agoutis to persist even in small forest fragments, therefore the species is a good choice for an early stage refaunation programs (Galetti et al., 2017). REFAUNA is a refaunation program (i.e. trophic rewilding, Svenning et al., 2015; Fernandez et al., 2017) that aims to reintroduce several species in the same area to restore lost ecological interactions due to defaunation. Part of TNP\u2019s forest had been cleared in the past and was restored Researchers tracking Agouti \u00a9 Vitor Marigo 165 in the 19th century; today the vegetation is composed of typical Atlantic rain forest trees in different succession stages along with some exotic ones. The agoutis came from two semi- captive populations, most of them from Campo de Santana Municipal Park (with more than 500 agoutis). The animals were then transferred to the local Zoo (RioZoo) facilities for health evaluation. All examinations and quarantine were carried out at RioZoo. Animal reintroduction in an urban protected area in the middle of Brazil\u2019s second largest city provides an interesting opportunity for engaging a wide public on conservation biology. Implementation: We started in 2009 the reintroduction process of D. leporina in TNP as the first stage of REFAUNA program.
