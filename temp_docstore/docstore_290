All countries included in this study have much broader social protection mechanisms in place. These include both non-contributory programmes (which usually target the poorest and most vulnerable groups) and contribution-based mechanisms, such as insurance schemes. The scale of programmes (i.e. whether the programmes are in a pilot phase or fully up-scaled) was not included as a criterion for selection in this research. Programme selection was largely random, subject to available information, but to ensure that each type of programme was represented at least once. Many countries have a variety of social protection programmes in place that have not been covered as a part of this study. These programmes are not necessarily integrated into a comprehensive and coordinated system of social protection, or administratively and operationally linked. This research highlights that, in most countries, social protection programmes are highly fragmented and characterised by poor governance and weak institutional capacity. All of the countries studied are undergoing some form of decentralisation, which clearly influences the degree to which local government is engaged in the delivery of social protection. The more devolution and fiscal decentralisation are evident, the more likely it is that local government will be involved in the implementation of social protection. 9 Mongolia was the exception, where only the child money grant was chosen for review. 10 Among the in-kind transfer schemes there is also a conditional in-kind transfer component, which has been separated out, in addition to the 19 pre-selected ones. This paper focused only on social assistance and non-contributory programmes, which are considered to be the main instruments targeted specifically at the poor and vulnerable, and which are financed from general government revenues. \u201c \u201c 8 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection Local government and social protection: analytical and conceptual issues By exploring the links between social protection and local government this paper aims to bring a new perspective to the debate on social protection. Until now, social protection has largely been dominated by a technical focus on operational aspects. It has been considered a part of the poverty reduction and inclusive growth agenda, rather than as a part of the broader policy sector and integral part of government functions.11 As social protection programmes have been scaled up and consolidated into permanent, often state-driven programmes however, focus has shifted to highlight social protection from a service delivery and governance perspective. This section will discuss some of the key analytical concepts that form the background for this study and provide the structure for this paper. 2.1 Local government, local governance and decentralisation \u2018Local government,\u2019 refers to a specific set of institutions or entities, created through a legal or constitutional act, to deliver a range of specified services within a defined subnational jurisdiction.12 \u2018Local governance,\u2019 on the other hand, is a broader concept that can be defined as \u201cthe way government and other social organizations interact, how they relate to citizens, and how decisions are taken.\u201d13 This encompasses interactions between local and other government hierarchies in the formulation and execution of policies and informal norms and regulations. It also refers to interactions with non-state institutions, community organizations and networks aimed at increasing citizen participation.14 Local-level actors include civil society organizations (CSOs), community-based organizations (CBOs) and non-state actors that take on various roles and responsibilities that shape local affairs. Non-state actors, including the media, religious organisations and CBOs, provide basic social services and complement state development efforts. Non-state actors may not have a formally recognized role, but are critical local stakeholders that wield significant influence. \u2018Decentralisation,\u2019 is a process through which government functions, powers, and finances are redistributed to lower levels of government. It is considered key to improving governance, and as such has been a major feature of governance reforms over the last two decades. Decentralisation and local government are important to sustained poverty reduction efforts, economic development and improved service delivery \u2013 especially to the most vulnerable and marginalized.15 Decentralisation brings services closer to the people and has the potential to increase citizen participation in prioritising services and the way they are delivered. In principle, this has the potential to improve overall accountability and give greater voice to the users of services, including the poor and vulnerable. Conventionally three types of decentralisation are distinguished: \u2022 \u2018Administrative decentralisation,\u2019 describes the transfer of authority, resources and responsibilities from central government to local agents or semi-autonomous bodies. Administrative decentralisation has three major forms. \u2018Deconcentration,\u2019 often considered to be the weakest form of decentralisation, is the redistribution of decision-making authority, financial and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b7183cc-6b8f-4d5e-83ac-ac305d7f7fe2": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b7183cc-6b8f-4d5e-83ac-ac305d7f7fe2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8909c2091f6cf3bd6554554bfd7a3332e149e9d6bdfb2bbf4abf58961b3ed27"}, "3": {"node_id": "63cd310e-0b79-4dde-8203-f212d15960d9", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "66ed0d809b2c9cb5f3e1ccd92de6975b20dd434e82f223e7572603e4457c9370"}}, "hash": "fb79b944c6204437445d90d5cf1a2ef00981c80625876b6eb2c5f440bb15c983", "text": "management responsibilities among different levels of the central government. \u2018Delegation,\u2019 is another form of 11 World Bank, \u201cPoverty Assessment for Bangladesh,\u201d World Bank (2008): http://siteresources.worldbank.org/BANGLADESHEXTN/ Resources/295759-1240185591585/BanglaPD.pdf; World Bank, Local Governance in Developing Countries.

Lastly, \u2018devolution,\u2019 is seen as a transfer of authority for decision-making, finance and management to local government. \u2022 \u2018Political decentralisation,\u2019 describes the transfer of power to a locally elected body with some degree of autonomy and some revenue raising power. Administrative devolution underlies most political decentralisation and is normally followed by fiscal decentralisation. Political decentralisation is usually based on a constitutional, legal and regulatory framework in order to ensure accountability and transparency. \u2022 \u2018Fiscal decentralisation,\u2019 describes intergovernmental fiscal transfers, the transfer of tax and revenue raising powers to lower levels of government and the transfer of decision-making powers in terms of how such fiscal resources are used. It underpins administrative and political decentralisation processes, enabling local government to play its role. Effective fiscal decentralisation is vital for any decentralisation process to be successful.16 The distinction is not always clear-cut, with varying levels of local decision-making and central control, varying degrees of upward and downward accountability, and varying ranges of functions and resource transfers. This is also the case in the countries under review, where parallel systems of devolution, delegation and deconcentration co-exist, often leading to tensions. The decentralisation process in Indonesia, for example, has not been accompanied by a re-organisation of administrative tasks, leading to unclear mandates and functions and overlaps between central and local government.17 Decentralisation and governance reform processes are driven by the specific country context, as is local government\u2019s role in the delivery of social protection programmes. In order to better understand current governance challenges, it is therefore important to examine the historical and political processes that have been or are driving local government and decentralisation processes. Most of the countries included in this study have historically been characterised by a highly centralised political system and state administration, where local government either did not exist or never developed any real political or fiscal autonomy, beyond carrying out some limited administrative functions. This path dependency18 heavily influences the way decentralisation processes evolve; despite decentralisation reforms, many government institutions may continue to plan and implement in a centralised manner. This continued top-down approach to policy making, despite more decentralised policy settings, is also due to deeply entrenched institutional cultures and practices, or what political scientists term the \u201cinstitutional fit,\u201d19 which has been shaped for a long time by centralised policy making processes. This organizational culture is hard to change and may make it difficult to implement programmes or policies that run counter to such practice in the long run.20 In most of the countries included in this study, decentralisation or re-decentralisation reforms (for example in Bangladesh and Lao PDR) started recently. Their introduction has sometimes followed profound political crisis, violent conflict and war (for example, in Nepal, Cambodia, Timor-Leste). While this has translated into a high degree of political commitment towards decentralisation in some countries (such as Indonesia and Nepal), in others (such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Mongolia) the political economy does not provide real incentives for major political stakeholders to accelerate decentralisation processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "63cd310e-0b79-4dde-8203-f212d15960d9": {"__data__": {"id_": "63cd310e-0b79-4dde-8203-f212d15960d9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a8909c2091f6cf3bd6554554bfd7a3332e149e9d6bdfb2bbf4abf58961b3ed27"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b7183cc-6b8f-4d5e-83ac-ac305d7f7fe2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fb79b944c6204437445d90d5cf1a2ef00981c80625876b6eb2c5f440bb15c983"}}, "hash": "66ed0d809b2c9cb5f3e1ccd92de6975b20dd434e82f223e7572603e4457c9370", "text": "Decentralisation efforts are perceived by some as an important means of power-sharing between economically, socially, ethnically, religiously or otherwise different regions and provinces.

Although improved service delivery is a major reason to embark on decentralisation in most countries, it is also a highly politicized process and fiercely contested by a variety of stakeholders with often contradictory interests. Weak political commitment to effectively implement decentralisation processes is a common feature in many countries, often bringing them to a complete halt. 2.2 Social protection and local government Social protection broadly consists of the mechanisms and instruments that allow people to cope with social and economic risks and vulnerability. These mechanisms include individual and collective savings arrangements, private and public (social) insurance schemes, redistributive tax-based mechanisms, as well as family and community-based schemes.22 Non-contributory social transfers are the main social protection instruments financed from general government revenues that are targeted specifically at the poor and vulnerable. They include: unconditional cash transfers (such as old age pensions and disability allowances); conditional cash transfers (such as education grants); in- kind transfers (such as school-based food programmes and health vouchers); and public works programmes. Unlike insurance-based programmes \u2013 which are usually managed by specific institutions and organizations (such as insurance funds) \u2013 the public sector plays a key role in the delivery of these non-contributory schemes. The framework of the current analysis is informed by this notion of social protection as part of a broader set of public services provided by the state or non-state actors. This framework considers how social protection programmes are implemented through a set of service delivery functions and sub-functions, which may be assigned to different institutions and stakeholders at various levels of government, including, but not limited to local government. Issues of accountability, clear functional assignments, mandates and sustainable financing are important prerequisites for the effective delivery of most social services. Issues of coordination and public information are of particular importance for the delivery of social protection programmes. This is especially the case for social protection programmes that require complex institutional and operational arrangements due to their nature and objectives, for example, conditional cash transfers or public works programmes which link both demand and supply side issues. 21 Nick Devas and Simon Delay, \u201cLocal Democracy and Challenges in Decentralising the State: An International Perspective,\u201d; Faguet, \u201cDecentralisation\u2019s Effects on Public Investment Evidence and Policy Lessons from Bolivia and Colombia,\u201d; Scott and Alam, Resource Guide on Decentralisation and Local Government.

It is important to note when referring to this framework that service delivery functions and sub-functions can be, and usually are, assigned to different institutions or actors \u2013 central government, local government, local line departments, civil society, and the private sector. Decisions on the assignment of such functions can be made in an ad hoc way, or based on rigorous assessment of the comparative advantages of each institution or actor. The various functions are interrelated, and together enable social protection programmes to be delivered successfully. Where one function is not undertaken or is poorly managed, 3 12 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection the effectiveness of other functions will be compromised and the overall delivery will be impeded. For example, inconsistent or unclear definitions of beneficiaries within upstream regulatory functions may compromise the effectiveness of frontline functions (such as targeting). Looking at the service delivery functions required for social protection programmes and the assignment of roles and responsibilities, it is useful to draw on current thinking on the assignment of functions and responsibilities in intergovernmental systems: the finance and development of policies and regulatory frameworks, or upstream functions,23 are best assigned to central government; evidence suggests that local government is better suited to implement and deliver social services.24 Evidence from the country studies largely confirms this picture, local government plays an important frontline role in the administration and management of social protection programmes, but is much less involved in design, policy, planning and finance. The major exception to this is Indonesia, where local government has broad political and fiscal autonomy which allows district governors and mayors to develop and design local social protection programmes, in addition to, and complementary to national ones.25 \u2018Unbundling,\u2019 the functions and sub-functions associated with social protection programmes makes it easier to understand the role that non-state actors often play in the delivery of social protection at the local level, particularly where the public sector may have limited capacity to do so. In some countries, private companies may also enter in a public-private partnership with the government to provide complementary services. The best example of this is when private financial service providers play a role in the delivery of cash transfer payments. In Nepal, for example, the government has entered into a contractual arrangement with a private Nepali bank, to test branchless banking solutions, for the delivery of the cash transfers of an educational grant pilot programme. Other examples include: Cambodia, where the World Food Programme (WFP) is piloting a conditional education grant which uses a private provider to deliver payments; and Bangladesh, where the Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets (REOPA) programme uses Union Information Centres (UIPs) through which people can access e-services, which include on-line applications for certain social allowances. \u2018Informal\u2019 or \u2018traditional\u2019 authorities and civil society or CBOs are another set of non-state stakeholders involved in the provision of social protection services. Such institutions fill gaps and bridge functions, especially where local government fails to carry out specific operational functions due to limited capacity or geographic challenges. Informal institutions and civil society groups act as important multipliers with regard to sensitization (for example, in Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Lao PDR) and are involved in: targeting processes (for example, in Timor-Leste, Bangladesh, Lao PDR, Nepal); monitoring (school food programmes, voucher programmes, conditional cash transfers); and service delivery (for example, in Bangladesh, Nepal and Timor-Leste). Donors, national and international NGOs also play an important role for social protection programmes at the local level. They are often closely involved in programme delivery, and manage functions and support local government with technical know-how on monitoring and evaluation, procurement in food programmes or the management of health voucher programmes (for example, WFP in Lao PDR and Cambodia and the Swiss Red Cross in Lao PDR). 23 UNDP,UNCDF, Local Government and Social Protection.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3910b5fa-ca0d-4d9d-bd9c-f61cc52d363c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3910b5fa-ca0d-4d9d-bd9c-f61cc52d363c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "76d8fc5ec970b0199f303b4396eb9abc312e6f3a90628d06f9aca88a19749294"}, "2": {"node_id": "04e527ab-52b8-4610-a519-0f342c6efcff", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e9507eefff27db94d8f803de77cbdfe5846c7bfadc4fcb72b8ad6e61e79abd96"}}, "hash": "97164da7e7e0d3b3a34da37731b16f81c75854c8d9acde107ea798e8e5d13d31", "text": "23 UNDP,UNCDF, Local Government and Social Protection. 24 Scott and Alam, Resource Guide on Decentralisation and Local Government.

In the literature there is a division between \u201cmiddle-range functions\u201d and \u201cproximate functions\u201d in reference to functions that are best kept with a higher local government tier, for example, monitoring socialization and communication, and functions that require close proximity to potential beneficiaries that should be delegated to the lowest government tier and local authorities. 25 There is little documentation on these programmes. To ensure that programmes at subnational level adhere to minimum standards, with regard transfer size, quality of services, etc., \u2018national blueprints\u2019 for social protection can provide a set of minimum requirements for different programme types. Local government may also top-up transfers of national programmes, in order to increase the share that can be distributed at local level. This is the case with the in-kind transfer programme RASKIN. Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 13 In the long run, the responsibility for the delivery and finance of social protection programmes should be taken over by government, to ensure sustainability. However, in many countries non-state actors will remain a key partner in service delivery for some years to come. The key challenge will be to coordinate implementation between various levels of government and the non-state actors, in terms of management, monitoring and accountability. It is important to ensure that high quality services are provided consistently, on a countrywide basis, and that services do not become sub-standard when delivered by one actor, rather than another. However, the degree to which non-state actors decide to involve local government in programmes, is driven by efficiency criteria related to the capacity of local government - issues of accountability, political structures and institutions all impact on the decision to engage with government. In countries where corruption and political influence are perceived as a threat to programme outcomes, the choice to limit government involvement is stronger. 3.2 Local government functions in social protection In the countries covered by this study, the administrative and management tasks delegated to local government mainly concern frontline service delivery functions: 1. sensitization and awareness raising 2. identifying vulnerable groups (targeting) 3. delivering benefits 4. monitoring and reporting 5. managing grievance and redress mechanisms 6. coordination (of services across sectors) The extent to which local government fulfils these functions, and does so effectively, varies greatly from country to country. This section provides a more detailed overview of the frontline delivery functions most commonly carried out by local government, and an assessment of delivery performance. While most of these are general functions of local government \u2013 important for the delivery of public services in general \u2013 some are more specific to social protection programmes, such as payments, coordination and targeting. 3.2.1 Sensitization and awareness raising \u201cThe extent to which potential beneficiaries are informed and politically engaged to make demands on political representatives is likely to determine how responsive they are to the poor and vulnerable.\u201d26 Sensitization and public information are required to increase downward accountability. This is of specific importance in countries where other downward accountability mechanisms, such as local elections, are not in place or have not taken place for a long time (as in Lao PDR, Nepal, and Timor-Leste).27 Local governments, because of their close proximity to potential recipients of social protection benefits, can play an important role, they raise awareness of and disseminate information on programme contents, including access criteria, size of transfers or the next out-payment. As it is the level of government that provides the closest connection between citizens and the public sector, it is theoretically well placed to act as a conduit to provide people with information about social 26 BRAC, Small Scale Old Age and Widow Allowance for the Poor in Rural Bangladesh: An Evaluation (Dhaka: BRAC, 2008).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4787587e-af57-4bc1-a78c-2fc25941d250": {"__data__": {"id_": "4787587e-af57-4bc1-a78c-2fc25941d250", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a4e1d324fe85777fb4e7cd8358010e58a98380df9916074aad2da09317c7003d"}, "2": {"node_id": "15c41e83-d4ca-4c98-8a07-cdafb8ecc19f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9a12bb6ce8c59c041ec54bc0cb0718c0177fb76ea54b3aa09a503515ad896d27"}}, "hash": "0a79dc143cc6a3dfc93f9d8e8f1770345d1b190c85e8cceb6fde6a8f993ee0b8", "text": "27 In this context, non-government actors, such as NGOs and CSOs, such as health or school committees, religious associations, sport clubs and cultural associations might be particularly apt to take a prominent role to disseminate information.

Evidence from this study shows that weak sensitization and communications approaches are major challenges. Communication strategies are often developed at the central government level and do not take into account local realities or involve actors at the local level (see for example, Box 3.1). Capacity to disseminate information is a problem, particularly in large geographical jurisdictions where local government staffing is often too low to reach out to the whole territory. There is often a lack of training and sensitization measures for local government officials, NGOs or civil society. Added to this, training materials are often written in a style that is difficult for non-expert local government officials and beneficiaries to understand, and many countries do not have information material written in the local languages of minority groups, who are often among the poorest. Box 3.1 Temporary cash transfer in Indonesia The Bantuan Tunai Langsung (BLT) programme was designed as a temporary unconditional cash transfer for poor households in order to cope with unprecedented price hikes. As of 2008, it had reached around 18.5 million households. The programme has been shown to have had a positive impact on the expenditure pattern of recipients\u2019 households, leading to greater health, education and labour outcomes. The programme design and implementation however, did not take into account governance challenges, including issues of targeting and sensitization at the local level. There was very limited communications between key relevant stakeholders at the national and local levels. Furthermore, a lack of community involvement in the design of the programme resulted in high inclusion and exclusion errors, which led to community-wide tensions, allegations of corruption and protests. The lack of a complaint monitoring, management information systems and social audits made it difficult to improve the programme between 2005 and 2008. The demand for information should come from citizens and civil society. Where the capacity and awareness of citizens to do this is limited, civil society, including the media, have an important role to play in supporting citizens to be more vocal about their demands. This can trigger the government to be more accountable, and the demand for information is an important accountability mechanism for awareness raising and sensitization of social protection programmes. A lack of information also poses challenges on the supply side. In many developing countries, government officials often have limited knowledge of how programmes are expected to operate. This makes it difficult for beneficiaries to access or apply for social protection programmes. This slows down operational processes significantly and excludes eligible beneficiaries. Impact assessments reviewed for this paper, note that beneficiaries often receive false or incomplete information, which forces them to return several times in order to access social protection benefits. For example, civil servants involved in the administration of Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) in Indonesia were unaware that beneficiaries eligible for one programme were also eligible for other social assistance schemes; this effectively excluded beneficiaries from accessing full social protection entitlements. Gaps in information also impact grievance and redress mechanisms \u2013 to the extent that beneficiaries and even local government officials are often not aware of their existence. The dissemination of information is an inherently political process and serves an important gatekeeping function. This is of particular importance with regard to social protection programmes. For fear of draining public funds or jeopardizing social cohesion, governments may choose to limit information, as evidence from Indonesia or Lao PDR suggests. Existing media may not always be able to provide people and scattered communities in remote or mountainous areas with access to information. Moreover, poor people usually have less access to radios and televisions than non-poor people (for example, in Bangladesh). At the same time, access to new communications technologies, such as mobile phones, may not be sufficiently widespread to expand Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 15 overall outreach. For example, most programmes do not utilize mobile phones to communicate the date and time for the next out-payments or health check-ups . 3.2.2 Identifying vulnerable groups (targeting) Local government plays a vital role in targeting and identifying beneficiaries for social protection. By virtue of their proximity and access to local knowledge, local governments are better placed than central agencies to identify beneficiaries, and can do so at a lower cost and with more accountability.28 Where information and data on poverty and other social indicators is limited at the subnational and local levels, local government stakeholders \u2013 that know their constituencies well \u2013 provide an important additional filter for selection to complement household surveys, means-tests and geographic targeting exercises. In numerous social protection programmes, district, sub-district level and traditional authorities identify potential beneficiaries.

For example, in Nepal, Village Development Committees identify old age pensioners and people with disabilities; a similar approach is taken in Bangladesh. In addition, school teachers, health workers, local school or health committees are often involved in targeting. In Lao PDR, nurses and other health personnel, together with local health committees, identify pregnant and breast-feeding mothers for the maternal health voucher programme. For public works programmes, local government may identify local infrastructure priorities and identify vulnerable people in the community who should be given priority for employment (See Box 3.2). Systems need to be put in place to ensure that decision-makers charged with identifying beneficiaries do not falsify information, to ensure that decisions are transparent and based on actual scenarios. Box 3.2 Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets (REOPA) programme in Bangladesh The REOPA public works programme employed 24,444 destitute, widowed and abandoned women,to maintain earthen roads, over a two-year tenure under a government social safety net programme. The programmes aim was to improve and sustain socio-economic conditions and food security. 30 percent of wages were kept as mandatory savings, to be used post-employment as a cushion, to protect basic levels of consumption and to invest in micro-enterprises. Impact assessments have shown that the cash transfer during employment was sufficiently high to allow for ample savings to be set aside for productive investments. Habits of saving and investment were also encouraged through a system of rotating inter-lending. The local government played a critical role in the implementation of REOPA. At the local level, the programme was implemented by Union Parishads (councils), the lowest tier of local government, with line ministry service departments involved at sub-district level. In addition, the local government played a significant role in identifying local infrastructure priorities and selecting beneficiaries. Furthermore, local NGOs assisted the local government to increase community participation and enhance targeting processes, monitoring and oversight. Nevertheless, the local government still had limited institutional capacity, especially to improve pro-poor and gender-sensitive approaches to REOPA. Critical limitations such as a lack of human resources and accountability remained the key challenges. Local government is also responsible for the collection of information, which is essential for targeting processes. The registration of vital events such as births and deaths is a common function of local government in many countries. While it supports the targeting of social protection programmes, it is also essential for planning and resource allocation for other public services, such as health or education. Moreover, vital registration is important for monitoring, for example, to ensure that deceased people are 28 UNDP,UNCDF, Local Government and Social Protection. 29 In each village, villagers select trusted and qualified representatives to form the Village Representative Groups (VRGs), who receive training. The latter starts the selection process using a standardized IDPoor Questionnaire . Before being submitted to the community council for further endorsement, the list of selected beneficiaries is discussed with the village and revised if necessary. A final list, which still can be modified based on individual complaints, is then entered in the unified MIS scheme. Following the verification process, an IDPoor Card is issued, which allows access to a range of programmes, including free access to health care, the social land concession programmes, free access to agricultural input subsidies. 16 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection taken off the recipient list of pension schemes. In several countries local governments are involved in the collection of poverty and other socio-economic data. This is vital to social protection targeting processes and planning at the local level, and also informs central development planning. In Timor-Leste for example, village development committees are trained to prepare simple reports that provide data on the socio- economic situation and development constraints of a village. This information is used for planning purposes at a higher government level. In many countries, targeting processes for social protection programmes are firmly integrated into the local patronage system. Local government institutions or traditional authorities responsible for targeting may develop their own targeting criteria based on kinship or other traditional patron-client relations, rather than following criteria based on needs or social and economic vulnerabilities. This is of particular relevance for marginalized groups, such as women, migrant workers, orphans, old people, people with disabilities or low caste groups who suffer the most from such exclusionary practices (see, for example, the Beras untuk Rumah Tangga Miskin (RASKIN) rice subsidy programme in Indonesia, or the old age pension scheme in Bangladesh outlined in Box 3.3).30 In order", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0fa1d04f-7383-4d7d-8dde-ddce4617df37": {"__data__": {"id_": "0fa1d04f-7383-4d7d-8dde-ddce4617df37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19f613b8902744bee87dec1f4099d2ca3a48fe74919579a31399ca8d21e80eda"}, "3": {"node_id": "ff708b27-c92f-4b94-b8e8-1131315a8238", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1c4690dc254a32d3c13980afe5faa391293fc9b44a6e1c12789d0b8e1ca981e4"}}, "hash": "32c28543dab8edb7f22cfbe4dc087d0b89a6fc6589bbf20ecdbbf1e29eec0cdc", "text": "to counter elite-capture, some programmes establish additional or alternative (self-) targeting mechanisms to avoid established institutional structures, which are often heavily influenced by party politics. The Bolsa Da Mae programme in Timor-Leste has, for example, introduced the possibility of self-application via NGOs and civil society organizations after complaints from potential beneficiaries of nepotism and clientelism. Box 3.3 Old age pension and assistance programme for vulnerable women in Bangladesh The programme reaches around 5.3 million pensioners aged 65 and above, and around 360,000 vulnerable and abandoned women, including elderly, disabled and incapacitated women. Its\u2019 aim is to increase consumption and food security. The programme has had an impact on the size of income of individual beneficiaries, which has in turn resulted in increased food intake and use of health care facilities. Some beneficiaries have re-invested part of the money into income-generating activities. The programme also increased the social position of the persons involved and increased their dignity. Targeting and selection processes in this programme are highly decentralised and built upon local knowledge and community discretion. While this is considered an efficient way of targeting, incidences of elite capture, nepotism and leakage are frequent, as targeting and distribution processes are firmly embedded in local patronage systems. There are at times, problems associated with individuals who are charged with identifying vulnerable groups. There have been examples of levying so-called \u2018programme entry fees\u2019 (which are sometimes deducted from benefit payments to recipients), registering ghost workers in cash for work programmes or pocketing pension payments for people who have long been dead. Beneficiaries are often either unaware of these types of leaks or see them as being \u2018normal\u2019.31 Much of this is because beneficiaries have little basic knowledge about social protection programmes, which makes it difficult for them (and others) to monitor and control illicit programme practices or to lodge complaints. 30 World Bank, \u201cRaskin subsidized rice delivery.

By virtue of their proximity and access to local knowledge, local governments are better placed than central agencies to identify beneficiaries, and can do so at a lower cost and with more accountability. \u201c \u201c Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 17 It is therefore crucial for the effective delivery of social protection programmes, to make a management information system available, as it allows all stakeholders to better monitor operational processes. In many countries, this is difficult as information is collected and filed manually, which makes processing lengthy. However, some countries are developing electronically-based and comprehensive management information systems. This will allow relevant data sets (for example vital registration) to be linked to social protection programmes and ensure access to the data of different social protection programmes (e.g. in Indonesia, Cambodia). Local government would be the logical point to take responsibility for data entry in order to avoid duplication of work, however, inadequate technical infrastructure and weak capacity are major challenges to this. 3.2.3 Delivering benefits In the absence of widely available and accessible banking services, local government officials may be responsible for delivering social transfers as cash to beneficiaries. Their presence in most areas and close spatial proximity to beneficiaries makes them cost-effective and relatively reliable payment agents. In Bangladesh for example, the lowest tier of local government (Union Parishad) is responsible for the distribution of some cash transfers to beneficiaries. A similar model is in place in Nepal, where old age pension, disability and other \u2018categorical\u2019 allowances are distributed by municipal ward officers in urban areas and village development secretaries in rural areas. However, to minimize leakages and misuse in delivery, accountability mechanisms should be put in place. In countries with a well established and widespread local banking infrastructure (for example, Indonesia or Mongolia) local government is not involved in the delivery of cash transfers. Cash is accessed directly at local bank branches to which it has been transferred by central level line ministries.

In Cambodia, WFP is piloting a cash card approach for payments made through a scholarship programme. While public-private partnership arrangements appear to work well, their cost- effectiveness needs to be carefully assessed, particularly when governments consider how to scale them up nationally. There are clear opportunities for corruption and illicit payments in the physical delivery of cash transfers. Local government actors may oppose the introduction of such innovative mechanisms, as they would lose an additional and reliable, albeit illegal, income source. As a result, they could be disincentivized to properly execute their administrative functions, making matters worse for the poor. However, anecdotal evidence from Nepal suggests evidence to the contrary. In Nepal, the introduction of a mobile banking scheme by UNCDF has been welcomed by many local government officials, because it substantially reduces their already heavy workload. The involvement of local government, or even local banks, in the delivery of payments does not always make it more convenient, as they often still have to make time-consuming and costly trips in order to get to the nearest bank branch or local government office. This is a particular challenge for those who are too old or physically challenged. In Bangladesh for example, beneficiaries of the old age pension programme are required to collect their allowance in person at the sub-district level office (Upazila Parishad) in order to avoid malpractice, such as payments being made to ghost beneficiaries (see also the case of disability allowances in Nepal, Box 3.4).32 32 BRAC, Small Scale Old Age and Widow Allowance for the Poor in Rural Bangladesh.

The allowance reaches around 25,000 people across the country. Despite the small size of the allowance, the impact is particularly strong for disabled people - who usually face a higher degree of discrimination and are among the poorest and most marginalized. Similar to the old age pension, the disability allowance suffers major management challenges. For disabled people, who may have mobility problems, it may be difficult to attend an office to apply for, or access, services. In addition, there is a problem with defining the criteria for \u2018disability,\u2019 which opens the allowance to misuse. Furthermore, the budget for the disability allowance is based on a quota, which stops the allowance from being given to all those who are actually eligible, which contributes further to exclusionary practices. Institutions at the local level are also involved in the delivery of in-kind transfers, such as food items or vouchers for health and education services. In order to ensure that food transfers, especially school food programmes, reach the intended target group, many programmes have started to involve CBOs, such as parent-teacher associations and health or school-feeding committees, which have a particular interest in ensuring that services reach the target group (see for example Timor-Leste, Box 3.5). Box 3.5 Involving the community in service delivery in Timor-Leste The WFP supported National School Feeding Programme programme was established in 2005. It provides around 230,000 children, in seven districts, with a mid-morning snack. Since 2010, parts of the food delivery to local schools have been controlled by government and there has been a move towards local procurement of food to make the programme more sustainable in the long run. The cooking and distribution of meals is carried out by local schools and school feeding committees, while management, oversight and monitoring is controlled by NGOs contracted by WFP. It is hoped that greater community involvement will improve transparency and commitment and ownership by local schools and communities. 3.2.4 Monitoring and reporting Monitoring and evaluation processes for social protection usually involve all levels of government. However, local government plays a key role in this given its involvement in the management and implementation of social protection programmes. Local government officials manage administrative information and data, draw up potential beneficiary lists and verify their eligibility. They provide information on application procedures and are involved in case management.33 Local government officials are involved with monitoring, they collect basic information on financial issues, and submit regular reports to the next higher government level and/or central coordination unit on the function of payments, in-kind transfers or services used.

Where programmes have specific access requirements (for example, in Cambodia or Bangladesh where conditional cash transfers are provided in education grants), local government bodies and institutions, such as schools, health centres, health or parent- teacher committees, are also involved in monitoring compliance with conditionality.

Monitoring and evaluation processes for social protection usually involve all levels of government. However, local government plays a key role in this given its involvement in the management and implementation of social protection programmes. \u201c \u201c Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 19 district or village-level administrations are usually required to make final beneficiary lists public, as a measure of transparency and accountability. However, reporting and monitoring are not always effective due to capacity constraints. Local government officials, teachers, nurses and civil society committees are often not provided with training on how to fill in reporting forms correctly. Furthermore, basic organizational weaknesses, such as an inability to print and deliver forms on time, have a negative impact on programme operations and lead to delays in delivery of, or adjustments to payments. This is of particular concern in conditional cash or in- kind transfer programmes (for example, in Indonesia, see Box 3.6). Monitoring and evaluation requires a strong commitment on the part of the implementing agency to ensure transparency and accountability. If this is not the case, monitoring processes are unlikely to work efficiently and effectively. Box 3.6 Monitoring conditionalities in Indonesia The Progamem Keluarga Harapan (PKH) or Hopeful Family Programme is a cash transfer programme provided to poor families, conditional upon the use of locally provided education and health services. The first impact evaluation conducted on the programme showed that the PKH increased income for very poor households and improved health behaviour. Most of the transfer was spent on food, clothes and health. The impact on education was low; enrolment did not increase, nor did child labour decrease. There were major bottlenecks in the process of verifying beneficiaries\u2019 entitlements. There were also difficulties monitoring conditionalities, which led to the collection of incorrect data on beneficiaries and lacking, late and incorrect payments. In addition, there were challenges on the supply-side aspect as the programme only included provinces that were able to cope with the increased demand. Where the public sector has limited capacity and commitment to properly monitor and evaluate operations, programmes supported by non-government stakeholders continue to develop their own monitoring and evaluation structures. In Lao PDR, for example, WFP employs three full-time staff members to support the monitoring and evaluation processes of the school food and child-mother nutrition programmes. This unit oversees the management information systems of both programmes and develops materials (such as forms and guidelines) used by local government officials for monitoring purposes. The unit also draws up detailed work plans for monitoring processes. 3.2.5 Managing grievance and redress mechanisms Grievance and redress mechanisms help to improve access to social justice, ensure impartiality and accountability and provide policymakers with a source of information on the effectiveness of their policies.34 Administrative structures within line ministries, the judiciary and other public institutions are the most commonly used grievance and redress mechanisms. Social audits and public hearings are also popular mechanisms employed by the users of services and policymakers to gather information on the effectiveness of services provided. However, the establishment of complaints mechanisms is often not enough; complaints need to be responded to by relevant stakeholders. It is equally important that people are informed about their right to redress and to social protection services \u2013 which NGOs, CSOs and the media play a key role in. 34 Varun Gauri, \u201cRedressing Grievances and Complaints Regarding Basic Service Delivery. Policy Research Working Paper 56992011\u201d (working paper, World Bank, 2011).

Like monitoring activities, grievance and redress mechanisms are some of the least developed features across all programmes and countries. Where they do exist, they often do not work or are not used. Often beneficiaries and local government officials are unaware that these mechanisms exist and there is a lack of training for the latter on how to handle and process grievances.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "40967c78-9894-433d-b6ca-45f9e5dd8ba3": {"__data__": {"id_": "40967c78-9894-433d-b6ca-45f9e5dd8ba3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f31231a0037a173ae9dff14a0982cd70a71efa629831d60ae603f4ac9d47c9db"}}, "hash": "f31231a0037a173ae9dff14a0982cd70a71efa629831d60ae603f4ac9d47c9db", "text": "Some programmes have developed informal grievance channels, such as village chiefs or trusted people in the community (for example, leaders of religious associations or women\u2019s clubs) who substitute for, or complement formal grievance and redress mechanisms. In the BLT programme in Indonesia, for example, the village level provides an entry point for grievance and redress, even though formal mechanisms are in place. Another example is in Bangladesh, where, although the old age pension has no formal complaints mechanism in place, village chiefs and UP Chairpersons play an informal role in terms of handling grievances and redress. These types of local and informal mechanisms are of particular importance in rural areas. Although informal grievance and redress mechanisms may sometimes be contested, some social protection programmes include them to ensure greater downward accountability on the part of the public sector institutions that are supposed to handle complaints. In Mongolia for example, the Child Grant Programme, has established Livelihood Support Councils, which include both local officials and village representatives, in response to grievances.35 3.2.6 Coordination (of services across sectors) As a key service provider, local government coordinates efforts across different public services. This role is of relevance for all services including social protection programmes, as it can significantly improve specific sector outcomes within health, education, agriculture and employment. Linkages between social protection programmes and other public services are a concern in several of the countries included in this study. The introduction of cash transfer programmes often leads to a sharp increase in demand for services, particularly in the health and education sectors. Such social protection programmes usually require beneficiaries to meet certain requirements in order to receive their cash transfers, including regular health check-ups or school attendance. Therefore, coordination needs to be strengthened between stakeholders and providers of health and education services, to ensure that the increase of demand is met with sufficient supply (for example, that new schools are build and teachers are recruited to cater for an increase in demand). Box 3.7 Coordination of educational services across sectors in Nepal The Social Protection Pilot for Scholarship Programmes, which covers the two far western districts of Nepal, aims to coordinate and streamline scholarship programmes provided by different line ministries and government levels. The programmes are all conditional cash transfers that target dalits, girls, children with disabilities and other disadvantaged children. The pilot aims to strengthen local governance for delivering social protection programmes, including management, delivery, monitoring and increased downward accountability. Other key priorities are: to increase coordination of services across different line ministries at local level; and to improve targeting efficiency of scholarship programmes, especially with regard to exclusion based on caste and poverty. The pilot provides a financial top-up to existing scholarship grants, to improve the impact of programmes and school attendance rates. While the main focus of the initiative is on the education grant programme, the pilot will also contribute to strengthening the social security system as a whole. To achieve the established governance goals of the pilot, Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MoFALD) is working closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to ensure close coordination and linkages between local bodies and local education departments during implementation. 35 This paper does not specifically examine the role of CBOs in strengthening grievance and redress mechanisms. This should be explored further to determine how this could improve the delivery of social protection programmes at the local level. Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 21 Effective coordination ensures that services are delivered within and across different sectors at the right time, and properly sequenced to increase their impact (see Box 3.7). In the case of programmes related to disaster risk management or food security, coordination becomes particularly relevant where social protection measures have proven to be an effective instrument in tackling seasonal food insecurity, that complement other food security measures such as agricultural programmes that aim to improve the productivity of farmers (see Box 3.8). Box 3.8 Strengthening livelihoods for food-insecure households in Cambodia The Productive Assets and Livelihoods Support (PALS) Programme, is a public works programme currently being piloted. It targets ten communes in five districts, and aims to promote livelihoods and provide regular employment opportunities for food-insecure and vulnerable households, especially in the lean season. Commune councils lead a participatory process through which communities select assets that contribute to higher agricultural productivity, increase access to markets and social infrastructure, and improve resilience to climate shocks. The programme intends to engage with selected communities for an extended period of time, to achieve greater impact, provide predictable employment opportunities and promote sustainable change.

Local government may also facilitate coordination, by providing citizens with harmonised procedures and processes for accessing services and benefits. Examples of this, in the form of one-stop-shops or single-window approaches, are currently being piloted in Bangladesh and Cambodia. In countries where the health and education sectors are highly centralised, the coordination role of local governments is usually limited. At the same time, it can be difficult for local government to manage and coordinate both the supply and demand sides linked to social protection. Conditional cash transfer programmes, for example, may only, or largely, be implemented where sufficient public services exist for beneficiaries to comply with conditionalities, which usually leaves out the poorest districts. This is the case for Indonesia\u2019s Hopeful Family Programme. In some countries local government bodies oversee and coordinate line ministries\u2019 activities, but may not be able to exercise proper authority \u2013 particularly when budgetary resources continue to be channelled through line ministries. In such circumstances, local government bodies have little influence over sector development plans, which may not always reflect local priorities. The ability of local governments to take on this role often depends on how clear decentralisation policies are, and how effectively they are being implemented on the ground. In addition, coordination and oversight may be compromised because local government often lacks the financial, technical and managerial capacity to engage in complex planning processes. The coordination of services also involves non-government actors, which, in many countries, provide a substantial share of public services at the local level. In some countries, there may be existing rules and regulations to ensure that non-government actors register their services and align themselves with public sector policies and priorities, though the extent to which these are enforced varies. A common mechanism at the local level, where decentralisation laws and strong local governance practices exist, is to include non-government actors in key planning meetings. The introduction of cash transfer programmes often leads to a sharp increase in demand for services, particularly in the health and education sectors. Therefore, coordination needs to be strengthened between stakeholders and service providers to ensure that the increase of demand is met with sufficient supply. \u201c \u201c 22 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 3.2.7 Summary There is a correlation between the level of programme complexity and local government involvement. When targeting mechanisms and management arrangements are more complex (as is the case for conditional cash transfers, public works programmes, food programmes or mixed programme types) there is more potential for local government to play a role (see Table 3.2). Other factors \u2013 such as decentralisation reforms, overall intergovernmental arrangements, local government capacity, local government incentives \u2013 are also important to determine the extent to which local government is involved in social protection programmes. A threefold typology can be used to characterise the extent to which local government is involved in social protection programmes: 1. Local government has no role, or only a very limited one, in the delivery and management of social protection programmes (e.g. Timor-Leste, Lao PDR). 2. Local government has a coordinating role with respect to social protection programmes, but delivery functions are largely centralised (e.g. Bangladesh, Nepal, Mongolia). 3. Local government is largely responsible for the management and implementation of social protection programmes (e.g. Indonesia). Local governments have significant managerial and implementation responsibilities for social protection programmes in countries where they enjoy a high degree of political, fiscal and administrative autonomy (for example, in Indonesia) and where robust control and oversight mechanisms (for example a unified management information system, minimum standards for transfers and/or quality of education and health services) are in place at the national level to ensure that local government plays its role. Evidence from the countries involved in this study indicates which types of responsibilities local government may have in delivering social protection programmes.

This is the case for district and local branch offices of the Ministry of Social Solidarity in Timor-Leste\u2019s Bolsa Da Mae programme, which play a minimal role in delivering social protection services. Accountability issues, such as widespread corruption or leakage problems, may also prompt donors or central government to re-centralise service delivery functions and to limit the role of local government in social protection programmes. Even if local government works well, certain service delivery functions may be contracted out for reasons of efficiency or transparency (for example, monitoring, evaluation or the management of beneficiary payments). Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 23 3.3 Underlying challenges and enabling factors This section looks at some of the challenges and enabling factors that underlie the extent to which local government involvement in social protection is (or is not) effective. Some of these are \u2018external\u2019 to local governments and are thus linked to the overall policy and institutional environment; others are \u2018internal\u2019 to local governments and relate to the ways in which they work and operate. 3.3.1 Policy commitment for social protection Processes and structures that make social protection a key and integral element in long-term poverty reduction and inclusive growth need to be in place. Distinctly articulated national strategic frameworks for social protection and social policy do not need to be in place, although this is the case in some countries (such as Cambodia and Bangladesh). Other national strategies, such as national poverty reduction plans or sector-specific strategies (for example, Timor-Leste\u2019s Education Strategy, or the National Safe Motherhood Programme in Lao PDR) may also provide a framework to strengthen the effectiveness of social protection programmes and ensure national ownership. Broad national development plans and strategies are important for social protection policies because they establish common goals and objectives that are shared and agreed upon across all government sectors and line ministries. This provides a strategic framework for cooperation and coordination. These goals and objectives are usually underpinned by progress indicators and benchmarks, which provide incentives to increase cooperation and coordination and strengthen outcomes. National strategies often make institutional shortcomings more visible and increase the pressure on government or other stakeholders to act. In Cambodia, for example, the national social protection strategy has revealed shortcomings in monitoring and reporting on social protection interventions. National strategies may also put pressure on non- governmental actors to cooperate with government. In Cambodia, the national social protection strategy \u2013 which has achieved high levels of national ownership \u2013 has encouraged some donors to seek increased cooperation with government partners (for example, the WFP supported national school meals programme). The long-term goal is to hand over programmes to respective line ministries. A focus on social protection as a national development priority may also provide an entry point for improved monitoring of non-state actors and service providers. 3.3.2 Coordination Effective and efficient coordination is an important enabling factor for social protection service delivery and, at the same time, a major challenge. A holistic approach to coordination requires both \u2018horizontal\u2019 coordination between government sectors and \u2018vertical\u2019 coordination between different levels of government. Multi-sectoral coordination must go beyond the public sector to include, non-government stakeholders, CSOs, private, not-for-profit and commercial agencies and service providers. Where several ministries are involved in the management of one social protection programme, coordination is more of a challenge. Deeply entrenched silo culture among sectors is a major inhibitor to coordination, that limits information sharing and the pooling of human and financial resources. Acting as vertical silos, line ministries and other agencies tend to operate independently of each other. In Timor- Leste, the Bolsa Da Mae programme has tried to overcome this; they use existing thematic interministerial working groups (for example, on gender-based violence) for monitoring purposes and for the exchange of data and information. Similarly, in Lao PDR, UNICEF has developed cross-sector cooperation around thematic fields (such as food security or child protection). Broad national development plans and strategies are important for social protection policies because they establish common goals and objectives that are shared and agreed upon across all government sectors and line ministries. \u201c \u201c 24 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection Strong leadership and political commitment for social protection is important to facilitate cooperation.

Local governments in Indonesia have the autonomy to manage their own development priorities at the local level. This provides a critical opportunity for local governments to design and implement social protection initiatives that are responsive to specific local needs. In practice, it can be challenging to maintain coherence between national and local levels; there is a lack of operational clarity and national policies and strategies must be translated into effective programmes at the provincial and local levels. Anecdotal evidence suggests that strong political leadership at provincial and district levels improves implementation, helps to ensure efficiency and the availability of quality services. Where elected and other officials at the subnational level have access to significant fiscal resources (as is the case in Indonesia), there is more incentive to establish and implement local social protection interventions. This is also the case in the school food programme in Cambodia, where variations in programme outcomes have been attributed to the degree of interest and political commitment to the programme shown by different provincial governors. For civil servants, coordination with other sectors usually means more work. If there are few incentives for civil servants to work across different sectors, or there is little awareness of the benefits of cross-sector coordination in the long run, public officials are unlikely to be motivated to engage in multi-sector activities. 3.3.3 Clear mandates and functions Unclear, poorly defined or loosely regulated assignment of functional responsibilities across central and local governments impedes the delivery of social protection services and leaves different tiers of government without a clear mandate to act.36 A clear definition of responsibilities is essential to establish accountability frameworks and to determine oversight and quality assurance mechanisms. A lack of clear functional mandates impedes capacity to strengthen the role of local government as a service provider and coordinator of public sector and non-state services. This makes it difficult to hold local government accountable for the delivery of quality social protection services (see, for example, the experience with BLT in Indonesia). In Bangladesh, the 2008 Zila Parishad Ordinance gives discretionary powers over social welfare up to the Zila Parishad (District Council) and to the specialized Chittagong Hills Parishads, but not to the lowest tier of government, i.e., the Unions. In some countries there are no regulatory frameworks at all, in others, regulatory overlaps exist which blur roles and responsibilities. In Indonesia, for example, social protection is defined as a shared responsibility between different government layers (central- local), which can create confusion and lead to duplication of efforts. At the same time, non-governmental actors implement their programmes in a non-regulated context, and often develop their own operational structures, without any or very limited coordination with local government. Under such circumstances, monitoring becomes an almost impossible task (see, for example, the case of Cambodia). In the absence of clear mandates, regulations and norms, local governments may begin to develop their own rules and regulations, including targeting and distribution mechanisms. Communities may develop their own criteria for the selection of beneficiaries, which may focus less on poverty and be based on local power relations. 36 This phenomenon also has historical roots. The British and French models of decentralisation give line ministries a strong role in local service delivery, which is carried out by centrally appointed field officers. Local governments must coordinate their actions with these field officers. They have substantial autonomy over purely local functions, but limited access to revenue instruments. See: World Bank, Local Governance in Developing Countries; WHO, Governance for health in the 21st century. In practice, it can be challenging to maintain coherence between national and local levels; there is a lack of operational clarity and national policies and strategies must be translated into effective programmes at the provincial and local levels. \u201c \u201c Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 25 This can lead to major inclusion and exclusion errors, which almost certainly run counter to actual programme goals. In Indonesia\u2019s BLT cash transfer programme and subsidized rice programme (RASKIN), the distribution of benefits that took place at the community level did not favour the most vulnerable, who were the intended target group (see Box 3.9).37 However, such targeting practices do not necessarily produce entirely negative consequences for the poor. In Bangladesh, Nepal or Timor-Leste for example, local government officials use their payment authority to re-allocate transfers to a larger set of beneficiaries, including poor households in the community which were not initially targeted, despite being eligible.38 Box 3.9 Re-distribution of rice in Indonesia The Beras", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "349d0c36-6f8f-4719-aa4e-aacd2495fcc8": {"__data__": {"id_": "349d0c36-6f8f-4719-aa4e-aacd2495fcc8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3030ce54ff92017adb7d2b4e1f207ff6ae56a37fa3669ac093e6f3f99f8a1018"}, "3": {"node_id": "eba7dd35-205e-485b-9538-23c8931dee07", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46da3d0dee2070cbe41c9016c129397beedb937c4fcd10f14df77d02c0b9a433"}}, "hash": "a8d38c538d7366231c68d04f066ea8efd4d6201915c5263df6782b473cb3b496", "text": "untuk Rumah Tangga Miskin (RASKIN) Rice for the Poor Households Programme, is an in-kind transfer programme that sells rice at below-market prices to vulnerable households, in order to smooth consumption difficulties. As of 2010, the programme had reached 17.5 million people. Its impact has been low considering programme costs. Local level implementation practices do not only favour eligible households, but rice is often shared among many or all households, which reduces the impact on poor households. Furthermore, there are no clear functions and mandates between the different agencies responsible for the programme, which makes it difficult to improve programme performance and raise incentives. The lack of a proper comprehensive monitoring scheme that looks into all programme steps, in particular distribution down to the household level, provides an additional challenge. Local adaptations of procedures may sometimes prove to be useful innovations. Innovations in service delivery are often developed at the local level in response to implementation challenges. These kinds of innovation are an iterative process, through which social protection programmes are fine-tuned or evolve in pragmatic ways and respond to operational challenges. As programmes are implemented, rules, regulations or operational procedures may be found to be inappropriate or poorly adapted to on-the-ground realities \u2013 and local adaptations to them can thus be seen as pragmatic responses. At the same time, important areas that need regulation might have been overlooked. 3.3.4 Participation Non-governmental or non-state actors are often involved in the implementation of many social protection programmes. The participation of civil society and other non- governmental actors in social protection programmes ensures oversight of frontline service providers at the district/sub-district levels. This is of particular importance in contexts where local level downward accountability mechanisms are weak or under- developed. Local participation, including the involvement of civil society and CBOs, is critical to ensure that social services and social protection programmes are responsive to local needs and demands. Evidence from the review suggests that the participation of local actors in the implementation of social protection programmes provides opportunities for innovation and experimentation with regard to service delivery. 37 World Bank, \u201cBantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT) temporary unconditional cash transfer.

It is important to make citizens aware of social protection programmes, and empower them to exercise their right to access services, to improve government accountability and create public demand for services. An impact evaluation of the school stipend programme in Bangladesh, for example, shows that fewer transfers go \u2018astray\u2019 or are subject to wrong doing when local communities and beneficiaries are provided with more information about the programme.39 The decentralisation of responsibilities may foster greater downward accountability, but upward accountability must also be improved. Effective and robust monitoring and oversight mechanisms, managed at the national level, need to be in place to ensure that locally managed services are provided to acceptable standards. IT-based monitoring and reporting systems that allow central government to assess local service delivery are one way to strengthen the oversight function of central government. Another way, which is used by Indonesia, is to provide and monitor benchmarks for national minimum standards for service delivery. 3.3.6 Human resources Local government officials have a key role to play in the coordination and delivery of social protection and other public services, however, staffing levels are typically low, officials are often over-worked, have few incentives and limited skills sets. This impedes service delivery and social protection schemes. Decentralisation processes have shifted responsibilities to lower tiers of government, but this has not \u2013 in most cases \u2013 been accompanied by a concomitant re-allocation of financial or human resources.

Several programmes have donor and development-partner support, but local ownership should be further encouraged to ensure the social protection agenda is in line with national and local level development priorities. To build long-term commitment and ownership, capacity of local government officials must be strengthened. 3.3.7 Financing The assignment of major administrative responsibilities for social protection to local government implies there should also be a provision of adequate financial resources to fulfil this task. In most developing countries, the central government is the major source of funding for social protection programmes. This is a reflection of the greater levels of fiscal resources available to the central government and the general principle that a redistributive fiscal role is better suited to central, rather than local government.41 39 Naomi Hossain and Ferdous Osman, Politics and Governance in the Social Sectors. 40 Nick Devas and Simon Delay, \u201cLocal Democracy and Challenges in Decentralising the State: An International Perspective\u201d. 41 UNDP,UNCDF, Local Government and Social Protection. The decentralisation of responsibilities may foster greater downward accountability, but upward accountability must also be improved. Effective and robust monitoring and oversight mechanisms, managed at the national level, need to be in place to ensure that locally managed services are provided to acceptable standards. \u201c \u201c Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 27 National governments in developing countries face major fiscal constraints, however, and may not be willing,42 or able, to provide the local government with sufficient funding to cover the full costs of social protection programmes. This can compromise the ability of local government to implement social protection programmes in line with policy and procedures. In Nepal, for example, Village Development Committees (VDCs) rarely receive enough transfers from central government to provide all eligible beneficiaries with old age pensions, disability allowances or other types of cash transfer. As a result, and given limited own-source revenues, VDCs have little choice but to \u2018ration\u2019 benefits by selecting some, but not all, eligible recipients and excluding others. Such exclusion reflects poorly on VDCs but can be attributed to inadequate fiscal resources, rather than to mismanagement or targeting errors. Beneficiary payments are not the only area impacted by insufficient funding, other direct and in-direct administrative costs linked to programme delivery are not taken into account when responsibilities are moved to the local level. Targeting processes, field visits for monitoring and evaluation purposes, communication and socialization campaigns, and cash delivery all create additional financial costs for local governments. Even when administrative budgets are made available, they are often not based on a formula weighted for costs against, for example, the number of beneficiaries served and area of distribution/coverage. Further, additional budgets may be needed to recruit additional staff to manage and deliver social protection functions, and again the need may vary from area to area. The same kind of fiscal constraint also applies to the ability of local government to provide public goods and services. Very few local governments in developing countries can, or are allowed to, mobilize significant local revenues, and are therefore dependent on intergovernmental fiscal transfers from central government to finance the provision of local public goods and services. Such transfers are usually insufficient to meet all local needs and priorities. This constrains the ability of local government to ensure that the supply-side public services meet demand, especially when demand increases because of social transfers and social protection programmes. Being able to match supply to demand implies that local governments enjoy considerable discretion over the ways in which they spend \u2013 for example, meeting an increase in demand for health services with an increase in spending on public health facilities as opposed to schools or rural roads. In practice, however, local governments usually only have discretionary powers over a limited proportion of their total revenues. Usually, a larger proportion of what they receive as intergovernmental fiscal transfers is earmarked for spending on specific sectors, or specific types of expenditure within a given sector. This can constrain their capacity to be responsive and to match variations in demand with a flexible supply side response. In some countries, increased funding is made available for local education services where schooling conditions are less favourable than in other areas (for example, the school improvement plan in Bangladesh). Such innovative and needs-based public finance mechanisms make it more likely that adequate services are provided in poorer or more disadvantaged areas \u2013 and thus improve social development outcomes.

Sufficient resources must be allocated, to allow local government to perform its role in delivering social protection to targeted beneficiaries. 42 Willingness to fully fund social protection is largely a reflection of the extent to which competing budgetary priorities (such as security, education, and infrastructure) reduce the available \u2018fiscal space\u2019 to finance social transfer programmes. Local governments usually only have discretionary powers over a limited proportion of their total revenues.

Across Asia and the Pacific, information on social conditions at the subnational level is patchy, or for some countries does not exist at all, partly because local governments do not have the capacity to collect information on a routine basis. In Lao PDR, the government \u2013 with support from UNICEF \u2013 has started to help local governments carry out social indicator surveys that are disaggregated to the household level. Due to their physical and social proximity to potential beneficiaries, local government institutions have a potentially important role to play in data collection processes. In Timor-Leste, for example, government has trained local traditional authorities and development committees to collect and provide information on local development priorities. Vital registration is an important function of local government, which can be used to facilitate the implementation of social protection and other social services. The national pension scheme in Nepal or the WFP supported mother and child nutrition programme in Lao PDR, for example, use a mix of geographic poverty targeting and vital registration data. Information and knowledge management in social protection involves data collection, as well as sharing experiences and practices across, and within, countries and regions. This is especially important when the local level provides opportunities for adaptation, innovation and experimentation. It is important to Document innovative approaches to the implementation of social protection programmes in capacity- and resource-constrained contexts, as this is useful to countries and local governments in similar situations. 3.3.9 Gender sensitivity Gender issues merit special consideration in discussion of social protection as women are a particularly vulnerable and marginalized group among the poor, given the endemic discrimination that they face in most of the countries covered in the study. Women face particular difficulties in accessing and benefitting from social services such as health and education,43 and they tend to be less informed than other poor people about social protection programmes and social services, resulting in a greater degree of exclusion and more reluctance to make a complaint or seek redress. Even in programmes where they are defined as the main target group, women tend to benefit less from social programmes due to specific intra-household relations. In terms of gender vulnerabilities, women across Asia and the Pacific are over-represented in the informal economy, and so are less likely to be enrolled in formal social insurance programmes. Women are also more vulnerable to the impact of climate change, and generally have fewer resources to mitigate risks or to cope with the aftermath of weather-related crises. Compounding these problems is the fact that women and young girls are more vulnerable than men to experiences of gender-based violence. In response to these challenges, more efforts are required to ensure social protection programmes are more gender-sensitive and address gender-specific vulnerabilities. Many programmes specifically target women or girls, but often fail to include gender- specific vulnerabilities in their need assessments and frequently do not consider vulnerability through a gendered lens. In doing so, programmes may reinforce traditional gender roles and responsibilities, and thereby compromise women\u2019s ability to strengthen their economic and social position within society. In addition, while programmes may have a gender-specific objective, impact studies do not necessarily provide gender-sensitive data, or examine the impact of programmes with regard to gender-relations.44 Indeed, this gender specific focus should be mainstreamed into all social protection programmes. 43 Ibid. 44 UN Women, Resilience for All?

Gender- sensitive delivery mechanisms that can help women better access social protection services include: family friendly schedules for out-payments; and efforts to raise awareness and provide women with information on their social protection rights. There is often a major gap, however, between gender-responsive design and actual programme implementation. Awareness and capacity to deal with gender issues are typically low at the local level, which demonstrates a disconnection from the central level.45 To make gender-sensitive implementation measures successful, training must be given to service providers, to raise awareness among civil servants, and other stakeholders who implement programmes at the local level, including traditional authorities and NGOs involved in targeting, registration or service delivery. For cash transfers this also includes representatives of banks or other commercial partners involved in out-payments. Successful programme implementation also depends on the gender awareness of the community itself. Being informed about basic programme content and specific gender-related objectives is important for beneficiaries and the community as a whole, to strengthen a gender-sensitive environment and enable programme interventions to increase their impact. Gender vulnerabilities are partly reflected in a range of programmes in the countries included in this study. The school stipend programme for poor girls and indigenous children in Cambodia, Bolsa Da Mae in Timor-Leste and the mother and child nutrition programme in Lao PDR all explicitly target women, girls and indigenous children. While women are participants in most of the public works programmes examined in the study, in Bangladesh, the REOPA programme specifically targets women from extremely poor households. The focus of most of these programmes is to provide employment and income-earning opportunities, in order to mitigate food insecurity and strengthen access to health and educational services, (see Box 3.10). Box 3.10 Strengthening maternal health in Lao PDR The Safe Motherhood Voucher Scheme, which operates in two districts, is carried out by two NGOs - Lao Red Cross (LRC) and Swiss Red Cross (SRC) - which are contracted by the Ministry of Health/Provincial Health Office to manage and account for the voucher scheme, and verify the services reportedly delivered by the health providers and their reimbursement. The overall objective is to reduce maternal and children under 5 morbidity and mortality in the targeted districts. The scheme has reached out to more than 4,000 women. The scheme aims to remove financial barriers to the access of reproductive and child health services. 45 Ibid. To make gender- sensitive implementation measures successful, training must be given to service providers, to raise awareness among civil servants, and other stakeholders who implement programmes at the local level, including traditional authorities and NGOs involved in targeting, registration or service delivery. \u201c \u201c 30 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 4 Strengthening local government involvement in social protection Local government has a role to play in the delivery of social protection services but, as outlined in Chapter 3, there are challenges to effective service delivery. These challenges are not limited to local government alone, but apply across all tiers of the intergovernmental system; likewise, they are not specific to social protection, but should be part of public sector service delivery arrangements in general. Without substantial reform processes at all levels of government, efforts to strengthen the role of local government in social protection are likely to be of limited value. They are nonetheless crucial to ensure social protection services are delivered in efficient, effective and equitable ways. This section of the paper examines some of these issues and identifies and describes key entry points to strengthen the role and effectiveness of local government in the delivery of social protection programmes and services. 4.1 Coordination of supply and demand It is important to work across sectors with different stakeholders, to match the demand for and supply of services, to improve the impact of social protection, especially in relation to its long-term impact on poverty reduction. Figure 4.1 Recommendations to match supply and demand Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational \u2022 Build human resources: Sufficient human resources are required to manage social services in an efficient way. \u2022 Provide technical know-how: It is important to strengthen the technical know- how of local governments in order to increase involvement in planning and budgeting of local or regional development. \u2022 Improve", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6343dbba-a1da-48ee-966c-8758b8a27eac": {"__data__": {"id_": "6343dbba-a1da-48ee-966c-8758b8a27eac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bbe6b6b68a35ada92e9570b30b73131605abbef2b2d88509d530db31223b4bfc"}}, "hash": "bbe6b6b68a35ada92e9570b30b73131605abbef2b2d88509d530db31223b4bfc", "text": "data availability: Data on the social, economic and demographic conditions at local level and household level must be available in order to identify needs and design and deliver good services accordingly. Upstream and national level \u2022 Clarify functions and mandates: Clear intergovernmental mandates and functions for social protection are needed in order for local government to deliver social protection programmes. \u2022 Provide sustainable and equitable financing: Adequate financial resources are required for local governments to address local needs and priorities. Resources need to be allocated in an equitable manner to address subnational disparities and inequalities, specifically with regard to basic services, such as health, education and social welfare services. \u2022 Foster political commitment to social protection at the national level: Political commitment for social protection at the national level is a pre-requisite for stronger commitment for social protection at local level. Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 31 4.2 Strengthening monitoring and evaluation Continuous monitoring of the performance of social protection programmes provides an evidence-based framework to see if progress is being made, and where amendments or modifications are needed to improve system performance. Figure 4.2 Recommendations to improve monitoring and evaluation Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational \u2022 Provide technical training: Training is needed to strengthen the capacity of local staff for reporting and monitoring, including but not limited to data entry processes and the collection of basic data on social, health and education indicators at the subnational level. \u2022 Strengthen technical infrastructure: To increase efficiency and transparency monitoring processes must be simplified, for example, through electronic reporting mechanisms. \u2022 Implement Management Information Systems: The development of Management Information Systems, that allow for the integration of data from different social protection programmes, and follow up on beneficiaries in a timely manner, will make the delivery of social protection more efficient. Upstream and national level \u2022 Simplify monitoring processes: Many programmes have their own independent monitoring systems, which lead to overlaps. There is no coordination in terms of monitoring across programmes, agencies and thematic sectors. \u2022 Develop and enforce regulatory frameworks: This will assist non-government actors to implement programmes and services, and enable local government to better plan for local services and coordinate non-governmental service provision. 4.3 Strengthening human capacity and technical infrastructure Adequate human resources are critical for effective and efficient delivery of services. Without sufficient and qualified staff, able to respond to local needs, it is difficult to deliver services in a timely and adequate way. Human resources need to be supported by an adequate technical infrastructure. Figure 4.3 Recommendations to strengthen capacity and infrastructure Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational \u2022 Provide technical training and capacity building: Technical training is needed so that people can carry out basic functions, such as filing applications, collecting data, reporting and monitoring, as well as coordination, management and planning. \u2022 Develop technical infrastructure: Infrastructure is needed to support service delivery activities. Without a working infrastructure (e.g. computers, phones, and internet access) local government cannot work effectively. This is of particular importance in countries where geography is a challenge; technology may provide one way to bridge distances. \u2022 Increase awareness and sensitization: It is important to increase awareness and knowledge of social protection to improve effective delivery of the programmes. Upstream and national level \u2022 Provide incentives: Establish clear incentives for local government bodies to deliver high quality services. Questions as to whom incentives should target (local institutions as a whole and/or individual officials) need to be carefully looked at in this context. \u2022 Reform bureaucracy and increase human resources: Decentralisation of services also means decentralisation of human resources. This unfortunately has not happened in all countries, where civil service reforms often lag behind decentralisation processes. 32 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 4.4 Strengthening delivery and modernizing payment systems The efficient and effective delivery of payment services reduces overall fiduciary risks, limits corruption and improves access to inclusive financial services. Figure 4.4 Recommendations to improve payment services Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational \u2022 Provide financial literacy training: Provide technical training for beneficiaries to enable them to better utilize social payments and to demand better financial services. \u2022 Improve monitoring capacity: Improve local government officials\u2019 capacity to ensure that transfers are delivered to the right person (spot-checks, etc.). \u2022 Improve information dissemination processes: Improve basic programme contents and regular programme processes (e.g. out-payments, registration processes, etc.). \u2022 Test and experiment with innovative delivery solutions: This may help to increase outreach and reduce the role of local government to a monitoring function.

Civil service reforms need to place greater emphasis on rules and regulations to prevent civil servants from misusing funds or misappropriating social transfers. At the same time, incentive mechanisms must be put in place to reward and encourage effective and efficient performance. 4.5 Strengthening social accountability Making information available about the main features of a social protection programme (including its objectives, basic eligibility criteria, the size of transfers, as well as basic operations, including delivery points and dates) is key for implementers and beneficiaries. Well-informed implementing agencies are better equipped to deliver services in a more efficient and effective way. Information also provides an important downward accountability mechanism for beneficiaries, households, and communities. Figure 4.5 Recommendations to strengthen social accountability Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational \u2022 Increase participation: Stronger involvement of communities in the development of communication strategies is important, to make sure that any information disseminated raises the interest of local communities, is disseminated on time and in ways that are appropriate to specific ethnic, regional or linguistic contexts. \u2022 Develop Training for Trainers: This will improve dissemination of information through civil servants. \u2022 Use technological innovations: Use of new media can help to disseminate important information on, for example, delivery dates, changes in prices (for example, with the subsidized rice programme in Indonesia) or timelines for cash or food for work programmes. This is especially important for remote or isolated areas. Upstream and national level \u2022 Develop adequate socialization strategies: Information strategies that are sensitive to cultural and linguistic variations are important to increase awareness of and access to services. Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection 33 4.6 Strengthening capacity of local government to identify the poor Local government\u2019s proximity and closeness to local communities enables it to identify the needy and vulnerable. This is of particular importance to gender-sensitive targeting. Local government also plays an important role in the collection of routine household-level data to improve targeting processes (for example, vital registration). Figure 4.6 Recommendations to improve local government ability to identify the poor Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational Disseminate information: Dissemination of information about basic programme parameters will increase the targeting capacity of local government officials and strengthen downward accountability. Improve data availability and collection: Strengthen capacity to collect information and carry out routine data collection processes to increase knowledge and understanding about subnational socio-economic conditions in order to complement national targeting processes. Provide training on gender-sensitive targeting and data collection: Increased awareness of gender issues at local level is important in order to make local government more responsive to gender aspects in social protection. Upstream and national level Implement Management Information Systems: This is important in order to support targeting processes. Improve targeting methodologies and policies: These are important in order to make targeting more efficient and increase the capacity of programmes to reach out to the poor. There is also a critical need to create a coherent linkage between the local database/ methodology for targeting, with the unified database at the national level, especially for the nation-wide social protection scheme. Regular update of the beneficiary selection process must be put in place with closer engagement with local governments. 4.7 Implementing grievance and redress mechanisms Grievance and redress mechanisms guarantee basic fairness in social protection programmes, and allow policymakers to see if programmes work effectively. They also provide an important mechanism for downward accountability. Figure 4.7 Recommendations to implement grievance and redress mechanisms Focus and scale Interventions Frontline and subnational Establish grievance and redress mechanisms where they do not exist: The important role of non-state stakeholders as trusted agents for complaints mechanisms, including \u201ctraditional complaints\u201d mechanisms, needs to be taken into account when creating these mechanisms. Strengthen the demand-side of grievance and redress: Work with NGOs and other non-government stakeholders as brokers in order to strengthen the demand-side. Strengthen responsiveness of formal complaint mechanisms: To do this, provide training and raise awareness of local government officials. Upstream and national level Create effective complaints procedures: Effective complaints procedures are important in order to be able to respond in time to complaints. 34 Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection Annex 1: Programme overview Country Name Programme type Coverage & costs Donor involvement NSPS Major governance challenges Bangladesh REOPA (Rural Employment Opportunities for Public Assets) Cash for work plus skills transfer (national programme) 24,444 women Taka 77.69 crores (USD 99,568,358) UNDP/European Union Under way \u2022 Capacity strengthening efforts are challenged due to high election turn-over of government officials \u2022 Excessive workload of local government representatives \u2022 Lack of accountability", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e544e6cd-aaea-4b30-98e4-939d8a478d0c": {"__data__": {"id_": "e544e6cd-aaea-4b30-98e4-939d8a478d0c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Strengthening the Governance of Social Protection: The Role of Local Government", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "089f01a4cb78e90aa5c3c3d6d09afbf4917258f4efc3148a8d79fbbf303accd5"}, "3": {"node_id": "8fef4144-2397-4fba-b9c5-b3e3027c922b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/strengthening-governance-social-protection-role-local-government", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cad37db3ea010af559e621ce2787397dedc6c5f20b30dc9a978f33bf12748779"}}, "hash": "242993932ecd51ec6499bf8b584f53bb28da59743443d3435cde0e2e28a91c03", "text": "\u2022 Lack of pro-poor and gender-sensitive attitudes and organizational culture Bangladesh EGPP (Employment Generation for the Poor) Cash for work (national programme) 742,500 persons/year Taka 1000 crores (USD 128,161,100.00) Government/World Bank Under way \u2022 Fast implementation has left local government unprepared to implement programme, and caused shortages in design (targeting, complex monitoring and payment systems, etc.) \u2022 Excessive workload of local government \u2022 Public works selected not part of local development plan Bangladesh Old Age Allowance for the Poor and Assistance Programme for Vulnerable Women Unconditional cash transfer (national programme) 5.3 Mio. and 4.8 Mio.

For three days, participants exchanged ideas and experiences in tackling corruption. The workshop included 33 presentations, all of them now available online (see the links in each session embedded in the presenters\u2019 names). DAY 1 Building blocks for the training The first day of training addressed linkages between corruption and development. It also focused on technical UNCAC provisions and presented a perspective on anti-corruption programming in Asia-Pacific. The first issue for consideration concerned the broad need to more surely recognize and address the problem of corruption in the interest of development effectiveness. Other sessions focused on the usefulness of a multilateral normative framework as the basis for reform programmes, and the identification of important Asia-Pacific regional trends. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cThe training aimed to consolidate the Asia-Pacific Community of Practice and provide strategic guidance for implementing UNCAC.\u201d 7 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 1 Corruption and development Phil Matsheza\u2019s presentation \u2013 addressing definitions, concepts and principles related to corruption and development \u2013 provided an overall conceptual umbrella for the workshop. UNCAC provides a development framework for UNDP, recommending multi-disciplinary approaches in both preventive measures and law enforcement. The UNCAC is a very comprehensive framework, but \u201cthe true measure of success of the United Nations is not how much we promise but how much we deliver for those who need us most\u201d. 1 One key discussion point was the importance of measuring corruption. The best-known tools, in this regard, are the perception indexes, serving advocacy purposes over the past years and raising public awareness; for example in Bangladesh, once ranked at the bottom of Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index (TI CPI). But the UNCAC Conference of State Parties has now endorsed a move towards a more objective, more nationally owned assessment whereby countries are compared against their own standards. Another discussion examined the design of anti-corruption responses, whether comprehensive or stand-alone. The issue of mainstreaming anti-corruption measures proved a consistent thread throughout the workshop. But two caveats were raised about mainstreaming, citing experience with gender programming where mainstreaming meant the issue itself gets lost, and suggesting that a clear understanding of the sector-specific dynamics is needed to effectively address the problem. Session 2 Introduction: the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) A comprehensive overview of UNCAC \u2013 as foundation for the workshop - familiarized participants with the Convention\u2019s four substantive components: prevention, criminalization/law enforcement, asset recovery and international cooperation. Asset-recovery provisions, a key UNCAC innovation, have created a common platform for international cooperation from a law-enforcement perspective. Getting legal assistance used to be very time consuming. A key UNCAC contribution to the fight against corruption across borders has been mutual legal assistance (MLA). UNCAC \u2013 which describes legal formalities, asset-recovery mechanisms, and the rules of repatriation and freezing of assets \u2013 revolutionized MLA, thereby eliminating many unnecessary steps. 1 Kofi Annan\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. 8 Supporting UNCAC implementation This session demonstrated how UNCAC\u2019s reporting mechanism can document results among Member States, including their successes, lessons learned and failures in the fight against corruption, thereby promoting ratification and success on the part of other countries. Session 3 Overview: Regional anti-corruption initiatives in Asia and the Pacific Participants saw how political will represents a key ingredient of success. At the same time they asked how and at what level of government this will is manifested (highest leadership or community decision-makers), and who else might be encouraged to champion the process. \u2018Political will\u2019 was seen to include \u2018room for maneuver\u2019 by policy-makers, and its exercise was understood to involve the leverage of this feature in generating momentum and ownership of reforms. It also became clear, in this session, that specific cultural and social patterns \u2013 e.g. traditions of gift-giving found within some Pacific cultures \u2013 may be misinterpreted as corrupt practices. DAY 2 Practical applications: Entry points, challenges and lessons learned The second day progressed to more practical UNCAC applications: e.g. entry points, challenges and lessons for successful anti-corruption programming.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c138fad4-ab8c-4952-9a79-8f2b3e21a3f7": {"__data__": {"id_": "c138fad4-ab8c-4952-9a79-8f2b3e21a3f7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b7b71a1a4df813b746d29cea7b82fc7727265dc6e501bcc7f37a683a69b79fc"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ecb557c-de41-448c-9b76-71defe520666", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8e34f8207edade029e2702c29deac18655e961ee15ace9904e6473c084a8033"}}, "hash": "01e3a30e2766c04f9b035b61d0b7798ca6c79c8431576e775d00b5cb594ed849", "text": "entry points, challenges and lessons for successful anti-corruption programming.

Key components for sectoral programming include these: surveys and diagnosis of risks and vulnerabilities; expenditure tracking; benchmarks and indicators; regulatory review/licences; codes of ethics/conduct; ethics and human resource training; incentive systems; complaints and whistle blowing mechanisms in a sectoral context; and access to information. This session reinforced themes considered in earlier discussions and anticipated those to come in later ones, such as the need for sound assessment of institutions and sectors in terms of vulnerability to corruption \u2013 whether through risk assessments, as highlighted by the Asian \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 9 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Development Bank (ADB), or through integrity assessments elaborated on by Malaysia and Korea in their presentations. This session also demonstrated how one holistic approach to fighting corruption yielded concrete results. Inspirational lessons from the Malaysia National Integrity Plan showed how a culture of ethics and social accountability could be grounded in a solid assessment of where the problems really lie. Session 5 Anti-corruption programming for public-sector reform at national and local levels Referring mainly to the UNCAC chapter on prevention, training then focused on specific sectors. \u2018Transforming Institutions and Culture for Accountability and Transparency: Lessons from South Korea\u2019. This presentation demonstrated the usefulness of integrity-assessment surveys by public-service users in measuring vulnerability to corruption. The same basic principles and approaches can be applied to any organization in any country at either the organizational or the national level. \u2018MDG, Decentralization and Corruption in the Philippines\u2019. Empowered communities developed and tracked their own progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through functional citizenry feedback and voice mechanisms that systematize accountability and transparency. Sound MDG practices that promote transparency and accountability were adapted and replicated at the community level, ensuring that MDGs are achieved with integrity. Recommendations included localizing UNCAC provisions down to village level; monitoring progress and providing technical support to information centres (ICs) beyond project life; and documenting best practices and popularizing them for easy use and dissemination. \u2018Health Sector Integrity Initiative in Mongolia\u2019. The government increased transparency and accountability in the Ministry of Health and selected health organizations by identifying current constraints and bottleneck areas, developing mechanisms to address them, and promoting ethics and staff integrity through open discussions, training, codes of conduct and complaints handling. Addressing ethics and integrity issues requires long-term engagement. \u2018Harnessing Voluntary Public Officials Initiative: The Sri Lanka Clean Hands Campaign\u2019. This campaign rewards outstanding public officials, eliminates systems and procedures that lead to corrupt practices, and provides a forum for discussion of corruption prevention and best practices. Although only a few officers are involved in corruption, public officials are often afraid to talk openly about the problem. An \u2018alliance\u2019 was formed of officials who wished to maintain a \u2018clean\u2019 public service. \u2018Ensuring Transparency and Integrity in Public Procurement: Lessons from Asia and the Pacific\u2019. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is involved in an initiative to ensure transparency and integrity in public procurement. Lessons learned so far include these: the need to benchmark national procurement systems, looking at procurement laws and regulations as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) baseline compliance and performance indicators; \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 10 Supporting UNCAC implementation the importance of Executing Agency Capacity Assessments in looking at procurement risks and training requirements; and the advantages of e-government procurement and capacity development. The session further emphasized the importance of citizen involvement in combating corruption; the need for \u2018clean\u2018 public servants who are also advocates within their respective public service systems; the importance of addressing all issues related to combating corruption, rather than merely focusing on law enforcement and, in so doing, perhaps neglecting prevention; and addressing the issue of remuneration for public servants in an effort to ensure that all receive an adequate wage. This process requires long-term commitment. Sessions 6 and 7 Judicial reform, law enforcement and oversight mechanisms Participants considered concrete examples of how judicial integrity is built or rebuilt in Indonesia and of how China has implemented UNCAC. They heard insights from Fiji as well as accounts of Pakistan\u2019s grievance redress mechanisms and the Philippines\u2019 multi-sectoral and comprehensive convergence anti-corruption programme. These two sessions importantly addressed the need for an independent judicial sector and the need to introduce accountability and transparency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "418d00e8-3418-4fc1-a2e6-90a85b29454a": {"__data__": {"id_": "418d00e8-3418-4fc1-a2e6-90a85b29454a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "693505cdf47ec82996724211b6c60aa9e72ab8b4d1db7ce7f56f820ee8e0a278"}, "2": {"node_id": "8dd8961a-f388-4dd9-a14b-af2cda9f9e22", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "5f2bec5abe1424967e13b39bf6c7705909784ffc310a118bae69d6bd6414253d"}}, "hash": "5a960a5eea817a8e9eafd77fb82d650c2037c628b1faf5f1a5c439fcde8acb4a", "text": "In doing so, participants agreed, discretion needs to be minimized at the same time as accountability is increased.

These special clinics touched upon emerging issues in anti-corruption, including human rights, gender, post- conflict state building, and aid accountability. Session 8 Civil society organizations (CSOs), the media and the private sector The Philippine Center for Investigative journalism presented best practices in investigative journalism as a tool to ensure public awareness and sustained engagement in holding elected public officials to account. Effective media efforts should be based on strong evidence \u2013 following the paper trail and following the money. From freedom of expression to right to information to the specific example of the \u2018Citizen Report Cards\u2019, the message was clear: Information is power, particularly when it can mobilize people to take action, encourage open debate and dialogue with decision-makers, and introduce market competition to ensure effective delivery of public services, especially to the poor. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 11 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region In the private sector, a remarkable change has occurred over the past five years. Where companies were asserting they had nothing to do with drugs, crime and corruption, that they had clean hands and were victims of public corruption, they are now acknowledging that the UNCAC can help them reduce corruption in their companies and in the countries where they do business. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is currently working on a number of joint projects with the private sector in accordance with commitments they undertook in the Bali Business Declaration, following the 2007 Bali Conference of State Parties of the UNCAC. Session 9 Regional and international synergies ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific supports a network of anti-corruption policy-makers linked with other global initiatives. The Anti-Corruption Network for Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECIS) provides expertise from within the region and highlights the value of informal networking and knowledge exchange. Lessons from the region also reverberate in Asia-Pacific, emphasizing long-term engagement and capacity development, as well as better insights into the politics of corruption. Another example from Sri Lanka emphasized the need for close international cooperation, particularly given limited national resources and capacity. Session 10 Global COP and report back from clinics This session allowed for smaller-group discussions on emerging issues \u2013 on human rights, natural- resource revenue management, gender, post-conflict reconstruction, and international aid transparency \u2013 as they relate to anti-corruption. The clinics focused on linkages with UNCAC, challenges, and programming entry points for UNDP in democratic governance initiatives. Conclusions and follow-up Overall, the workshop provided a useful opportunity to deepen participant understanding of UNCAC and to share experiences related to the operationalization of UNCAC in UNDP programming. The agenda provided a good mixture of topics and guest speakers together with an informative overview of UNCAC. Some participants suggested having fewer presentations to allow more time for questions and answers. Nevertheless, participants rated workshop organization as \u2018very good\u2019 to \u2018excellent\u2019. Among other things, they appreciated the Solutions Network of Asia Pacific (SNAP) real-time availability of documents and presentations. Participants suggested that UNDP proceed with establishing the \u2018Integrity in Action \u2013 INTACT\u2019 regional network of anti-corruption practitioners to share experiences and information. They also \u201cInformation is power, particularly when it can mobilize people to take action, encourage open debate and dialogue with decision-makers, and introduce market competition to ensure effective delivery of public services, especially to the poor.\u201d Supporting UNCAC implementation proposed establishing a directory of focal points and, with relevant Ministries, organizing capacity- development activities at the country level. They also proposed follow-up workshops to assess progress in implementing UNCAC. The UNDP RCB will ride this momentum in creating an interactive anti-corruption portal. The portal will focus on preventive measures in the fight against corruption and on anti-corruption initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs, highlighting sectoral approaches in areas such as education, health and non-renewable natural resources. The portal will facilitate exchange among UNDP practitioners and national counterparts involved in UNDP anti-corruption initiatives.

That fact is supported by evidence from around the world. And corruption is a long-standing global phenomenon. But it was only in the mid-1990s that the global community began responding to this serious developmental threat, a threat that has since been exacerbated by globalization and critical cross- border dimensions. Although it appears in different forms and varying magnitudes, corruption is found in both rich and poor countries, in both developing and developed countries. Corruption hurts the poor disproportionately, hinders economic development, undermines state accountability and capacity to provide equitable and responsive public services, and diverts investments from infrastructure, institutions and social services. Furthermore, corruption fosters an anti-democratic environment characterized by uncertainty, unpredictability and declining moral values and disrespect for constitutional institutions and the rule of law. Corruption, therefore, reflects a democracy, human rights and governance deficit that has serious impacts on poverty and human security.1 The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the first international legal instrument of its kind, clearly demonstrates a global consensus on what countries should do to prevent and criminalize corruption, to improve international cooperation in combating corruption, and to recover assets. Many consider it a revolutionary step in international criminal law, a groundbreaking and innovative tool to promote good governance. Since the UNCAC came into force on 14 December 2005, rallying reform in countries across the globe,2 all UN agencies are expected to use this new framework in their anti-corruption initiatives. Currently a number of these agencies, including UNDP, are conducting a variety of country-level activities under different thematic groups. To maximize the impact of these activities and to ensure that they are mainstreamed into national development strategies, agencies need to synergize, to maximize resources in enabling the development of complementary areas of expertise. UNODC, a pivotal partner in anti-corruption programming, serves as UNCAC custodian. Over the past decade, an estimated US$100 million and more per year in public funds have been spent on anti-corruption activities. Overall, however, the impact of these measures has been modest, and the average quality of governance worldwide seems to have stagnated. Corruption in Asia-Pacific remains a challenge for analysis and policy. The region presents great cultural, ethnic, political and religious diversity, diverging levels of human development, and regional governance models that range from autocratic regimes to one-party people\u2019s democracies to multiparty electoral systems. Design and implementation of realistic National Integrity Strategies must take into account all these factors. 1 UNDP Practice Note 2004, p. 1. 2 As of this writing, 140 Member States have signed the Convention and128 have ratified it. Among 27 countries that signed in Asia-Pacific, 16 have ratified. \u201cCorruption reflects a democracy, human rights and governance deficit that has serious impacts on poverty and human security.\u201d 14 Supporting UNCAC implementation Many anti-corruption initiatives fail because they are essentially non-political in nature, while most of the corruption in developing countries is highly political. Is there a causal relationship between levels of democratic governance and control of corruption? Research indicates that it is not so much the current degree of democracy that is important, but rather the length of time the democratic governance system has been in place. The more experience a country has with democracy, the better it can address corruption. In addition, fighting corruption is no longer simply a domestic challenge. The cross-border impact of corruption and the need to share knowledge and experiences have inspired several regional initiatives. Among the most comprehensive and active networks is the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia Pacific, which brings together representatives from anti-corruption institutions in 27 countries around the region, as well as a steering group of development partners including UNDP. See also the Asia Pacific Action Plan. ASEAN\u2019s Vientiane Plan of Action for 2004\u20132020 pays increased attention to corruption as a governance issue requiring special attention. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has constituted an expert group on corruption to support capacity-building in Member Countries. The Pacific Plan is also central to fighting corruption in the Pacific Islands, with recommendations to set up regional anti-corruption agencies, regional ombudsman offices and auditor generals. Increased awareness of the detrimental effects of corruption has also caused parliamentarians to unite in the fight against corruption. The North East Asian and South East Asian chapters of the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (NEAPAC and SEAPAC) were established in May 2003 and April 2005, respectively. An inaugural meeting of SAPAC (South Asian Parliamentarians Against Corruption) is planned.

At the same time, however, there is the risk of overly ambitious, unsustainable plans that might eventually jeopardize public support for the anti-corruption effort. Four main policy-development trends emerge from the region: Development of national policies are being linked to comprehensive strategies to combat corruption. Such plans have been developed in Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Republic of Korea and Thailand. The Afghan National Development Strategy incorporates a comprehensive anti-corruption plan. Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka are also developing such strategies. Implementation plans are being developed for new anti-corruption laws that supersede what were formerly arrays of separate pieces of legislation. This often includes institutional development plans for anti-corruption agencies and other integrity institutions. UNCAC implementation involves countries undertaking in-depth assessment of their laws and regulations for combating corruption, analyzing gaps between the legislation in place and the mandatory and non-mandatory provisions of the UNCAC. Gap analyses are usually performed prior to ratification, as was the case in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and Mongolia. Other countries, e.g. Sri Lanka, have ratified without undertaking such an in-depth legal assessment. A number of countries in the region have incorporated this UNCAC gap analysis in their short- term plans. While comprehensive strategies remain the fashion, a more recent trend supplements these strategies with sectoral approaches, either related to government agencies considered highly vulnerable to corrupt activities (e.g. tax, customs) or sectors crucial for the achievement of the MDGs. For example, UNDP Mongolia is supporting the Ministry of Health in improving its ethics, accountability and transparency infrastructure and the supporting governance structure. Anti- corruption initiatives that focus on sub-national levels are also being piloted in a number of countries (e.g. the Philippines). UNDP work in fighting corruption is rooted in the agency\u2019s over-all goal of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The UNDP approach to corruption and governance deficits is anchored in human development, concentrating on people\u2019s capacity to make choices about the life they wish to lead. It goes beyond economic well-being to include respect for principles of human rights, equality and freedom from oppression. To these ends, UNDP launched Integrity in Action (INTACT) in Phnom Penh (24\u201327 January 2007), the first regional Community of Practice of its kind. This meeting brought together UNDP practitioners, stakeholders and counterparts to share experiences and lessons learned in the area of anti-corruption. It also helped prepare for the 2007 Regional Human Development Report on Corruption. Following up on the INTACT launch, UNDP, together with UNODC, ADB, Transparency International and other partners, convened this regional training workshop on the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), held in Bangkok (Thailand), 13\u201315 October 2008.

The gap between the ethical standards that people expect from public officials and business leaders and what they see in practice is raising concerns about overall social integrity. Meanwhile, the current global financial crisis is propelling intense debate regarding the way the global financial system functions, raising additional integrity and transparency concerns. Asia is not being spared, in this period of financial and economic turmoil. And, despite remarkable economic progress in Asia-Pacific, 50 percent of the world\u2019s poor still live in this region. Perceived high levels of corruption remain, continuing to dilute regional development achievements. If we want to improve the lives of the millions of people who live in extreme poverty, then the fight against corruption has to be made a top priority at all levels. Corruption not only endangers the stability of democratic institutions, it also leads to discrimination in the delivery of services, thus violating human rights. The poor in particular, given that they suffer from corruption in their daily lives more than anyone else, deserve to enjoy the basic human right to live in a corruption-free society. UNCAC is clearly a landmark achievement in the global move to stop corruption. It represents an international response to corruption as a transnational phenomenon affecting all societies and economies, one that shows the need for international cooperation in prevention and control. It also provides benchmarks that allow civil society to hold Governments accountable for anti- corruption activities. Corruption seriously drains resources allocated for human development. UNDP considers UNCAC essential to the strengthening of democratic governance in support of poverty alleviation and human-rights protection. Indeed, promoting accountable and transparent governing institutions and respect for international norms and standards of integrity and accountability has become one of UNDP\u2019s fastest growing areas of support, both regionally and worldwide. At the global level, UNDP has just launched a new Global Programme on Anti-Corruption for Development Effectiveness. This initiative focuses on building and enhancing effective partnerships among various agencies and institutions working in the field of anti-corruption. Opening Session Session Reports \u201cCorruption seriously drains resources allocated for human development.\u201d 18 Supporting UNCAC implementation At the regional level, several regional networks have been established, notably the Anti-Corruption Practitioners Network (ACPN) for Eastern Europe and the CIS coordinated by the UNDP Bratislava Regional Centre and the Anti-Corruption Network in the Arab States, organized by the UNDP Regional Centre in Egypt. The Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) has just launched its new Asia Regional Governance Programme, which also contains an anti-corruption component, focusing mainly on support to UNCAC implementation and related public-sector reforms. The RCB has already taken practical steps to support UNCAC implementation. In 2005, it published a comparative study entitled \u2019Institutional Arrangements for Combating Corruption\u2018 that has been translated into various national languages in the region and is enjoying wide use. The Centre has produced television ads that vividly depict the losses to healthcare and education from corruption, and offers these ads to countries around the region. RCB has organized several training workshops on media and corruption. RCB also plans to train indigenous journalists through the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme, allowing them to better report on the governance issues that affect these communities in particular. \u2018Tackling Corruption, Saving Lives\u2019, UNDP\u2019s latest Regional Human Development Report, also addresses corruption and its impact on human development in the region. But the bulk of UNDP work in the region still directly targets the country level, where anti- corruption initiatives range from raising awareness to helping develop anti-corruption legislation and national integrity strategies, building the capacity of anti-corruption agencies and supporting the media and civil society. In addition, UNDP interventions in other governance-related areas \u2013 e.g. parliamentary reforms, access to justice, local governance and public administration reform \u2013 all contribute in a holistic manner to the strengthening of national integrity systems.

With the UNCAC now coming into force, the speaker stressed the immediate need to define the UNDP entry point vis-\u00e0-vis other UN organizations, most notably, and vis-\u00e0-vis other partners. The UNCAC preamble recognizes that corruption jeopardizes sustainable development. The UNCAC itself provides a comprehensive development framework calling for multi-disciplinary approaches, including preventive measures and law enforcement. No matter how comprehensive UNCAC might be, however, \u201cthe true measure of success of the United Nations is not how much we promise but how much we deliver for those who need us most\u201d. 1 Corruption entails enormous costs. According to World Bank Institute estimates, more than $US1 trillion is paid in bribes every year \u2013 just over 3 percent of world income in 2002. Corruption can inflate the cost of producing goods by as much as 20 percent. In fact, however, figures about corruption don\u2019t mean that much. The impact of corruption on the actual lives of people is much more striking, where illegal logging erodes sustainable livelihoods, faulty drugs endanger human lives, hiring of non-performers delivers poor public services, etc. In short, it is important to focus on the human face of anti-corruption. Corruption is not a disease; it\u2019s a symptom. The disease is governance deficits. UNDP should therefore focus on democratic governance in the context of environment and sustainable development, poverty reduction and crisis prevention and recovery. The first generation of UNDP AC support focused on accountability, transparency and integrity. UNCAC now has 128 ratifications, and the demand for AC interventions at country level is rising. Hence, UNDP recently launched the Global Thematic Programme on Anti-Corruption for Development Effectiveness (PACDE), which aims to develop capacity at the country, regional and global levels. 1 Kofi Annan\u2019s Nobel Peace prize acceptance speech. 20 Supporting UNCAC implementation Post-presentation discussion included questions about measuring corruption. The speaker observed that several diagnostic tools have been developed since the 1990s. Best known are the perception indexes, which have proven very useful for advocacy purposes and in raising public awareness, for example in Bangladesh (once ranked first on the Transparency International index). The UNCAC Conference of State Parties has now endorsed a move towards a more objective and nationally owned assessment, whereby countries are being compared against their own standards. One participant argued that corruption is only possible when institutional deficits exist, and that anti-corruption programming should address these deficits by promoting transparency, accountability and integrity and taking into account the voices of citizens. UNCAC does promote the involvement of civil society, notably the media, as well as access to information policies.

It\u2019s worth noting that the Convention does not propose a formal definition of corruption, since this might limit its scope where new forms of corruption evolved in future. During the past 12 years, various regional treaties have responded to the issue of corruption, but \u2013 either focusing only on specific regions or specific manifestations of corruption \u2013 all lacked the comprehensiveness required to address the issue effectively. The UNCAC is the first global comprehensive anti-corruption treaty introducing the concept of asset recovery and return to its rightful owners. It also promotes international cooperation as the basis for fighting corruption\u2019s cross-national nature. UNCAC comprises four components: prevention, criminalization/law enforcement, asset recovery and international cooperation. Negotiated in less than three years, a record time, the treaty was unanimously accepted by the UN General Assembly in 2003 and came into force on 14 December 2005 with 30 ratifications. Currently, 128 countries have ratified the Convention, with a fair balance between Asia-Pacific and other regions around the world. UNCAC describes different levels of obligation, among them mandatory provisions, measures that States need to consider, and optional measures. The treaty obliges Member States to establish one or more dedicated anti-corruption bodies for policy implementation and dissemination. These bodies must be independent, i.e. free from political influence, financially independent and adequately resourced, and their staff must be properly trained. The treaty also requires asset disclosure of politically exposed people (PEP), funding disclosure of political parties, involvement of civil society in the fight against corruption through access to information, private-sector requirements such as enhanced accounting, and independence of the prosecution and judiciary. 22 Supporting UNCAC implementation UNCAC is administered by UNODC, which provides secretarial support to the Conference of the States Parties (COSP), promotes further ratification and supports COPS working groups on review of implementation, asset recovery and technical assistance. The UNCAC monitoring mechanism is still evolving. Currently, a self-assessment checklist is being used to measure country performance in the implementation of selected UNCAC Articles from all four substantive chapters of the Convention. However, the survey is not designed to measure corruption or to index or rank countries based on their performance. The provision of development assistance is not linked to the implementation of the UNCAC. Instead, it is driven by the needs identified by requesting states. Among the reporting States Parties, 66 percent are in need of technical assistance to ensure or improve UNCAC implementation. UNCAC\u2019s criminalization and law-enforcement pillar includes five mandatory and six other offences of corruption that States parties are obliged to consider introducing into their domestic systems. The mandatory offences include bribery of national civil servants, \u2018active\u2019 bribery of international civil servants, embezzlement, money laundering and obstruction of justice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1294f345-548a-42b5-beee-874f21b620b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "1294f345-548a-42b5-beee-874f21b620b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "46394b5fe6a935ab7b44cad09559ccf7293e496554fb20a44b9acc183f43245b"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cb8cf8e-94cd-4cca-b48b-2f344bd29893", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd403869298630389d01ca19f35f9557630c6dc5353ee8e912804c5c08c95ff8"}}, "hash": "9285301ff6ce8b314dc9dd55b9b57d5be4a75d46a621353828ece74279803568", "text": "The six non-mandatory offences are \u2018passive\u2019 bribery of international civil servants, trading in influence, abuse of function, illicit enrichment, bribery and embezzlement in the private sector.

The treaty includes various articles regulating mutual legal assistance, extradition and other international cooperation measures such as joint investigations. UNCAC\u2019s asset-recovery provisions are based on the principle that confiscated proceeds of corruption need to be returned to legitimate owners (individual or state), a very recent development in international law. Previously, the return of assets was at the discretion of the confiscating State, and later attempts to settle the recovery of assets introduced sharing arrangements and joint disposal. However, the UNCAC clearly specifies that there is no longer any discretionary element \u2013 all proceeds should be returned without conditions to their country of origin and rightful owners. The World Bank and UNODC launched the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) in 2007 to assist Member Countries in building legal capacity to initiate legal action, meet evidential requirements and enable countries to manage their asset-recovery cases, both forensic and investigative. It also promotes legal and institutional reform (e.g. assistance to specific departments). Yara Esquivel presented the topic of \u2018Strengthening the Ability of Developing Countries to Recover Assets Stolen or Hidden in Foreign Jurisdictions: What has been Accomplished with UNCAC? What Remains to be Done?\u2019. UNCAC\u2019s innovative asset-recovery provisions create a common platform upon which to address this issue from a law-enforcement perspective. UNCAC specifies various articles and provisions dealing with asset recovery. International cooperation is a great advancement, since previously the process to obtain legal assistance was very time \u201cUNCAC clearly represents a landmark achievement in the global move to stop corruption.\u201d consuming. UNCAC has revolutionized mutual legal assistance (MLA) and eliminated many unnecessary steps. The Convention provides formal rules for asset-recovery mechanisms, repatriation and freezing of assets. Subsequent discussion looked at issues of transparency and effectiveness of development aid in post-conflict situations, and whether UNCAC provisions help reduce corruption under these circumstances, i.e. situations where, instead of being delivered through the Government, aid is provided directly through sub-contractors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It became clear that corruption also affects international public officials, something that is covered in UNCAC provisions. Given the implementation of private-sector non-mandatory offences as stipulated in the UNCAC, private-sector corruption can also be criminalized and included within national penal codes. The point was also raised that national levels of corruption remain relatively low in countries such as Japan and Australia, even though they do not have dedicated anti-corruption bodies, with the relevant responsibilities spread across various institutions. UNCAC calls for specific anti-corruption bodies covering prevention, investigation and enforcement (Articles 6 & 36). However, these functions can be either combined into one body (the combined model) or shared across a number of them. Whether combined or not, these bodies must be independent from the government executive and able to function effectively. There are three generic models: combined prevention, investigation and enforcement; prevention in one body, with investigation and enforcement combined in another; and each of the three functions covered by a separate body. There is insufficient data to determine which is the most effective model. In any case, it is crucial that those bodies enjoy strong political backing. Participants asked whether the UNCAC reporting mechanism also documents successes, lessons learned and failures in the fight against corruption of Member States in order to promote ratification among other countries. By way of clarification, they learned that the UNCAC review mechanism is only a method of collecting information and, only newly implemented, the mechanism has yet to define typical reactions to its assessments. So far, only one cycle of information collection has been completed (2007); a second one is currently underway. Questions arose concerning the tracking of official development assistance (ODA) and special/ discretionary funds. This is another area where political support is needed to ensure transparency in bidding processes, etc. A further question was raised as to why ODA should not be linked to UNCAC implementation. It was explained that such conditionality was to be avoided, since sectoral ODA, for example, should not be linked to anti-corruption progress, as this may have an impact on the poor and vulnerable, who cannot be held responsible for insufficient implementation of the UNCAC by their Governments.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "13e28faf-3451-44c4-8dda-a6adaf4a031d": {"__data__": {"id_": "13e28faf-3451-44c4-8dda-a6adaf4a031d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2341ebaea26e9f70ac920c2d92a721484447eaf240be622d607bccf1a4f53ed9"}, "2": {"node_id": "76af52ab-dc7c-4068-b14e-b99d3dc61c61", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "371271cbbb0bc0671d00f04b2515f15bc41992ecfc7254ab2befaf30c4ec71b1"}}, "hash": "e561ddbbb4469935e9486d09b8b4a21f1e1d6aa4561d2245f48fdca2c191ab4b", "text": "\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 23 24 Supporting UNCAC implementation One query concerned the best institutional model to adopt in implementing the UNCAC in small island developing states (SIDSs) and least-developed countries (LDCs) contexts, since those countries often lack resources and capacities for successful UNCAC management.

In terms of UNCAC implementation, it was said, it is the prerogative of the respective ratifying country to directly implement the treaty or to apply its provisions through incorporation into such domestic legislation as penal codes. UNCAC provisions on proceeds from crime, participants learned, only pertain to those obtained from corruption-related crimes. But there is usually no need to first prove a corruption crime before asset-recovery actions can be initiated. Money laundering is a crime in itself, and can be referred for direct prosecution; parallel investigations of corruption and money laundering are also possible. Some countries, however, require that a given crime be proven before proceeding to the recovery of proceeds from the crime. No online depository provides data on countries that have fully satisfied all UNCAC requirements. (In fact, no country is considered fully compliant with the UNCAC provisions at this stage, and it is hard to imagine this being ever possible.) However, an official online directory with contact details for all central authorities for mutual legal assistance is under development. The data is already available in rudimentary form in the declarations made by State parties upon ratification of the Convention and on the International Centre for Asset Recovery\u2019s website. If someone receives an asset as a bribe in a foreign country, a civil lawsuit based on UNCAC can be initiated. The question arose as to whether, if the respective State or Government does not take action, an NGO can pursue corruption cases. Though the UNCAC only refers to State parties, civil society has been successful in pushing Governments to pursue cases. But any individual or legal person (as per law) can claim damages and compensation, and States can also be victims of corruption in court. Whether civil or criminal action for asset recovery is more effective or appropriate depends on the specific case at issue. Civil cases usually take longer than criminal cases but, since UNCAC authorizes preventive freezing orders, time considerations might not be an issue. Both avenues can be pursued. In conclusion, UNCAC represents a milestone achievement in the fight against corruption. It introduces a comprehensive anti-corruption framework consisting of prevention, implementation/ law enforcement, asset recovery and international cooperation obligations. The asset-recovery provisions and mutual legal assistance in particular present real innovations as part of the international cooperation element, and have catalyzed the fight against multinational corruption crimes. \u201cUNCAC is the first global comprehensive anti-corruption treaty introducing the concept of asset recovery and return to its rightful owners.\u201d 25 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 3 UNDP anti-corruption efforts in Asia-Pacific Chair: Fathmath Anoola, Assistant Director, Anti Corruption Board Maldives Speakers: Pauline Tamesis, Coordinator for Asia Regional Governance Programme, RCB Ernesto Bautista, Governance Team Leader, UNDP Pacific Centre Rapporteur: Masood Amer, Assistant Country Director a.i., UNDP Afghanistan Two key messages emerged from this session. Firstly, there was the issue of a gift-giving culture, and how, especially in the Pacific, certain traditions may be misinterpreted as corrupt practices. Secondly, the importance of political will was highlighted as one of the key ingredients for success. While the corruption perception index (CPI) makes a good advocacy tool, multi-dimensional approaches are necessary in preventing corruption. Necessary ingredients include political will and commitment, since corruption is often political in nature. \u2018Political will\u2019 was seen to include \u2018room for maneuver\u2019 by policy-makers at all levels, from the highest level to the community level. Several countries in the region have made significant progress in recent years. However, according to Transparency International\u2019s Global Corruption Report 2008, 22 out of 32 countries still scored below 5 in the CPI, with New Zealand as the cleanest country and the Union of Myanmar and Afghanistan at the bottom of the list. Sixteen countries in the region have now ratified the UNCAC. The Asia-Pacific region, rich in cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, is also characterized by growing inequalities and a wide range of political systems. Nevertheless, countries in the region have undertaken some similar approaches in tackling corruption \u2013 e.g. formulating anti-corruption strategies, adopting UNCAC implementation-monitoring plans and (e.g. in Mongolia) crafting supplementary strategies with sectoral approaches.

Countries in the region have also paid more attention to assets declaration, with emphasis on accountability and screening of public officials. Bhutan, for example, has formulated a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy tackling this issue in the public sector. Ernesto Bautista\u2019s presentation on UNDP anti- corruption initiatives in the Pacific highlighted distinctive features of the region, where national populations range from 5,000 to 5,000,000 people, and where many countries remain in post-colonial situations with limited experiences in governance and institution building. In consequence, a regional approach is being developed with options for regional accountability, including the possible establishment of a regional ombudsman mechanism. Other UNDP initiatives include advocacy for ratification of UNCAC (so far only PNG and Fiji have ratified the Convention), support for the development of national anti-corruption action plans, advocacy for freedom to information, developing capacity of the media, support for social accountability initiatives, and the establishment of a NHRC in PNG. Key development partners for the region include the Pacific Forum Secretariat and national government agencies, e.g. PIC Ombudsman Offices, the Commonwealth Ombudsman of Australia, CSOs and AusAid. Challenges to implementing anti-corruption programmes in the Pacific include very limited capacity, both technically and financially, on the part of most Pacific island countries (PICs); limited reach and presence of the central Government; limited public understanding of the core functions of Government; aspects of cultural practices such as gifting; and political will. Key issues for sustainability include political will; building broad-based public awareness and understanding of the reforms; building accountability mechanisms in the provision of service delivery; and, given the limited capacity, a strategic incremental/regional approach. For quick facts on accountability institutions in the region, see the presentation. In a final observation, one of the speakers remarked that corruption is a complex phenomenon requiring collective responses. Picking up on a comment made earlier, it was stressed that UNDP also needs to practise what it preaches and improve its internal capacity and transparency. The establishment of ethics measures, ethics training, disclosure of assets, stronger audit and review mechanisms are examples of efforts to improve UNDP\u2019s internal system and accountability. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cPolitical will is one of the key ingredients for success.\u201d 27 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 4 Anti-corruption programming (Incl. experience from Malaysia) Chair: Francisco de Carvalho, National Director, Office of Inspector General, Timor-Leste Speakers: Phil Matsheza, Policy Adviser, Anti-Corruption, UNDP BDP/DGG Patrick Keuleers, Senior Policy Advisor, Public Administration Reform & Anti-Corruption and Governance Practice Team Leader, UNDP RCB Sandra Nicoll, Governance and Capacity Development, ADB Anis Yusal Yusoff, Director, Political Sector, Institut Integriti Malaysia Rapporteur: Panvirush Vittayapraphakul, Programme Assistant, UNDP This session addressed UNDP\u2019s corporate approach to supporting UNCAC implementation. It discussed programming options with a view to identifying ways to mainstream support for UNCAC implementation. Participants also discussed ideas for new initiatives with programmatic value, partnership strategies, funding possibilities, and management arrangements. Phil Matsheza clarified the basis for anti- corruption programming, which may differ from one country to another. For example, it might be the result of a self-assessment processed by UNODC, in follow-up to a needs assessment or scoping mission, or in order to meet international demands (EU entry requirements, MCA criteria or expectations from donors). International anti-corruption cooperation has two faces: corruption prevention, and combating corruption. UNDP\u2019s niche is in the prevention side, i.e. developing AC policies, AC bodies and AC mechanisms in supporting the private sector, civil society and the media. (Refer to UNCAC Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.)

Examples of potential AC interventions at the country level were also mentioned. Finally, he summarized the guidelines for AC programming: engage all relevant stakeholders (public, private, CSOs and judges) both in formulating programme and monitoring progress; get the process right (e.g. sufficient consultations and risk analysis); take into account the sustainability issue from the outset (resources may be readily available for national initiative, but it is hard to secure enough resources for sectoral programmes); be realistic while", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c2794a9-4a40-4402-b15a-a41a88901e68": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c2794a9-4a40-4402-b15a-a41a88901e68", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0fd484d0bdadd16c1daa6a104057faad9e5f830457fadc37a527f6738d98131"}, "3": {"node_id": "29c2cfa1-7f17-4058-80a5-1d6b27db488a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "02b405133a573d056d4d058fe2421dbb1e7dedf6fd478fb28d86280d0722df87"}}, "hash": "90343fe2d82a6c6d1eeffceb1d1521ff6d422ecb9d96c392e26beda6db55d32c", "text": "developing a project/ programme; the programme should be knowledge-based; project the programme within a realistic timeframe (e.g. the lifespan of a government); note that prioritization and sequencing are important, but that they are context specific; if possible, conduct gap and risk analyses to determine entry points and to effectively prioritize and sequence interventions; adopt joint assistance strategies for better resource mobilization and coordination (e.g. working groups with donors and national counterparts); incorporate national anti-corruption plans within development strategy documents; promote sectoral approaches, e.g. education or justice could prove effective, but they should be a part of a broader strategy (not stand-alone initiatives) from the perspective of sustaining AC initiative; build upon the insight that corruption is a cross-cutting issue (this gives one more opportunities for programming); seize the opportunities for AC intervention (appropriate times include after an election; after regime change; post-scandal and post-conflict situations); and from the outset, be clear about responsibilities (establish who is going to be responsible for what). Patrick Keuleers presented AC entry points through sectoral programming. This recent trend differs from the comprehensive approach, focusing on specific sectors such as education, health or justice. Advantages of the sectoral approach include these: its potential to produce tangible results relatively quickly; its capacity to recognize the particularity of organizational cultures in different sectors, and the need to look at the details of particular professional practices (e.g. in maternal health); its obvious link with poverty eradication and the pursuit of the MDGs; its promotion of participatory approaches with civil society and the private sector; its compatibility with \u2018one UN\u2019 programming (e.g. with UNICEF, WHO, UNESCO, depending on the sector) to enhance development effectiveness; and \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cSectoral anti-corruption programming in health, education and clean water supply helps achieving the MDGs.\u201d 29 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region sectoral approaches at the micro-level can find that political leadership is more pronounced and political will more readily available than they are in comprehensive approaches at the macro-level. UNCAC support for sectoral approaches is found in Articles 5 (preventive AC policies and practices), 7 (public sector), 8 (code of conduct, asset declarations, whistle- blowing and disciplinary measures), 9 (procurement and financial management), 10 (transparency, public reporting and simplification), 12 (private sector), and 13 (participation of civil society and media). A number of elements need to be considered when using the sectoral approach: surveys and diagnosis of risks and vulnerabilities; expenditure tracking; benchmarks and indicators; regulatory review/licences; codes of ethics/conduct; ethics and HR training; incentive systems; complaints mechanisms/whistle blowing; access to information; introduction of information and communication technologies (ICTs); and pilot initiatives. Sectoral programming should focus on the MDGs (health, education, water and sanitation, and natural resource management) and legal empowerment at the local level. To succeed with sectoral programming, one must find the right champions and work with them. At the same time, all relevant stakeholders must be involved in the initiative. Complaint mechanisms must be set up. Finally, monitoring and evaluation system must be sufficiently effective. Sandra Nicoll presented risk assessments in governance and capacity development programming. In 2005, ADB reviewed implementation of its policies and looked into core government institutions. Although the policies were relevant, they were only partially implemented, and insufficient to tackle corruption. Action plans proved overly ambitious, while resources were spread too thinly, with not enough invested to mainstream the policies in ADB sector work. Therefore, the Second Governance & Anti-Corruption Action Plan (GACAP II) adopted a risk-based approach to governance assessment. This offers a better tool to combat corruption. Three priorities (thematic areas) were chosen because they proved most effective: public financial management, procurement, and combating corruption. Using a risk-based approach in AC initiatives assists Governments in prioritizing actions and investments needed to strengthen systems and reduce risks over time. ADB investment can therefore be more sharply focused on addressing major risks to development effectiveness. There follows a graphic representation of the workflow in implementing GACAP II. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 30 Supporting UNCAC implementation Anis Yusal Yusoff presented Malaysia\u2019s experience in public-sector reforms and anti-corruption programming.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29c2cfa1-7f17-4058-80a5-1d6b27db488a": {"__data__": {"id_": "29c2cfa1-7f17-4058-80a5-1d6b27db488a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0fd484d0bdadd16c1daa6a104057faad9e5f830457fadc37a527f6738d98131"}, "2": {"node_id": "5c2794a9-4a40-4402-b15a-a41a88901e68", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "90343fe2d82a6c6d1eeffceb1d1521ff6d422ecb9d96c392e26beda6db55d32c"}}, "hash": "02b405133a573d056d4d058fe2421dbb1e7dedf6fd478fb28d86280d0722df87", "text": "He began his presentation by referring to the Report of the Commission of Enquiry into the Integrity of the Public Services, Federation of Malaya (1952), which emphasizes that the key to success with AC initiatives is \u2018the attitude of the public\u2019.

The latter initiative aimed to measure levels of public understanding and perceptions of corruption to gauge how effectively the National Integrity Plan was being implemented, and to ensure that efforts towards improving the integrity agenda were conducted in a systematic, consolidated and continuous manner. In addition, ASEAN Integrity Dialogues were introduced as a channel for discussion of global and regional issues related to values, ethics and integrity.

The Commission will table its annual report with this parliamentary committee, and members of the committee can seek further clarification. A delegate from Bhutan shared his country\u2019s experience with simplifying public-sector procedures through a standard cost model, assessing the administrative burdens and the effectiveness of service delivery. All governmental entities assess the administrative burden and report to the Ministry of Finance, which sets targets to reduce bureaucracy under penalty of a reduced budget. A delegate from Afghanistan underlined the role of citizens and civil society, as they are the ultimate victims of corruption and need more attention as stakeholders. It is also important, he suggested, to think about protection for public officials with integrity, e.g. judges and police officers who are sometimes targeted simply for performing their duties. One participant noted that sectoral approaches address day-to-day issues among the citizens at large, and may better address public discontent. \u201cInternational anti-corruption cooperation has two faces: corruption prevention, and combating corruption.

Sound MDG practices that promote transparency and accountability are adapted and replicated at the community level, ensuring that the MDGs are achieved with integrity. Recommendations include the need to localize UNCAC provisions down to the village level; the need to monitor progress and provide technical support to ICs beyond project life; and the need to document best practices and popularize them for easy use and dissemination. 33 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Davaadulam Tsegmed presented Mongolia\u2019s integrity initiative in the health sector. A variety of public-opinion surveys have found that health professionals are perceived as being among the most corrupt public servants in Mongolia. The Government increased transparency and accountability in the Ministry of Health and selected health organizations through identifying current constraints and bottleneck areas, developing mechanisms to address them, and promoting staff ethics and integrity through open discussions, training, codes of conduct and complaints handling. Addressing ethics and integrity issues requires long-term engagement. W.A. Jayasundara presented the Sri Lanka Clean Hands Campaign and its experience with recruiting public officials in a voluntary fight against corruption. This initiative recognizes and rewards outstanding public officials, eliminates systems and procedures that lead to corrupt practices, and provides a forum for discussion of corruption prevention and best practices. The campaign identified these challenges: a general neutrality and reluctance to talk openly about corruption among many public officers; lack of professionalism; low competency among top management; lack of resources to provide efficient service delivery; weak political commitment; disorganized civil society; poor salaries and perks for public servants; and the monopolistic nature of public services. Public officers are afraid of speaking openly against corruption, though only a few are themselves involved in corruption. An \u2018alliance\u2019 was formed of officers wishing to establish a \u2018clean\u2019 public service. Chi Nai Chong provided lessons from Asia-Pacific on transparency and integrity in public procurement. The ADB, recognizing the need for long-term commitment, is involved in an initiative to achieve these goals. Lessons learned so far: the need to benchmark national procurement systems, looking at procurement laws and regulations and OECD baseline compliance and performance indicators; the importance of executing-agency capacity assessments that look at procurement risks and training requirements; the benefits of e-government procurement and capacity development. Session discussions also addressed the following issues: the importance of citizen involvement in combating corruption; the need for \u2018clean\u2019 public servants who also serve as advocates within their respective public- service systems; the importance of addressing all issues related to combating corruption, rather than just focusing on law enforcement to the possible neglect of prevention; and \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 34 Supporting UNCAC implementation the need to address the issue of remuneration for public servants in an effort to ensure that all receive a \u2018livable\u2019 wage. Other questions and issues raised during this period included these: Should we focus on traditional prevention or on innovative ways of combating corruption that incorporate cultural values and norms? What was the political reaction at the local level concerning the MDG, Decentralization and Corruption Initiative in the Philippines? How was the \u2018alliance\u2019 (Harnessing Voluntary Public Officials Initiative: the Sri Lanka Clean Hands Campaign) of public servants in Sri Lanka initiated? How do we tackle public servants who do not want to obtain accreditation in procurement matters because of fears of audits, etc.? Is not public-sector reform, specifically that regarding remuneration, also significantly linked to combating corruption? Should we not be supporting the reality that public servants must earn a livable wage in order to prevent \u2018survival corruption\u2019? Discussion included ideas that preventive measures are essential in combating corruption, and that public orientation in the context of \u2018How corrupt are you?\u2019 in relation to budget execution and personnel management, are important, and that loopholes must be closed. Concerning the development of \u2018integrity circles\u2019, it is essential to promote advocacy, mobilize committees, and let political leaders understand that the public is involved and motivated. Typically, once political leaders observe the success of integrity circles they often challenge others to participate. It was learned that the \u2018alliance\u2019 initiative developed in Sri Lanka was not created by legislation, but is a voluntary organization, and members have to adhere to a set of ethical standards and by- laws to maintain their membership.

But concerns were expressed about decentralization and how it would effect the fight against corruption, especially since most anti-corruption programmes target the national level. In addition, viewing public servants as citizens, not just as public servants, and encouraging their involvement in combating corruption as a citizen, is an approach that might prove effective in many areas.

Since the start of the democratization process in 1998, serious efforts to reform the judicial sector have been made, including these: establishing the independence of the judiciary; developing blueprints for the reform of judicial institutions; establishing new legal institutions, including independent commissions on the judiciary, the public prosecution and the national police; an anti-corruption commission; and an anti-money laundering agency; and the adoption of anti-corruption laws and regulations, notably a law and a national plan on corruption eradication, a law on witness protection (to protect whistle-blowers), ratification of UNCAC, and guidelines on bureaucracy reform. Despite all the progress, public perceptions of the Indonesian judiciary related to corruption remain rather negative. Challenges to judicial integrity reform, meanwhile, are numerous, and include the following: the mentality of state justice providers; low salaries among justice providers; an institutional arrangement unconducive to anti-corruption initiatives; lack of capacity and knowledge among justice providers; a prevailing culture that is permissive of corrupt practices; and lack of political will, especially among local politicians. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 36 Supporting UNCAC implementation Several development assistance organizations support judicial integrity reform. UNDP is a relatively new player focusing on access to justice and legal empowerment for the poor. A joint UNDP-UNODC scoping mission is planned for November 2008 to assess needed support for internal oversight mechanisms such as the Supreme Court, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and the National Police. Andrew Boname presented efforts to improve judicial integrity in Asia. As UNCAC Article 11, Section 1 states: \u201cBearing in mind the independence of the judiciary and its crucial role in combating corruption, each State party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system and without prejudice to judicial independence, take measures to strengthen integrity and to prevent opportunities for corruption among members of the judiciary. Such measures may include rules with respect to the conduct of the judiciary.\u201d The judiciary is prone to corruption in accordance with Robert Klitgaard\u2019s formula of corruption (C = Monopoly + Discretion \u2013 Accountability). The justice sector has a monopoly on deciding legal rights, enjoys discretion (judicial independence) and has limited accountability to other branches of government. To improve judicial integrity, procedural measures should therefore be taken to decrease discretion or increase accountability (for examples, see presentation).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3d447061-616a-464e-9503-bf353cbf72c6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3d447061-616a-464e-9503-bf353cbf72c6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b2f1d301f45160196b13ca9dc4c6f35096d79a7278f4e9bf74a34aa00ca87255"}, "2": {"node_id": "91b2252f-ebe1-4700-9d68-5900e62e893a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9addd7f105caa322817b9783b59ef3799deccd4d9121613edd3e0b25228caf57"}}, "hash": "278b65e127cb98e45a0792c59276da1d7b20edbc78a8e4bc0790f9f3927701d3", "text": "Measures applied in Asia include these: rolling out an inter-disciplinary course on corruption, governance and impunity in law faculties across the Philippines; a pilot study in the use of verbatim hearing records in Thailand; adopting a mechanism for lawyers, through the bar association in Viet Nam, to file complaints against judges for improper conduct.

Vanessa Chang provided insights from Fiji in terms of accountability and fighting corruption in the judicial sector. The key legislation in Fiji is included in the penal code, which is out-dated, has an unusually complex drafting style, and is difficult to read, analyze and understand. The layout is extremely confusing. However, attempts to pass legislation in the area of corruption have met with little success. Improving judicial integrity will require procedural measures to decrease discretion or increase accountability. In the discussions, one participant requested examples of measures to control commercial bribery in China. Zhang Yumei described China\u2019s practice regarding investigation, prosecution and trial of offences involving commercial bribery. Another participant asked why one should bother paying a lawyer if you can buy a judge. Since this is not uncommon in some countries, it is necessary to adopt a code of conduct for judicial personnel and increase salaries for judges. The judges should be entitled to immunity for the decisions they make in court, but not for their conduct outside court proceedings. The risk of executive interference with the judiciary can be offset if judicial bodies establish their own codes of conduct and complaints procedures. This presupposes, of course, that the judiciary is willing to do this. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cTo improve judicial integrity, procedural measures should be taken to decrease discretion or increase accountability.\u201d 38 Supporting UNCAC implementation Session 7 Anti-corruption programming for oversight mechanisms (Incl. experiences from the Philippines and Pakistan) Chair: Irman Lanti, Head a.i.

Ms. Baliton focused on elements of a multi-pronged anti-corruption strategy aimed at strengthening policy frameworks and institutional capacities, developing integrity systems, and coordinating for multi-sectoral convergence. The policy and legislative frameworks are aimed at systemic solutions to governance and to provide enabling environment to combat corruption. Farhan Sabih introduced the topic \u2018Grievance Mechanisms as Vehicles for Accountability\u2019, a programme aimed at enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of grievance-redress mechanisms in Pakistan by aligning the redress and response systems and procedures with the needs and expectations of citizens; increasing public demand for accountability and transparency in service delivery; and facilitating availability of and access to information regarding grievance redress mechanisms and service delivery standards. Discussions focused on the role and mandate of ombudsmen in fighting corruption and, in particular, the jurisdiction to prosecute criminal cases and impose penalties. The perception that the ombudsman\u2019s office primarily has the mandate to investigate complaints of maladministration and to present its findings and recommendations raises questions about its effectiveness and efficacy.

Founded in 1989, the centre is an independent non-profit media agency that helps nurture a culture of investigative reporting in old and new media in the Philippines and across Asia. The centre produces investigative reports, runs training seminar-workshops, publishes an online magazine, a news blog and a database, and produces books, films and documentaries (see www.pcij.org). The investigative process begins with a tip or a first lead, an initial investigation and an investigative hypothesis. The initial investigation is very important. The process includes following paper, people, electronic and legal trails. Malou Mangahas presented two case studies: \u2018Investigating President Joseph Estrada: Millions, Mansions and Mistresses\u2019, and \u2018The Philippine ODA Trail: Seven in 10 Projects Fail to Deliver Promised Benefits\u2019 (see presentation for further details). Charmaine Rodrigues talked about the right to information as a cross-cutting anti-corruption approach for the media, the private sector and civil society. In 1946, the UN General Assembly proclaimed freedom of information as \u201ca fundamental human right and the touchstone for all freedoms\u201d. The right to information underpins many other human rights, for example the right to food in India. Subsidized food rations were embezzled and sold by middlemen until poor people obtained the right to monitor the food distribution process. In East Africa, education 40 Supporting UNCAC implementation grants disappeared until the introduction of pro-active publication in schools of education grants allowed parents to verify the amounts allocated to local officials and to raise questions about the use of those funds. Freedom-of-information legislation has been progressively introduced in several Asia- Pacific countries. In 2008, Indonesia, the Cook Islands and Bangladesh joined a list that now comprises 11 countries; other countries include provisions in their constitution or clauses in administrative law. UNCAC promotes access to information as an anti-corruption strategy. One of the best ways to implement the right to information is through mandatory pro-active disclosure clauses (e.g. in the United Mexican States). The right to information should not be seen exclusively as a media right \u2013 it is a strong development right, and it supports the human rights-based approach to anti-corruption programming. Jairo Acuna-Alfaro provided insights from Viet Nam on the role of civil society in the fight against corruption. Evidence from both the 10 largest GDP countries and the APEC economies suggest a linear correlation between \u2018voice and accountability\u2019 and \u2018control of corruption\u2019, \u2018government effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018control of corruption\u2019, and \u2018voice and accountability\u2019 and \u2018government effectiveness\u2019. Corruption should not be fought for the sake of fighting corruption, but as a means to improve the efficiency of public administration. Although Viet Nam has changed its rank on the TI CPI, its actual score hasn\u2019t changed from year to year. So corruption in Viet Nam is neither increasing nor decreasing. Rather, there is a clear and constant pattern of corruption. Petty corruption is most prevalent, but in recent years high-level scandals involving grand corruption have also surfaced.

Giovanni Gallo observed that, six months after the signing of the UNCAC, the UN Global Compact adopted a tenth principle to the effect that \u201cbusinesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery\u201d. He also pointed to a remarkable change over the last five years among companies who asserted they had nothing to do with UNODC, drugs, crime and corruption. From saying they had clean hands and were victims of public corruption, these companies now instead acknowledge that UNODC and UNCAC can help them reduce corruption in their companies and in the countries where they do business. Numerous corruption scandals start and end in the private sector. In December of 2007, at the Bali Conference of State Parties of the UNCAC, all stakeholders agreed to adopt the Bali Business Declaration. This declaration commits to working towards the alignment of business principles with the fundamental values enshrined in the UNCAC; towards developing mechanisms to review company compliance with realigned business principles; and towards strengthening private- public partnerships for combating corruption in business. UNODC, in accordance with these commitments, is currently working on a number of joint projects with the private sector. During the discussions, one participant referred to experiences from Bangladesh, where public- private partnerships to fight corruption have been initiated. Fighting corruption is only possible if the people really support the campaign. The fact that Bangladesh figured as \u2018most corrupt country in the world\u2019 in a TI CPI contributed much to raising awareness. Following a gap analysis presented to Parliament and following the Bali Conference, the Government took several steps to address the issue, including the passage of legislation governing the right to information, mandatory disclosure of eight types of information for running election candidates, and transparency measures in procurement. A participant from Afghanistan asked what measures could be taken against corruption in the private sector. Mr. Gallo pointed out that bribery and embezzlement in the private sector figure in the UNCAC chapter on criminalization. In this light, penal codes should be amended to include these offenses. Companies need to understand that corruption does not benefit anyone. Another participant observed that the culture of corruption is sometimes based on pity for underpaid civil servants, and that the people at large may be part and parcel of a corruption culture. Finally, one participant referred to the potential advantages of new technology such as blogs, YouTube and SMSs, asking how the new media could be used to fight corruption, and suggesting, for one thing, that these tools should make it much easier to publicize the truth. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cCompanies need to understand that corruption does not benefit anyone.\u201d 42 Supporting UNCAC implementation Session 9 Synergies with other regional and international actors Chair: Mohamed Anil, Commissioner of Legal Reforms, Ministry of Legal Reforms, Maldives Speakers: Sandra Nicoll, Governance and Capacity Development, ADB Luckshmi Jayawickrama, Director General, CIABOC, Sri Lanka Dan Dionisie, Public Administration Reform and Anti-Corruption Adviser, UNDP Regional Service Centre Bratislava Rapporteur: Laurentina Barreto Soares, Programme Officer, Governance Unit, UNDP Timor Leste Sandra Nicoll introduced the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific, launched in 1999 by a group of Asia-Pacific countries to more proactively address corruption in the region.

The Commission investigates complaints against public servants as well as members of the general public in respect of incidents of bribery, corruption and accumulation of wealth beyond known income. In performing this function, the Commission has encountered three important obstacles: reluctance among persons with grievances to complain to the Commission \u2013 a consequence, at least in part, of too-often repeated postponements of trials in law courts and the absence of a whistle-blowers protection Act; a prevailing willingness in the private sector to grease the palms of state officials so they will do their job; and insufficient state funds to combat bribery and corruption or to act quickly to strengthen the prevailing law. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 43 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Supported by international funding, the Commission works closely with CSOs to raise awareness among the general public and state officials regarding their rights and duties.

Dan Dionisie shared lessons on regional anti-corruption cooperation in Eastern Europe and the CIS. The UNDP Bratislava Regional Centre, for example, established an Anti-Corruption Practitioners Network (ACPN). The ACPN facilitates professional networking, information sharing, expert referral, technical advice and capacity development for anti-corruption agencies (ACAs). Capacity development focuses on the preventive and educational ACA functions of policy development, coordination, monitoring, research, education, and public awareness. Regional cooperation is relatively easy in the Eastern Europe and CIS region because most of these countries have ratified international legal instruments such as UNCAC, OECD and CoE anti-corruption Conventions. It is also interesting that several countries already have well-established ACAs, and are relatively successful in combating the levels of public corruption, while others are still struggling to start up basic AC functions and institutions. All countries in post-communist transition face comparable challenges in fighting corruption. (For details on lessons learned, approaches and challenges, refer to the presentation.) Overall, challenges for ACAs reflect general public-sector difficulties. One must recognize that quick fixes and shortcuts cannot be sustained in the long run. There is no alternative to overall public-administration reform and capacity development, something that requires persistent long-term engagement. Other questions raised by participants included these: whether development agencies should allow media access to their contractors blacklist; what can be done to improve in-country networking within specific sectors and between different sectors; and whether ICTs play significant roles in combating corruption. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cRegional knowledge sharing among Anti-Corruption Agencies contributes significantly to their overall capacity development and effectiveness.\u201d 44 Supporting UNCAC implementation In response to the first of these questions, the ADB representative suggested that sharing information with the public and the media was important as an act of transparency, even though every organization will have its own disclosure policies. This having said, it\u2019s well recognized that ADB itself is a multilateral organization with a very liberal public-disclosure information policy. Responding to the other questions, the speakers suggested that the regional approach to combating corruption is not the only solution and not enough. It would instead be useful to link country offices and agencies within countries, and to apply IT and e-governance to promote anti- corruption efforts. IT alone does not help much, however; it must be supplemented by back-office support and the efforts of various stakeholders and units. In conclusion, it is important to develop synergies between different anti-corruption players at the national, regional and global levels.

The clinics considered human rights, natural-resource revenue management, gender, post-conflict reconstruction, and international-aid transparency, focusing on linkages with UNCAC, challenges and programming entry points for UNDP in democratic governance initiatives. Clinic 1 Human rights and anti-corruption Presenters/facilitators: Sudarshan and Phil Matsheza Rapporteur: Samarajoo Manikam, Malaysia UNCAC linkages. Although the fight against corruption aims to enhance human rights, in some instances it may instead encroach on these rights. Human rights Conventions have existed for many years, while UNCAC is only recent. But common principles include accountability, rule of law, right to information, transparency, non-discrimination and participation. Thus there is convergence between UNCAC provisions and the human rights expressed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), etc. Challenges. Corruption leads to discrimination, contravening the human-rights mandate, which is based on non-discrimination. Does democracy help reduce corruption? In some democracies, the problem occurs at rather high bureaucratic levels and proves hard to tackle. \u2022 \u2022 46 Supporting UNCAC implementation Programming entry points. Look for the middle path, ensuring that individual human rights are respected whilst at the same time enforcement agencies fight corruption. Explore ways of dealing with corrupt people other than putting them behind bars, for example through people\u2019s forums where offenders (if there is sufficient evidence) are named and shamed. Such an approach has worked in parts of India, where offenders have thereby been induced to voluntarily return misused funds. Clinic 2 Natural-resource revenue management Presenter/facilitator: Pauline Tamesis Rapporteur: Saiful Bhuiyan, Bangladesh UNCAC linkages. Natural-resource management and UNCAC both aim at sustainable development. UNCAC supports public reporting, CSO oversight, and people\u2019s empowerment. Other UNCAC links relate to non-tax revenue lost or diverted, criminal offenses, and abuse of public authority. Challenges. Proper policies for management of natural resources are needed. One challenge is the privatization of public policies because, in some LDCs, Governments have limited bargaining power and companies formulate policies tainted by their own interests. In some cases, moreover, lack of advanced capacity leads to limited understanding of the concept of natural-resource management. Programming entry points. These include assistance in natural-resource management through sharing experiences and practices; ensuring government/company accountability by citizen empowerment; and assistance for LDCs with procurement and contracts when there is a lack of bargaining power. Clinic 3 Gender and corruption Presenter/facilitator: Roohi Metcalfe Rapporteur: Charmaine Rodrigues, UNDP Pacific Centre Preliminary reflections. In future training, gender should be addressed in the plenary as an integral part of analysis and implementation. Men and women can be both victims and perpetrators of corruption. They are both agents of change. Corruption does not just involve \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cAlthough the fight against corruption aims to enhance human rights, in some instances it may instead encroach on these rights.\u201d 47 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region money but may include sexual exploitation, illegal benefits or gains, the illegitimate use of power manifested in various ways. UNCAC linkages. UNCAC itself does not refer specifically to gender, not even in Article 13 (on participation), so a link is needed to treaties such as CEDAW. There is a need to raise awareness, taking cultural considerations into account, regarding linkages between gender and corruption. Challenges. Gender-related differences in both the response to and the impact of corruption need analysis. As part of this, gender-disaggregated statistics are needed. Perhaps less opportunity for corruption presents itself to women, for example, because they are often relegated to government positions of lesser power. Programming entry points. Gender and corruption are cross-cutting issues in programming, yet gender sometimes remains overlooked. This element needs to be included at all stages of programming, including formulation, decision-making and implementation. Gender also needs to be reflected in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) through gender-disaggregated indicators and a better methodology to guide implementers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56aed489-8417-40b6-b900-18959dd4e69a": {"__data__": {"id_": "56aed489-8417-40b6-b900-18959dd4e69a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country Experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8d26d04a0a6522dbb69869105a3cd4e1083706b1d191ee21b0fbb95b3a03b061"}, "2": {"node_id": "45e1dd17-7888-4531-ac82-31a3af10b711", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "586787e957a9c2f5730fdf00f2caa7ac33075e549dc379df515f3c10b41bc21e"}}, "hash": "a736cd6125630fa6f5a0afd959ed75f263bcd99f1d939e8e724498a340427b83", "text": "UNCAC can be used as an entry point through Articles 13 and 60, but gender should be mainstreamed in all articles.

UNCAC principles should be applied in developing the relevant institutions in post-conflict situations. Challenges. Massive flows of aid create both incentives and opportunity for corruption.

This is a new initiative launched at the Accra High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in September of 2008. Fourteen donors and development agencies including DFID, UNDP and WB signed up to the initiative. Asked to be open about their funds to countries (both immediate and mid-term), donors have agreed to set up a model by the end of 2009 whereby all aid flows will be recorded and monitored. The initiative involves multiple linkages with UNCAC, notably with regard to Articles 5, 7, 9, 10 and 13. CSOs can use this instrument to monitor the aid flow, but they also need to be forthcoming, participating themselves in a way they too can be held accountable for their activities. Challenges. Parliamentary oversight may politicize technical assistance, and could delay project implementation. There is also a risk of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) being donor driven and, instead of being nationally owned, coming to represent a second, parallel system alongside the national budget. The greatest challenge is to bring on board development partners other than those who have already signed up (international NGOs, some donors who expressed support for the initiative but have yet to sign up, and new development actors such as China). Another challenge involves sensitive issues, for example with technical assistance that may have military security implications. Programming entry points. National capacity development for Parliament and the Government to participate in this initiative, as well as for CSOs to monitor the initiative and to be part of it. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cMassive flows of aid create both incentives and opportunity for corruption.\u201d 48 Conclusions and follow-up The technical training brought together 61 participants from 18 countries in the region, notably Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. For three days, participants exchanged ideas and experiences in tackling corruption and deepened their understanding of UNCAC as a framework for reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The workshop included 33 presentations, all of which are available online (see the links under each session). The agenda provided a good mixture of topics and guest speakers and a very informative overview of UNCAC. In terms of follow-up, participants suggested UNDP pursue the establishment of the Integrity in Action (INTACT) network of anti-corruption practitioners in the region to share experience, knowledge and information. They also proposed establishing a directory of focal points and, with the relevant Ministries, organizing capacity-development activities at the country level. It would also be useful, they said, to monitor progress in implementing UNCAC in follow-up workshops. The UNDP RCB will ride this momentum through the creation of an interactive portal on anti- corruption. This portal will focus on preventive measures in the fight against corruption and on anti-corruption initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs, highlighting sectoral approaches in areas such as education, health and non-renewable natural resources. The portal will facilitate exchange among UNDP practitioners and national counterparts involved in UNDP anti-corruption initiatives. It will provide a one-stop shop for hands-on country- level experience generated by UNDP, government entities and CSOs in preventing corruption. Knowledge products developed at the country level will be made easily available for anti- corruption practitioners and partners in the region. At the country level, UNDP COs will pursue their activities to support UNCAC implementation. For example, in Bangladesh, UNDP will organize an \u2018Executive Training for the Government Officials on the UNCAC\u2019 as well as a TOT on the same topic. In Mongolia, furthermore, the UNDP CO is planning several follow-up activities with its partners (see box).

Samuel De Jaegere Policy Analyst, Public Administration Reform and Anti-Corruption, Regional Centre in Bangkok Samuel.de.jaegere@undp.org 60 Supporting UNCAC implementation Overall, the workshop provided a useful opportunity to share experiences and deepen participant understanding of UNCAC. The agenda provided a good mixture of topics and guest speakers together with a very informative overview of UNCAC. Some participants suggested having fewer presentations (maximum three per session), thereby leaving more time for questions and answers. They also suggested devoting more discussion to sectoral approaches and local initiatives, the impact of corruption on gender, the informal sector and poor people, and the experiences of Singapore and Hong Kong in fighting corruption. The participation of UNODC, ADB and other partners was highly appreciated, both in terms of substance and in terms of the presentation of such diverse perspectives on corruption. In general, participants lauded the speakers\u2019 presentations (although in some cases more innovative thinking and a more even quality might have been expected). The presentation on UNCAC was considered very useful. Participants rated the workshop organization as very good to excellent, and they appreciated the real-time availability of documents and presentations in SNAP. The workshop venue was considered excellent. In terms of improvements, they suggested (i) sending invitations earlier, thereby facilitating visa procedures and (ii) evaluating sessions at the end of each day, rather than at the end of the three- day workshop.

It was a great opportunity to share a wealth of diverse experiences. A job well done! Agenda Too many topics and speakers were squeezed into this single workshop. A clearer focus combined with presentation and more space for discussions would enhance the effectiveness of the training. I would request that there be more participation through Q&A. Need to have more sectoral discussions, for example of good practices on the ground, more local initiatives. Need more discussion of how corruption impacts on gender, the informal sector and poor people in general. The agenda was a bit too long and, when it came to the end of the day, it was difficult to remain attentive. I would like more comprehensive workshops that dedicate themselves to the implementation of UNCAC, especially since most countries that have ratified the Convention need guidance concerning the actual implementation of UNCAC principles. The clinics were very useful. They should be a compulsory component of all workshops. It would have been of value to have had representatives from Singapore ICAC and Hong Kong, or even reps. from another bureau, to present their models. Good mixture of topics and guest speakers. Provided good technical guidance, country examples, and ideas. More coordination and preparation needed in presentations. Shouldn\u2019t be more than three presentations per session. The general information/training on UNCAC and programming was very useful, but the Asian country case studies were not always so relevant for the Pacific. Speakers Speakers were very good overall. Presentations were very diverse (good), but of uneven quality. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 68 Supporting UNCAC implementation Presentations lacked knowledge and substantive thinking. UNDP needs to move forward as a knowledge resource and innovative organization. Appreciate joint UNDP-UNODC approach and inclusion of others, e.g. ADB. Very useful for making contacts and discussions in the margins. Useful workshop, though some of the country presentations were not very focused. UNODC overview of UNCAC was very good, and will be useful in the future. Organization Well organized and well received. Invitations should be sent well in advance to accelerate visa processes. Providing evaluations at the end of each day, when evaluations are fresher, would be more fruitful than only at the end of the final session. Three days was too short for such a vital topic in the context of the MDGs and global economy. Four days would have been better, as this would have given speakers more time. The workshop was well organized in terms of content, venue, facilities and presenters. Excellent job by the organizers. Excellent organization. Very well organized, well-run event. Liked the real-time availability of documents and presentation on SNAP. Handouts of the speaker presentations would have been helpful. Overall, the activity was perfect. Logistical suggestion: Internet access should be provided free of charge in the rooms. Follow-up It is suggested that the programme include a follow-through activity involving some form of computation. Inquiries from participants coming from various sectors would prove useful in planning subsequent activities. A directory of focal persons would be useful. Similar workshops would be very relevant in taking stock of progress in the implementation of UNCAC.

For three days, participants exchanged ideas and experiences in tackling corruption. The workshop included 33 presentations, all of them now available online (see the links in each session embedded in the presenters\u2019 names). DAY 1 Building blocks for the training The first day of training addressed linkages between corruption and development. It also focused on technical UNCAC provisions and presented a perspective on anti-corruption programming in Asia-Pacific. The first issue for consideration concerned the broad need to more surely recognize and address the problem of corruption in the interest of development effectiveness. Other sessions focused on the usefulness of a multilateral normative framework as the basis for reform programmes, and the identification of important Asia-Pacific regional trends. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cThe training aimed to consolidate the Asia-Pacific Community of Practice and provide strategic guidance for implementing UNCAC.\u201d 7 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 1 Corruption and development Phil Matsheza\u2019s presentation \u2013 addressing definitions, concepts and principles related to corruption and development \u2013 provided an overall conceptual umbrella for the workshop. UNCAC provides a development framework for UNDP, recommending multi-disciplinary approaches in both preventive measures and law enforcement. The UNCAC is a very comprehensive framework, but \u201cthe true measure of success of the United Nations is not how much we promise but how much we deliver for those who need us most\u201d. 1 One key discussion point was the importance of measuring corruption. The best-known tools, in this regard, are the perception indexes, serving advocacy purposes over the past years and raising public awareness; for example in Bangladesh, once ranked at the bottom of Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index (TI CPI). But the UNCAC Conference of State Parties has now endorsed a move towards a more objective, more nationally owned assessment whereby countries are compared against their own standards. Another discussion examined the design of anti-corruption responses, whether comprehensive or stand-alone. The issue of mainstreaming anti-corruption measures proved a consistent thread throughout the workshop. But two caveats were raised about mainstreaming, citing experience with gender programming where mainstreaming meant the issue itself gets lost, and suggesting that a clear understanding of the sector-specific dynamics is needed to effectively address the problem. Session 2 Introduction: the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) A comprehensive overview of UNCAC \u2013 as foundation for the workshop - familiarized participants with the Convention\u2019s four substantive components: prevention, criminalization/law enforcement, asset recovery and international cooperation. Asset-recovery provisions, a key UNCAC innovation, have created a common platform for international cooperation from a law-enforcement perspective. Getting legal assistance used to be very time consuming. A key UNCAC contribution to the fight against corruption across borders has been mutual legal assistance (MLA). UNCAC \u2013 which describes legal formalities, asset-recovery mechanisms, and the rules of repatriation and freezing of assets \u2013 revolutionized MLA, thereby eliminating many unnecessary steps. 1 Kofi Annan\u2019s Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech. 8 Supporting UNCAC implementation This session demonstrated how UNCAC\u2019s reporting mechanism can document results among Member States, including their successes, lessons learned and failures in the fight against corruption, thereby promoting ratification and success on the part of other countries. Session 3 Overview: Regional anti-corruption initiatives in Asia and the Pacific Participants saw how political will represents a key ingredient of success. At the same time they asked how and at what level of government this will is manifested (highest leadership or community decision-makers), and who else might be encouraged to champion the process. \u2018Political will\u2019 was seen to include \u2018room for maneuver\u2019 by policy-makers, and its exercise was understood to involve the leverage of this feature in generating momentum and ownership of reforms. It also became clear, in this session, that specific cultural and social patterns \u2013 e.g. traditions of gift-giving found within some Pacific cultures \u2013 may be misinterpreted as corrupt practices. DAY 2 Practical applications: Entry points, challenges and lessons learned The second day progressed to more practical UNCAC applications: e.g. entry points, challenges and lessons for successful anti-corruption programming.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e5d34914-352b-4dae-9b67-99bbfb6f3ef5": {"__data__": {"id_": "e5d34914-352b-4dae-9b67-99bbfb6f3ef5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fd9175febc0e42fe0e31e91cd56321fd6e1e6447f23a1f6bce36293e537ac7ca"}, "2": {"node_id": "c20aeada-8bac-4e8d-951d-c03270fc9f3c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "080965cd798e9b7c3f6c99ccb2ebec7fda52b809378299076f8d610c8474f55c"}}, "hash": "d5c7b5316c8ac449e0a0b8664ea84e5ddfbe6008e104e593d085fc437cff4271", "text": "entry points, challenges and lessons for successful anti-corruption programming.

Key components for sectoral programming include these: surveys and diagnosis of risks and vulnerabilities; expenditure tracking; benchmarks and indicators; regulatory review/licences; codes of ethics/conduct; ethics and human resource training; incentive systems; complaints and whistle blowing mechanisms in a sectoral context; and access to information. This session reinforced themes considered in earlier discussions and anticipated those to come in later ones, such as the need for sound assessment of institutions and sectors in terms of vulnerability to corruption \u2013 whether through risk assessments, as highlighted by the Asian \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 9 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Development Bank (ADB), or through integrity assessments elaborated on by Malaysia and Korea in their presentations. This session also demonstrated how one holistic approach to fighting corruption yielded concrete results. Inspirational lessons from the Malaysia National Integrity Plan showed how a culture of ethics and social accountability could be grounded in a solid assessment of where the problems really lie. Session 5 Anti-corruption programming for public-sector reform at national and local levels Referring mainly to the UNCAC chapter on prevention, training then focused on specific sectors. \u2018Transforming Institutions and Culture for Accountability and Transparency: Lessons from South Korea\u2019. This presentation demonstrated the usefulness of integrity-assessment surveys by public-service users in measuring vulnerability to corruption. The same basic principles and approaches can be applied to any organization in any country at either the organizational or the national level. \u2018MDG, Decentralization and Corruption in the Philippines\u2019. Empowered communities developed and tracked their own progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) through functional citizenry feedback and voice mechanisms that systematize accountability and transparency. Sound MDG practices that promote transparency and accountability were adapted and replicated at the community level, ensuring that MDGs are achieved with integrity. Recommendations included localizing UNCAC provisions down to village level; monitoring progress and providing technical support to information centres (ICs) beyond project life; and documenting best practices and popularizing them for easy use and dissemination. \u2018Health Sector Integrity Initiative in Mongolia\u2019. The government increased transparency and accountability in the Ministry of Health and selected health organizations by identifying current constraints and bottleneck areas, developing mechanisms to address them, and promoting ethics and staff integrity through open discussions, training, codes of conduct and complaints handling. Addressing ethics and integrity issues requires long-term engagement. \u2018Harnessing Voluntary Public Officials Initiative: The Sri Lanka Clean Hands Campaign\u2019. This campaign rewards outstanding public officials, eliminates systems and procedures that lead to corrupt practices, and provides a forum for discussion of corruption prevention and best practices. Although only a few officers are involved in corruption, public officials are often afraid to talk openly about the problem. An \u2018alliance\u2019 was formed of officials who wished to maintain a \u2018clean\u2019 public service. \u2018Ensuring Transparency and Integrity in Public Procurement: Lessons from Asia and the Pacific\u2019. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is involved in an initiative to ensure transparency and integrity in public procurement. Lessons learned so far include these: the need to benchmark national procurement systems, looking at procurement laws and regulations as well as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) baseline compliance and performance indicators; \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 10 Supporting UNCAC implementation the importance of Executing Agency Capacity Assessments in looking at procurement risks and training requirements; and the advantages of e-government procurement and capacity development. The session further emphasized the importance of citizen involvement in combating corruption; the need for \u2018clean\u2018 public servants who are also advocates within their respective public service systems; the importance of addressing all issues related to combating corruption, rather than merely focusing on law enforcement and, in so doing, perhaps neglecting prevention; and addressing the issue of remuneration for public servants in an effort to ensure that all receive an adequate wage. This process requires long-term commitment. Sessions 6 and 7 Judicial reform, law enforcement and oversight mechanisms Participants considered concrete examples of how judicial integrity is built or rebuilt in Indonesia and of how China has implemented UNCAC.

Effective media efforts should be based on strong evidence \u2013 following the paper trail and following the money. From freedom of expression to right to information to the specific example of the \u2018Citizen Report Cards\u2019, the message was clear: Information is power, particularly when it can mobilize people to take action, encourage open debate and dialogue with decision-makers, and introduce market competition to ensure effective delivery of public services, especially to the poor. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 11 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region In the private sector, a remarkable change has occurred over the past five years. Where companies were asserting they had nothing to do with drugs, crime and corruption, that they had clean hands and were victims of public corruption, they are now acknowledging that the UNCAC can help them reduce corruption in their companies and in the countries where they do business. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is currently working on a number of joint projects with the private sector in accordance with commitments they undertook in the Bali Business Declaration, following the 2007 Bali Conference of State Parties of the UNCAC. Session 9 Regional and international synergies ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific supports a network of anti-corruption policy-makers linked with other global initiatives. The Anti-Corruption Network for Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (ECIS) provides expertise from within the region and highlights the value of informal networking and knowledge exchange. Lessons from the region also reverberate in Asia-Pacific, emphasizing long-term engagement and capacity development, as well as better insights into the politics of corruption. Another example from Sri Lanka emphasized the need for close international cooperation, particularly given limited national resources and capacity. Session 10 Global COP and report back from clinics This session allowed for smaller-group discussions on emerging issues \u2013 on human rights, natural- resource revenue management, gender, post-conflict reconstruction, and international aid transparency \u2013 as they relate to anti-corruption. The clinics focused on linkages with UNCAC, challenges, and programming entry points for UNDP in democratic governance initiatives. Conclusions and follow-up Overall, the workshop provided a useful opportunity to deepen participant understanding of UNCAC and to share experiences related to the operationalization of UNCAC in UNDP programming. The agenda provided a good mixture of topics and guest speakers together with an informative overview of UNCAC. Some participants suggested having fewer presentations to allow more time for questions and answers. Nevertheless, participants rated workshop organization as \u2018very good\u2019 to \u2018excellent\u2019. Among other things, they appreciated the Solutions Network of Asia Pacific (SNAP) real-time availability of documents and presentations. Participants suggested that UNDP proceed with establishing the \u2018Integrity in Action \u2013 INTACT\u2019 regional network of anti-corruption practitioners to share experiences and information.

They also proposed follow-up workshops to assess progress in implementing UNCAC. The UNDP RCB will ride this momentum in creating an interactive anti-corruption portal. The portal will focus on preventive measures in the fight against corruption and on anti-corruption initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs, highlighting sectoral approaches in areas such as education, health and non-renewable natural resources. The portal will facilitate exchange among UNDP practitioners and national counterparts involved in UNDP anti-corruption initiatives. It will provide a one-stop shop for hands-on country-level experience generated by UNDP, government entities and CSOs in preventing corruption. Anti- corruption practitioners and partners in the region will be provided with readily accessible knowledge products developed at the country level.

That fact is supported by evidence from around the world. And corruption is a long-standing global phenomenon. But it was only in the mid-1990s that the global community began responding to this serious developmental threat, a threat that has since been exacerbated by globalization and critical cross- border dimensions. Although it appears in different forms and varying magnitudes, corruption is found in both rich and poor countries, in both developing and developed countries. Corruption hurts the poor disproportionately, hinders economic development, undermines state accountability and capacity to provide equitable and responsive public services, and diverts investments from infrastructure, institutions and social services. Furthermore, corruption fosters an anti-democratic environment characterized by uncertainty, unpredictability and declining moral values and disrespect for constitutional institutions and the rule of law. Corruption, therefore, reflects a democracy, human rights and governance deficit that has serious impacts on poverty and human security.1 The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), the first international legal instrument of its kind, clearly demonstrates a global consensus on what countries should do to prevent and criminalize corruption, to improve international cooperation in combating corruption, and to recover assets. Many consider it a revolutionary step in international criminal law, a groundbreaking and innovative tool to promote good governance. Since the UNCAC came into force on 14 December 2005, rallying reform in countries across the globe,2 all UN agencies are expected to use this new framework in their anti-corruption initiatives. Currently a number of these agencies, including UNDP, are conducting a variety of country-level activities under different thematic groups. To maximize the impact of these activities and to ensure that they are mainstreamed into national development strategies, agencies need to synergize, to maximize resources in enabling the development of complementary areas of expertise. UNODC, a pivotal partner in anti-corruption programming, serves as UNCAC custodian. Over the past decade, an estimated US$100 million and more per year in public funds have been spent on anti-corruption activities. Overall, however, the impact of these measures has been modest, and the average quality of governance worldwide seems to have stagnated. Corruption in Asia-Pacific remains a challenge for analysis and policy. The region presents great cultural, ethnic, political and religious diversity, diverging levels of human development, and regional governance models that range from autocratic regimes to one-party people\u2019s democracies to multiparty electoral systems. Design and implementation of realistic National Integrity Strategies must take into account all these factors. 1 UNDP Practice Note 2004, p. 1. 2 As of this writing, 140 Member States have signed the Convention and128 have ratified it. Among 27 countries that signed in Asia-Pacific, 16 have ratified. \u201cCorruption reflects a democracy, human rights and governance deficit that has serious impacts on poverty and human security.\u201d 14 Supporting UNCAC implementation Many anti-corruption initiatives fail because they are essentially non-political in nature, while most of the corruption in developing countries is highly political. Is there a causal relationship between levels of democratic governance and control of corruption? Research indicates that it is not so much the current degree of democracy that is important, but rather the length of time the democratic governance system has been in place. The more experience a country has with democracy, the better it can address corruption. In addition, fighting corruption is no longer simply a domestic challenge. The cross-border impact of corruption and the need to share knowledge and experiences have inspired several regional initiatives. Among the most comprehensive and active networks is the ADB-OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia Pacific, which brings together representatives from anti-corruption institutions in 27 countries around the region, as well as a steering group of development partners including UNDP. See also the Asia Pacific Action Plan. ASEAN\u2019s Vientiane Plan of Action for 2004\u20132020 pays increased attention to corruption as a governance issue requiring special attention. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) has constituted an expert group on corruption to support capacity-building in Member Countries. The Pacific Plan is also central to fighting corruption in the Pacific Islands, with recommendations to set up regional anti-corruption agencies, regional ombudsman offices and auditor generals. Increased awareness of the detrimental effects of corruption has also caused parliamentarians to unite in the fight against corruption. The North East Asian and South East Asian chapters of the Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (NEAPAC and SEAPAC) were established in May 2003 and April 2005, respectively. An inaugural meeting of SAPAC (South Asian Parliamentarians Against Corruption) is planned. The advent of UNCAC has revived interest in the issues to the extent that", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5295099-18da-46ad-9bb3-4cb81d1e674a": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5295099-18da-46ad-9bb3-4cb81d1e674a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d8d76ce907517cff4954be35c7a1db7078659b73a1554346b5ab1c2a8c0c93ee"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0189b70-9483-4f8f-a8a6-86b4b8ce0987", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dc7ca40c3319d6007e76a9b9751ff6e7308e269abe431ec922264dc87387b75f"}}, "hash": "f6291112f399bed72c39299370af091159c194fc2379b90016961c9456e6d4a8", "text": "massive new donor funds will likely be available for implementation and monitoring of the Convention.

Article 5 of the UN Convention against Corruption requires the development and implementation of effective, coordinated anti-corruption policies promoting the participation of society.

At the same time, however, there is the risk of overly ambitious, unsustainable plans that might eventually jeopardize public support for the anti-corruption effort. Four main policy-development trends emerge from the region: Development of national policies are being linked to comprehensive strategies to combat corruption. Such plans have been developed in Bhutan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Republic of Korea and Thailand. The Afghan National Development Strategy incorporates a comprehensive anti-corruption plan. Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka are also developing such strategies. Implementation plans are being developed for new anti-corruption laws that supersede what were formerly arrays of separate pieces of legislation. This often includes institutional development plans for anti-corruption agencies and other integrity institutions. UNCAC implementation involves countries undertaking in-depth assessment of their laws and regulations for combating corruption, analyzing gaps between the legislation in place and the mandatory and non-mandatory provisions of the UNCAC. Gap analyses are usually performed prior to ratification, as was the case in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and Mongolia. Other countries, e.g. Sri Lanka, have ratified without undertaking such an in-depth legal assessment. A number of countries in the region have incorporated this UNCAC gap analysis in their short- term plans. While comprehensive strategies remain the fashion, a more recent trend supplements these strategies with sectoral approaches, either related to government agencies considered highly vulnerable to corrupt activities (e.g. tax, customs) or sectors crucial for the achievement of the MDGs. For example, UNDP Mongolia is supporting the Ministry of Health in improving its ethics, accountability and transparency infrastructure and the supporting governance structure. Anti- corruption initiatives that focus on sub-national levels are also being piloted in a number of countries (e.g. the Philippines). UNDP work in fighting corruption is rooted in the agency\u2019s over-all goal of reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The UNDP approach to corruption and governance deficits is anchored in human development, concentrating on people\u2019s capacity to make choices about the life they wish to lead. It goes beyond economic well-being to include respect for principles of human rights, equality and freedom from oppression. To these ends, UNDP launched Integrity in Action (INTACT) in Phnom Penh (24\u201327 January 2007), the first regional Community of Practice of its kind. This meeting brought together UNDP practitioners, stakeholders and counterparts to share experiences and lessons learned in the area of anti-corruption. It also helped prepare for the 2007 Regional Human Development Report on Corruption. Following up on the INTACT launch, UNDP, together with UNODC, ADB, Transparency International and other partners, convened this regional training workshop on the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC), held in Bangkok (Thailand), 13\u201315 October 2008.

The gap between the ethical standards that people expect from public officials and business leaders and what they see in practice is raising concerns about overall social integrity. Meanwhile, the current global financial crisis is propelling intense debate regarding the way the global financial system functions, raising additional integrity and transparency concerns. Asia is not being spared, in this period of financial and economic turmoil. And, despite remarkable economic progress in Asia-Pacific, 50 percent of the world\u2019s poor still live in this region. Perceived high levels of corruption remain, continuing to dilute regional development achievements. If we want to improve the lives of the millions of people who live in extreme poverty, then the fight against corruption has to be made a top priority at all levels. Corruption not only endangers the stability of democratic institutions, it also leads to discrimination in the delivery of services, thus violating human rights. The poor in particular, given that they suffer from corruption in their daily lives more than anyone else, deserve to enjoy the basic human right to live in a corruption-free society. UNCAC is clearly a landmark achievement in the global move to stop corruption. It represents an international response to corruption as a transnational phenomenon affecting all societies and economies, one that shows the need for international cooperation in prevention and control. It also provides benchmarks that allow civil society to hold Governments accountable for anti- corruption activities. Corruption seriously drains resources allocated for human development. UNDP considers UNCAC essential to the strengthening of democratic governance in support of poverty alleviation and human-rights protection. Indeed, promoting accountable and transparent governing institutions and respect for international norms and standards of integrity and accountability has become one of UNDP\u2019s fastest growing areas of support, both regionally and worldwide. At the global level, UNDP has just launched a new Global Programme on Anti-Corruption for Development Effectiveness. This initiative focuses on building and enhancing effective partnerships among various agencies and institutions working in the field of anti-corruption. Opening Session Session Reports \u201cCorruption seriously drains resources allocated for human development.\u201d 18 Supporting UNCAC implementation At the regional level, several regional networks have been established, notably the Anti-Corruption Practitioners Network (ACPN) for Eastern Europe and the CIS coordinated by the UNDP Bratislava Regional Centre and the Anti-Corruption Network in the Arab States, organized by the UNDP Regional Centre in Egypt. The Regional Centre in Bangkok (RCB) has just launched its new Asia Regional Governance Programme, which also contains an anti-corruption component, focusing mainly on support to UNCAC implementation and related public-sector reforms. The RCB has already taken practical steps to support UNCAC implementation. In 2005, it published a comparative study entitled \u2019Institutional Arrangements for Combating Corruption\u2018 that has been translated into various national languages in the region and is enjoying wide use. The Centre has produced television ads that vividly depict the losses to healthcare and education from corruption, and offers these ads to countries around the region. RCB has organized several training workshops on media and corruption. RCB also plans to train indigenous journalists through the Regional Indigenous Peoples Programme, allowing them to better report on the governance issues that affect these communities in particular. \u2018Tackling Corruption, Saving Lives\u2019, UNDP\u2019s latest Regional Human Development Report, also addresses corruption and its impact on human development in the region. But the bulk of UNDP work in the region still directly targets the country level, where anti- corruption initiatives range from raising awareness to helping develop anti-corruption legislation and national integrity strategies, building the capacity of anti-corruption agencies and supporting the media and civil society. In addition, UNDP interventions in other governance-related areas \u2013 e.g. parliamentary reforms, access to justice, local governance and public administration reform \u2013 all contribute in a holistic manner to the strengthening of national integrity systems.

With the UNCAC now coming into force, the speaker stressed the immediate need to define the UNDP entry point vis-\u00e0-vis other UN organizations, most notably, and vis-\u00e0-vis other partners. The UNCAC preamble recognizes that corruption jeopardizes sustainable development. The UNCAC itself provides a comprehensive development framework calling for multi-disciplinary approaches, including preventive measures and law enforcement. No matter how comprehensive UNCAC might be, however, \u201cthe true measure of success of the United Nations is not how much we promise but how much we deliver for those who need us most\u201d. 1 Corruption entails enormous costs. According to World Bank Institute estimates, more than $US1 trillion is paid in bribes every year \u2013 just over 3 percent of world income in 2002. Corruption can inflate the cost of producing goods by as much as 20 percent. In fact, however, figures about corruption don\u2019t mean that much. The impact of corruption on the actual lives of people is much more striking, where illegal logging erodes sustainable livelihoods, faulty drugs endanger human lives, hiring of non-performers delivers poor public services, etc. In short, it is important to focus on the human face of anti-corruption. Corruption is not a disease; it\u2019s a symptom. The disease is governance deficits. UNDP should therefore focus on democratic governance in the context of environment and sustainable development, poverty reduction and crisis prevention and recovery. The first generation of UNDP AC support focused on accountability, transparency and integrity. UNCAC now has 128 ratifications, and the demand for AC interventions at country level is rising. Hence, UNDP recently launched the Global Thematic Programme on Anti-Corruption for Development Effectiveness (PACDE), which aims to develop capacity at the country, regional and global levels. 1 Kofi Annan\u2019s Nobel Peace prize acceptance speech. 20 Supporting UNCAC implementation Post-presentation discussion included questions about measuring corruption. The speaker observed that several diagnostic tools have been developed since the 1990s. Best known are the perception indexes, which have proven very useful for advocacy purposes and in raising public awareness, for example in Bangladesh (once ranked first on the Transparency International index). The UNCAC Conference of State Parties has now endorsed a move towards a more objective and nationally owned assessment, whereby countries are being compared against their own standards. One participant argued that corruption is only possible when institutional deficits exist, and that anti-corruption programming should address these deficits by promoting transparency, accountability and integrity and taking into account the voices of citizens. UNCAC does promote the involvement of civil society, notably the media, as well as access to information policies. One participant asked whether anti-corruption programming should attempt to be comprehensive, or whether it ought to focus on sector-specific issues, and mainstream anti-corruption into education, health or other sectors. But mainstreaming is not easy, since one needs to clearly understand the sector-specific dynamics. And methodologies for sector-specific anti-corruption programming are not always available.

On the contrary, they are symptomatic of a dysfunctional system. In conclusion, this session situated anti-corruption within the core mandate of UNDP to pursue the MDGs; highlighted the human face of anti-corruption; and encouraged participants to exchange lessons learned. The speaker recommended the User\u2019s Guide to Measuring Corruption for information regarding diagnostic tools and the most appropriate measurements in a given context. The Chair reminded participants about previously produced TV ads that graphically portray the gravity of corruption in terms of human development. These ads are available at the Regional Centre in Bangkok, and can be translated into different languages to make a persuasive case against corruption and for anti- corruption programming in countries in the region (see example from Malaysia). \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cIt is important to focus on the human face of anti-corruption.\u201d 21 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 2 Introduction to UNCAC Chair: Khamhheuang Bounteum, Director General of the Treaties and Law Department, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Lao PDR Speakers: Giovanni Gallo, Crime Prevention Expert, UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Yara Esquivel, International Centre for Asset Recovery at the Basel Institute on Governance Rapporteur: Dirk Wagener, Assistant Resident Representative, Head of Governance Unit, UNDP Lao PDR Giovanni Gallo\u2019s presentation provided a comprehensive overview of UNCAC principles, provisions and current progress, and introduced the Convention\u2019s genesis, fundamentals and structure. It\u2019s worth noting that the Convention does not propose a formal definition of corruption, since this might limit its scope where new forms of corruption evolved in future. During the past 12 years, various regional treaties have responded to the issue of corruption, but \u2013 either focusing only on specific regions or specific manifestations of corruption \u2013 all lacked the comprehensiveness required to address the issue effectively. The UNCAC is the first global comprehensive anti-corruption treaty introducing the concept of asset recovery and return to its rightful owners. It also promotes international cooperation as the basis for fighting corruption\u2019s cross-national nature. UNCAC comprises four components: prevention, criminalization/law enforcement, asset recovery and international cooperation. Negotiated in less than three years, a record time, the treaty was unanimously accepted by the UN General Assembly in 2003 and came into force on 14 December 2005 with 30 ratifications. Currently, 128 countries have ratified the Convention, with a fair balance between Asia-Pacific and other regions around the world. UNCAC describes different levels of obligation, among them mandatory provisions, measures that States need to consider, and optional measures. The treaty obliges Member States to establish one or more dedicated anti-corruption bodies for policy implementation and dissemination. These bodies must be independent, i.e. free from political influence, financially independent and adequately resourced, and their staff must be properly trained. The treaty also requires asset disclosure of politically exposed people (PEP), funding disclosure of political parties, involvement of civil society in the fight against corruption through access to information, private-sector requirements such as enhanced accounting, and independence of the prosecution and judiciary. 22 Supporting UNCAC implementation UNCAC is administered by UNODC, which provides secretarial support to the Conference of the States Parties (COSP), promotes further ratification and supports COPS working groups on review of implementation, asset recovery and technical assistance. The UNCAC monitoring mechanism is still evolving. Currently, a self-assessment checklist is being used to measure country performance in the implementation of selected UNCAC Articles from all four substantive chapters of the Convention. However, the survey is not designed to measure corruption or to index or rank countries based on their performance. The provision of development assistance is not linked to the implementation of the UNCAC. Instead, it is driven by the needs identified by requesting states. Among the reporting States Parties, 66 percent are in need of technical assistance to ensure or improve UNCAC implementation. UNCAC\u2019s criminalization and law-enforcement pillar includes five mandatory and six other offences of corruption that States parties are obliged to consider introducing into their domestic systems. The mandatory offences include bribery of national civil servants, \u2018active\u2019 bribery of international civil servants, embezzlement, money laundering and obstruction of justice.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "07632964-510e-4f89-a9ef-a9c9408f27d8": {"__data__": {"id_": "07632964-510e-4f89-a9ef-a9c9408f27d8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d9b357472f51d34a3ed45adb2b70a90d9d051599aa7b993d276a35a65720f45e"}, "2": {"node_id": "77875ea5-4446-486c-9028-47b50be68e90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "00d33a47c01d7d05130902289bea180757c4dea037402ede4798825c6499ae98"}}, "hash": "f1145c1a000107500d87a712bc9e39cc999a6dbfaf1a3796e0d3296106b85e4c", "text": "The six non-mandatory offences are \u2018passive\u2019 bribery of international civil servants, trading in influence, abuse of function, illicit enrichment, bribery and embezzlement in the private sector.

The treaty includes various articles regulating mutual legal assistance, extradition and other international cooperation measures such as joint investigations. UNCAC\u2019s asset-recovery provisions are based on the principle that confiscated proceeds of corruption need to be returned to legitimate owners (individual or state), a very recent development in international law. Previously, the return of assets was at the discretion of the confiscating State, and later attempts to settle the recovery of assets introduced sharing arrangements and joint disposal. However, the UNCAC clearly specifies that there is no longer any discretionary element \u2013 all proceeds should be returned without conditions to their country of origin and rightful owners. The World Bank and UNODC launched the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR) in 2007 to assist Member Countries in building legal capacity to initiate legal action, meet evidential requirements and enable countries to manage their asset-recovery cases, both forensic and investigative. It also promotes legal and institutional reform (e.g. assistance to specific departments). Yara Esquivel presented the topic of \u2018Strengthening the Ability of Developing Countries to Recover Assets Stolen or Hidden in Foreign Jurisdictions: What has been Accomplished with UNCAC? What Remains to be Done?\u2019. UNCAC\u2019s innovative asset-recovery provisions create a common platform upon which to address this issue from a law-enforcement perspective. UNCAC specifies various articles and provisions dealing with asset recovery. International cooperation is a great advancement, since previously the process to obtain legal assistance was very time \u201cUNCAC clearly represents a landmark achievement in the global move to stop corruption.\u201d consuming. UNCAC has revolutionized mutual legal assistance (MLA) and eliminated many unnecessary steps. The Convention provides formal rules for asset-recovery mechanisms, repatriation and freezing of assets. Subsequent discussion looked at issues of transparency and effectiveness of development aid in post-conflict situations, and whether UNCAC provisions help reduce corruption under these circumstances, i.e. situations where, instead of being delivered through the Government, aid is provided directly through sub-contractors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It became clear that corruption also affects international public officials, something that is covered in UNCAC provisions. Given the implementation of private-sector non-mandatory offences as stipulated in the UNCAC, private-sector corruption can also be criminalized and included within national penal codes. The point was also raised that national levels of corruption remain relatively low in countries such as Japan and Australia, even though they do not have dedicated anti-corruption bodies, with the relevant responsibilities spread across various institutions. UNCAC calls for specific anti-corruption bodies covering prevention, investigation and enforcement (Articles 6 & 36). However, these functions can be either combined into one body (the combined model) or shared across a number of them. Whether combined or not, these bodies must be independent from the government executive and able to function effectively. There are three generic models: combined prevention, investigation and enforcement; prevention in one body, with investigation and enforcement combined in another; and each of the three functions covered by a separate body. There is insufficient data to determine which is the most effective model. In any case, it is crucial that those bodies enjoy strong political backing. Participants asked whether the UNCAC reporting mechanism also documents successes, lessons learned and failures in the fight against corruption of Member States in order to promote ratification among other countries. By way of clarification, they learned that the UNCAC review mechanism is only a method of collecting information and, only newly implemented, the mechanism has yet to define typical reactions to its assessments. So far, only one cycle of information collection has been completed (2007); a second one is currently underway. Questions arose concerning the tracking of official development assistance (ODA) and special/ discretionary funds. This is another area where political support is needed to ensure transparency in bidding processes, etc. A further question was raised as to why ODA should not be linked to UNCAC implementation.

In terms of UNCAC implementation, it was said, it is the prerogative of the respective ratifying country to directly implement the treaty or to apply its provisions through incorporation into such domestic legislation as penal codes. UNCAC provisions on proceeds from crime, participants learned, only pertain to those obtained from corruption-related crimes. But there is usually no need to first prove a corruption crime before asset-recovery actions can be initiated. Money laundering is a crime in itself, and can be referred for direct prosecution; parallel investigations of corruption and money laundering are also possible. Some countries, however, require that a given crime be proven before proceeding to the recovery of proceeds from the crime. No online depository provides data on countries that have fully satisfied all UNCAC requirements. (In fact, no country is considered fully compliant with the UNCAC provisions at this stage, and it is hard to imagine this being ever possible.) However, an official online directory with contact details for all central authorities for mutual legal assistance is under development. The data is already available in rudimentary form in the declarations made by State parties upon ratification of the Convention and on the International Centre for Asset Recovery\u2019s website. If someone receives an asset as a bribe in a foreign country, a civil lawsuit based on UNCAC can be initiated. The question arose as to whether, if the respective State or Government does not take action, an NGO can pursue corruption cases. Though the UNCAC only refers to State parties, civil society has been successful in pushing Governments to pursue cases. But any individual or legal person (as per law) can claim damages and compensation, and States can also be victims of corruption in court. Whether civil or criminal action for asset recovery is more effective or appropriate depends on the specific case at issue. Civil cases usually take longer than criminal cases but, since UNCAC authorizes preventive freezing orders, time considerations might not be an issue. Both avenues can be pursued. In conclusion, UNCAC represents a milestone achievement in the fight against corruption. It introduces a comprehensive anti-corruption framework consisting of prevention, implementation/ law enforcement, asset recovery and international cooperation obligations. The asset-recovery provisions and mutual legal assistance in particular present real innovations as part of the international cooperation element, and have catalyzed the fight against multinational corruption crimes. \u201cUNCAC is the first global comprehensive anti-corruption treaty introducing the concept of asset recovery and return to its rightful owners.\u201d 25 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 3 UNDP anti-corruption efforts in Asia-Pacific Chair: Fathmath Anoola, Assistant Director, Anti Corruption Board Maldives Speakers: Pauline Tamesis, Coordinator for Asia Regional Governance Programme, RCB Ernesto Bautista, Governance Team Leader, UNDP Pacific Centre Rapporteur: Masood Amer, Assistant Country Director a.i., UNDP Afghanistan Two key messages emerged from this session. Firstly, there was the issue of a gift-giving culture, and how, especially in the Pacific, certain traditions may be misinterpreted as corrupt practices. Secondly, the importance of political will was highlighted as one of the key ingredients for success. While the corruption perception index (CPI) makes a good advocacy tool, multi-dimensional approaches are necessary in preventing corruption. Necessary ingredients include political will and commitment, since corruption is often political in nature. \u2018Political will\u2019 was seen to include \u2018room for maneuver\u2019 by policy-makers at all levels, from the highest level to the community level. Several countries in the region have made significant progress in recent years. However, according to Transparency International\u2019s Global Corruption Report 2008, 22 out of 32 countries still scored below 5 in the CPI, with New Zealand as the cleanest country and the Union of Myanmar and Afghanistan at the bottom of the list. Sixteen countries in the region have now ratified the UNCAC. The Asia-Pacific region, rich in cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, is also characterized by growing inequalities and a wide range of political systems. Nevertheless, countries in the region have undertaken some similar approaches in tackling corruption \u2013 e.g. formulating anti-corruption strategies, adopting UNCAC implementation-monitoring plans and (e.g. in Mongolia) crafting supplementary strategies with sectoral approaches. A common area of difficulty for countries in the region has been the justice sector, which has been prone to corruption.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaea67fe-4cd1-4e31-b866-d66567babca0": {"__data__": {"id_": "aaea67fe-4cd1-4e31-b866-d66567babca0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "918c3d7963a6f0a757aadbfa456fe9b9dd1a068faa9222f1eaaa178225cdf4b3"}, "2": {"node_id": "02b196ec-4fd7-49f0-8535-79b0f50e82cf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "0e39b6f2c823d76bc589da13b914e17b6720237a3449f658f9c66aa2ebe71c18"}}, "hash": "dc740cfa9b0b759047285386747e7d8e2c93b9e8e57005fa3d038abf24201633", "text": "According to the Regional Human Development Report (RHDR), respondents lack confidence in law-enforcement institutions. 26 Supporting UNCAC implementation Lessons learned from the region indicate the need for greater and more broadly based understanding of governance and political economy; forging partnerships with non-state actors; sequencing interventions; mobilizing resources; and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7db4b18e-e9da-4afe-bf93-b0c3757e1455": {"__data__": {"id_": "7db4b18e-e9da-4afe-bf93-b0c3757e1455", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2665ebb4388e0d2b52bcc1199b845448d7ba1ac771994bc810c91dabe24cfe9a"}, "3": {"node_id": "f43ef85c-42e3-44ff-8464-559d777938d3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "633e71d5c2b44642f4c9f9730ca4cc6fad55be2eacc959496d6be9858445bfb2"}}, "hash": "1a9bd81f6f1451648756b0d2e29e23a0071632e5f51cc0d002c921dc53bb7f2c", "text": "providing anti-corruption bodies with more realistic mandates. Countries in the region have also paid more attention to assets declaration, with emphasis on accountability and screening of public officials. Bhutan, for example, has formulated a comprehensive anti-corruption strategy tackling this issue in the public sector. Ernesto Bautista\u2019s presentation on UNDP anti- corruption initiatives in the Pacific highlighted distinctive features of the region, where national populations range from 5,000 to 5,000,000 people, and where many countries remain in post-colonial situations with limited experiences in governance and institution building. In consequence, a regional approach is being developed with options for regional accountability, including the possible establishment of a regional ombudsman mechanism. Other UNDP initiatives include advocacy for ratification of UNCAC (so far only PNG and Fiji have ratified the Convention), support for the development of national anti-corruption action plans, advocacy for freedom to information, developing capacity of the media, support for social accountability initiatives, and the establishment of a NHRC in PNG. Key development partners for the region include the Pacific Forum Secretariat and national government agencies, e.g. PIC Ombudsman Offices, the Commonwealth Ombudsman of Australia, CSOs and AusAid. Challenges to implementing anti-corruption programmes in the Pacific include very limited capacity, both technically and financially, on the part of most Pacific island countries (PICs); limited reach and presence of the central Government; limited public understanding of the core functions of Government; aspects of cultural practices such as gifting; and political will. Key issues for sustainability include political will; building broad-based public awareness and understanding of the reforms; building accountability mechanisms in the provision of service delivery; and, given the limited capacity, a strategic incremental/regional approach. For quick facts on accountability institutions in the region, see the presentation. In a final observation, one of the speakers remarked that corruption is a complex phenomenon requiring collective responses. Picking up on a comment made earlier, it was stressed that UNDP also needs to practise what it preaches and improve its internal capacity and transparency. The establishment of ethics measures, ethics training, disclosure of assets, stronger audit and review mechanisms are examples of efforts to improve UNDP\u2019s internal system and accountability. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cPolitical will is one of the key ingredients for success.\u201d 27 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Session 4 Anti-corruption programming (Incl. experience from Malaysia) Chair: Francisco de Carvalho, National Director, Office of Inspector General, Timor-Leste Speakers: Phil Matsheza, Policy Adviser, Anti-Corruption, UNDP BDP/DGG Patrick Keuleers, Senior Policy Advisor, Public Administration Reform & Anti-Corruption and Governance Practice Team Leader, UNDP RCB Sandra Nicoll, Governance and Capacity Development, ADB Anis Yusal Yusoff, Director, Political Sector, Institut Integriti Malaysia Rapporteur: Panvirush Vittayapraphakul, Programme Assistant, UNDP This session addressed UNDP\u2019s corporate approach to supporting UNCAC implementation. It discussed programming options with a view to identifying ways to mainstream support for UNCAC implementation. Participants also discussed ideas for new initiatives with programmatic value, partnership strategies, funding possibilities, and management arrangements. Phil Matsheza clarified the basis for anti- corruption programming, which may differ from one country to another. For example, it might be the result of a self-assessment processed by UNODC, in follow-up to a needs assessment or scoping mission, or in order to meet international demands (EU entry requirements, MCA criteria or expectations from donors). International anti-corruption cooperation has two faces: corruption prevention, and combating corruption. UNDP\u2019s niche is in the prevention side, i.e. developing AC policies, AC bodies and AC mechanisms in supporting the private sector, civil society and the media. (Refer to UNCAC Articles 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 13.)

Patrick Keuleers presented AC entry points through sectoral programming. This recent trend differs from the comprehensive approach, focusing on specific sectors such as education, health or justice. Advantages of the sectoral approach include these: its potential to produce tangible results relatively quickly; its capacity to recognize the particularity of organizational cultures in different sectors, and the need to look at the details of particular professional practices (e.g. in maternal health); its obvious link with poverty eradication and the pursuit of the MDGs; its promotion of participatory approaches with civil society and the private sector; its compatibility with \u2018one UN\u2019 programming (e.g. with UNICEF, WHO, UNESCO, depending on the sector) to enhance development effectiveness; and \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cSectoral anti-corruption programming in health, education and clean water supply helps achieving the MDGs.\u201d 29 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region sectoral approaches at the micro-level can find that political leadership is more pronounced and political will more readily available than they are in comprehensive approaches at the macro-level. UNCAC support for sectoral approaches is found in Articles 5 (preventive AC policies and practices), 7 (public sector), 8 (code of conduct, asset declarations, whistle- blowing and disciplinary measures), 9 (procurement and financial management), 10 (transparency, public reporting and simplification), 12 (private sector), and 13 (participation of civil society and media). A number of elements need to be considered when using the sectoral approach: surveys and diagnosis of risks and vulnerabilities; expenditure tracking; benchmarks and indicators; regulatory review/licences; codes of ethics/conduct; ethics and HR training; incentive systems; complaints mechanisms/whistle blowing; access to information; introduction of information and communication technologies (ICTs); and pilot initiatives. Sectoral programming should focus on the MDGs (health, education, water and sanitation, and natural resource management) and legal empowerment at the local level. To succeed with sectoral programming, one must find the right champions and work with them. At the same time, all relevant stakeholders must be involved in the initiative. Complaint mechanisms must be set up. Finally, monitoring and evaluation system must be sufficiently effective. Sandra Nicoll presented risk assessments in governance and capacity development programming. In 2005, ADB reviewed implementation of its policies and looked into core government institutions. Although the policies were relevant, they were only partially implemented, and insufficient to tackle corruption. Action plans proved overly ambitious, while resources were spread too thinly, with not enough invested to mainstream the policies in ADB sector work. Therefore, the Second Governance & Anti-Corruption Action Plan (GACAP II) adopted a risk-based approach to governance assessment. This offers a better tool to combat corruption. Three priorities (thematic areas) were chosen because they proved most effective: public financial management, procurement, and combating corruption. Using a risk-based approach in AC initiatives assists Governments in prioritizing actions and investments needed to strengthen systems and reduce risks over time.

The Malaysian Institute of Integrity (MII) was established to implement the Plan in developing a nation of high integrity and resilience that embraced universal values. At the same time, the National Integrity Perception Index Study was launched. The latter initiative aimed to measure levels of public understanding and perceptions of corruption to gauge how effectively the National Integrity Plan was being implemented, and to ensure that efforts towards improving the integrity agenda were conducted in a systematic, consolidated and continuous manner. In addition, ASEAN Integrity Dialogues were introduced as a channel for discussion of global and regional issues related to values, ethics and integrity. The Dialogues were to focus on promoting information sharing among ASEAN countries; on a culture of integrity among the Malaysian community; on closer work with ASEAN friends; and, in general, on both new and renewed cooperation among the various organizations and institutions from countries at the global and regional levels.

Taking steps to ensure its initiative is sustainable, the Malaysian Government will restructure the Anti-Corruption Agency (ACA) as a full-fledged Malaysian Commission on Anti-Corruption. In addition, the Government will establish both an independent \u2018corruption prevention advisory board\u2019 and a parliamentary committee on the prevention of corruption. The Commission will table its annual report with this parliamentary committee, and members of the committee can seek further clarification. A delegate from Bhutan shared his country\u2019s experience with simplifying public-sector procedures through a standard cost model, assessing the administrative burdens and the effectiveness of service delivery. All governmental entities assess the administrative burden and report to the Ministry of Finance, which sets targets to reduce bureaucracy under penalty of a reduced budget. A delegate from Afghanistan underlined the role of citizens and civil society, as they are the ultimate victims of corruption and need more attention as stakeholders. It is also important, he suggested, to think about protection for public officials with integrity, e.g. judges and police officers who are sometimes targeted simply for performing their duties. One participant noted that sectoral approaches address day-to-day issues among the citizens at large, and may better address public discontent. \u201cInternational anti-corruption cooperation has two faces: corruption prevention, and combating corruption.

Sound MDG practices that promote transparency and accountability are adapted and replicated at the community level, ensuring that the MDGs are achieved with integrity.

A variety of public-opinion surveys have found that health professionals are perceived as being among the most corrupt public servants in Mongolia. The Government increased transparency and accountability in the Ministry of Health and selected health organizations through identifying current constraints and bottleneck areas, developing mechanisms to address them, and promoting staff ethics and integrity through open discussions, training, codes of conduct and complaints handling. Addressing ethics and integrity issues requires long-term engagement. W.A. Jayasundara presented the Sri Lanka Clean Hands Campaign and its experience with recruiting public officials in a voluntary fight against corruption. This initiative recognizes and rewards outstanding public officials, eliminates systems and procedures that lead to corrupt practices, and provides a forum for discussion of corruption prevention and best practices. The campaign identified these challenges: a general neutrality and reluctance to talk openly about corruption among many public officers; lack of professionalism; low competency among top management; lack of resources to provide efficient service delivery; weak political commitment; disorganized civil society; poor salaries and perks for public servants; and the monopolistic nature of public services. Public officers are afraid of speaking openly against corruption, though only a few are themselves involved in corruption. An \u2018alliance\u2019 was formed of officers wishing to establish a \u2018clean\u2019 public service. Chi Nai Chong provided lessons from Asia-Pacific on transparency and integrity in public procurement. The ADB, recognizing the need for long-term commitment, is involved in an initiative to achieve these goals. Lessons learned so far: the need to benchmark national procurement systems, looking at procurement laws and regulations and OECD baseline compliance and performance indicators; the importance of executing-agency capacity assessments that look at procurement risks and training requirements; the benefits of e-government procurement and capacity development. Session discussions also addressed the following issues: the importance of citizen involvement in combating corruption; the need for \u2018clean\u2019 public servants who also serve as advocates within their respective public- service systems; the importance of addressing all issues related to combating corruption, rather than just focusing on law enforcement to the possible neglect of prevention; and \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 34 Supporting UNCAC implementation the need to address the issue of remuneration for public servants in an effort to ensure that all receive a \u2018livable\u2019 wage. Other questions and issues raised during this period included these: Should we focus on traditional prevention or on innovative ways of combating corruption that incorporate cultural values and norms? What was the political reaction at the local level concerning the MDG, Decentralization and Corruption Initiative in the Philippines? How was the \u2018alliance\u2019 (Harnessing Voluntary Public Officials Initiative: the Sri Lanka Clean Hands Campaign) of public servants in Sri Lanka initiated? How do we tackle public servants who do not want to obtain accreditation in procurement matters because of fears of audits, etc.? Is not public-sector reform, specifically that regarding remuneration, also significantly linked to combating corruption? Should we not be supporting the reality that public servants must earn a livable wage in order to prevent \u2018survival corruption\u2019? Discussion included ideas that preventive measures are essential in combating corruption, and that public orientation in the context of \u2018How corrupt are you?\u2019 in relation to budget execution and personnel management, are important, and that loopholes must be closed. Concerning the development of \u2018integrity circles\u2019, it is essential to promote advocacy, mobilize committees, and let political leaders understand that the public is involved and motivated. Typically, once political leaders observe the success of integrity circles they often challenge others to participate. It was learned that the \u2018alliance\u2019 initiative developed in Sri Lanka was not created by legislation, but is a voluntary organization, and members have to adhere to a set of ethical standards and by- laws to maintain their membership.

Since the start of the democratization process in 1998, serious efforts to reform the judicial sector have been made, including these: establishing the independence of the judiciary; developing blueprints for the reform of judicial institutions; establishing new legal institutions, including independent commissions on the judiciary, the public prosecution and the national police; an anti-corruption commission; and an anti-money laundering agency; and the adoption of anti-corruption laws and regulations, notably a law and a national plan on corruption eradication, a law on witness protection (to protect whistle-blowers), ratification of UNCAC, and guidelines on bureaucracy reform. Despite all the progress, public perceptions of the Indonesian judiciary related to corruption remain rather negative. Challenges to judicial integrity reform, meanwhile, are numerous, and include the following: the mentality of state justice providers; low salaries among justice providers; an institutional arrangement unconducive to anti-corruption initiatives; lack of capacity and knowledge among justice providers; a prevailing culture that is permissive of corrupt practices; and lack of political will, especially among local politicians. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 36 Supporting UNCAC implementation Several development assistance organizations support judicial integrity reform.

A joint UNDP-UNODC scoping mission is planned for November 2008 to assess needed support for internal oversight mechanisms such as the Supreme Court, the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and the National Police. Andrew Boname presented efforts to improve judicial integrity in Asia. As UNCAC Article 11, Section 1 states: \u201cBearing in mind the independence of the judiciary and its crucial role in combating corruption, each State party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system and without prejudice to judicial independence, take measures to strengthen integrity and to prevent opportunities for corruption among members of the judiciary. Such measures may include rules with respect to the conduct of the judiciary.\u201d The judiciary is prone to corruption in accordance with Robert Klitgaard\u2019s formula of corruption (C = Monopoly + Discretion \u2013 Accountability). The justice sector has a monopoly on deciding legal rights, enjoys discretion (judicial independence) and has limited accountability to other branches of government. To improve judicial integrity, procedural measures should therefore be taken to decrease discretion or increase accountability (for examples, see presentation).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b35ce0c3-5672-4ad3-8a85-b5ef7553a186": {"__data__": {"id_": "b35ce0c3-5672-4ad3-8a85-b5ef7553a186", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "82f29f03254a714f6ad42ed8b6a13147f82fe2f48e12f2e13adbf62104c94b1d"}, "2": {"node_id": "23b63af2-a84a-40ca-912b-b5285e0c4d63", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c6b42010d30f3296cbdf681e06f82eaeb77b21ef31eea7374ab0f7b64272d070"}}, "hash": "5391c84d230c751b42f60fb09bb608ea25ac625620d8a1b26cef1c5ab7aa6b9e", "text": "Measures applied in Asia include these: rolling out an inter-disciplinary course on corruption, governance and impunity in law faculties across the Philippines; a pilot study in the use of verbatim hearing records in Thailand; adopting a mechanism for lawyers, through the bar association in Viet Nam, to file complaints against judges for improper conduct.

As a State party of the UNCAC, China has directed great efforts to satisfying its obligations. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cScandals may provide occasions for reform, and it is good to be prepared for those windows of opportunity.\u201d 37 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region New developments in China include these: an inter-ministerial working group, led by the Ministry of Supervision with more than 20 participating ministerial departments, to design a plan to enforce the UNCAC in China; a step-by-step working plan for implementing the UNCAC in China; specialized initiatives for preventing and combating commercial bribery; establishment of the National Bureau of Corruption Prevention (NBCP) in September 2007; the entry into force of the Law against Money Laundering in January 2007; a judicial interpretation, jointly issued by the Supreme People\u2019s Court and the Supreme People\u2019s Procuratorate, to combat the accepting of bribes by public officials; and a draft amendment of the criminal law that may enlarge the legal definition of \u2018trade in influence\u2019 and impose heavier punishment for corruption offenders. Vanessa Chang provided insights from Fiji in terms of accountability and fighting corruption in the judicial sector. The key legislation in Fiji is included in the penal code, which is out-dated, has an unusually complex drafting style, and is difficult to read, analyze and understand. The layout is extremely confusing. However, attempts to pass legislation in the area of corruption have met with little success. Improving judicial integrity will require procedural measures to decrease discretion or increase accountability. In the discussions, one participant requested examples of measures to control commercial bribery in China. Zhang Yumei described China\u2019s practice regarding investigation, prosecution and trial of offences involving commercial bribery. Another participant asked why one should bother paying a lawyer if you can buy a judge. Since this is not uncommon in some countries, it is necessary to adopt a code of conduct for judicial personnel and increase salaries for judges. The judges should be entitled to immunity for the decisions they make in court, but not for their conduct outside court proceedings. The risk of executive interference with the judiciary can be offset if judicial bodies establish their own codes of conduct and complaints procedures. This presupposes, of course, that the judiciary is willing to do this. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cTo improve judicial integrity, procedural measures should be taken to decrease discretion or increase accountability.\u201d 38 Supporting UNCAC implementation Session 7 Anti-corruption programming for oversight mechanisms (Incl. experiences from the Philippines and Pakistan) Chair: Irman Lanti, Head a.i. Governance Unit, UNDP Indonesia Speakers: Evelyn Baliton, Assistant Ombudsman, Office of the Ombudsman, the Philippines Farhan Sabih, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan Rapporteur: Farhan Sabih, Assistant Resident Representative, UNDP Pakistan Evelyn Baliton presented the Ombudsman\u2019s Office\u2019s role in the fight against corruption in the Philippines. Ms. Baliton focused on elements of a multi-pronged anti-corruption strategy aimed at strengthening policy frameworks and institutional capacities, developing integrity systems, and coordinating for multi-sectoral convergence. The policy and legislative frameworks are aimed at systemic solutions to governance and to provide enabling environment to combat corruption. Farhan Sabih introduced the topic \u2018Grievance Mechanisms as Vehicles for Accountability\u2019, a programme aimed at enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of grievance-redress mechanisms in Pakistan by aligning the redress and response systems and procedures with the needs and expectations of citizens; increasing public demand for accountability and transparency in service delivery; and facilitating availability of and access to information regarding grievance redress mechanisms and service delivery standards. Discussions focused on the role and mandate of ombudsmen in fighting corruption and, in particular, the jurisdiction to prosecute criminal cases and impose penalties. The perception that the ombudsman\u2019s office primarily has the mandate to investigate complaints of maladministration and to present its findings and recommendations raises questions about its effectiveness and efficacy. However, the practice differs in countries depending on the legal mandate of ombudsmen.

Founded in 1989, the centre is an independent non-profit media agency that helps nurture a culture of investigative reporting in old and new media in the Philippines and across Asia. The centre produces investigative reports, runs training seminar-workshops, publishes an online magazine, a news blog and a database, and produces books, films and documentaries (see www.pcij.org). The investigative process begins with a tip or a first lead, an initial investigation and an investigative hypothesis. The initial investigation is very important. The process includes following paper, people, electronic and legal trails. Malou Mangahas presented two case studies: \u2018Investigating President Joseph Estrada: Millions, Mansions and Mistresses\u2019, and \u2018The Philippine ODA Trail: Seven in 10 Projects Fail to Deliver Promised Benefits\u2019 (see presentation for further details). Charmaine Rodrigues talked about the right to information as a cross-cutting anti-corruption approach for the media, the private sector and civil society. In 1946, the UN General Assembly proclaimed freedom of information as \u201ca fundamental human right and the touchstone for all freedoms\u201d. The right to information underpins many other human rights, for example the right to food in India. Subsidized food rations were embezzled and sold by middlemen until poor people obtained the right to monitor the food distribution process. In East Africa, education 40 Supporting UNCAC implementation grants disappeared until the introduction of pro-active publication in schools of education grants allowed parents to verify the amounts allocated to local officials and to raise questions about the use of those funds. Freedom-of-information legislation has been progressively introduced in several Asia- Pacific countries. In 2008, Indonesia, the Cook Islands and Bangladesh joined a list that now comprises 11 countries; other countries include provisions in their constitution or clauses in administrative law. UNCAC promotes access to information as an anti-corruption strategy. One of the best ways to implement the right to information is through mandatory pro-active disclosure clauses (e.g. in the United Mexican States). The right to information should not be seen exclusively as a media right \u2013 it is a strong development right, and it supports the human rights-based approach to anti-corruption programming. Jairo Acuna-Alfaro provided insights from Viet Nam on the role of civil society in the fight against corruption. Evidence from both the 10 largest GDP countries and the APEC economies suggest a linear correlation between \u2018voice and accountability\u2019 and \u2018control of corruption\u2019, \u2018government effectiveness\u2019 and \u2018control of corruption\u2019, and \u2018voice and accountability\u2019 and \u2018government effectiveness\u2019. Corruption should not be fought for the sake of fighting corruption, but as a means to improve the efficiency of public administration. Although Viet Nam has changed its rank on the TI CPI, its actual score hasn\u2019t changed from year to year. So corruption in Viet Nam is neither increasing nor decreasing. Rather, there is a clear and constant pattern of corruption. Petty corruption is most prevalent, but in recent years high-level scandals involving grand corruption have also surfaced. But Viet Nam is improving its regulatory framework to combat corruption, formulating a national strategy, passing resolutions and decrees, passing an anti-corruption law in 2005 that was amended in 2007.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "262bedbe-e3a4-4a23-b5a0-02f9ffbe7076": {"__data__": {"id_": "262bedbe-e3a4-4a23-b5a0-02f9ffbe7076", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "62e1543f79a10ac6b46537e91c9dfe8852b2ef8d79ce5156541055edf4f75564"}, "2": {"node_id": "0c53da07-ab29-40a6-a62e-23ab057fc5d5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65f1c94870ce44e4c1ebf9b8e618daecafdc46d14bb0960949ffd893e305f87c"}}, "hash": "1e40da2f3701569dabe0ce969e84b60c82fa05ab8ebcb838a565ff48fd40335d", "text": "Civil society, although currently not a central pillar of the national strategy, is becoming increasingly important.

CRCs can be used at all levels, national, provincial and district levels by both the government and civil society. Giovanni Gallo observed that, six months after the signing of the UNCAC, the UN Global Compact adopted a tenth principle to the effect that \u201cbusinesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery\u201d. He also pointed to a remarkable change over the last five years among companies who asserted they had nothing to do with UNODC, drugs, crime and corruption. From saying they had clean hands and were victims of public corruption, these companies now instead acknowledge that UNODC and UNCAC can help them reduce corruption in their companies and in the countries where they do business. Numerous corruption scandals start and end in the private sector. In December of 2007, at the Bali Conference of State Parties of the UNCAC, all stakeholders agreed to adopt the Bali Business Declaration. This declaration commits to working towards the alignment of business principles with the fundamental values enshrined in the UNCAC; towards developing mechanisms to review company compliance with realigned business principles; and towards strengthening private- public partnerships for combating corruption in business. UNODC, in accordance with these commitments, is currently working on a number of joint projects with the private sector. During the discussions, one participant referred to experiences from Bangladesh, where public- private partnerships to fight corruption have been initiated. Fighting corruption is only possible if the people really support the campaign. The fact that Bangladesh figured as \u2018most corrupt country in the world\u2019 in a TI CPI contributed much to raising awareness. Following a gap analysis presented to Parliament and following the Bali Conference, the Government took several steps to address the issue, including the passage of legislation governing the right to information, mandatory disclosure of eight types of information for running election candidates, and transparency measures in procurement. A participant from Afghanistan asked what measures could be taken against corruption in the private sector. Mr. Gallo pointed out that bribery and embezzlement in the private sector figure in the UNCAC chapter on criminalization. In this light, penal codes should be amended to include these offenses. Companies need to understand that corruption does not benefit anyone. Another participant observed that the culture of corruption is sometimes based on pity for underpaid civil servants, and that the people at large may be part and parcel of a corruption culture. Finally, one participant referred to the potential advantages of new technology such as blogs, YouTube and SMSs, asking how the new media could be used to fight corruption, and suggesting, for one thing, that these tools should make it much easier to publicize the truth. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cCompanies need to understand that corruption does not benefit anyone.\u201d 42 Supporting UNCAC implementation Session 9 Synergies with other regional and international actors Chair: Mohamed Anil, Commissioner of Legal Reforms, Ministry of Legal Reforms, Maldives Speakers: Sandra Nicoll, Governance and Capacity Development, ADB Luckshmi Jayawickrama, Director General, CIABOC, Sri Lanka Dan Dionisie, Public Administration Reform and Anti-Corruption Adviser, UNDP Regional Service Centre Bratislava Rapporteur: Laurentina Barreto Soares, Programme Officer, Governance Unit, UNDP Timor Leste Sandra Nicoll introduced the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific, launched in 1999 by a group of Asia-Pacific countries to more proactively address corruption in the region.

The Commission investigates complaints against public servants as well as members of the general public in respect of incidents of bribery, corruption and accumulation of wealth beyond known income. In performing this function, the Commission has encountered three important obstacles: reluctance among persons with grievances to complain to the Commission \u2013 a consequence, at least in part, of too-often repeated postponements of trials in law courts and the absence of a whistle-blowers protection Act; a prevailing willingness in the private sector to grease the palms of state officials so they will do their job; and insufficient state funds to combat bribery and corruption or to act quickly to strengthen the prevailing law. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 43 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region Supported by international funding, the Commission works closely with CSOs to raise awareness among the general public and state officials regarding their rights and duties. The Commission recently introduced new procedures to enhance its effectiveness: an information sheet to be completed by complainants, providing a valid and comprehensive communication upon which the Commission can act; a methodology that assists people in preparing for trials, thereby helping to secure successful prosecutions; technical assistance to guide complainants through investigations; more publicity in state media regarding the prevention programme; and necessary training for staff. Dan Dionisie shared lessons on regional anti-corruption cooperation in Eastern Europe and the CIS. The UNDP Bratislava Regional Centre, for example, established an Anti-Corruption Practitioners Network (ACPN). The ACPN facilitates professional networking, information sharing, expert referral, technical advice and capacity development for anti-corruption agencies (ACAs). Capacity development focuses on the preventive and educational ACA functions of policy development, coordination, monitoring, research, education, and public awareness. Regional cooperation is relatively easy in the Eastern Europe and CIS region because most of these countries have ratified international legal instruments such as UNCAC, OECD and CoE anti-corruption Conventions. It is also interesting that several countries already have well-established ACAs, and are relatively successful in combating the levels of public corruption, while others are still struggling to start up basic AC functions and institutions. All countries in post-communist transition face comparable challenges in fighting corruption. (For details on lessons learned, approaches and challenges, refer to the presentation.) Overall, challenges for ACAs reflect general public-sector difficulties. One must recognize that quick fixes and shortcuts cannot be sustained in the long run. There is no alternative to overall public-administration reform and capacity development, something that requires persistent long-term engagement. Other questions raised by participants included these: whether development agencies should allow media access to their contractors blacklist; what can be done to improve in-country networking within specific sectors and between different sectors; and whether ICTs play significant roles in combating corruption. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cRegional knowledge sharing among Anti-Corruption Agencies contributes significantly to their overall capacity development and effectiveness.\u201d 44 Supporting UNCAC implementation In response to the first of these questions, the ADB representative suggested that sharing information with the public and the media was important as an act of transparency, even though every organization will have its own disclosure policies. This having said, it\u2019s well recognized that ADB itself is a multilateral organization with a very liberal public-disclosure information policy. Responding to the other questions, the speakers suggested that the regional approach to combating corruption is not the only solution and not enough. It would instead be useful to link country offices and agencies within countries, and to apply IT and e-governance to promote anti- corruption efforts.

The clinics considered human rights, natural-resource revenue management, gender, post-conflict reconstruction, and international-aid transparency, focusing on linkages with UNCAC, challenges and programming entry points for UNDP in democratic governance initiatives. Clinic 1 Human rights and anti-corruption Presenters/facilitators: Sudarshan and Phil Matsheza Rapporteur: Samarajoo Manikam, Malaysia UNCAC linkages. Although the fight against corruption aims to enhance human rights, in some instances it may instead encroach on these rights. Human rights Conventions have existed for many years, while UNCAC is only recent. But common principles include accountability, rule of law, right to information, transparency, non-discrimination and participation. Thus there is convergence between UNCAC provisions and the human rights expressed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), etc. Challenges. Corruption leads to discrimination, contravening the human-rights mandate, which is based on non-discrimination. Does democracy help reduce corruption? In some democracies, the problem occurs at rather high bureaucratic levels and proves hard to tackle. \u2022 \u2022 46 Supporting UNCAC implementation Programming entry points. Look for the middle path, ensuring that individual human rights are respected whilst at the same time enforcement agencies fight corruption. Explore ways of dealing with corrupt people other than putting them behind bars, for example through people\u2019s forums where offenders (if there is sufficient evidence) are named and shamed. Such an approach has worked in parts of India, where offenders have thereby been induced to voluntarily return misused funds. Clinic 2 Natural-resource revenue management Presenter/facilitator: Pauline Tamesis Rapporteur: Saiful Bhuiyan, Bangladesh UNCAC linkages. Natural-resource management and UNCAC both aim at sustainable development. UNCAC supports public reporting, CSO oversight, and people\u2019s empowerment. Other UNCAC links relate to non-tax revenue lost or diverted, criminal offenses, and abuse of public authority. Challenges. Proper policies for management of natural resources are needed. One challenge is the privatization of public policies because, in some LDCs, Governments have limited bargaining power and companies formulate policies tainted by their own interests. In some cases, moreover, lack of advanced capacity leads to limited understanding of the concept of natural-resource management. Programming entry points. These include assistance in natural-resource management through sharing experiences and practices; ensuring government/company accountability by citizen empowerment; and assistance for LDCs with procurement and contracts when there is a lack of bargaining power. Clinic 3 Gender and corruption Presenter/facilitator: Roohi Metcalfe Rapporteur: Charmaine Rodrigues, UNDP Pacific Centre Preliminary reflections. In future training, gender should be addressed in the plenary as an integral part of analysis and implementation. Men and women can be both victims and perpetrators of corruption. They are both agents of change. Corruption does not just involve \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cAlthough the fight against corruption aims to enhance human rights, in some instances it may instead encroach on these rights.\u201d 47 Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific region money but may include sexual exploitation, illegal benefits or gains, the illegitimate use of power manifested in various ways. UNCAC linkages. UNCAC itself does not refer specifically to gender, not even in Article 13 (on participation), so a link is needed to treaties such as CEDAW. There is a need to raise awareness, taking cultural considerations into account, regarding linkages between gender and corruption. Challenges. Gender-related differences in both the response to and the impact of corruption need analysis. As part of this, gender-disaggregated statistics are needed. Perhaps less opportunity for corruption presents itself to women, for example, because they are often relegated to government positions of lesser power. Programming entry points. Gender and corruption are cross-cutting issues in programming, yet gender sometimes remains overlooked. This element needs to be included at all stages of programming, including formulation, decision-making and implementation. Gender also needs to be reflected in monitoring and evaluation (M&E) through gender-disaggregated indicators and a better methodology to guide implementers.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e24e7c5b-dab9-4992-9e74-74aed1d03ed1": {"__data__": {"id_": "e24e7c5b-dab9-4992-9e74-74aed1d03ed1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "db93bc6beadea2254d24aa4d083b9528be03fa60a45fc2fab52f1ffd5217905b"}, "2": {"node_id": "bc0d7ddc-f9fd-48ae-b85f-6e31cec3ea3a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "189504b98fa15e3286e0553a91f40f04bed0071e7696dea4657b6c4920a0dee6"}}, "hash": "4d6a3e8b80e2e9cb883431e705677e26fb69ca3a2c08c494d262f35ad6c5ed11", "text": "UNCAC can be used as an entry point through Articles 13 and 60, but gender should be mainstreamed in all articles.

UNCAC principles should be applied in developing the relevant institutions in post-conflict situations. Challenges. Massive flows of aid create both incentives and opportunity for corruption.

This is a new initiative launched at the Accra High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in September of 2008. Fourteen donors and development agencies including DFID, UNDP and WB signed up to the initiative. Asked to be open about their funds to countries (both immediate and mid-term), donors have agreed to set up a model by the end of 2009 whereby all aid flows will be recorded and monitored. The initiative involves multiple linkages with UNCAC, notably with regard to Articles 5, 7, 9, 10 and 13. CSOs can use this instrument to monitor the aid flow, but they also need to be forthcoming, participating themselves in a way they too can be held accountable for their activities. Challenges. Parliamentary oversight may politicize technical assistance, and could delay project implementation. There is also a risk of the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) being donor driven and, instead of being nationally owned, coming to represent a second, parallel system alongside the national budget. The greatest challenge is to bring on board development partners other than those who have already signed up (international NGOs, some donors who expressed support for the initiative but have yet to sign up, and new development actors such as China). Another challenge involves sensitive issues, for example with technical assistance that may have military security implications. Programming entry points. National capacity development for Parliament and the Government to participate in this initiative, as well as for CSOs to monitor the initiative and to be part of it. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u201cMassive flows of aid create both incentives and opportunity for corruption.\u201d 48 Conclusions and follow-up The technical training brought together 61 participants from 18 countries in the region, notably Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, Fiji, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia, Pakistan, Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam. For three days, participants exchanged ideas and experiences in tackling corruption and deepened their understanding of UNCAC as a framework for reducing poverty and promoting sustainable development. The workshop included 33 presentations, all of which are available online (see the links under each session). The agenda provided a good mixture of topics and guest speakers and a very informative overview of UNCAC. In terms of follow-up, participants suggested UNDP pursue the establishment of the Integrity in Action (INTACT) network of anti-corruption practitioners in the region to share experience, knowledge and information. They also proposed establishing a directory of focal points and, with the relevant Ministries, organizing capacity-development activities at the country level. It would also be useful, they said, to monitor progress in implementing UNCAC in follow-up workshops. The UNDP RCB will ride this momentum through the creation of an interactive portal on anti- corruption. This portal will focus on preventive measures in the fight against corruption and on anti-corruption initiatives aimed at reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs, highlighting sectoral approaches in areas such as education, health and non-renewable natural resources. The portal will facilitate exchange among UNDP practitioners and national counterparts involved in UNDP anti-corruption initiatives. It will provide a one-stop shop for hands-on country- level experience generated by UNDP, government entities and CSOs in preventing corruption. Knowledge products developed at the country level will be made easily available for anti- corruption practitioners and partners in the region. At the country level, UNDP COs will pursue their activities to support UNCAC implementation. For example, in Bangladesh, UNDP will organize an \u2018Executive Training for the Government Officials on the UNCAC\u2019 as well as a TOT on the same topic. In Mongolia, furthermore, the UNDP CO is planning several follow-up activities with its partners (see box).

Samuel.de.jaegere@undp.org 60 Supporting UNCAC implementation Overall, the workshop provided a useful opportunity to share experiences and deepen participant understanding of UNCAC. The agenda provided a good mixture of topics and guest speakers together with a very informative overview of UNCAC. Some participants suggested having fewer presentations (maximum three per session), thereby leaving more time for questions and answers. They also suggested devoting more discussion to sectoral approaches and local initiatives, the impact of corruption on gender, the informal sector and poor people, and the experiences of Singapore and Hong Kong in fighting corruption. The participation of UNODC, ADB and other partners was highly appreciated, both in terms of substance and in terms of the presentation of such diverse perspectives on corruption. In general, participants lauded the speakers\u2019 presentations (although in some cases more innovative thinking and a more even quality might have been expected). The presentation on UNCAC was considered very useful. Participants rated the workshop organization as very good to excellent, and they appreciated the real-time availability of documents and presentations in SNAP. The workshop venue was considered excellent. In terms of improvements, they suggested (i) sending invitations earlier, thereby facilitating visa procedures and (ii) evaluating sessions at the end of each day, rather than at the end of the three- day workshop. As follow-up, participants suggested proceeding with the establishment of the \u2018Integrity in Action\u2019 network of anti-corruption practitioners in the region to share experiences and information.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3ac22c5-28c3-4cbd-94e1-3498f2f5da96": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3ac22c5-28c3-4cbd-94e1-3498f2f5da96", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Supporting UNCAC Implementation: Country experiences in the Asia-Pacific Region", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ba7b8bb11e0c4d385eaead8fe23c776d607c13e8b4de0106d400d0172f7c46d6"}, "2": {"node_id": "9f385908-25fb-4474-90c6-41cf13ad1388", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/supporting-uncac-implementation-country-experiences-asia-pacific-region-0", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "15ce17fad22735a2a41614a445ccb1b852da4b50612749cc673494cf57f6e841"}}, "hash": "cb5775928dafbaf5b0f62be5918d9e65527954934ab4ac4ec709f6b041944444", "text": "They also proposed establishing a directory of focal points and, together with the relevant Ministries, organizing capacity development activities at the country level.

It was a great opportunity to share a wealth of diverse experiences. A job well done! Agenda Too many topics and speakers were squeezed into this single workshop. A clearer focus combined with presentation and more space for discussions would enhance the effectiveness of the training. I would request that there be more participation through Q&A. Need to have more sectoral discussions, for example of good practices on the ground, more local initiatives. Need more discussion of how corruption impacts on gender, the informal sector and poor people in general. The agenda was a bit too long and, when it came to the end of the day, it was difficult to remain attentive. I would like more comprehensive workshops that dedicate themselves to the implementation of UNCAC, especially since most countries that have ratified the Convention need guidance concerning the actual implementation of UNCAC principles. The clinics were very useful. They should be a compulsory component of all workshops. It would have been of value to have had representatives from Singapore ICAC and Hong Kong, or even reps. from another bureau, to present their models. Good mixture of topics and guest speakers. Provided good technical guidance, country examples, and ideas. More coordination and preparation needed in presentations. Shouldn\u2019t be more than three presentations per session. The general information/training on UNCAC and programming was very useful, but the Asian country case studies were not always so relevant for the Pacific. Speakers Speakers were very good overall. Presentations were very diverse (good), but of uneven quality. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 68 Supporting UNCAC implementation Presentations lacked knowledge and substantive thinking. UNDP needs to move forward as a knowledge resource and innovative organization. Appreciate joint UNDP-UNODC approach and inclusion of others, e.g. ADB. Very useful for making contacts and discussions in the margins. Useful workshop, though some of the country presentations were not very focused. UNODC overview of UNCAC was very good, and will be useful in the future. Organization Well organized and well received. Invitations should be sent well in advance to accelerate visa processes. Providing evaluations at the end of each day, when evaluations are fresher, would be more fruitful than only at the end of the final session. Three days was too short for such a vital topic in the context of the MDGs and global economy. Four days would have been better, as this would have given speakers more time. The workshop was well organized in terms of content, venue, facilities and presenters. Excellent job by the organizers. Excellent organization. Very well organized, well-run event. Liked the real-time availability of documents and presentation on SNAP. Handouts of the speaker presentations would have been helpful. Overall, the activity was perfect. Logistical suggestion: Internet access should be provided free of charge in the rooms. Follow-up It is suggested that the programme include a follow-through activity involving some form of computation. Inquiries from participants coming from various sectors would prove useful in planning subsequent activities. A directory of focal persons would be useful. Similar workshops would be very relevant in taking stock of progress in the implementation of UNCAC.

It is an attempt to put together, in one place, APRI\u2019s experiential, hands-on knowledge accumulated in the process of publishing Asia-Paci\ufb01c RHDRs and other reports. It provides a quick reference for the production process including drafting, editing, reviewing and publication of publishable documents. This Prepkit does not substitute the HDR Toolkit for National and Regional Human Development Report Teams, which may be seen at http://hdr.undp.org/nhdr/toolkit/. This Prepkit is an informal guide for the preparation and production of research based printed knowledge products. The steps listed in this document should be customized to speci\ufb01c situations. They do not have to be necessarily followed in each case, but are useful to consider in the process of production. This Prepkit is largely drawn from our experience of working on Regional Human Development Reports, MDG Reports and other published knowledge products. Introduction 5 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications I. Initiating the Process 1. Select a THEME/ISSUE that is of relevance to the country. 2. Identify PARTNERS or COLLABORATORS for the project, if applicable. The partnership can be on the basis of various factors, but primarily thematic and research interests. You may also like to consider strategic interests. 3. Draft a PROJECT PROPOSAL which includes the rationale for the project, the objective, methodology, timeline and budget estimates. Where applicable, the proposal should clearly identify the countries to be covered and the scope of the research. A tentative, \u201csub-zero\u201d draft outline of the Report could also be included. 4. It is useful to institute a MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE for major documents like the NHDR or and MDG Report. The ManCom for the HDR includes the agents that are funding the project. The ManCom meets at regular intervals (physically or virtually) during the drafting period to make decisions related to both administrative and content matters. II. Developing a Timeline 1. A timeline detailing all activities related to the preparation stage \u2013 submission of outputs, consultations, Management Committee meetings, reviews, revisions, etc. \u2013 helps to facilitate and track the process. The timeline evolves and is periodically updated according to ManCom decisions and other factors. Steps in the Production Process 1 6 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications III.

For national studies, more regional and local level consultations can be organized. 3. TECHNICAL REVIEW REGIONAL CONSULTATIONS.

Chapters are revised based on feedback from the consultations, and the process of \ufb01nalizing of the knowledge product begins. IV. Drafting 1. The drafting process depends on the methodology agreed. Various consultants can work on sub-thematic research areas while an Overall Research Coordinator could take charge of the drafting (re-writing) of the complete report. Alternatively, a single researcher can be in charge of drafting the complete report with appropriate research support. 2. Select CONSULTANTS/ RESEARCH INSTITUTES. Their terms of reference are drafted, and recruitment and contracting follows. TORs should allow for some changes in approach and content \u2013 sometimes ManCom meetings and peer reviews can change directions. 7 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications 3. If required, a STATISTICIAN/ECONOMIST may be recruited to work on statistical work related to document, including research on possible indices. A Technical Study - an o\ufb00-shoot of main document, yet a separate product - can add value to the \ufb01nal publication. 4. SPECIAL CONTRIBUTORS to the report can be identi\ufb01ed and contributions requested. Special Contributors are distinguished international/national personalities, whose pieces are displayed prominently in boxes to highlight a particular issue(s), adding reader interest, credence and advocacy potential. Box items, which can be anecdotal pieces, add interest and \u2018colour\u2019 to the report. 5. Box items. It is a good idea to collect speci\ufb01c examples, particular cases, factual information, etc. which can make useful box items. These can later be rewritten or edited depending on space, importance and prioritization. 6. Data and statistics are critical. All data should be referenced and speci\ufb01c sources provided. INTERNATIONAL DATA is used in multi-country HDRs for easy comparability. Common data sources include the World Bank databases, UN Statistics Division, UNESCAP. NHDRs may use international, national or sub- national data. V. Review 1. PEER REVIEWERS, who may be from within the UN system or outside, are selected in various ways. THEMATIC REVIEWERS are chosen on the basis of their expertise on the theme or sub-themes of the Report. OVERALL PEER REVIEWERS, generally well-known \u2018Star Experts\u2019 and whose association adds weight and credibility to the report, can also be selected. 2. It helps to pay peer reviewers in order to ensure that reviews are conducted substantively, and that their submission is timely. It is hard to follow-up, request written comments and expect timelines to be adhered to if no payment is made. It is advisable to prepare a TOR which can serve as a guide for peer reviewing. 8 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications 3. REVIEW GUIDELINES can be circulated to peer reviewers. While reviewers are free to use their own criteria for providing feedback, these guidelines can serve as useful pointers. (See suggested Peer Review Guidelines - pg 11) 4. Preliminary draft chapters are \ufb01rst circulated and reviewed internally and updated accordingly. 5. Revised (and more developed) drafts are circulated to thematic peer reviewers for review. 6. After the revisions from the Technical Consultations are incorporated into the draft, a \ufb01nal completed draft is circulated to the panel of OVERALL PEER REVIEWERS. VI. Editing 1. Editing is of two kinds \u2013 CONTENT EDITING and COPY EDITING 2. A good CONTENT EDITOR can transform a draft from a well researched but what may be a somewhat disjointed piece of writing into a coherent, internally consistent document with a common thread tying the di\ufb00erent parts of the report together. It is worth having an experienced content editor as early as possible. It is very useful for the content editor to participate in the various consultations. 3. COPY EDITING involves the \ufb01nal nitty-gritty of grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc. It is useful to hire an COPY EDITOR who is familiar with the UNDP Style and Spelling guides (see pg. 17 for details on Style and Spelling List can be found in Annex IV pg 45).

Many things can be pursued in parallel. \uf06c Do not expect research institutions/consultants to be responsible for the product; or, to deliver quality products timely. Have at least one designated person in the internal team to backstop consultants and maintain timelines. \uf06c Do not hire all \u2018stars\u2019 for they may not be able to devote enough time to the task. Before recruiting a Consultant, check his/her research and analytical capability \u2013 writing skills are important! \uf06c Do not send \ufb01rst drafts to reviewers; they tend to be rough cuts. \uf06c Do not send draft for peer review without suggested guidelines. \uf06c Do not send draft for external review until it has been reviewed internally and updated. \uf06c Do not send feedback on drafts directly to writers. Have a vetting system for assessing key points and consolidation of relevant feedback. 11 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications I. Objective Peer review is an important part in the process of preparation of HDRs and other knowledge products. It consists of obtaining diverse but substantive comments from experts in the \ufb01eld who are not directly involved in its preparation. This also helps add credibility to the report. II. General Note While reviewers are free to use their own criteria while reading, when providing feedback, here are some useful suggestions. The aim of the review is to be constructive in order that the writer is better able to express himself. The more speci\ufb01c a reviewer is, the more useful the writer will \ufb01nd the inputs. III. Possible Parameters for Peer Reviews \uf06c The role of the peer reviewer is to assist writers in expressing their ideas. Do not get caught up in providing critical evaluations, and do not re-write the paper. Makes your own job easier. \uf06c Read as a reader, rather than as a critic. Describe how you react to the piece. Point out where something doesn\u2019t read well but then o\ufb00er speci\ufb01c suggestions for improvement. \uf06c Your role is not primarily as a proofreader. Hence if you notice a recurring error, do point it out, but don't spend a lot of your time correcting typos and individual spelling, grammar, or punctuation problems. Your time is precious. Peer Review Guidelines 2 12 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications \uf06c Always o\ufb00er assistance/comments. It does not have to be in the form of advice. \uf06c If the draft seems successful as is, your saying just that may matter a good deal (and may be as astute as any set of suggestions). There is no need to feel duty bound to \ufb01nd something to criticize. \uf06c Criticize the lack of relevant citations but then suggest what articles they should consider including. \uf06c Point out \ufb02aws in logic (if evident) and o\ufb00er a correction.

Ibid. takes the place of the author\u2019s name, the title of the work and as much of the succeeding information about the reference as is identical. Op. cit. (opere citato, \u2018in the work cited\u2019) is used to replace references to books or pamphlets cited earlier but not necessarily immediately beforehand. Op. cit. is used only with the surname of an author, never with the name of an organization. A short form of the referenced title may be used instead of op. cit. IV. Country Names and Currencies Country names and currencies are listed in the United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database (http://unterm.un.org). After you start your search, enter the name of the country in the \u201csearch\u201d \ufb01eld. Under \u201csubject\u201d, click on the down arrow and choose \u201ccountry name\u201d. Both the short and formal country names are given. The short form is used for most purposes in the United Nations. The formal name is generally used in legal texts, such as treaties. In communications from Governments issued as United Nations documents, the country designations used by the author of the communication are retained in 20 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications the edited text, even if they are not consistent with established United Nations terminology. V. Foreign Words The foreign words listed in The Concise Oxford Dictionary are considered to have been adopted into the English language and are therefore not italicized. Foreign words not listed in the COD should be italicized. Non-English names of organizations, \ufb01rms, ministries and the like are not italicized. Notes \uf06c A single asterisk (*) indicates a change from previous practice \uf06c A double asterisk (**) indicates a variation from the eleventh edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary \uf06c Fractions expressed in words are not hyphenated (e.g. one third of the total), unless they are used as adjectives (e.g. one-third share) \uf06c In technical texts, ages are expressed in \ufb01gures VI. Language As UNDP policies and programmes evolve and change, so too does the language used in our day-to-day work. Keeping up with such changes can be di\ufb03cult. Below is a sample of phrases that have recently changed. Avoid sexist and racist language All writers and editors should try to make sure that the texts they are preparing do not show sexual or racial bias in content or expression. The most important point is for the writer to remember that both men and women, and various racial groups, will be reading the manuscript. The following general rules can also be helpful: 21 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications \uf06c Avoid making generalizations about the characteristics of certain nationalities or racial groups. \uf06c Use a term that includes men and women (e.g. \u201cthe best candidate for the job,\u201d rather than \u201cthe best man for the job\u201d). \uf06c Except where strictly necessary, try to avoid the use of \u201che\u201d when referring to both sexes. You can put the sentence into the plural (e.g. not \u201cthe worker ... he\u201d but \u201cworkers ... they\u201d), leave the pronoun out, change the pronoun to a de\ufb01nite article, use a noun (or a general noun like \u201cindividual\u201d) instead of the pronoun, or use \u201che or she.\u201d \uf06c Remember that most jobs or roles can be performed by either men or women.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "385c17f7-d00a-4ceb-9bfc-877e7e720daa": {"__data__": {"id_": "385c17f7-d00a-4ceb-9bfc-877e7e720daa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/surviving-publication-process-prepkit-publications", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Surviving the Publication Process: A Prepkit for Publications", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/surviving-publication-process-prepkit-publications", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4ea5cf72891de0d8c006f8b88c6145ff722b37fc0545c2007936302d108e201e"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6b1311e-760c-49aa-b34d-7b8faca7ffb5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/surviving-publication-process-prepkit-publications", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f857eb4444440b150789a26ba8272e158ee4f13c5be9e7dcf9a129b100c0ce0"}}, "hash": "bb8e91a2e24d1004602907722761dd6d39228394c455b7220ca302d0cc766de9", "text": "\uf06c Whenever possible, replace words ending in \u201cman\u201d with a term that can apply to either sex, e.g. \u201cseafarer,\u201d \u201cpolice o\ufb03cer\u201d and \u201c\ufb01re-\ufb01ghter\u201d rather than \u201cseaman,\u201d \u201cpoliceman\u201d and \u201c\ufb01reman.\u201d \uf06c Photographs and illustrations showing people should include women, various social and ethnic groups, etc., as appropriate. \u2014 Adapted from the ILO house style manual Past usage Suggested usage AIDS orphans children orphaned by AIDS developed countries industrialized countries \ufb01eld o\ufb03ce country o\ufb03ce peri-urban areas shanty towns, squatter settlements (when implying poor areas) prostitutes commercial sex workers street people people living or working on the streets underdeveloped countries developing countries 22 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications UNDP HIV-related language policy Language and the image it evokes shape and in\ufb02uence behaviour and attitudes.

The use of language is an ethical and a programmatic issue. UNDP has adopted the following principles to guide its HIV-related language. Language should be inclusive and not create and reinforce a Them/Us mentality or approach. For example, a term such as \u201cintervention\u201d places the speaker outside of the group of people for or with whom he or she is working. Words like \u201ccontrol\u201d set up a particular type of distancing relationship between the speaker and the listeners. Care should be taken with the use of the pronouns \u201cthey\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cthem\u201d, etc. It is better if the vocabulary used is drawn from the vocabulary of peace and human development rather than from the vocabulary of war. For example, synonyms could be found for words like \u201ccampaign\u201d, \u201ccontrol\u201d, \u201csurveillance\u201d, etc. Descriptive terms used should be those preferred or chosen by persons described. For example, \u201csex workers\u201d is often the term preferred by those concerned rather than \u201cprostitutes\u201d; \u201cpeople living with HIV\u201d or \u201cpeople living with AIDS\u201d are preferred by infected persons rather than \u201cvictims\u201d. Language should be value neutral, gender sensitive and should be empowering rather than disempowering. Terms such as \u201cpromiscuous\u201d, \u201cdrug abuse\u201d and all derogatory terms alienate rather than create the trust and respect required. Terms such as \u201cvictim\u201d or \u201csufferer\u201d suggest powerlessness; \u201chaemophiliac\u201d or \u201cAIDS patient\u201d identify a human being by their medical condition alone. \u201cInjecting drug users\u201d is used rather than \u201cdrug addicts\u201d. Terms such as \u201cliving with HIV\u201d recognize that an infected person may continue to live well and productively for many years. 23 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications Terms used need to be strictly accurate. For example, \u201cAIDS\u201d describes the conditions and illnesses associated with signi\ufb01cant progression of infection. Otherwise, the terms used included \u201cHIV infection\u201d, \u201cHIV epidemic\u201d, \u201cHIV-related illnesses or conditions\u201d, etc. \u201cSituation of risk\u201d is used rather than \u201crisk behaviour\u201d or \u201crisk groups\u201d, since the same act may be safe in one situation and unsafe in another. The safety of the situation has to be continually assessed. The terms used need to be adequate to inform accurately. For example, the modes of HIV transmission and the options for protective behaviour change need to be explicitly stated so as to be clearly understood within all cultural contexts. The appropriate use of language respects the dignity and rights of all concerned, avoids contributing to the stigmatization and rejection of the a\ufb00ected and assists in creating the social changes required to overcome the epidemic. VII. Numbers Numbers expressed in words In general, numbers under 10 should be written in words. Numbers should also be spelled out in the following contexts: at the beginning of a sentence; in approximate or isolated references to dimensions, weights and measures in non-technical, non-statistical texts; in fractions in narrative text; and in reference to ages in non- technical, nonstatistical texts. Numbers expressed in \ufb01gures Numbers between 10 and 999,999 should normally be expressed in \ufb01gures. In addition, the following are always expressed in \ufb01gures: percentages; ratios; results of voting; dates and time of day; numbers with decimal or vulgar fractions; statistics; degrees; dimensions, weights and measures, except when they are obviously intended to be approximate or in isolated references in a non-technical context; 24 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications series of \ufb01gures; document symbols; and page and paragraph references. Millions In English, numbers in the millions should be written as follows: 1 million, 3.4 million, BUT 3,432,000 (if there is more than one digit to the right of the decimal point). Percentages Percentages should be expressed in \ufb01gures.

There are only two versions of the logo: UNDP (English) and PNUD (French/ Spanish). 2. Each country o\ufb03ce will decide for itself which version of the logo to use, based on country-speci\ufb01c circumstances. 3. As described in the Graphic Standards guidelines, the only exception is a special con\ufb01guration of the logo for country o\ufb03ces, which includes below the logo, the country name in English, French and Spanish, and the Cyrillic and Arabic scripts. Please refer to the Graphic Standards, speci\ufb01cally to Pages 5 and 6, which show how to use the logo with country names. It also shows how not to use the new logo. Nothing but the country name can be added underneath the logo. 4. All HQ produced reports and material will be printed with the language equivalent logo. Country O\ufb03ces decide what language version of the logo to use on any nationally produced report, document and/or material. The logo is for use by country o\ufb03ces on publications and other materials for use in that country. This version has been developed to reinforce the \ufb01eld-driven nature of UNDP. 1 From the website of the Communications O\ufb03ce of the Administrator, http://intra.undp.org/coa 30 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications 5.

External audiences include donors, developing countries, civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations, parliamentarians, academics, the private sector, media and other constituents. These publications may be produced periodically, occasionally or once only.

The Communications O\ufb03ce of the Administrator is available for advice on the implementation of the Publications Policy. Regional Bureaux should contact their respective regional focal points for advice. 2. Until 2002, the Publications Policy applied to units at UNDP New York (headquarters) and UNDP Liaison O\ufb03ces for publications de\ufb01ned in paragraph 1. On 28 February 2002, the Executive Team decided to extend the Publications Policy to country o\ufb03ces. Country o\ufb03ces are encouraged to apply the Policy when producing publications. For now, country o\ufb03ces need not get approvals or clearances from the Publications Board. However, country o\ufb03ces are required to send their quarterly publication plans to their Publications Board representatives in the respective regional bureaux. 3. The Publications Board shall exempt from substantive content review existing publication series such as the Human Development Report, the National Human Development Reports (NHDR) and publications produced by the Evaluation O\ufb03ce. Publications by the Evaluation O\ufb03ce shall conform to corporate design guidelines. 4. National Human Development Reports shall always bear the date of the year in which they are launched rather than the date of the \ufb01nal draft. All published reports shall be made available online prior to media and/or advocacy outreach. The NHDR Unit in New York is ready to assist country o\ufb03ces with posting the reports online. For assistance, contact juan.pablo.mejia@undp.org. 5. A separate e-publications board will manage UNDP electronic publications. 6. As recommended by the Executive Board, at six-month intervals of each calendar year, every unit at UNDP headquarters shall provide the Publications Board with a master plan of its intended publications for the next six months. Master plans 35 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications should include: - The objective of each publication; - Target audiences; - Foreword by the Administrator, if needed; - Funding source; - Editorial and production cost estimates; - Price, if it is a sales publication; - Intended language versions; - Date of issuance; - Distribution plan, including UNDP Reference Unit, the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library and United Nations depository libraries, and - Launch plans, if any. 7. Any headquarters unit planning to produce a UNDP publication shall provide the above information electronically, using the prescribed noti\ufb01cation form, to the secretariat of the Publications Board in the Communications O\ufb03ce of the Administrator for review and clearance.

The Communications O\ufb03ce of the Administrator should invariably advise on corporate identity. Thus, all units must comply with the following: (a) The UNDP logo should be placed at the top right-hand corner on the front cover of all print publications: magazines, reports, books, brochures, posters, 37 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications \ufb02yers and exhibit displays with the exception of the Human Development Report and the Administrator\u2019s Illustrated Annual Report. (In the case of Arabic language publications, the logos would be placed on the upper left corner.) The Policy on Logo Use can be found at http://intra.undp.org/ branding/GSEp4.pdf. The UNDP logo can be downloaded from http://intra. undp.org/branding/download.html. b) When producing a publication with other partners (e.g., UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA, government institutions, civil society organizations and private sector entities), all logos should be placed on the same line either at the bottom or at the top of the front cover of the publication. All logos should be visually equal; no one logo should take precedence over the other logos of partnering agencies or organizations. There are no exceptions to this rule. (c) A standard description on UNDP shall appear at the beginning or end of each publication. The standard descriptions are also available in English, French and Spanish at http://intra.undp.org/branding/coreMessages.html. (d) The back cover should list the date of the publication and the contact address for copies and information. Generally, this will be the unit postal address, phone/fax numbers, e-mail, and Web site address; (e) Units may also seek ISBN or ISSN numbers for major publications, which makes bibliographic control easier. However, all publications for sale should carry an ISBN number. To obtain these numbers, please contact Leslyn Camacho at camacho@un.org or at 212 963 4469. The Communications O\ufb03ce of the Administrator can advise on procedures; (f) All units shall ensure that publications meet UNDP standards for quality of content, writing, editing, translation, design and printing. The Communications O\ufb03ce of the Administrator can advise and recommend writers, editors, translators and designers who meet UNDP editorial and 38 Surviving the Publication Process: Prepkit for Publications design standards and who will help to ensure that the publications are user-friendly and avoid the abuse of acronyms, jargon and other aspects unsuitable for an external audience. A UNDP Style Manual is now online at http://intra.undp.org/coa/stylemanual/undpstylemanual16dec.pdf. Originating units will be responsible for in-house and external peer review of the publication.

While Asia\u2019s is an enviable growth story, with steadily declining income poverty in most countries, hunger and malnutrition have proved much harder to combat. Although the recent rise in global food prices is being hotly debated inter- nationally, malnutrition has been a serious pre- existing issue, exacerbated during particularly adverse periods - sudden changes in prices, di- sasters, or conflicts. Malnutrition at both ends of the spectrum is of concern - undernutrition due to a shortage of calories and malnutrition due to rapidly changing lifestyles among the poor and the rich, resulting in excesses or shortages of certain nutrients, including obesity2.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9c3ee9f0-3820-4064-9dba-38003c179dc1": {"__data__": {"id_": "9c3ee9f0-3820-4064-9dba-38003c179dc1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/targeted-interventions-against-hunger-case-preschool-and-school-feeding", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Targeted Interventions against Hunger: A Case for Preschool and School Feeding", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/targeted-interventions-against-hunger-case-preschool-and-school-feeding", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c010fad05c1bb1a8bd603d44a1a776d3a6b73a13037ca222e31c5f7da3e1f3f1"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3532b81-6b15-4fa6-8711-0a7711ff15e7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/targeted-interventions-against-hunger-case-preschool-and-school-feeding", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d89a907eb9be76fcf4acceafc22952c3f8500e878c5bb925eb27fd3736a833a9"}}, "hash": "5a00b3e924590eed43395c5c40d2ed9fa4e30b5183d51a5a43d906b93705753d", "text": "National policies have tried to respond to the issue in dif- ferent ways. The focus of this paper is on direct feeding schemes for the nutritionally vulnerable as a strategic policy intervention and operation- alising the idea of the right to food.

Section IV examines the potential and limitations of direct food investments and finds that while the potential is enormous, going well beyond hunger, the existence of such schemes does not automatically result in the realization of these benefits.

The Context: Nutrition Concerns in Asia 2 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING Malnutrition in children contributes to over half of child deaths, globally4. With food deprivation, the debilitating effects of infectious diseases and general neglect are compounded. Over 150 million children under age five in the developing world are underweight for their respective ages, including almost half the children in southern Asia. Malnutrition among children is a pretty good reflection of the condition of the popu- lation as a whole. We see progress in East Asia where the numbers more than halved, declin- ing from 24 to 10 million children malnourished over the period 1990 to 2003. From 1996 to 2005, the share of underweight-for-age children in China was eight percent, Malaysia 11 percent, Thailand 18 percent; though in the Philippines, at 28 percent, it was higher. In South Asia, the share of children below five undernourished is much higher on an average, with Bangladesh at 48 percent, India 47 percent, and Sri Lanka 29 percent. The South Asia figures are comparable with or even worse than some of the poorest countries in the world such as Burkina Faso with 38 percent or Sierra Leone 27 percent (UNDP 2007)5. And even in East Asia, there are continu- ing concerns about internal inequalities. The problem of malnutrition is wider and more persistent than income poverty (Rajivan, A, 2004). Table 1.1 shows that the share of chil- dren under five who are moderately or severely underweight is higher than the share of popu- lation living under a dollar a day in Asia-Pacific. If micronutrient deficiencies, anaemia among women and adolescent girls, and other forms of adult malnutrition are added, the share of popu- lation malnourished is more than 50 percent. Si- multaneous existence of nutritional deprivation among some sections and obesity among others is a modern paradox. With food surpluses global- ly, overflowing supermarket shelves people still cannot take food security for granted. Recent dramatic increases in staple food prices are likely to plunge still more people into hunger.

Small (stunted) baby girls grow up to become small adolescents and undernourished mothers. It is not uncommon for girls in Asia, especially in South Asia, to become teen-aged mothers while their own bodies are still growing. With low weight gain during pregnancy, they, in turn, have low birth weight infants. Relative neglect of girls and inaccurate and inadequate knowl- edge of factors that influence nutrition out- comes contribute to transmitting malnutrition across generations. India has used direct food interventions as a policy instrument in a number of its states, some more successful than others. With a popula- tion of 1.1 billion spread over 30 states and five Union Territories, enormous diversity and ineq- uities, India is more like 25 countries, some of them LDCs8. The population of some of the indi- vidual states (Uttar Pradesh 166 million, Andhra Pradesh 76 million, Tamil Nadu 62 million, Maha- rashtra 97 million) compares with many country populations (Philippines 88 million, Republic of Korea 48 million, Nepal 28 million, Malaysia 24 million, Sri Lanka 20 million). Hence, the experi- ence of even a single state can have relevance for other countries. India is, both shining and whining simultane- ously, with some extreme contrasts. Its annual GDP growth rate has been high at over nine percent in 2006 (up from only six percent per annum in the 1980s and 1990s). Poverty is fall- ing - the national poverty share halved between 1977-78 and 2004-05.

World Bank, 2007 There has been a jump in savings in India - at 32.4 percent as of March 2006, this was up from the 1990-2004 average of 25 percent9. There has also been a jump in investment to 33.4 percent which is a breakthrough from a 26 percent av- erage in the last 15 years. FDI inflows are grow- ing with net inflows at US$4.7 billion in 2005-06 and a further acceleration in 2006-07 represent- ing an approximate doubling over the previous year10. Corporate entrepreneurial success stories are plenty - deeper and broader than perhaps even China in terms of world class companies - IT, telecom, pharmaceuticals, energy, steel and auto components. The country has a high stock of human capital which can unshackle the coun- try\u2019s potential - finally providing a demographic dividend. But amidst growing wealth, half India\u2019s chil- dren are clinically underweight.

Undernutrition does not get attention the way communicable diseases and deaths do. It is through techniques like growth charts that plot actual weights against an external \u2018norm\u2019 that we can \u2018reveal\u2019 malnutrition. For example, Figure 1.2 represents a sample growth chart where ac- tual weights for corresponding ages of a child up to 36 months of age are plotted against a \u2018norm\u2019. Growth faltering is evident right through the chart after the first six months15. Since the child is undernourished, almost every infectious episode results in a drop in weight. A question is sometimes raised regarding norms: why should international norms be used? Are they not external? Should norms not be from within ethnic groups? While body size is an out- come of both genetic and environmental fac- tors, most variation seems to be explained by the circumstances in which people live. The gap within groups is much more than the gap across. For example, figure 1.3 presents mean heights among seven year olds from eight countries. Outside South Asia, very few countries have such high levels of malnutrition. India is roughly on par with Burkina Faso, Niger and Sudan, which, in fact are a little better. In China, comparable malnutrition stands at just eight percent on av- erage14, though there are concerns regarding internal regional disparities. The situation in Asia represents an \u2018invisible emergency\u2019. When most of the population is undernourished, small body sizes as a result of growth faltering appear \u2018normal\u2019, becoming in- visible to an untrained observer.

There is not much varia- tion across ethnic groups - the dark circles across Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica and Nigeria are not that much apart. However, the gaps within countries across socioeconomic groups are much more - India and Guatemala showing the widest in-country gap. The problems are clearly more in the realm of social science rather than biology.

Neverthe- less, while the Right is asserted, and has consid- erable support from civil society organizations (CSOs), its understanding and operationalizing continues to be debated. Conceptually, the right to food is much less clear than other rights like the right to information or to free speech. Who does one enforce it against and how? Can parents be held liable? Can soci- ety at large? Can the State? Is it practical to pun- ish poor parents? It is generally agreed that the right to food does not imply that states must provide food to everyone18. Then how meaning- ful is the Right? Right to food is a bit like the right to education - another right not well understood. But once it achieves social legitimacy, it becomes real. No one today questions that children should be in school full-time, rather than in the labour force, unlike the days of the industrial revolution. Once people come to expect and demand social and economic rights as a matter of course, state policies tend to respond and have in the case of education done so, making it a de facto right. In India the right to education has been incorpo- rated in the constitution. Right to food, however, is not so explicitly defined by law. Operationalising the right to food is also a complex issue. The core elements of the right to food consist of availability, food safety and 10 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING acceptability19: One could take alternate posi- tions regarding who is responsible: the people, CSOs, experts or governments. In practice all are equally important in addressing hunger and malnutrition - the people to obtain access and tackle intra-household issues, the CSOs to lobby and hold authorities accountable, the experts to provide the right knowledge, and governments, as the ultimate duty holders, to ensure that all citizens are well nourished through providing access and knowledge. Even though food has not quite been acknowl- edged as a legally enforceable right, in late 2001, India\u2019s Supreme Court responded to a public in- terest litigation20 and ordered all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide cooked mid-day meals for school stu- dents and preschoolers below six21. Parents can demand the meals and enforce through courts if necessary, putting the onus on governments. None of the state governments in India liked it; it was considered a budgetary and organizational nightmare. Governments around the world have used sev- eral different instruments to promote food se- curity - bolstering food production, building buffer stocks of grain, price stabilization to ben- efit farmers and consumers, public distribution networks, employment schemes and direct nu- trition investments through programmes such as school and pre-school feeding. The focus of this paper is on the potential and limitations of direct nutrition investments through school and pre-school feeding programmes - schemes per- haps most resisted by governments but most popular with the poor. Such schemes contain elements of all dimensions of the core content of the right to food - availability, food safety and acceptability. If a reader feels that direct feeding schemes are a waste of time and resources, you are not alone. But the matter is worth thinking through again. Preschool and school feeding is an important step towards the right to food, though not suffi- cient. Meals (as against raw grains) also contrib- ute to the right to education as they: facilitate attendance, combat class-room hunger, enhance learning promote gender equity - keep girls in school They also have other benefits as they: foster social equity - in the case of India, combating caste discrimination and un- touchability provide employment - direct and indirect impart nutrition education and promote healthy eating habits offer opportunities to promote habits of personal hygiene promote good health Thus, publicly funded feeding can not only con- tribute to the right to food, but also to a num- ber of other goals that go beyond combating hunger. 11 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING From India\u2019s Pioneer State to National Scaling-up: Relevance for Asian Developing Countries T amil Nadu, the pioneer state.

But most states never went beyond supplying dry rations. Ju- dicial intervention has changed that, putting pressure on state governments to respond. The experience of India can provide useful pointers relevant to other developing countries, given that overall development, including income poverty reduction, may not automatically translate into a reduction of malnutrition. It could help countries refine their own goals and priorities and better assess resource needs of time, funds, technical knowledge and person- nel to achieve the aims they set for themselves in a shorter time. In Tamil Nadu (TN) near-universalised feed- ing for the nutritionally vulnerable population through visible, public funding has been in place well before judicial intervention. The State\u2019s effort is a unique combination of pressure from above and below resulting in a wide network of feeding centres in-between. In spite of a trend reduction in malnutrition observed in the State, it has nevertheless persisted, both, among the III 12 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING poor and the non-poor, even with the introduc- tion of the Programme, at levels high enough to continue with policy attention. While the State has a long history of providing food outside the home for young children and mothers, starting from 1956 and some even earlier, the early efforts at school feeding were sporadic and faced several operational dif- ficulties. It was not until 1982 that, for the first time, the hardest to reach group was included - preschoolers between 2-5 years. The State has never looked back. The original aim was to combat hunger, but over the years it has be- come integrated with addressing malnutrition. The political value of publicly visible feeding in a democratic set-up was not lost to decision makers - hunger was well understood as a po- tent tool for electoral victory. Over the years, nutrition concerns were also integrated with ad- dressing hunger so the full benefits of providing food could be reaped. Starting with a small, pilot nutrition scheme23, nutrition oriented schemes and hunger oriented feeding schemes, first op- erated in parallel, and were subsequently inte- grated as there was a convergence of interests between what was democratically attractive (visible, publicly funded feeding schemes) and what was technically recommended (multi-sec- toral nutrition schemes). Today, the nutrition- cum-child-development programme is so well entrenched in the State that it has become a de facto entitlement. Food has become an integral part of the school and pre-school routine - like a blackboard. Cen- tres function every day. An impressive physi- cal infrastructure is in place with buildings for most centres. Earmarked staff (a cook, a helper, an organizer) and equipment such as scales, utensils and mats are in place. Through the net- work of centres that operate at village level, in urban wards and schools, a daily noon meal is provided to preschool and school-age children with supplementary feeding to children below 24 months.

The Tamil Nadu (TN) case is interesting for a number of reasons. First, this state in southern India with a population of approximately 62 mil- lion, according to the 2001 Census, and a land area of 130,058 sq km (Government of Tamil Na- du26) is comparable in size to many developing countries of Asia. For example, in comparison, Nepal has a population of around 28 million and area of 140,800 sq km; Sri Lanka a population of 20 million and area of 65,610 sq km; Philip- pines a population of 88 million and an area of 300,000 sq km; and Bangladesh a population of 144 million in an area of 144,000 sq km27. Sec- ondly, Tamil Nadu is the first, and perhaps the only, state government in India to have officially proclaimed its aim of making the state malnutri- tion free (April 200228) by 2020 and to have in place a coherent policy for achieving this (No- vember 200329). Thirdly, the policy is backed by budgets through a combination of State fund- ing, Central allocations and World Bank support. Finally, it is also interesting because even after 14 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING World Bank funding was supposed to end under an experimental nutrition project, the Bank was reluctant to withdraw despite the State having demonstrated its ability to scale-up and go be- yond the Bank funded project in coverage - re- flecting a desire to continue being associated with an overall winner, despite the scheme\u2019s well recognized shortcomings. Three features of the TN case are noteworthy. First, there has been sustained political will from above resulting in public policy attention with budgetary allocations for combating hunger and malnutrition. It is perhaps the only case where hunger and malnutrition have entered the political discourse and remained there con- sistently for over four decades, fully backed by funding. This happened despite contrary advice from experts (too populist), the finance depart- ment (fiscal burden will be unsustainable), and bureaucrats (operations considered too massive and complex). Second, there has also been pres- sure from below with the feeding programmes becoming so popular and well received by the population, that it is difficult for centre\u2019s staff to let a facility remain closed for any length of time without local reaction and immediate enquiry. Third, while political will triggered off the pres- sure from below, pressure from beneficiaries, in turn, has contributed to the retention of political will over time regardless of the party in power. The interests of nutritionally vulnerable groups have coincided with prospects for democratic spoils in such a way that no party in power has reduced allocations to the Programme. As pub- lic funding of the statewide nutrition effort has come to stay, Tamil Nadu is on the verge of es- tablishing child rights to nutrition security. The Programme is not without its problems, of course, both in process and results. Both, the in- gredients and cooked food are attractive items for the poor and for programme staff, many of who are themselves not well off. Complaints of food diversion do surface through inflating at- tendance, feeding unregistered persons, inad- equate use of vegetables or pulses. However, pressure from above due to strong political will, combined with parental pressure from below due to expectations that have been strength- ened over the years, ensure not just built-in lim- its on diversion, but also quality and regularity, ensuring the relatively smooth functioning of the Programme. Then there are second genera- tion issues emerging due to changing food hab- its and emergence of newer nutrition problems among the poor, population relocation, remote location access, continuing staff motivation and training, and most importantly, the rather lim- ited participation of beneficiary households or local communities in design, implementation or management. Given that the State is commit- ting resources to counter nutritional depriva- tions, whether, in fact, malnutrition can be re- duced to such an extent that it is no longer a public health issue, would depend on how the State facilitates knowledge management on nutrition to complement more tangible direct nutrition inputs so that individuals and house- holds, as also other stakeholders, are enabled to make pro-nutrition choices.

The sever- est forms of malnutrition seem to have almost disappeared. At the same time, the percentage of normal children has gone up from under 20 to over 60. This is a significant achievement. The moderately malnourished (grade II) percentages have also declined from over 35 to under single digit numbers. The mildly malnourished (grade I) does not show any trend due to the likelihood of children from moderate and severe malnutri- tion categories climbing into grade I, while those from grade I joining the normal category. These are combined effects without segregating the effects of state investments in nutrition from the overall development effects. Other data sources also show relatively lower overall malnutrition and trend improvement in Tamil Nadu31. For example, table 3.2, which pres- ents comparable data from the NFHS surveys among the population as a whole, confirms this. Table 3.2 Change in IMR and nutritional status of children, India and Tamil Nadu, 1992-93, 1998-99 and 2005-06 Indicators India Tamil Nadu 1992-93 1998-99 2005-06 1992-93 1998-99 2005-06 IMR 79 68 57 68 48 31 Children under 3 stunted (%) n.a. 46 38 n.a. 29 25 Children under 3 un- derweight (%) 52 47 46 46 37 33 Source: IIPS, 2007 Tables 1.3 and 1.4 above show lower anemia percentages among children and adults in Tamil Nadu as compared with India as a whole. And in a situation of increasing anemia at the national level among women, the Tamil Nadu percent- ages actually declined. Scaling up to the national level. Given Tamil Na- du\u2019s experience as a background, it was a public interest litigation, which resulted in generating pressure from above at the national level. The Supreme Court Orders of November 28, 2001 directed all states to introduce cooked Mid- Day Meals (MDMs) in primary schools within six months. The result was that most states missed the deadline as they could not or did not com- ply. The sheer logistics, management and bud- gets were mind-boggling. Yet, this pressure from above contributed to a steady expansion of school lunches as most states, after some reluc- tance, complied - Rajasthan, Karnataka and even Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. No doubt this was a vic- tory of sorts, but it was soon clear that judicial 17 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING intervention needed to be supplemented with pressure from below to make it politically worth- while - linking MDMs to electoral prospects as in Tamil Nadu. Political will is critical for quality and sustainability of the Programme but has varied highly across states. So it has been necessary to generate wider pressure from below. This is hap- pening through a nation-wide \u2018Right-to-food Campaign\u2019 by an informal network of supporters committed to the right to food. Initial reversals and difficulties should not daunt protagonists in the battle against malnutrition. Even in Tamil Nadu, in the early years, experi- ences were not always good. For example, in 1974 the headmaster was tasked with manag- ing school meals with the help of teachers. This distracted from teaching. There were also high variations in quality from school to school.

The survey explored the implementation of the MDM scheme in some other states as well. In the state of Chhattisgarh, for example, cooking took place in soot covered classrooms, there were swarming pupils, utensils were inadequate, cooks struggled and got children to help. The teacher wished for school feeding to be stopped as it distracted children, turned the classroom filthy after food and meant that no teaching took place after lunch. The gap in this case was inad- equate political will combined with inadequate funding, infrastructure and management. In Rajasthan, the situation was found to be dif- ferent. Political will was in place, logistics were well managed and monitoring took place. But the meal was identical every day (ghoogri - boiled wheat & jaggery) and the infrastructure was poor. Upper caste children were found to bring food from home food, making social in- equalities explicit. The gap identified here was under funding. 18 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING Potential and Limitations T he potential of direct food interventions goes beyond the more commonly under- stood benefits of combating hunger, malnutri- tion and ill-health. Good nourishment can pro- mote the capacity to resist and recover from disease. It can improve earning capacity through improved productivity, reduced absenteeism and loss of work days. By reducing expenditure on curative services, it can save household and governments scare budgetary resources. Better nutrition can break the cycle of inter-generation- al transmission of malnutrition. Direct school feeding can promote education through a re- duction in class room hunger, better attendance, cognitive development, school readiness. It can promote gender equity to the extent that pro- viding food at schools makes it more likely for girls to remain in education. It can also promote women\u2019s employment when they become freer to work for remuneration rather than be limited by the unavoidable burden of unpaid domes- tic work such as providing mid-day meals. Uni- IV 19 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING versal feeding facilitates joint dining which can promote social equity, spread egalitarian values, and break barriers of caste and class. Appointing cooks from the lower castes can teach children and adults to overcome caste prejudices, which are very significant in caste-based societies like India, especially in rural areas. At the same time, the limitations also need to be recognized. The health-nutrition benefits are not automatic. Sharing of entitlements among non-target population like the rest of the fam- ily or even with farm animals, as happens with take-home dry rations, can reduce benefits. Sub- stitution through cutting back on home food re- duces the extent of the additionality. In respect of education benefits, expectations have to be realistic as there could be a mismatch between objective and instrument - food cannot substi- tute for teachers, text books or buildings. Edu- cation ministries are unlikely to use their limited budgets for food as food is an instrument, one of many, which addresses only one side of the equation - the demand for education. School teaching can actually get interrupted without separate provisions for staffing, etc. In respect of social equity, poor quality food can do more harm than good as inequality could be widened or revealed if children from relatively better off households prefer bringing food from home. Sharp targeting does the same and can lead to poorer children and Dalits being discriminated against. Then again, political will varies across the states. In spite of the long experience of a state in India, it needed judicial intervention for the scheme to be made universal. So far, only some states have taken the issue up seriously and are realizing the political mileage from vis- ible food provision.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ca152c1-8be1-4958-b733-364dde4ecfb6": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ca152c1-8be1-4958-b733-364dde4ecfb6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/targeted-interventions-against-hunger-case-preschool-and-school-feeding", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Targeted Interventions against Hunger: A Case for Preschool and School Feeding", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/targeted-interventions-against-hunger-case-preschool-and-school-feeding", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2bcf032ea229f67f1309e9967a29a8bbb6fa400c8348fc6b32bd53d515ae1ee6"}, "2": {"node_id": "5383c7cf-faa7-4582-8abd-f9492c377349", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/targeted-interventions-against-hunger-case-preschool-and-school-feeding", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "fe3aa0c802f028e650b355bf58f866312d94c4c8e04c843e1a88ba50d9ea493e"}}, "hash": "a3c362621b1d19bede4677711544906b34be0f6cbd7fe4c9fb85fcd4d1248972", "text": "Another set of issues arises because the concept of nutrition status is not widely understood the way huger is, even among the better off.

Thus, nutrition status is an outcome of a number of bio-medico-socio-economic pro- cesses interacting over time, and without ad- dressing the non-food factors simultaneously, effectiveness of direct food interventions would be limited. Nevertheless, the shift from a drug based ap- proach to a food based approach has been a big improvement. Countries now need to make the next shift - to a knowledge based approach, understanding nutrition to make pro-nutrition choices. A recognition of the non-food factors - like poor absorption at cellular level, poor sani- tation, personal hygiene and infections, drinking water quality, low birth weights, inadequate/ inaccurate knowledge, quick successive births and high parity, low weight gain in pregnancy, low heights and weights of adolescent girls, in- adequate understanding of female health and nutrition, geriatric health and nutrition - is just as important. As part of managing knowledge, a number of inaccurate beliefs also need to be countered e.g. soda cures gas; peas and daals are too \u2018heavy\u2019 for children depriving them of an important source of protein; sprouts are suitable mainly for the old; iron tablets in pregnancy will result in a dark child; papaya causes abortion; tea is good for health; bananas cause colds; and so on. Clearly, unlike drugs or food, nutrition status cannot be \u2018delivered\u2019. Good nutrition requires that people themselves actively participate, re- spond and take action based on correct infor- mation. In recent years, unfortunately, a new dimension has been added. Even in rural ar- eas and among the urban poor there is an in- creased consumption of fizzy drinks, processed and packaged foods loaded with preservatives, colours and artificial flavours that are relatively expensive. Together with undernutrition, we 20 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING are also simultaneously beginning to find rural obesity and other lifestyle related diseases as globalisation contributes to lifestyle changes. The poor seem to have started spending scarce household resources on relative expensive, but nutritionally poor, processed foods. Hence it is very important to make available nutrition edu- cation to complement other nutrition inputs. Even in Tamil Nadu, while we observe improve- ments among programme participants, other data indicate that the overall prevalence of mal- nutrition in the state continues to persist. As per data from the Third National Family Health Survey (2005-06), among children under age of 5 years, 30 per cent are underweight, 31 per cent are stunted and 22 per cent of newborns are categorized as low birth weight. New batches of underweight babies further contribute to the incidence of malnourishment, including among the next generation. Adding other correlates, in- cluding social and lifestyle related factors which are prevalent among both, the better off and the worse off, reasons for concern continue. While the existing malnourished are being addressed through a fairly efficient management of malnu- trition, a critical concern is how does one mini- mize new batches of the malnourished? These were the motivations for Tamil Nadu\u2019s state pol- icy on nutrition. 21 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING Costs and Financing H ow much do direct food investments cost? The main components are a combination of capital costs, recurring costs and provisions for maintenance. These have, of course, to be costed locally. The main components under each are: Capital : one time costs for infrastructure (buildings with kitchen and toilet, storage, and a water source) and equipment (utensils, containers, mats to sit on etc.) Recurring : ingredients (for a given scale of rations per head), transport, conversion costs (i.e. converting raw ingredients into cooked food covers condiments, fuel and staff), and administration Maintenance : repairs and periodic replace- ment to account for wear and tear In most cases, it is easier to secure funding for one time capital expenses.

In Tamil Nadu, this has amounted to a share of about 2 to 4 percent of total annual revenue expenditure. Financing of these expenditures in India been done jointly by the centre and state govern- ments. In states with stronger political commit- ments, once nutrition was an identified policy priority, resource flows have followed. Many of the existing ongoing development schemes have been used to fund parts of the costs. For example, to cover capital and replacement costs, the Employment Guarantee Scheme, rural works, urban development and slum improve- ment schemes were made eligible for NMP. Lo- cal contributions were also encouraged not only for resource supplementation but also for com- munity buy-in. Grains from the public distribu- tion system were used towards the cereals used for the mid-day meals. Donor financing is also an option. However, by and large for the present, the right to food is less accepted than education. There seems to be a willingness to support education, however. To that extent, rather than food per se, Food for Education (FFE) is considered to be a more ac- ceptable strategy. Without building a greater legitimacy for combating hunger, this more or less rules out donor financing for pre-school ages which are nutritionally more vulnerable. Even in the case of Tamil Nadu, the World Bank agreed to support other than food costs for pre- school ages - expecting families to bear that part, and recommending sharp targeting of supplements. This is a fairly strongly held position within most governments as well. Hunger is expected to be in the realm of the household. Hence, longer term interventions like income generation have been the preferred instruments to deal with hunger and malnutrition. But, based on the dis- cussion above, there is an argument for direct food investments as well, more so as decline in poverty has not resulted in corresponding nu- tritional improvements. Policies should not only aim to prevent future malnutrition, given the size of the problem, they should also tackle cur- rent hunger and malnutrition. Finally, while money is important, money alone is not enough. Complementary policies that include institutional changes, including har- nessing inter-ministerial synergies and capacity development are equally important to get the maximum benefit per dollar. 23 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING Overall Messages and Conclusion T he paper has four overall messages: First, direct nutrition intervention can contribute to the right to food with the potential to ad- dress critical development concerns - poverty, hunger-nutrition, health, education and social equity. Second, it must, however, be recognized that the benefits are not automatic - they de- pend upon the design and quality of implemen- tation. Third, poor design and implementation can actually do more harm than good. Fourth, one needs to have realistic expectations about effects as there are a number of \u2018other\u2019 contribu- tory factors, which need to be addressed simul- taneously. Hence, it is critical to combine admin- istrative capacities with technical inputs backed by adequate budgets. To operationalise steps towards the right to food, four specific recom- mendations emerge: Follow a two-pronged strategy in programme design prevention for those not yet malnourished management of malnutrition for those affected Customize inputs by socio-economic groups for efficiency in the use of resources knowledge for the better off to promote nutrition literacy subsidized inputs-cum-knowledge for the worse off 1 2 VI 24 TARGETED INTERVENTIONS AGAINST HUNGER : A CASE FOR PRESCHOOL AND SCHOOL FEEDING Simplify targeting to cover the worse off focus on state funded institutions (e.g., school and pre-school) and universalize make separate provisions for those out of schools cover disadvantaged locations through area-based targeting Minimise leakages design publicly visible feeding use pressure from below to facilitate social monitoring and audits encourage community participation 3 4 In conclusion, we need to ask the fundamental question - should we really let people face hun- ger and malnutrition arguing for fiscal prudence when we have the technology and resources?

November 2009 6 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Preface The Millennium Declaration from the Millennium Summit in 2000 emphasizes the centrality of democratic governance for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). World leaders agreed that improving the quality of democratic institutions and processes, and managing the changing roles of the state and civil society in an increasingly globalized world, should underpin national efforts to reduce poverty, sustain the environment, and promote human development. The Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund (DGTTF) was created in 2001 to enable UNDP Country Offices to explore innovative and catalytic approaches to supporting democratic governance on the ground. The DGTTF Lessons Learned Series represents a collective effort to capture lessons learned and best practices in a systematic manner, to be shared with all stakeholders, to serve as an input to organizational learning, and to inform future UNDP policy and programming processes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4e4fd77-66e6-4aac-8248-49a2c88e70b9": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4e4fd77-66e6-4aac-8248-49a2c88e70b9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ede9081d25d3a3a8ebc6ae05842fe636208de4018f4376b5d09d65db3c224188"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1ea0c8b-9386-41c8-9bbd-486aa1ddd6bf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4150f3c0bc2518da71d89e14760fe26e087501362769b2775e45f455dd83a3e1"}}, "hash": "d29cc2d0d7f582962f913d32dadfddaa31b7f8c5b678ca15725e4869b13e751f", "text": "7 This report presents the findings of an assessment of two projects supported by DGTTF: Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People, and Legal Empowerment Through Community Radio. The assessment examined project process and results for elements to enrich regional programming and policy options and strengthen knowledge management. The initiatives were assessed in terms of their effectiveness, the political economy in which they were located and their sustainability. The first project, Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People, aimed to build up a research base on pro-poor justice at the National Judicial Academy (NJA), provide a platform for judiciary and civil society to engage in an ongoing dialogue on access to justice by marginalized people, initiate a process of networking among civil society actors on access to justice, develop a strategy to overcome barriers to access justice, and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2d90a67d-1bc1-4342-b75e-705377803f59": {"__data__": {"id_": "2d90a67d-1bc1-4342-b75e-705377803f59", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "26431ef20cc12f1a30c275c14759c57f992aa7d75ba1f7515df0be089afd2dd1"}}, "hash": "26431ef20cc12f1a30c275c14759c57f992aa7d75ba1f7515df0be089afd2dd1", "text": "help the NJA draw up a curriculum for judicial training that is more sensitive to poor and marginalized people. The project produced six reports, each examining pendency of cases (by district), delays at different stages of procedure, the participation of the elderly, the disabled, tribal peoples, women and children, and the literacy status of each group. Though these elements are not uniformly covered across the six reports, they provide good indicators for addressing chronic problems in access to justice. The project served as an exercise in cultivating an analytical appreciation of research findings among judicial officers. It provided an insider\u2019s perspective of the barriers to justice, and strengthened collaboration among the judiciary, academics, NGOs and lawyers. At the same time, it has helped to catalyze change in the attitude of judicial institutions towards the poor and the disadvantaged. The project is also timely, coming amidst a slew of legal and judicial reforms designed to streamline the system to more effectively open the Indian economy to the world. Reform of laws, judicial processes and practices have attempted to shore up credibility in the system, especially in reducing delay and backlog. Perhaps as a reflection of these overarching imperatives driving reform, the project shifted focus somewhat from the issues of the poor and disadvantaged to the specific objective of reducing delays. The judiciary has been so overwhelmed with the problems of delay, the case backlog and low rate of disposal that these problems overshadowed the focus on the poor and the disadvantaged. Yet what has been reported is not irrelevant to questions of access to justice, as the perceptions and priorities of the judicial officers are instructive in identifying and overcoming barriers to justice for the poor and disadvantaged. The implementation process revealed the importance of preliminary training, and of ensuring that the research methodology approached the problem in a comprehensive manner. In this case, those who did not reach the courts did not feature in the study, since the researchers worked only with data from court registries. Identifying the constituency clearly was also essential. The study suggests that addressing the concerns of the judiciary will improve system accessibility and responsiveness to the poor and the disadvantaged. The second project, Legal Empowerment Through Community Radio, explored the potential of community radio \u2013 a relatively recent development in India \u2013 to empower communities with information and awareness of their legal rights, enabling them to engage directly with legal professionals to pursue their interests. It employed a variety of techniques to present, discuss and resolve issues. The project was implemented in the Kutch and Dang regions of Gujarat and in four districts of Karnataka over the course of a year. The main expected outcome was increased awareness of legal matters among otherwise marginalized communities. The potential impact of community radio was well explored. The issues raised in the broadcasts provide valuable insight into community priorities. The project heightened awareness of rights and helped reduce tolerance of injustice. The project demonstrated the expansive role that community radio can play in deepening democracy. Plays, songs, poems, Executive summary 8 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative discussions and talks employing the local dialect and metaphor were all used to explore matters of law. The projects brought together community activists, the media, lawyers, local artists and local leaders. A cadre of paralegals was also assembled and trained specifically to work on the project, enhancing local capacities. Networks were created to respond to the particular needs of each broadcast. This gave lawyers involved a sense of the kinds of legal issues that might not in the ordinary course reach them or the courts, while also adding a rare creative dimension to their role. The project has attracted other donors, including the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Swiss Cooperation for Development in Gujarat. UNESCO is currently funding new facilities for community broadcasting in cooperation with community- based organization MYRADA. Although the project ran for a year, the number of broadcasts exceeded original targets. Many participants are now preparing to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the opening up of airwaves under the new Policy on Community Radio of the Government of India. The one-year period was too short to accurately gauge impact. Certain elements of the project, such as the recourse to legal aid and advice, and a shift in local-level power dynamics in matters of domestic violence and land acquisition, offered the potential for longer-term dividends that could not be measured in such a brief period. It was widely suggested that a project of this catalytic potential, if in the first instance planned for one year, be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e8c1d638-a8cf-4847-8422-dad183a24516": {"__data__": {"id_": "e8c1d638-a8cf-4847-8422-dad183a24516", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ebe786efadb49bbdab93fe6e8ac54237c58ced57bfaed784363f11aca8553a56"}}, "hash": "ebe786efadb49bbdab93fe6e8ac54237c58ced57bfaed784363f11aca8553a56", "text": "reviewed as the period draws to a close. If it is found to be worth pursuing, funding may then be continued for another year, or possibly two under the DGTTF, or be linked directly to UNDP programming. Apart from insulating a worthwhile project from collapse, this would also prevent frustration of heightened expectations. The project targeted marginalized communities whose concerns are rarely aired in mainstream media, and whom legal reforms and rights discourses do not easily reach. Their interaction with formal law and formal justice systems is minimal, constrained by entrenched power and patriarchal structures. This made the awakening into legal awareness and empowerment with the help of lawyers, counsellors and paralegals all the more significant. On the whole, this experimental project has been a success worthy of replication and, importantly, of continuing support, with a possible view to incorporation into the UNDP agenda. 9 This report presents the findings of an assessment of two projects supported by DGTTF: Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People, and Legal Empowerment Through Community Radio. The assessment \u2013 conducted between April and May 2009 - examined project process and results for elements to enrich regional programming and policy options and strengthen knowledge management. The initiatives were assessed in terms of their effectiveness, the political economy in which they were located and their sustainability. Ensuring access to justice is a prerequisite to reducing poverty and fostering human development. The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative motivated UNDP India to gain an understanding of the transformative potential of HRBA applied to A2J programming, to make a serious appraisal of A2J issues in India, and to explore possibilities for UNDP support in the area. This happened through the involvement of programme staff in the preparation of the Programming Guide, and workshops organized in that phase. The September 2005 launch of the Programming Guide was another significant milestone. The participation of Mr R.K. Bhargava, Additional Secretary of the Department of Justice, at the launch workshop secured his support for the HRBA for A2J within the government of India, at a senior level. The next step was to share perspectives on HRBA and A2J with other important policy makers at a conference organized by the Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association, supported by UNDP India. This helped to get Supreme Court judges, especially those on the board of the National Judicial Academy, Bhopal, to take an interest in UNDP support for A2J, and convince the Government of India to consent to the use of TRAC resources in an area that had been hitherto considered not appropriate for UNDP. The project Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People aimed to build up a research base on pro-poor justice at the National Judicial Academy (NJA), provide a platform for key stakeholders from judiciary and civil society to engage in an ongoing dialogue on access to justice by marginalized people, initiate a process of networking among civil society actors on access to justice, develop a strategy to overcome barriers to access justice, and help the NJA draw up a curriculum for judicial training that is more sensitive to poor and marginalized people. The second project, Legal Empowerment Through Community Radio, explored the potential of community radio \u2013 a relatively recent development in India \u2013 to empower communities with information and awareness of their legal rights, enabling them to engage directly with legal professionals to pursue their interests. Introduction to the assessment report 10 Introduction There is a commonly perceived gulf between poor and disadvantaged people and the formal justice system. Not only is there scant documentation of the kinds of problems specifically experienced by the poor and disadvantaged, but the small percentage of poor and disadvantaged people who bring their grievances to court also indicates that expanding access to the justice system should be made a priority. Costs of legal representation, weak institutional infrastructure, failure to implement laws and inherent biases in the justice sector have been identified as deterrents for the poor and disadvantaged. Access to court is further hindered by mounting case backlog, inordinate delays, excessive costs and uncertainties of litigation, and increasing insensitivity on the part of lawyers, judges and court staff to the problems of the poor. Against this backdrop, the NJA at Bhopal partnered with UNDP and the Department of Justice in executing this project, which aimed to identify barriers to justice from the perspective of poor and disadvantaged people. Expected project outcomes were as follows: a A set of reliable data on disadvantaged people\u2019s access to justice through formal courts, to be used in policy development and corrective action. a Enhanced capacity", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5fda4a5e-a7c5-4168-92e5-ff111703c7bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "5fda4a5e-a7c5-4168-92e5-ff111703c7bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b1cec00202705e530dc3dfdf870984aa5a117bba468a7f47afc452268ab1bfdd"}}, "hash": "b1cec00202705e530dc3dfdf870984aa5a117bba468a7f47afc452268ab1bfdd", "text": "of NJA and state judicial academies to research and document pro-poor justice. a Identification of barriers to accessing justice by poor and marginalized people through consultations and dialogue among the judiciary at various levels, government actors such as the Ministry of Justice, and civil society. a Initiation of a network around access to justice among civil society actors, courts, NJA, state judicial academies and law schools. a Prominent reflection of pro-poor concerns in the judicial training curriculum at various levels, and a set of training materials. The project was expected to build on the close relationship between UNDP and the Government of India to initiate a change process from within the judicial system. Background The NJA hosted three residential workshops of two to three days\u2019 duration to conceptualize the problem and determine the research method and questions to be addressed. The initial focus was on inducting the State Judicial Academies (SJAs) into the work, by fostering a research culture in the SJAs, and enhancing self-critiquing capacity within the judicial system. Seven states were initially involved in the research: Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa and West Bengal. Orissa dropped out, but the other six states completed the exercise. As the project proceeded, the High Courts, the SJAs and academic institutions (except in Karnataka), lawyers (in Jharkhand) and NGOs contributed at different stages. The workshops identified five target groups: women, children, the elderly, disabled persons and tribal peoples. The project was managed through a four-tier structure consisting of a Project Steering Committee, a Project Management Board, a Project Implementation Agency and a State Level Project Monitoring Committee, the last located in each participating state. The State Level Project Monitoring Committee determined how data would be gathered, processed and reported. High Court judges and the subordinate judiciary were instrumental in collecting cases from court registries. In addition to the three NJA workshops described above, activities included case collection, state-level progress meetings, data collation and reporting. Assessment of Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People 11 India Country Assessment Effectiveness The project produced six reports, each examining pendency of cases (by district), delays at different stages of procedure, the participation of the elderly, the disabled, tribal peoples, women and children, and the literacy status of each group. Though these elements are not uniformly covered across the six reports, they provide good indicators for addressing chronic problems in access to justice. The project also served as an exercise in cultivating an analytical appreciation of research findings among judicial officers. Judges of the higher rungs of the judiciary have increasingly been involved in fashioning policy, and introducing the element of research to supplement their experience was both useful and necessary. This element of promoting rigorous research among the judiciary proved mutually rewarding to the project and its participants. It provided an insider\u2019s perspective of the barriers to justice, and strengthened collaboration among the judiciary, academics, NGOs and lawyers. Equally important was the enhanced self-reflexive capacity of the judicial establishment. It is worth noting that the NJA has since incorporated law and poverty into its curriculum, in response to the concerns and the gaps raised in the reports. At the same time, the reports focus on those who reach the courts, leaving out those who do not and who may, in fact, be the most excluded and marginalized. The project was innovative in that it addressed a critical democratic issue. The research led to an uncommon degree of interaction among multiple groups. This sharing of access, technical resources, skills and perspectives augurs well for future collaboration and exchange. There were certain advantages to engaging the judiciary to conduct and coordinate the research: a Relatively easy access to case records. Although judicial records are public documents, they have as a rule been closed to public, and academic, scrutiny except under specially granted permissions. This has, it may be more than hypothesized, resulted in stifling research related to the workings of the court. Recent years have seen the beginnings of a practice where court statistics are placed online for public scrutiny. Case records, however, are still not easy to access. a The involvement of subordinate judiciary personnel. This brought the judges face to face with the problems and possibilities of the system in which they play a part. a First-hand knowledge of the judicial process and its bottlenecks. a Continuing engagement, beyond the project, with the NJA. The downsides included: a Limiting the project focus to cases already in court. This meant that those who had not been able to reach the courts were not within the scope of the research. a The prominent", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d110f5f9-7778-4ac5-ac7d-31bcbb0281af": {"__data__": {"id_": "d110f5f9-7778-4ac5-ac7d-31bcbb0281af", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "a3951591533e12d1883bf33d7118a8bd7df4a707034ff48eab3f8c2d2961c33c"}}, "hash": "a3951591533e12d1883bf33d7118a8bd7df4a707034ff48eab3f8c2d2961c33c", "text": "focus on the problems of the system as opposed to the barriers specifically facing the poor and disadvantaged. For instance, because delay was identified as a problem, the bottleneck stages became the object of analysis. This tended to shift the focus from the poor and disadvantaged to the general ills of the system. In the case of one report, a questionnaire asked only questions that pertained to delay. Another report concluded that \u2018project results are not suggestive of any systemic bias against the litigants from the disadvantaged categories, as the research does not reveal any special barrier for disadvantaged sections alone\u2019. Yet the report goes on to acknowledge that the disadvantaged have greater difficulty coping with the effects of those systemic ills. a The recommendations and suggestions reflect techniques and technology currently being tested and are not based on empirically rigorous data. As stated above, the study was hampered by restricting its focus to cases already in court and by the pre-determined conclusion that delay is the underlying problem. Yet it is of consequence that judges perceive that dealing with delay, and reducing pressure on performance by reducing backlog, would make the system more responsive to the inequity facing poor and disadvantaged people. 12 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Other notable issues raised were as follows: a The need for legal reform was raised in some reports. Though not explored here because of the focus on cases in the system, this line of study appears to be worth pursuing. a Reports from Maharashtra and West Bengal identified language as a barrier for the poor and disadvantaged and recommended the use of local languages in court proceedings. Other key issues warranting further examination include: a Corruption, which is part of the unaccounted cost generated by the current system, and which the legal aid system cannot legitimately take into account. a Indebtedness occasioned by the case, including raising monies to pay legal fees, as well as the hidden cost of lost wages and other expenses of attending court. (One court found that, despite a formal stipulation that witness travel costs be paid, in not even one of the 600 cases studied had it actually been paid). a Lawyers, who have regrettably come to be perceived as a barrier to justice. a Legal aid. The potential for using these reports in directing policy needs to be thoroughly debated. Despite the flaws in the research method and the limited value of the conclusions, the process has perceptibly increased participants\u2019 awareness of the barriers to justice that need to be urgently addressed. Sustainability The judiciary traditionally operates in isolation, with lawyers acting as interlocutors across the bench, and little interaction with NGOs, academics or others with an interest in both the institution and its constituency, especially the poor and disadvantaged. This project has exposed those in the judiciary who were involved in the research to the skills and concerns of other professionals. The heightened mutual respect and understanding that developed in the process is likely to have a lasting effect. The reports demonstrated a need to develop and hone socio- legal research skills. The Director of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai agreed to host a workshop on legal research later in 2009 in an attempt to fill this gap, and to invite the participation of judges, academics and NGOs. The six reports themselves constitute an important document of the judicial system\u2019s introspection. Coordinators of the project in the two states visited as part of this assessment (Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra) reported that they had used the report to launch a meeting of professionals on judicial reforms. Over the three- to four-year course of the project, considerations of poverty, gender and constitutional values became more prominent at the NJA itself, even as the reports were being written. The project itself is located amidst a slew of changes to the law (e.g., amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure and Criminal Procedure) and to judicial procedure (e.g., fast-track courts, camp courts in jails, and the extended use of lok adalats). While the reports do not go very far in investigating the problems that the poor and disadvantaged have in accessing justice, and while those in extreme poverty and those who do not reach the courts are left out altogether, they do provide a view of what the judiciary sees as the barriers it faces in facilitating justice.

Located in the NJA, and involving the High Courts and SJAs, this is not merely a discrete, stand-alone study, but part of a coherent programme. Involving the Department of Justice in the project put access to justice on the executive map. Identifying the importance of access to justice at a time when so much was changing in the justice landscape provided a needed push. Courts and parliament have been working to address the ills of the judicial system, and this study was timed well both to contribute to the changes being proposed, and to assimilate them in their reading of the situation for the poor and the disadvantaged. The objective of this project was to build up a research base on pro-poor justice at the NJA, provide a platform for key stakeholders from judiciary and civil society to engage in an ongoing dialogue on access to justice by marginalized people, initiate a process of networking among civil society actors on access to justice, develop a strategy to overcome barriers to access justice, and help the NJA draw up a 13 India Country Assessment curriculum for judicial training that is more sensitive to poor and marginalized people. In the process of executing the project, channels of communication were opened between the judiciary and NGOs (such as those working with the disabled and on the issue of HIV/AIDS) and law schools and academics. Within the judicial system, collaborations among High Courts, the district judiciary and SJA were especially helpful in breaching the hierarchy and critiquing the system. As has been stated, the judiciary has been so overwhelmed with the problems of delay, the case backlog and low rate of disposal (with many cases being \u2018compromised\u2019 rather than awaiting judicial decision) that these problems overshadowed the focus on the poor and the disadvantaged. Yet what has been reported is not irrelevant to questions of access to justice, as the perceptions and priorities of the judicial officers are instructive in identifying and overcoming barriers to justice for the poor and disadvantaged. Efficiency Work on the project extended from December 2004 till 2008 when the last report was submitted. Since the judicial officers involved had to work on the project in addition to their regular judicial work, this length of time is not extraordinary. Project efficiency benefited from the early involvement of academics and lawyers in determining how the research should proceed, and in incorporating work done by NGOs. This approach avoided duplication of effort while validating the work of the NGOs. The difficulty in accessing court records was largely overcome by using the hierarchy of courts and judges to collect case records from the registries, with one exception where academics collected case records relating to maintenance cases. It will be important to work around the inaccessibility of court records in undertaking further research on the court system. Political economy Endemic delay, a severe case backlog, escalating costs, and uncertainties of outcome have long plagued the judicial system. The past fifteen years have seen these problems further exacerbated by the demands of a rapidly expanding economy. During that time, legal and judicial reforms have prioritized streamlining the system to more effectively open the Indian economy to the world. Reforms of laws, judicial process and judicial practice have attempted to shore up credibility in the system, especially in reducing delay and backlog. Tribunals, lok adalats, plea bargaining, fast-track courts and amended procedures are examples of these efforts. These experiments are still in their early stages, and their impact on the poor and the disadvantaged has not yet been tested. In this context, it is left to the NJA, the constitutional courts, NGOs and law universities to ensure that the poor and disadvantaged do not get left behind. The focus of this project brought has been a necessary counterweight to the priorities being pursued on a national scale. Codification of lessons learned, tools and instruments used The issue of access to justice was of demonstrable significance when the project was launched. The studies reinforce this. The process revealed the importance of preliminary training, and of ensuring that the research methodology approached the problem in a comprehensive manner. In this case, those who did not reach the courts did not feature in the study, since the researchers worked only with data from court registries. Identifying the constituency clearly was also essential. The project addressed a critical issue of democracy and inclusiveness.

The study suggests that addressing the concerns of the judiciary will improve system accessibility and responsiveness to the poor and the disadvantaged. The usually difficult process of accessing court registries and case filings was made simpler by involving judicial officers, directed by High Court judges. This points to a need to simplify access to case records and to broaden awareness of judicial records as public documents. Further resources and effort are needed to make the legal and judicial system better and more accessible instruments of social justice. The sharing of knowledge and expansion of collaborative networks that this implies is consistent with DGTTF principles. 14 Introduction This experimental project used community radio, with a broadcast range of 10-20 kms, to address issues and disseminate information about rights and laws to target communities. It employed a variety of techniques to present, discuss and resolve issues. The project was implemented in the Kutch and Dang regions of Gujarat and in four districts of Karnataka. It was executed under the aegis of the Centre for Social Justice supported in Gujarat by KMVS Media Cell and the Drishti Media Collective, and in Karnataka by MYRADA and VOICES. MARG, an NGO based in Delhi with a strong base in legal literacy, was appointed the monitoring and evaluation agency to work with the Gujarat and Kutch groups. The project ran for one year. The main expected outcome was increased awareness of legal matters among otherwise marginalized communities. Background The Gujarat experiment primarily used the broadcast medium, while in Karnataka both broadcast and narrowcast, with cassettes and loudspeakers, were effectively deployed. The undulating terrain limited the range in Karnataka, which prompted the adoption of mixed media. Pre-broadcast activities included: a Holding community meetings to identify legal issues to be addressed in the broadcast; a Contacting lawyers to provide counsel on the issues raised; a Preparing a programme for broadcast; a Recording the programme; and a Arranging airtime. After the broadcast of the initial episodes, a telephone line was set up with a lawyer at the other end who could address questions arising in the course of the broadcast. Narrowcast had the advantage of immediate community feedback. In Gujarat, Kutch and Karnataka, the pre-existing relationships of the media collectives with the beneficiary communities made it easier to identify issues and elicit feedback. In the Dang area, the radio broadcast helped foster a relationship with the community. Effectiveness The potential impact of community radio was well explored in these projects. It was innovative, demonstrating the expansive role that community radio can play in deepening democracy. The projects brought together community activists, the media, lawyers, local artists and local leaders. A cadre of paralegals was also assembled and trained specifically to work on the project, enhancing local capacities. Networks were created to respond to the particular needs of each broadcast. This gave lawyers involved a sense of the kinds of legal issues that might not, in the ordinary course, reach them or the courts. Plays, songs, poems, discussions and talks employing the local dialect and metaphor were all used to explore matters of law. The project heightened awareness of rights and helped reduce tolerance of injustice. Wife-beating, for instance, which was endemic in many of the districts, began to be questioned, with resistance to beatings emerging as a possible response. Questions concerning land, property and succession were frequent. In addition to such everyday matters, the project introduced such topics as the right to information, female foeticide and the devadasi law. In Karnataka, a MYRADA campaign on universal birth registration was included in the broadcast. Land rights, police power, rights of tribal peoples in relation to the Revenue Officer, entitlements under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, and the right to food in the context of anti-corruption were among the subjects of broadcast in the Dang region. In Kutch, broadcasts covered such topics as the boat registration process, the illegal encroachment on land by a company, and the destruction of Assessment of Legal Empowerment Through Community Radio 15 India Country Assessment mangroves and parliamentary site review in preparation for a Special Economic Zone. The empowering effect was also seen in the confidence and awareness of the women encountered during the site visits. It was hard to imagine that they had not so long ago been the meek and submissive victims of violence. Awareness of the law, the notion that violence, oppression and injustice should not be borne with patient suffering and the recommendation to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aa033d41-094b-47db-83b1-4b408cc50b0b": {"__data__": {"id_": "aa033d41-094b-47db-83b1-4b408cc50b0b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "854b030d9b9d7237e5bc517f072699e0d70dc44f1450ff8d8fc25e1a554adef5"}}, "hash": "854b030d9b9d7237e5bc517f072699e0d70dc44f1450ff8d8fc25e1a554adef5", "text": "seek recourse to the wider community beyond the individual or family involved had emboldened listeners, especially women. The project has had a catalytic effect. It has attracted other donors, including the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust and the Swiss Cooperation for Development in Gujarat. UNESCO is currently funding new facilities for community broadcasting in cooperation with MYRADA. Although the project ran for a year, the number of broadcasts exceeded original targets. Many participants are now preparing to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the opening up of airwaves under the new Policy on Community Radio of the Government of India, introduced in December 2006. Alliances have strengthened between the lawyers and civil society groups involved in the project. For lawyers, the project provided a rare creative and proactive role. The tendency of mainstream media to ignore, or fail to accommodate, local concerns has given community radio special relevance. Broadcasts in the local dialect, about matters directly relevant to listeners\u2019 lives, have been highly appreciated. However, as one participating lawyer observed, empowerment does not end with the sharing of information: heightened awareness of rights must be accompanied by effective enforcement of those rights. Although some 34 people were trained in Karnataka as paralegals over the course of the project, one year was too short a time to equip them adequately and to integrate them into the existing legal community. Sustainability Both CSJ and MYRADA have struggled to invest their limited resources to sustain the changes generated by the project. In addition to broadcasting more modules than were budgeted and using narrowcasting in some areas, there were rigorous efforts to obtain detailed feedback. Participating organizations have begun to position themselves to seize opportunities created by the 2006 Policy on Community Radio. In Karnataka, UNESCO has contributed significantly towards building and equipping a broadcasting studio. Development of content and of a network of lawyers requires ongoing support. However, networks established during the project period have survived to a remarkable extent. The one-year period was too short to accurately gauge impact. Certain elements of the project, such as the recourse to legal aid and advice, and a shift in local-level power dynamics in matters of domestic violence and land acquisition, offered the potential for longer-term dividends that could not be measured in such a brief period. It was widely suggested that a project of this catalytic potential, if in the first instance planned for one year, be reviewed as the period draws to a close. If it is found to be worth pursuing, funding may then be continued for another year, or possibly two under the DGTTF, or be linked directly to UNDP programming. Apart from insulating a worthwhile project from collapse, this would also prevent frustration of heightened expectations. Relevance and strategic positioning Legal empowerment is now widely recognized as essential to curbing injustice and violence. Campaigns to improve legal literacy and support for vulnerable persons are currently underway. UNDP, with its focus on the poorest and most vulnerable, was well placed to explore the potential role of community radio in legal empowerment. The intervention also proved timely, as the government was putting in place a policy that would open up the airwaves to community radio. DGTTF support helped introduce legal empowerment into the nascent community radio presence. The software required to make community radio a tool for legal empowerment calls for specific skills, which this project prompted participants to seek and develop. As previously noted, a project of such promise would be well served by a more stable flow of resources, possibly through links to other programmes within UNDP. Efficiency There were impressive collaborations among those with technical knowledge of the medium, those with access to the community, and those providing project software. Participants managed to strike the right balance between information sought by the listeners themselves for use in their immediate 16 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative lives, and information that needed to be imparted to them as an exercise in legal awareness and empowerment. While the project was too short in duration, its immediacy seems to have spawned relationships that have survived the project. The project included a monitoring and evaluation component. A Delhi-based NGO specializing in legal literacy was tasked with monitoring and evaluating the project even as it was being implemented in Gujarat and Karnataka, and with coordinating communication materials and lessons learnt. This does not seem to have worked well. In addition to the physical distance between the NGO and the project locations, the collaboration suffered from the short duration and from a lack of patience and flexibility during implementation.

There was also a certain resentment that the monitoring and evaluation budget almost equalled the implementation budget, and that the agency had been mandated to act as an overseer. In future, these relationships and responsibilities need to be carefully managed. Political economy The project targeted marginalized communities whose concerns are rarely aired in mainstream media, and whom legal reforms and rights discourses do not easily reach. Their interaction with formal law and formal justice systems is minimal, constrained by entrenched power and patriarchal structures. This made the awakening into legal awareness and empowerment with the help of lawyers, counsellors and paralegals all the more significant. A pre-existing relationship with the community helps in gathering an audience, but the project shows that that may come at a price. In the Karnataka experience, it was noticed that there were very few modules that could be seen to challenge the power structures. Bonded labour, which is known to exist, was not included in any module. It turned out, however, that a bonded labourer had, in fact, approached the media collective with a complaint that a loan of INR 5000 taken years ago had left him and his family bonded to a landlord. The landlord had the papers to his land, and although the labourer had spent years working off his debt, the landlord was still claiming that he remained in debt. The complaint was converted into a case and sent to the High Court in Bangalore. Some time later, workers from the media collective were accosted on the road and threatened \u2013 threats that they were able to sidestep only because of a long presence in the village. This experience eroded their confidence in taking any further risks. By contrast, in Kutch a radio programme inflamed tensions around the passive acceptance of displacement. Public reaction did not seem to have dampened the fervour of subsequent broadcasts. The variety in these experiences could be further studied to explore ways to reduce risks to safety while broadcasting without compromising the underlying objectives of empowering people and raising awareness. Codification of lessons learned, tools and instruments used This project explored the potential value of community radio, a relatively new and innovative medium in the Indian context, in spreading awareness about rights and entitlements, particularly in rural communities lacking other means of receiving information related to their specific needs. The project effectively demonstrated the potential significance of community radio in broadening legal empowerment and deepening democracy. It provided an opportunity to bring lawyers to the field, and gave them new relevance among typically marginalized groups. Paralegals were trained as a necessary aspect of the project, with the potential to influence community perceptions of rights and grievances. Ancillary activities \u2013 discussions on programme content, phone-ins with lawyers, legal aid \u2013 were not adequately anticipated in the budget, but had to be delivered to meet project objectives. The issues raised in the broadcasts provide valuable insight into community priorities. Too brief a programme could compromise long-term impact. In the future, a review process near the end of the DGTTF project could assess whether follow-up funding is needed, and resources may then either be provided by DGTTF itself or derive from links with other UNDP programmes. Flexibility in the media mix (i.e., narrowcasting as well as broadcasting) was a distinct virtue. If UNDP were to adopt a broad definition of community radio, encompassing all radio programmes that reach all rural communities without easy access to the media, it could engage partners beyond educational institutions or managed communities. 17 India Country Assessment The potential for involving law schools in developing the content of the programmes warrants further exploration. The practice of enlisting radio professionals to advise institutions wishing to take advantage of the new policy on community radio to improve access to justice has proven to be effective, and should be expanded. On the whole, this experimental project has been a success worthy of replication and, importantly, of continuing support, with a possible view to incorporation into the UNDP agenda. 18 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Annex I \u2013 Documents produced Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People in the State of Madhya Pradesh Access to Justice by Poor and Disadvantaged People: Jharkhand Project Report (Final Draft) Access to Justice by the Poor and the Disadvantaged People: Disa Karnataka Project Report Access to Justice by the Poor and the Disadvantaged People: Maharashtra Study Report Access to Justice by the Poor and the Disadvantaged People: Project Report A Study of Family Courts: Karnataka (monograph) A Study of Family", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b86217b3-e230-4b85-9aee-a263500e6d35": {"__data__": {"id_": "b86217b3-e230-4b85-9aee-a263500e6d35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: India Country Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-india-country-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f01b387e70dc86373205351ae2a3a6475a4dc426f5b96c3aecdfdb8ff223eee8"}}, "hash": "f01b387e70dc86373205351ae2a3a6475a4dc426f5b96c3aecdfdb8ff223eee8", "text": "Courts in West Bengal (monograph) 19 India Country Assessment Annex II \u2013 List of persons interviewed Flavia Agnes, Advocate, Bombay High Court Asha Bajpai, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai Balakrishna, MYRADA in Kamasamudram Project, Kolar, Karnataka Pukhraj Bora, District Judge, Pune, Maharashtra Nimmi Chauhan, Drishti, Gujarat Mihir Desai, Advocate, Bombay High Court Ranjana Desai, Judge, Bombay High Court Mohan Gopal, Director, National Judicial Academy, Bhopal Kanikaparameshwari, Advocate, Kolar, Karnataka Shiv Kumar, Advocate, Benguluru Rohan Mallick, MYRADA of Kamasamudram Project, Kolar, Karnataka Yasmin Master, formerly of MYRADA, Benguluru Mehul, formerly of Drishti, Gujarat Madhava Menon, former Director, National Judicial Academy, Bhopal Nupur, Executive Director, CSJ, Gujarat Parasuraman, Director, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai Damini Patel, CSJ Archana Ramachandran, MYRADA, Bangalore Rohan, Reporter-cum-Coordinator, Radio Unit, CSJ, Gujarat Ashish Sen, formerly of VOICES, Benguluru Gagan Sethi, CSJ, Gujarat 20 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative Annex III \u2013 References Centre for Social Justice, Kutch Mahila Vikas Sanghatan and Drishti, Raan Rede (Radio of the Jungle), Reliving the Experience of Community Radio Program in the District of Dang, Gujarat (monograph) MARG, Legal Empowerment through Community Radio: A Report, 2008.

World leaders agreed that improving the quality of democratic institutions and processes, and managing the changing roles of the state and civil society in an increasingly globalized world, should underpin national efforts to reduce poverty, sustain the environment, and promote human development. The Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund (DGTTF) was created in 2001 to enable UNDP country offices to explore innovative and catalytic approaches to supporting democratic governance on the ground. The DGTTF Lessons Learned Series represents a collective effort to capture lessons learned and best practices in a systematic manner, to be shared with all stakeholders, to serve as an input to organizational learning, and to inform future UNDP policy and programming processes. 8 This report presents the assessment findings of the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative (AP-A2J), funded by UNDP Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund (DGTTF) and launched in August 2002 to codify the links between access to justice (A2J) and human rights, and to help define the UNDP niche in this field. DGTTF was created in 2001 to promote a thematic focus around UNDP\u2019s Democratic Governance Practice (DGP). Its main function is to provide country offices with discretionary funds to explore innovative approaches and address issues in politically sensitive areas where the use of core funds may prove more problematic and slow. DGTTF was designed to allow rapid disbursement and to attract funding from donors interested in democratic governance. This assessment seeks to identify the impact of the DGTTF funding at the regional level through the AP-A2J initiative. AP-A2J was one of the first regional communities of practice founded by the UNDP. The initiative falls under the Democratic Governance practice area in UNDP and under the sub-thematic service line of justice and human rights. At its inception in 2002, AP-A2J was supported by the UNDP/ OHCHR HURIST programme and the DGTTF. It was initially facilitated by UNDP Sub-Regional Resource Facilities in Bangkok and Kathmandu, but is currently supported largely by the UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok. The Initiative started as an attempt to strengthen UNDP\u2019s knowledge and capacities on A2J in Asia and the Pacific, and to contribute to global UNDP A2J policy. Its strategy has been to develop a regional \u2018community of practitioners\u2019 on A2J, which has produced a number of programming tools and to stimulate knowledge development in that field. The initiative has consciously applied a human rights-based approach in defining its scope for action and in creating programming tools. UNDP defines access to justice as \u2018the ability of people, particularly from poor and disadvantaged groups, to seek and obtain a remedy through formal and informal justice systems, in accordance with human rights principles and standards\u2019. The rationale for using human rights-based programming is to promote empowering development processes and to enhance the accountability and effectiveness of development initiatives. The human rights-based approach focuses not only on the intended goal of a programme or project, but also on the process of its design and implementation. The assessment of AP-A2J, conducted over April and May 2009, examined the Initiative\u2019s results \u2013 through the dual lens of process and outputs \u2013 in order to harness lessons of the past experience and strengthen the DGTTF role in supporting innovation in democratic governance regionally and globally. The assessment is part of a larger UNDP effort to respond to one of the recommendations of the global DGTTF 2008 Evaluation that highlighted the need for UNDP HQ, regional and country offices, as well as donors to learn more from successful and unsuccessful projects. As such, it aims to strengthen knowledge management by documenting country office experiences in implementing DGTTF-supported access to justice interventions. The assessment was largely informed by the OECD/DAC criteria of effectiveness and efficiency, sustainability and political economy.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dee19162-c9bf-4135-a558-ad2351d13473": {"__data__": {"id_": "dee19162-c9bf-4135-a558-ad2351d13473", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "The Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative: Regional Assessment", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "34f6fbb0d4b37b096c20f06125a24e6c57c0d21cd79b76cb3166d09182a636a2"}, "2": {"node_id": "949e3515-7d57-446a-aed3-6cd6a9336f49", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-rights-and-justice-initiative-regional-assessment", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "95a1a1a429438fbc16637a2ee37f2487c14bc296281ed6ff3bd9b7c77ca06784"}}, "hash": "770fd465a584bc51ec23733025c5812d80d7bdfd4a1c63898e2ebcadb69077f8", "text": "Its main objectives were: a to identify, analyze and document the results and impact of the project, lessons learned and tools and instruments used; a to analyze the sustainability of its innovations and the degree of government- or donor-funded upscaling or replication; a to channel the lessons of this assessment into regional programming and policy options, and foster stronger knowledge management; and a to conceptualize future A2J programming and policy development.

A small survey was also conducted in May 2009 with members of the UNDP A2J Community of Practice Network (AP-A2J network), and dozens of reports and documents on the regional initiative and country office projects were analyzed. The assessment team also conducted four country assessments in Cambodia, India, Indonesia and Sri-Lanka. Summary of findings, lessons learned and recommendations Political economy The AP-A2J human rights-based approach regards access to justice as a fundamental right, as well as a key means to defend other rights. The focus on human rights brings two important values to development work: a framework for policies and programmes; and an emphasis on enhancing the capacity of poor people to demand accountability. There is a general consensus around the main characteristics of the human rights-based approach to development. These include free, active and meaningful participation, equality and non-discrimination, empowerment of the poorest and most disadvantaged groups, clear connection between duties and responsibilities, and a comprehensive and integrated long-term vision of the development process as contributing to the further realization of human rights. Many years after the publication of the first UNDP Human Development Report and the 2000 Human Development Report on Human Rights and Development, the debate continues over whether and how development and human rights intersect. Many UN bodies, national development cooperation agencies, international and national NGOs are mainstreaming human rights into development practice. Although there was an agreement reached in 2003 with the UN Common Understanding on the human rights-based approach, there is still no comprehensive UNDP global commitment to strategically adopt a human rights based approach to development2. Effectiveness On the whole, the assessment concluded that AP-A2J has successfully achieved all of its expected outputs and the core of its two outcomes. It has clearly increased codification of knowledge and production of tools on the subject, and contributed immensely to the capacity development of both UNDP practitioners and national and external partners. It has promoted policy development at the global level and raised the visibility and credibility of the UNDP\u2019s work on applying the human rights-based approach to A2J, thereby establishing the UNDP\u2019s niche in the area of access to justice. The initiative successfully launched a regional community of practice which adopted a bottom-up practice approach, focused on drawing on the knowledge of practitioners and strengthening organizational learning. The AP-A2J initiative was found to be radically innovative in both process and results. The approach emphasizing process and results had far reaching impact extending beyond the region and to other development partners, including civil society organizations. Financially, it boosted interest from donors keen on earmarking funds for access to justice projects in the region which had adopted the human rights-based approach3. It also effectively demonstrated that with very little initial funding4, low-cost activities and one full time dedicated resource facilitator, it was possible to create an inspiring movement owned by the core practitioners. Lastly, while the ownership, capacity development and partnership strategies were effectively geared to promoting sustainability, there continues to be challenges in ensuring that the human-rights based approach to development is not seen merely as a passing fad and that the momentum built by the initiative is not lost. Sustainability The sustainability of the initiative\u2019s effects and impact can be difficult to gauge. The main challenge is in maintaining the momentum generated by the scaling up of the community of practice, with its attendant benefits for ownership and capacity development. Many original community members have dispersed to different country offices; some in senior management have sought to incorporate a human rights- based approach into their work in other fields and regions. Still, country assessments have identified sustainability as the biggest concern for all country offices and national counterparts regarding ongoing A2J interventions. 2 Indeed, the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) missed the opportunity to further endorse the human rights-based approach to access to justice. 3 The CLEP, while seeking to empower the poor through focusing on property rights, business rights, land rights and access to justice, missed an opportunity to integrate human rights into their framework by not adopting the human rights-based approach. 4 From interviews and documentation available, it was possible to conclude that the initiative mobilized approximately USD 185,000 from DGTTF and the Global HURIST Programme. UNDP SURF offices in Bangkok and Kathmandu further contributed an estimated USD 20,000. 10 Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative On its face, AP-A2J has all the elements necessary to sustainability.

Some good opportunities to demonstrate UNDP commitment to this approach have been missed \u2013 notably the 2008-2011 Strategic Plan, the Global Justice Programme and more recently the Commission on Legal Empowerment of the Poor (CLEP) initiative. If this pattern persists, the positive impact of the initiative may well fade with time \u2013 and with it, the opportunity for serious engagement on a human rights-based approach to development. Access to Justice Practitioner\u2019s Guide The Programming for Justice: Access for All programming guide on applying the human rights-based approach to access to justice programming is targeted at development practitioners working on access to justice. It has influenced and has been influenced by a vast range of experiences from countries in the Asia-Pacific region. The tool itself and the process of developing the tool can be considered a good practice which has generated substantive results. The Practitioner\u2019s Guide is particularly impressive in conceptualizing the issues and in making the case for a step-by-step approach to practically developing and implementing justice programmes from a human rights- based perspective. However, it has been recommended that the Guide (published in 2005) should be updated and made more user-friendly. Lessons learned The core lesson from the AP-A2J experience is that while community of practice development may be a complex and time-consuming process, it produces tailored and relevant tools, and enhances the capacity of those who are part of the process to draw on their experiences, build on their awareness of the issues and apply their knowledge in practice. Technically, policy advisors or external experts in isolation can also develop tools and knowledge products, but in these cases the result is often a document, which is informative, but does not fully capture practical experiences and know-how. A practice approach is critical to ensure that knowledge produced is \u2018shared\u2019 rather than \u2018shelved\u2019. Lessons from tool development The following principles guided the challenging and time- consuming process of tool development: a Thorough assessment of UNDP knowledge needs at the start; a Reducing knowledge uptake time among practitioners; a Rigorous prioritization and screening of resources; a High-quality analysis; a Optimization of already existing resources, avoiding reinventing the wheel. In the end several lessons were extracted through this lengthy process. When the community of practice was launched, few other communities of practice existed and practitioners had more time to participate in it. As the number of communities of practice has grown, commitment among practitioners has been diluted. Still, the A2J initiative has produced several tools that have become familiar to many country offices in the region. In a May 2009 survey5 on the AP- Rights and Justice Initiative (annexed to this report), 75% of respondents claimed to have used the most relevant tools that came out as one of the results of the initiative; 8.3% were familiar with the tools but had never used them; and 16.7% were not familiar. The Practitioner\u2019s Guide was considered the best tool by the majority of stakeholders interviewed by the assessment at both the regional and country office levels. The interviews and survey results both point out that while the 5 The survey neglected to request that respondents identify their country offices, and some non-Asian country offices responded. UNDP Kosovo, for example, is in the process of launching an A2J programme. 11 Regional Assessment Practitioner\u2019s Guide was launched at the regional level in 2005, it would have benefitted from an immediate roll-out programme at the country-level so that UNDP country offices and their partners would know how to use the tool. Lessons on applying the human rights-based approach to A2J programming Applying a human rights-based approach makes good programming practice obligatory rather than optional. Human rights-based programmes are therefore effective even when measured by traditional development criteria. In the AP-A2J experience, applying the human rights-based approach helped in moving away from justice sector reform projects focused on highlighting the connection from the rule of law and economic growth, to one where the framework for UNDP\u2019s interventions on access to justice focused on empowering disadvantaged people to realize their rights and obtain remedies for their grievances. The human rights-based approach puts people at the centre of the development process and seeks to analyze underlying problems that prevent people from exercising their rights. It examines the roles of both duty-bearers in fulfilling their obligations and rights-holders in claiming their rights. A focus on disadvantaged groups seeks a more direct impact on poverty eradication and other Millennium Development Goals.

This report concludes that adopting of a human rights-based approach in analyzing access to justice for poverty reduction improved problem identification, identification of target groups, scope of assessment and identification of entry points for capacity development. The country assessments held in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka also contribute to this conclusion. Recommendations The eight main recommendations are drawn from the experiences of the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice Initiative. These recommendations are for the future of the initiative as well as recommendations on coordinating with other global initiatives on justice and human rights: 1. Conduct independent evaluations of the impact of access to justice programmes in the region on how using the human rights-based approach affects the ability of people to seek and obtain a remedy. For example, client surveys can be used to ensure that the programmes are reaching their target groups and enhancing their ability to access justice. 2. Re-energize the community of practice in order to build on past momentum and ensure continued engagement of practitioners on the human rights-based approach to access to justice. For example, practitioners can be brought together to update and simplify the Practitioners\u2019 Guide. 3. Provide further guidance and develop tools on how to adopt the human rights-based approach to programming on law reform projects at the country level. 4. Conduct additional research in strengthening linkages between traditional justice systems and formal justice system in adopting the human rights-based approach. Additional focus on public interest litigation is also necessary. 5. Pool regional resources and expertise to foster capacity development and training. For example, supporting a consortium of organizations to work on applying the human rights-based approach to access to justice. 6. Capitalize on other ongoing programmes on justice and human rights. For example, build and strengthen partnerships applying the human rights-based approach with the Global Human Strengthening Programme, the Global Thematic Programme on Access to Justice, and the Commission on the Legal Empowerment of the Poor. 7. Support the UNDP Legal Empowerment for the Poor initiative in adopting a human rights-based approach. 8. Continue using the same bottom-up approach to practice development that was able to achieve results for AP-A2J in the past. 12 Assessment purpose, objective and scope UNDP Regional Centre in Bangkok has received support from the Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund (DGTTF) since 2002 for innovative, catalytic initiatives to strengthen democratic governance and promote good governance in the region. With the DGTTF support the Asia-Pacific Rights and Justice initiative was launched in August 2002 to codify the links between access to justice and human rights, and to help define the UNDP niche in this field. The assessment of AP-A2J, conducted over April and May 2009, examined the Initiative\u2019s results in order to harness lessons of the past experience and strengthen the DGTTF role in supporting innovation in democratic governance regionally and globally. The assessment is part of a larger UNDP effort to respond to one of the recommendations of the global DGTTF 2008 Evaluation that highlighted the need for UNDP HQ, regional and country offices, as well as donors to learn more from successful and unsuccessful projects. As such, it aims to strengthen knowledge management by documenting country office experiences in implementing DGTTF-supported access to justice interventions. The main objectives in assessing the results of the A2J regional initiative were: a to identify, analyze and document the results and impact of the project, lessons learned and tools and instruments used; a to analyze the sustainability of its innovations and the degree of government- or donor-funded upscaling or replication; a to channel the lessons of this assessment into regional programming and policy options, and foster stronger knowledge management; and a to conceptualize future A2J programming and policy development. The terms of reference for the assessment stress the importance of documenting both \u2018direct\u2019 and \u2018indirect\u2019 levels of influence of AP-A2J by focusing on the process that led to its formulation as well as follow-up efforts on the part of the Regional Centre in Bangkok to monitor progress at the country level. It is important to note that the current assessment is an overall analytic overview of results of AP-A2J to improve programming and sustainability, rather than an outcome evaluation6 of the initiative or its main products. No attempt is made to systematically and objectively assess outcomes through the traditional analysis of the results chain and performance measurement tools.

The objective is simply to put emphasis on capturing valuable lessons that may have broader applications, rather than on accountability7 and performance management. It is, above all, an exercise in documenting valuable information to provide forward-looking recommendations for the RCB role in advancing the A2J initiative. Introduction 6 The current assessment is not an outcome evaluation as described in the UNDP M&E Handbook: \u201c\u2026an evaluation that covers a set of related projects, programmes and strategies intended to bring about a certain outcome.
