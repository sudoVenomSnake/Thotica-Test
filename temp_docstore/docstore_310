tegration at the country level. The institutional and administrative responsibility for risk reduction has to be vested at the highest possible level in government, in order to have the necessary political authority and resources to influence development policy. If risk reduction can be included explicitly in national development plans and budgets, all parts of government are then able to programme risk reduction actions and investments. Fortunately, the review of HFA progress highlighted that many countries are already putting into place innovative mechanisms for risk reduction governance, on which an improved governance framework can be built. 7.5.1 Hazard monitoring and risk information Responsibilities for both hazard monitoring and risk information management are currently highly dispersed amongst a large number of governmental technical institutions, universities, and international technical cooperation projects. As a result, little progress is being made in comprehensive multi-hazard risk assessments 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 182 and hazard monitoring is often ad hoc and discontinuous. It is recommended, therefore, that in the context of a country\u2019s planning system, greater synergy is sought in hazard monitoring and risk identification. This might be achieved by the functional integration or merging into a single institution of the large number of scientific and technical bodies responsible for meteorology, geology and geophysics, oceanography, and environmental management. Such functional integration or institutional merging would improve the availability of accurate and up-to-date disaster risk information in appropriate scales and formats to support decision-making. This would facilitate, for example, the analysis of costs and benefits of incorporating disaster risk reduction into public investment, including ecosystem protection and renovation; the identification of priorities for investments in corrective disaster risk reduction; the assessment of probabilistic risk levels for the calculation of insurance premiums; the provision of hazard maps for use by local and city governments in land-use and territorial planning and regulation; the formulation of building codes; the dissemination of risk information for the private sector and civil society; and the establishment of norms and standards for risk reduction, such as the new ISO 3100 Standard currently under discussion. Enhanced hazard monitoring would support improved early warning related to the major risks faced by a country, including cyclones, floods, volcanic eruptions and risks associated with climate variability such as El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles. 7.5.2 Incorporating cost\u2013benefit analysis into public investment Some countries have incorporated governance innovations in their public investment systems, such as the analysis of the costs and benefits of disaster risk reduction, illustrated by Table 5.5. On the basis of accurate and up-to-date information on hazards, vulnerabilities and risks, an effective public investment system, normally located in either the planning or the finance ministry, could ensure that all new public investment is subject to a cost\u2013benefit analysis to determine whether the additional costs of incorporating disaster risk reduction measures are justified", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0da55705-d97c-4178-af79-7eb1440fe22c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0da55705-d97c-4178-af79-7eb1440fe22c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f96ab7b1ac08a61943004aad0030fe7f6d78debe3d3dfb0703bceacf7f36919"}}, "hash": "7f96ab7b1ac08a61943004aad0030fe7f6d78debe3d3dfb0703bceacf7f36919", "text": "by the level of risk. This would enhance the sustainability and cost- effectiveness of public investment, whether in sectoral or local development, new development or in rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and services. Such action would contribute significantly to the reduction of future disaster risks. Normally the finance or planning ministry would also manage national budget resources for investments in reducing and correcting existing risks or those that are likely to increase due to climate change. These resources would be used for hazard mitigation; retrofitting of highly vulnerable key facilities and infrastructure (for example, schools, hospitals, water, sanitation and energy networks); for the development of early warning systems; for the restoration of ecosystems; and for other corrective disaster risk reduction investments. If disaster risk reduction is incorporated into public investment systems, the finance or planning ministry would then also be best placed to negotiate the transfer of residual sovereign risk through participation in catastrophe pools, the issue of catastrophe bonds or other instruments, and to ensure that adequate resources exist for investment in recovery and reconstruction after disasters, through the management of contingency funds. 7.5.3 Ensuring implementation A further governance innovation implemented in some countries is the inclusion of disaster risk reduction on the national audit or controller\u2019s office agenda of periodic audits of public sector performance. This in turn depends on risk reduction becoming a central component of national policy and being included in national development plans and budgets. This can ensure that risk reduction policies and norms are implemented and enforced at all levels and sectors of government. Without improvements in implementation, enforcement and control, there is a real danger that other advances in policy and governance lead to 183 Chapter 7 Investing today for a safer tomorrow achievements on paper but have little effect on the underlying risk factors. Audits can lead to administrative or other sanctions for non-compliance. However, they can also be used to highlight deficiencies and areas where improvements can be made and should become a key element in governance frameworks for risk reduction. 7.5.4 Improvements in early warning systems The review of early warning systems (see Box 5.2) highlighted nine areas in which improvements are required to ensure that those at risk have access to timely and understandable early warning information, know their risks, and are prepared to take appropriate risk-reducing action. In particular, linkages need to be enhanced between the systems that provide early warnings of impending hazard events and the organizations responsible for disaster preparedness and response; local and community capacities for preparedness and response also need to be strengthened. Experience has shown that even when national and regional early warning fails, those areas with strong local capacities experience drastically reduced mortality rates even in cases of catastrophic events. 7.5.5 Risk transfer and financial mechanisms There are still major barriers to the penetration of catastrophe insurance in lower-middle and low- income countries. These barriers include the lack of accurate and systematic risk assessments and the necessary financial infrastructure. Support for the development of insurance markets in lower-income countries is another governance innovation that addresses these barriers, allowing a larger proportion of at- risk households to have access to risk transfer mechanisms. The development of insurance markets should be complemented by measures such as microfinance and contingency funding mechanisms to address different layers of risk in each country. A greater penetration of risk transfer mechanisms in lower-income countries will also provide a quicker, more predictable and transparent mechanism for financing recovery and reconstruction, enabling a rapid recovery of livelihoods and lost assets. Investing today for a safer tomorrow In general terms, the cost implications of the recommendations presented above have three principal components: 1. Investment in risk-reducing development: the cost of providing the infrastructure and services needed to address the underlying risk factors. For example, this might include improvements to storm and surface drainage in urban areas; retrofitting existing buildings and infrastructure to reduce their vulner - ability; improving water and sanitation, health and education; or providing infrastructure in rural areas. 2. Incorporating risk reduction consider- ations: the additional costs of factoring risk reduction considerations into all the above investment. 3. Risk reduction governance framework: the costs of building the governance frame- works and capacity at both the national and local levels to organize the tasks listed in points 1 and 2 above, and ensuring they are implemented. Progress in the first two components depends on the presence of an adequate governance framework. At the same time, a governance framework without investment in the first two components is analogous to a country that has developed a comprehensive building code, but where", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb2c48a4-c39e-4a93-bf13-b0a151e621f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb2c48a4-c39e-4a93-bf13-b0a151e621f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4c6712a963034e02caf06d8e3631f3838de94a97574c2ae17aa72430ef2cdff9"}}, "hash": "4c6712a963034e02caf06d8e3631f3838de94a97574c2ae17aa72430ef2cdff9", "text": "90% of the housing of the poor is built in the informal sector without reference to the code. In other words, investment in all three areas is mutually supportive. 7.6 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 184 7.6.1 Investment in risk-reducing development Calculations of the costs of risk-reducing development investment must include both the cost of addressing existing development deficits, such as upgrading existing informal settlements or restoring damaged ecosystems, and that of ensuring that new development contributes to risk reduction \u2013 for example, ensuring that the urban poor have access to safe land, infrastructure and services. It is difficult or impossible to provide accurate global estimates of the cost of reducing the development deficit in rural and urban areas. However, as Box 7.2 shows, the estimates developed by the Millennium Project serve to give an idea of the magnitude. These different estimates indicate that several hundred billion dollars of investment a year are required to address the underlying risk Box 7.2: The cost of meeting the MDGs factors in rural and urban areas. As Chapter 6 indicated, these costs can be greatly reduced through innovative government\u2013civil society partnerships. However, even assuming that governments up-scale and mainstream such participatory approaches, there is no getting round the fact that addressing the underlying risk factors requires major and sustained investment, of which the international community will have to pay a significant portion. Reducing disaster risk and adapting to climate change in developing countries is not a free ride for the international community. Paradoxically the current global economic crisis may offer an opportunity to promote such investment. Many countries are increasing public investment in areas such as infrastructure and employment creation as part of economic stimulus packages. To the extent that this investment could be targeted at risk-reducing Detailed estimates of the cost of meeting the MDGs in Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda suggest a total of around US$ 1,000 per person2. Of this, about half is for infrastructure. The only housing-related component is around US$ 30 per person allocated to slum upgrading3. The difference between the total investment needed to meet the MDGs and current domestic resource mobilization from households and governments is estimated to be approximately US$ 600 per person for these five countries. If this average were applied only to the LDCs, this would still imply a need for external investment of US$ 480 billion over ten years. The MDG finance gap for all low- and middle- income countries was estimated at US$ 73 billion in 2006, rising to US$ 135 billion in 2015. This costing exercise highlights the high monetary cost of addressing the development deficit that underpins disaster risk reduction in poor countries. The estimated cost of remedying existing deficiencies in the provision of water, sanitation and drainage in urban areas provides another relevant ex- ample. If we assume that there are 30 million urban dwellings lacking provision for water and sanitation in Africa and Latin America, and 150 million lacking such provision in Asia4; and that the average cost per household of providing water, sanitation and drain- age is US$ 200\u20134005, with another US$ 200\u2013400 needed for the trunk infrastructure this requires (including water abstraction and treatment), then US$ 42\u201384 billion would be needed. The proportion of this that could be funded by local and national governments would differ greatly between regions and countries. At the same time, this only considers the water and sanitation infrastructure needed in urban areas and does not consider the investment needed for the 55% of the population who live in rural areas. The cost of upgrading informal settlements has been estimated at an average of US$ 665 per person6. This implies that the cost of upgrading the 800 million to one billion people living in informal settlements would be US$ 532\u2013665 billion7. If 30% of these investments could be recovered through small loans and 10% was contributed by residents themselves, this would still imply the need for some US$ 300\u2013400 billion. The cost of providing good quality alterna- tives to the growth of informal settlements for an estimated 457 million people between 2005 and 2020, through assisted owner-driven housing, would require a per capita investment of US$ 400. This implies a total requirement of US$ 182 billion, of which 60%, or US$ 110 billion, would have to come from subsidies. The other 40% could be funded through savings and contributions from participant households and cost-recovery from small loans. 185 Chapter 7 Investing today for a safer tomorrow development (for example, improving drainage in flood prone areas) it could be", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "052ab4b9-9979-47ce-85ed-55f6f4913f4f": {"__data__": {"id_": "052ab4b9-9979-47ce-85ed-55f6f4913f4f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f02a4107973468599c4c110bb9a6b682cf2f42b430764fff16b6a6612cb02f00"}, "3": {"node_id": "0cb1b0cf-b9a3-489d-9947-44f18c2748f5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "009cfa904468a83285a31709000addf71d5d938325913a562588f59a8ae22fae"}}, "hash": "a093ce1b5a682281d2f47048af91c0b7ca64146aa45eaa3395c68351b3655f1c", "text": "used as a risk reducing tool. 7.6.2 Incorporating risk reduction Risk reduction (whether conceptualized as disaster risk reduction or adaptation to climate change) is usually viewed as an additional development cost. In fact, one of the principal arguments that has been used to justify the lack of progress in disaster risk reduction, is that developing countries have other priorities, such as reducing poverty, and cannot afford the additional costs. This Report puts forward a contrasting view. As Table 5.5 illustrated, investment in disaster risk reduction generally represents a large saving in terms of avoided losses and reconstruction costs. It is thus a way of lowering the costs of poverty reduction and of addressing the underlying risk factors. This means that the real cost of development investments is actually lower if disaster risk reduction is included. Mechanisms such as catastrophe pools and bonds may provide a means to transfer residual risks, where it is not cost-effective to reduce them. Given that insurance markets in most lower-middle and low-income countries are highly undeveloped, this policy recommendation requires public sector support to ensure that risk assessments are available for the estimation of hazard and risk levels, and to assist with the start- up costs associated with opening an insurance market. These costs need to be included in budgets for improving governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction. 7.6.3 Risk reduction governance framework It is likewise difficult to estimate the investments required to enhance national policy and governance frameworks, because needs and capacities vary from one country to another. Many of these investments require an element of international technical cooperation, even in countries where most of the key resources and capacities are available nationally. In any case, the key resource in this case is political will more than international finance. When the necessary political will is present, even small investments can produce huge benefits. Without political will even large investments in capacity building may have little tangible effect. In conclusion, the key requirements are to help countries strengthen governance arrangements and improve management of investments for addressing the underlying risk drivers, and to ensure disaster risk reduction is incorporated into those investments. Without strengthening these arrangements and capacities, even large investments in development may have little tangible effect or be counter-productive. If the governance arrangements and capacities for risk reduction can be strengthened, small investments can produce huge benefits. Investing today to strengthen capacities is essential if future generations are to enjoy a safer tomorrow. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction Risk and poverty in a changing climate 186 Endnotes 1 World Bank, World Development Indicators On-line: http://go.worldbank.org/U0FSM7AQ40, accessed 1 November 2008 2 Sachs and UN Millennium Project, 2005.

In 2008, the deaths of approximately 140,000 people in the Myanmar cyclone and the collapse of more than five million buildings and damage to 21 million more in the China earthquake, were stark reminders that disaster risks associated with tropical cyclones, floods, earthquakes, droughts and other natural hazards are a key part of this interlocked set of threats. The Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction focuses attention on that challenge. It identifies disaster risk, analyses its causes, shows that these causes can be addressed and recommends the means to do so. The over-riding message of the Report is that reducing disaster risk can also help in reducing poverty, safeguarding development and adapting to climate change, with beneficial effects on broader global security, stability and sustainability. Given the urgency posed by climate change, the Report forcefully argues the case for taking action now. The Report is the first biennial global assessment of disaster risk reduction prepared in the context of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR). The ISDR, launched in 2000, provides a framework to coordinate actions to address disaster risks at the local, national, regional and international levels. The Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA), endorsed by 168 UN member states at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in Kobe, Japan in 2005, urges all countries to make major efforts to reduce their disaster risk by 2015. The Report was coordinated by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) Secretariat, in collaboration with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the World Bank, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the ProVention Consortium, the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute and a wide range of other ISDR partners. The Kingdom of Bahrain, the World Bank\u2019s Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), UNDP, UNEP, the Government of Norway, the Government of Switzerland, the ProVention Consortium and the German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) contributed financial resources that enabled the successful development of the Report. Key findings and recommendations Global disaster risk \ufffd\ufffd is highly concentrated in poorer countries with weaker governance. Particularly in low and low-middle income countries with rapid economic growth, the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards is growing at a faster rate than risk-reducing capacities are being strengthened, leading to increasing disaster risk. Countries with small and vulnerable economies, such as many small-island developing states \ufffd \ufffd (SIDS) and land-locked developing countries (LLDCs), have the highest economic vulnerability to natural hazards. Many also have extreme trade limitations. Most disaster mortality and asset destruction is intensively concentrated in very small areas \ufffd \ufffd exposed to infrequent but extreme hazards. However, low-intensity damage to housing, local infrastructure, crops and livestock, which interrupts and erodes livelihoods, is extensively spread within many countries and occurs very frequently. Such damage represents a significant and largely unaccounted for facet of disaster impacts. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 4 Poorer communities suffer a disproportionate share of disaster loss. Poor households are usually \ufffd \ufffd less resilient to loss and are rarely covered by insurance or social protection. Disaster impacts lead to income and consumption shortfalls and negatively affect welfare and human development, often over the long term. Weather-related disaster risk is expanding rapidly both in terms of the territories affected, the \ufffd \ufffd losses reported and the frequency of events. This expansive tendency cannot be explained by improved disaster reporting alone. In countries with weaker risk-reducing capacities, underlying risk drivers such as poor urban governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline underpin this rapid expansion of weather-related disaster risk. Climate change is already changing the geographic distribution, frequency and intensity of \ufffd \ufffd weather-related hazards and threatens to undermine the resilience of poorer countries and their citizens to absorb loss and recover from disaster impacts. This combination of increasing hazard and decreasing resilience makes climate change a global driver of disaster risk. Climate change will magnify the uneven distribution of risk skewing disaster impacts even further towards poor communities in developing countries. Progress towards reducing disaster risk is still mixed. In general terms, countries are making \ufffd \ufffd significant progress in strengthening capacities, institutional systems and legislation to address deficiencies in disaster preparedness and response. Good progress is also being made in other areas, such as the enhancement of early warning. In contrast, countries report little progress in mainstreaming disaster risk reduction considerations into social, economic, urban, environmental and infrastructural planning and development.

In general, the institutional and legislative arrangements for disaster risk reduction are weakly connected to development sectors. The policy and institutional frameworks for climate change adaptation and poverty reduction are \ufffd \ufffd only weakly connected to those for disaster risk reduction, at both the national and international levels. Countries have difficulty addressing underlying risk drivers such as poor urban and local governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline in a way that leads to a reduction in the risk of damages and economic loss. Documented experience in upgrading squatter settlements, providing access to land and \ufffd \ufffd infrastructure for the urban poor, strengthening rural livelihoods, protecting ecosystems, and using microfinance, microinsurance and index-based insurance to strengthen resilience shows that it is possible to address the underlying drivers of disaster risk. However, in most countries these experiences are not integrated into the policy mainstream. A failure to address the underlying risk drivers will result in dramatic increases in disaster risk \ufffd \ufffd and associated poverty outcomes. In contrast, if addressing these drivers is given priority, risk can be reduced, human development protected and adaptation to climate change facilitated. Rather than a cost, this should be seen as an investment in building a more secure, stable, sustainable and equitable future. Given the urgency posed by climate change, decisive action needs to be taken now. Risk and poverty in a changing climate Summary and Recommendations 5 A 20-point plan to reduce risk Accelerate efforts to avoid dangerous climate change 1 Agree measures such as an effective multilateral framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and policies for sustainable carbon budgeting. These are essential if potentially catastrophic increases in disaster impacts and associated poverty outcomes are to be avoided in disaster prone developing countries. Increase the economic resilience of small and vulnerable economies 2 Coordinate policies on trade and productive sector development with policies in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction in order to strengthen economic resilience, particularly in the case of SIDS and LLDCs. 3 Promote the development of catastrophe pools between such countries to allow the transfer of sovereign risk at an affordable cost and provide a more reliable mechanism for recovery and reconstruction. Adopt high-level development policy frameworks to reduce risk 4 Adopt overarching national development policy frameworks at the highest level, backed by the necessary political authority and resources, focusing on the underlying drivers of disaster risk. These should bring coherence to, align and integrate existing efforts being pursued under the HFA and through poverty reduction and climate change adaptation instruments. Focus development policy on addressing the underlying risk drivers 5 Build the capacities of urban and local governments to integrate disaster risk reduction considerations into a broader strategy to ensure the supply of safe land, secure tenure, infrastructure and services, and adequate, disaster resistant housing for the urban poor. 6 Invest in natural resource management, infrastructure development, livelihood generation and social protection to reduce vulnerability and strengthen the resilience of rural livelihoods. 7 Protect and enhance ecosystem services through mechanisms such as protected area legislation, payment for ecosystem services and integrated planning. 8 Shift the emphasis of social protection from an exclusive focus on response to include pre- disaster mechanisms and more effective targeting of the most vulnerable groups. Adopt an approach supportive of local initiatives 9 Promote a culture of planning and implementation of disaster risk reduction that builds on government\u2013civil society partnerships and cooperation and is supportive of local initiative, in order to dramatically reduce the costs of risk reduction, ensure local acceptance, and build social capital. Build on existing systems for public administration to incorporate innovations into the governance of disaster risk reduction 10 Ensure that responsibility for disaster risk reduction is vested in the highest level of political authority and is explicitly incorporated into national development plans and budgets. 11 Harmonize and where possible integrate the governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 6 Global disaster risk: the challenge Risk is intensively concentrated The risk of both mortality and economic loss in disasters is highly concentrated in a very small portion of the Earth\u2019s surface. Countries with large populations exposed to severe natural hazards account for a very large proportion of global disaster risk. For example, 75% of global flood mortality risk is concentrated in only three countries: Bangladesh, China and India. Similarly mortality and economic loss are concentrated in a very small number of disasters.

Invest to reduce risk 17 Increase the resources available for climate change adaptation in risk prone developing countries, in order to complement resources pledged to achieve the MDGs and allow such countries to address the underlying drivers of risk. 18 Use increased public spending in the context of economic stimulus packages, to invest in risk- reducing infrastructure and other measures that address the underlying risk drivers. 19 Ensure that additional investments are made to factor disaster risk reduction considerations into all new development. 20 Strengthen the capacities of disaster prone countries to develop the policy and governance frameworks necessary to organize and manage all the above. internationally recorded economic losses were US$ 1,527.6 billion. Just 25 mega-disasters, representing 0.28% of the events, accounted for 40% of the loss. However, small island developing states (SIDS) and other small countries have far higher levels of relative risk with respect to the size of their populations and economies. For example, in the case of tropical cyclones, Vanuatu has the highest mortality risk per million inhabitants in the world, with St. Kitts and Nevis in third place. Risk is unevenly distributed Disaster risk is not evenly distributed. Developing countries concentrate a hugely disproportionate share of the risk. For example, both Japan and Risk and poverty in a changing climate Summary and Recommendations 7 the Philippines are exposed to frequent tropical cyclones. In Japan, approximately 22.5 million people are exposed annually, compared to 16 million people in the Philippines. However, the estimated annual death toll from cyclones in the Philippines is almost 17 times greater than that of Japan. This uneven distribution of risk is also true for groups of countries. For the same number of people exposed to tropical cyclones, mortality risk in low-income countries is approximately 200 times higher than in OECD countries. Poorer countries also experience higher economic losses in relation to the size of their economies. OECD countries, including Australia, Japan and the United States of America, account for almost 70% of estimated global annual economic losses to tropical cyclones \u2013 approximately 90 times more than the losses in exposed countries in sub-Saharan Africa.

These examples show that disaster risk is not just a consequence of hazard severity and exposure. Risk is configured by a range of other drivers related to a country\u2019s economic and social development. These include not only income and economic strength but also governance factors such as the quality of institutions, transparency and accountability. Wealthier countries tend to have better institutions, more effective early warning, disaster preparedness and response systems, and more open government that tends to be more supportive of disaster risk reduction. Well-governed countries with higher human development indicators generally have lower levels of risk than countries with weaker governance. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 8 Risk is increasing While wealthier countries are usually less risk prone than poorer countries, economic develop- ment must be accompanied by the strengthening of governance capacities if disaster risk is to be reduced. Rapid economic and urban development can lead to a growing concentration of people and economic assets in hazard prone cities, fertile river valleys and coastal areas. Disaster risk increases if the exposure of people and assets to natural hazards increases faster than countries can strengthen their risk-reducing capacities by putting policy, institutions, legislation, planning and regulatory frameworks in place. In absolute terms, and assuming constant hazard levels, global disaster risk increased between 1990 and 2007. In the case of floods, mortality risk increased by 13% from 1990 to 2007. Over the same period flood economic loss risk increased by 35%. These increases in disaster risk are primarily driven by the growing exposure of people and economic assets. The number of people exposed to floods increased by 28% over the same period, while exposed GDP increased by 98%. Most flood risk is concentrated in Asian countries, such as China and India. While global GDP increased by 64%, China and India increased their GDP by 420% and 185% respectively. Over the same period, vulnerability declined; in the case of flood mortality risk by 11%, and flood economic loss risk by 32%. But this reduction in vulnerability was insufficient to compensate for the increase in exposure. This suggests that disaster risk is increasing fastest in low- and lower-middle income countries with rapidly growing economies. These countries have rapidly increasing exposure but relatively weak institutions. While they are making im- provements in risk-reducing capacities these have yet to catch up with rising exposure. In contrast, most high income countries experience more moderate increases in exposure and have already reduced a significant part of their vulnerability. Relative to the size of the global popu- lation and GDP, risk may actually be falling. For example, when recorded economic losses are adjusted for inflation and expressed as a proportion of global GDP they are fairly stable.

Madagascar shows a different pattern but a clear impact of disaster loss on cumulative net capital formation. In contrast, the impact of major disasters on high-income countries such as the United States of America is imperceptible, even though that country has experienced huge economic losses, for example the US$ 125 billion associated with Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Disaster loss reports at the local govern- ment level compiled for a sample of 12 Asian and Latin American countries for the period 1970 to 20073 show that 84% of the mortality and 75% of the destroyed housing were concentrated in only 0.7% of the reports. These are the disasters that make news headlines and capture the attention of the international community. Damage is extensively spread However, there are other risk patterns at the local level that are essentially invisible when viewed from a global perspective. Low-intensity damage to housing, local infrastructure, crops and livestock, which interrupt and erode livelihoods is extensively spread within countries and occurs very frequently. In the 12 countries sampled there were 126,620 reports of disaster damage at the municipal level since 1970, implying an average of 9 disasters per day. More than 82% of the municipalities reported losses at least once over this period. Almost half reported losses six times or more, and over 10% reported losses more than 50 times. Housing damage is extensively spread over these reports. In the case of Tamil Nadu, India, there were more than 900,000 damaged houses between 1976 and 2007. More than 60% of the housing damage, representing 550,000 houses, was spread amongst 12,000 low-intensity loss reports. Damage to 40 or 50 houses in a localized storm or flood does not attract international media attention. But over time such losses add up to a considerable accumulation of loss and an erosion of local development. Such losses, therefore, represent a significant and largely unreported facet of disaster impacts. Across the 12 countries, 34% of the economic cost of disasters in the housing sector was associated with such low-intensity loss reports, as well as 57% of the damage to schools, 65% of the damage to hospitals and 89% of the damage to roads. Poor communities face the highest risk Within developing countries, poorer communities are also more at risk than wealthier communities. Furthermore, poor households are often less resilient as they are unable to access or mobilize the assets necessary to buffer disaster losses and are rarely covered by insurance or social protection measures. In Mexico, it was found that between 1980 and 2006, disaster loss affected only 8% A comparison of extensive housing damage (left) and intensive housing destruction", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b0c6085d-4687-4315-a489-4baef3e5887c": {"__data__": {"id_": "b0c6085d-4687-4315-a489-4baef3e5887c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8fc66df5f229860a91419cbffffa28ee86cce438e8414598e2b95e04d4b1ad26"}, "3": {"node_id": "b7975678-c971-4c71-94c1-603d3e7a98f1", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "700e672e8dffb60fb583a772689d535ebd33666b2be50de039badab167bb2935"}}, "hash": "f4ae3c10372f7d4831087f9e7771a7dfb7e7caa7e24bb436389c6a17df91dc1c", "text": "(right) in Tamil Nadu, India (1976\u20132007) SRI LANKA P O N DI C HE RR Y P O N DI C HE RR Y AN DH RA P RA DE SH K A R N A T A K A K E R A L A S e a A r a b i a n G u l f o f M a n n a r B a y o f B e n g a l CHENNAI (MADRAS) BANGALORE TRIVANDRUM 80\u00b0 E 80\u00b0 E 75\u00b0 E 75\u00b0 E 10\u00b0 N 1\u2013250 0 251\u20131 000 1 001\u20135 000 5 001\u201310 000 >10 000 Number of houses SRI LANKA CHENNAI (MADRAS) BANGALORE TRIVANDRUM K A R N A T A K A K E R A L A AN DH RA P RA DE SH P O N DI C HE RR Y P O N DI C HE RR Y G u l f o f M a n n a r B a y o f B e n g a l 80\u00b0 E 80\u00b0 E 10\u00b0 N 1\u20131 000 0 1 001\u20135 000 5 001\u201310 000 10 001\u201350 000 >50 000 Number of houses 0 100 200 50 Kilometres City population >500 000 STATE CAPITAL 100 000\u2013500 000 50 000\u2013100 000 INDIA Risk and poverty in a changing climate Summary and Recommendations 11 of the housing stock in municipalities with low or very low levels of marginality. In contrast, in municipalities with high or very high levels of marginality that proportion was far higher: in 20% of these municipalities more than 50% of the housing stock had been damaged or destroyed. These findings were mirrored by other countries. In Sri Lanka more houses are damaged by floods in areas with people living below the poverty line. In Tamil Nadu, disaster mortality is higher in areas with vulnerable housing, while housing damage in tropical cyclones is greater in areas with the lowest literacy. Poor households are likely to experience income or consumption shortfalls after disaster impacts. In El Salvador, for example, the average income per capita in poor rural households affected by the 2001 earthquakes was reduced by approximately one third. Welfare is also negatively affected at the local and regional levels. In Mexico, for example, municipalities that experienced disaster losses between 2000 and 2005 experienced a 3.5% growth in the number of households without enough income to buy a basic food basket. In Iran, the provinces that experienced the largest number of deaths and destroyed houses in earthquakes also experienced the greatest drop in household expenditure. The poorest households also tend to lose a higher proportion of their assets and income. In Peru, for example, in 2006, rural households that had experienced disasters between 2000 and 2005 had a reduced per capita consumption. However, consumption dropped by 3.85% in the poorest quarter of households, as opposed to 1.2% in the wealthiest quarter. Disaster impacts produce other poverty outcomes as well. The empirical evidence shows that school enrolment tends to fall and children may grow at a slower rate due to nutritional shortfalls following disasters. For example, children that were in the womb to 36 months of age and living in villages affected by the 1984 drought and famine in Ethiopia were almost 3cm shorter ten years after the disaster than their non- affected counterparts4. In countries where women have a low social and economic status they may be particularly affected. These outcomes may be short-term, if targeted and appropriate assistance is provided to poor families, but in its absence, poverty outcomes may be long-term and recovery slow or difficult. In Ethiopia, poor rural households most affected by the droughts and famines of the mid-1980s were still experiencing 4\u201316 % lower growth in household income in the mid- 1990s, a period of substantial recovery of food consumption and nutrition. Rural households affected by repeated disasters often never recover fully before being hit by another shock. The rapid expansion of weather-related disaster risk The number of local-level disaster loss reports in the 12 countries sampled has more than doubled since 1980, and housing damage has quintupled.

The number of local government areas reporting losses one to nine times a year has doubled since 1980. The number of municipalities reporting losses between 10 and 49 times has quintupled. Importantly, the number of loss reports associated with flooding and heavy rains is increasing faster than all other hazard types. In Costa Rica, for example, these have at least quintupled since 1990. It is likely that improved disaster report- ing at least partly explains this increase. Since the introduction of the Internet in the early 1990s, many more disasters are being reported, particu- larly from remoter, rural areas. However, improved reporting is insufficient to explain the geographic expansion of risk. In addition flood related hazard is also increasing in major cities, where disaster losses have always been historically reported. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 12 Case study evidence from Africa, Asia and Latin America documented in the Report shows that the expansion of weather-related disaster risk closely mirrors development-related processes such as the growth of cities and the expansion of the agricultural frontier into previously sparsely populated areas. These processes simultaneously increase the number of people exposed to hazards and also generate new hazard patterns. In coun- tries with weaker risk-reducing capacities, it is underlying risk drivers such as poor urban gover- nance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline that underpin the expansion of risk.

Many city governments have been incapable of ensuring that there is safe land for housing, adequate infrastructure and services, and a planning and regulatory framework to manage the associated environmental and other risks. This has led to urban growth in developing countries being absorbed through the creation of informal settlements. Approximately one billion people worldwide live in these settlements and numbers are growing by approximately 25 million per year. Poor people in informal urban settlements typically have higher levels of everyday risk, even without considering the impact of natural hazards. For example, cities in high-income countries typically have under-five mortality rates of less than 10 per 1000 live births. In contrast many cities in developing countries have far higher rates. In Nairobi, for example, under-five mortality rates were 61.5 per 1,000 live births for the city as a whole in 2002, but approximately 150 per 1,000 in informal settlements. Evidence from cities in Africa, Asia and Latin America, shows that the expansion of informal settlements is closely associated with the rapid increase in weather-related disaster reports in urban areas. Flood loss reports in the city of Cali, Colombia are shown in the map for each decade since the 1950s. The centrifugal expansion of reported floods has mirrored the expansion of informal settlements in the city. Urbanization per se tends to increase the intensity of run-off during storms and heavy rains. Instead of being absorbed into the ground, greater volumes of rainwater are channelled into drains, culverts and streams. Informal settlements typically occupy land deemed unsuitable for residential or commercial use, located in low lying flood prone areas, on landslide prone hillsides or in ravines, exposing people to hazard. Houses are built and modified without reference to hazard resistant building standards. In many cities there has been an underinvestment in building drains and in maintaining those that exist, particularly in informal settlements. Many floods are caused as much by deficient or non- existent drainage as by the intensity of rainfall. Vulnerable rural livelihoods Livelihood vulnerability is an underlying driver of disaster risk and poverty in many areas. Approximately 75% of the people living below the international poverty line (US$ 1.25 per day) live and work in rural areas5: 268 million in sub-Saharan Africa; 223 million in East Asia Risk and poverty in a changing climate Summary and Recommendations 13 and the Pacific and 394 million in South Asia. Even in countries experiencing rapid economic development, such as China, there are 175 million rural dwellers below this poverty line. Disaster losses affect huge numbers in poor rural areas. In sub-Saharan Africa, during the 2001\u20132003 drought, an estimated 206 million people, or 32% of the region\u2019s population, were under- nourished,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fc3eed2a-4e23-4414-9253-17a83aaeba16": {"__data__": {"id_": "fc3eed2a-4e23-4414-9253-17a83aaeba16", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7dc013f7fec716ba0f57efd73d69a74ed0758b9b6703c35d9d5d870a504a1a3f"}}, "hash": "7dc013f7fec716ba0f57efd73d69a74ed0758b9b6703c35d9d5d870a504a1a3f", "text": "a number only slightly less than the total 268 million rural poor6. Many rural livelihoods still depend heavily on agriculture and other natural resource sectors. Rural farm-based livelihoods are generally characterized by low input and low output agriculture due to constrained access to productive assets such as land, labour, fertilizers, irrigation facilities, infrastructure and financial services. For example, average maize yields in Malawi are only one tenth of yields in the United States of America7. Opportunities for processing and adding value to agricultural production are also often limited due to asset constraints, trade barriers and lack of access to markets. Historical patterns of land distribution and tenure tend to discriminate against the poor, who may only have access to marginal and unproductive land including areas prone to flooding, erratic or minimum rainfall, or with poor soil. Poor households usually do not have access to improved seeds, irrigation technology and other inputs that can reduce the vulnerability of crops to drought. They are dependent on rain-fed agriculture, which is far more sensitive to small seasonal fluctuations in rainfall, temperature and other weather variables than Extensive flood reports in Cali, Colombia (1950\u20132000) 1 0 2\u20133 4\u20136 >7 1950\u20131959 1990\u20132000 1980\u20131989 1970\u20131979 1960\u20131969 Number of flood events irrigated agriculture. Household dependence on a single main harvest for most annual requirements of food and income further increases vulnerability. Livelihoods in rural areas are also limited by a lack of economic diversification, thin markets, weak and costly mechanisms of exchange and trade barriers. Poor and indebted households thus have little or no surplus capacity to absorb crop or livestock income losses and to recover. A small loss in income may be devastating and set off a ratchet effect that feeds back into further poverty and future vulnerability, due to a lack of asset reserves, the absence of other income earning opportunities and the non-existence of economic and social safety-nets. Resilience is further undermined by the impacts of other hazards such as conflict and HIV/AIDS. The high structural vulnerability of housing, schools, infrastructure and other assets in poor rural areas exposed to floods, tropical cyclones and earthquakes also leads to major mortality in disasters. Rural housing is usually built with local materials and labour and without hazard resistant building techniques. The collapse of heavy earth walls led to the destruction of 329,579 houses in the 2005 Kashmir earthquake. The lack of protection offered by wattle and daub, and thatch houses in Myanmar contributed to the deaths of 140,000 people in the 2008 cyclone. The isolation of many poor rural areas, combined with under-investment by government in infrastructure and in disaster preparedness and response capacities, further increases asset and mortality risk. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 14 Declining ecosystems People receive substantial benefits or services from ecosystems. These include provisioning services which provide energy, water, food and fibre for both urban and rural households, as well as regulating services, such as the mitigation of floods and storm surges. Most ecosystems have been intentionally or unintentionally modified to increase the supply of certain categories of services and institutions have been developed to govern access and use of these services. However, because ecosystems produce many services simultaneously, an increase in the supply of one service, such as food, can frequently lead to declines in other services, such as flood regulation. The Millennium Assessment found that the supply of approximately 60% of the ecosystem services evaluated (15 of 24) were in decline (see table)8. At the same time, consumption of more than 80% of the services was found to be increasing. In other words, the flow of most ecosystem services is increasing at the same time as the total stock is decreasing. In particular, the Millennium Assessment identified that while people have modified ecosystems to increase provisioning services, these modifications have led to the decline of regulating ecosystem services, including those responsible for mitigating hazards, such as fires and floods. An increase in landslide hazard on slopes deforested for agricultural use and in storm surges in areas where mangroves have been destroyed to create shrimp ponds are examples of how an increase in provisioning ecosystem services may decrease regulating ecosystem services. While such changes in the distribution of ecosystem services often benefit specific economic interests, the costs are frequently borne by poor urban and rural households. Changes in the supply of ecosystem services may also increase livelihood vulnerability, particularly when livelihoods depend on common pool resources. For example, the destruction of mangroves for shrimp cultivation not only reduces protection against coastal erosion and storm surges but also negatively affects artisanal coastal fisheries and the communities", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e830618-ed89-43fc-b317-6bf688a274e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e830618-ed89-43fc-b317-6bf688a274e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ea95c7d4fa25b0da133f6e96a3c2d47415c21d9694abfc2896747f03ede204a"}, "3": {"node_id": "6478771d-3c88-487f-861e-5ddc5f5cc33a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ee21559eed776f7e100565a80c23d7ba009b5439b3f791095939d30b127854c"}}, "hash": "45849caad772c1b95e0d9b1db5f9554cccdc74c9305138b11c17fd75e89a254f", "text": "that depend on them.

This combination of increasing hazard and decreasing resilience makes climate change a global driver of disaster risk that will increase the impact of disasters on the poor. There is already evidence that some kinds of weather-related hazard are increasing. The table shows that the average annual number of cyclones has been fairly stable, (between 54.9 and 58.1 per year) since 1976, regardless of sea surface temperature (SST). However, in warmer years there are more Category 3 and 4 (i.e. more intense) cyclones and fewer in Categories 1 and 2. In particular, compared to the period between 1976 and 1984, when there were no data on SST, there are now significantly more category 4 and 5 cyclones. This is in line with the findings of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and recent research that has estimated that a 1\u00b0C increase in SST would lead to a 31% increase in the global frequency of Category 4 and 5 cyclones per year. Climate change magnifies the uneven distribution of disaster risk By increasing hazard at the same time as it erodes resilience, climate change has a magnifying effect on disaster risk. In particular, climate change will magnify the uneven distribution of risk, skewing disaster impacts even further towards poor communities in developing countries. Changes in means and extremes lead to increasing hazard and declining resilience Climate change is probably the greatest global outcome of environmental inequity. It is driven by greenhouse gas emissions that have brought benefits to affluent societies and individuals, yet most of the burdens fall on developing countries and their poorest citizens. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report has emphasized that if the planet\u2019s surface temperature increases by 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, the catastrophic collapse of ecosystems becomes possible with unforeseen, non-linear impacts on poverty and disaster risk9. The IPCC has also confirmed that the geographic distribution, frequency and intensity of weather-related hazards are already being altered significantly by climate change10. Changes are already occurring in the amount, intensity, frequency and type of precipitation. This is associated with an increase in the area affected by drought, in the numbers of heavy daily precipitation events that lead to flooding, and in the intensity and duration of certain kinds of tropical storms.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6478771d-3c88-487f-861e-5ddc5f5cc33a": {"__data__": {"id_": "6478771d-3c88-487f-861e-5ddc5f5cc33a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8ea95c7d4fa25b0da133f6e96a3c2d47415c21d9694abfc2896747f03ede204a"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e830618-ed89-43fc-b317-6bf688a274e0", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "45849caad772c1b95e0d9b1db5f9554cccdc74c9305138b11c17fd75e89a254f"}}, "hash": "8ee21559eed776f7e100565a80c23d7ba009b5439b3f791095939d30b127854c", "text": "At the same time, changes in the climate means threaten to undermine the resilience of poorer countries and their citizens to absorb loss and recover from disaster impacts, through, for Redistribution of extensive risk in central Peru between 1970\u20131985 and 1985\u20132006 1986\u20132006 P a c i f i c O c e a n LIMA 1\u20135 0 6\u201310 11\u201315 >15 Number of loss reports 1970\u20131985 LIMA P a c i f i c O c e a n 1\u20135 0 6\u201310 11\u201315 >15 City population >500 000 CAPITAL CITY 100 000\u2013500 000 15 000\u2013100 000 Number of loss reports 0 100 50 Kilometres 1986\u20132006 P a c i f i c O c e a n LIMA 1\u20135 0 6\u201310 11\u201315 >15 Number of loss reports LIMA a c i f i c O c e a n City population >500", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3523c056-7d68-4711-8f62-aef61a2811e6": {"__data__": {"id_": "3523c056-7d68-4711-8f62-aef61a2811e6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94c27adb7b2ece2a7fc5660d33d1036dc775a535ab82753cb5335d9e432ab10d"}, "3": {"node_id": "54df6ff4-ed52-4f0f-b0c7-5de2b77bee5f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "65a11ce19671b4d12ed4bfe9256d35db4c6490ef6bbe1143a997659056f741ac"}}, "hash": "3b23024f95b5262bc100f3425f0b49c13b8b63a8f9dc37ce294e9b6c7cbf000d", "text": "000 CAPITAL CITY 100 000\u2013500 000 15 000\u2013100 000 0 100 50 Kilometres 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 16 in climate means may lead to greater water stress and lower agricultural productivity; increases in the frequency and intensity of hazards may lead to greater losses; and resilience may be further sapped by more widespread disease vectors. Many urban areas will also experience stress through water and energy shortages, heat and cold waves and more prevalent disease vectors. Climate change will further increase flood hazard, with particular implications for informal settlements. Many cities are also at risk from sea level rise. Currently 10% of the world\u2019s total population (over 600 million people) and 13% of its urban population (over 360 million people) live on the 2% of the world\u2019s land area that is less than 10 metres above sea level, known as the Low Elevation Coastal Zone 11. There are clear risks associated with increased flooding and storm surges, exacerbated by sea level rise, in cities such as Dhaka, Mumbai and Shanghai, large parts of which are only 1\u20135 metres above sea level. For example, it is estimated that 1.9% of the GDP of Madagascar is annually at risk from Category 3 cyclones compared to only 0.09% of the GDP of Japan. If these cyclones were to increase to Category 4 storms, 3.2% of the GDP of Madagascar would be at risk but only 0.16% of the GDP of Japan. As highlighted above, 97% of the docu- mented local-level loss reports are weather-related. This means that a very significant part of emerg- ing disaster risk in developing countries is highly sensitive to any increase in hazard intensity and frequency due to climate change. It is likely that climate change is already contributing to the rapid increase in the number of weather-related loss reports since 1980, although at present it is not possible to calculate by how much. Rural livelihoods, which are dependent on agriculture and other natural resources and vulnerable to slight variations in weather, are particularly sensitive to climate change.

Progress in addressing disaster risk The Hyogo Framework for Action In 2005, 168 countries adopted the Hyogo Framework of Action (HFA), a comprehensive set of five priorities that aim to achieve a substantial reduction in disaster losses, in terms of lives and social, economic and environmental assets of communities and countries by 2015. A recent review by 62 countries12 indicates that progress towards this objective is still mixed. In general terms, countries are making significant progress in strengthening capacities, institutional systems and legislation to address deficiencies in disaster preparedness and response. Good progress is also being made in other areas, such Risk and poverty in a changing climate Summary and Recommendations 17 risk reduction. Unfortunately this has not been translated into reductions in disaster risk in the principal development sectors. It would appear that countries have difficulty addressing underlying risk drivers such as poor urban and local governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline in a way that leads to a reduction in the risk of damage and economic loss. At the same time, the governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction in many countries do not facilitate the integration of risk considerations into development. In general, the institutional and legislative arrangements for disaster risk reduction are weakly connected to development sectors. Mainstreaming is challenged by a range of factors that include difficulties in compiling comprehensive information on disaster risks, weak engagement by the development sectors and major difficulties in ensuring implementation, enforcement and accountability.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54df6ff4-ed52-4f0f-b0c7-5de2b77bee5f": {"__data__": {"id_": "54df6ff4-ed52-4f0f-b0c7-5de2b77bee5f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "94c27adb7b2ece2a7fc5660d33d1036dc775a535ab82753cb5335d9e432ab10d"}, "2": {"node_id": "3523c056-7d68-4711-8f62-aef61a2811e6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3b23024f95b5262bc100f3425f0b49c13b8b63a8f9dc37ce294e9b6c7cbf000d"}}, "hash": "65a11ce19671b4d12ed4bfe9256d35db4c6490ef6bbe1143a997659056f741ac", "text": "Climate change adaptation Many countries are also developing plans and strategies to adapt to climate change, for example through National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs).

Adaptation faces similar challenges to disaster risk reduction, in particular a governance framework that can allow risk in the development sectors to be addressed. Poverty reduction Large numbers of Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) explicitly recognize the poverty outcomes associated with disaster impacts and some include sections on disaster risk reduction. In principle, poverty reduction efforts in both rural and urban areas have a as the enhancement of early warning. As a result, some lower-income countries, such as Bangladesh and Cuba, have already made dramatic strides in reducing mortality risk in the face of hazards such as tropical cyclones and floods, which are sensitive to improvements in early warning, preparedness and response. For example, despite being hit by five successive hurricanes in 2008, only 7 deaths were reported in Cuba. In contrast, countries report little progress in mainstreaming disaster risk reduction considerations into social, economic, urban, environmental and infrastructural planning and development. Early warning and preparedness can help to evacuate people in the case of a cyclone. But housing, schools and infrastructure cannot be evacuated and, if not structurally resistant, they are damaged or destroyed. Across all five HFA Priorities for Action, high-income countries outperform low- and middle-income countries. In these high-income countries, the adoption of hazard resistant building standards, planning and environmental regulations as well as a web of institutions and systems that protect citizens when disasters occur, have enabled a substantial reduction in vulnerability. In the case of the least-developed countries, some lack the basic technical, human, institutional and financial capacities to address even the most basic aspects of disaster risk reduction. Between these two poles, many middle- and low-income countries have made major strides towards developing national policies, institutional systems and legislation for disaster Hyogo Framework: Average progress by income classification Priority 1 5 4 3 2 1 0 Priority 2 Priority 3 Priority 4 Priority 5 High Medium Low Level of progress 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 18 considerable potential to address the underlying risk drivers if they are clearly focused. In most countries, however, poverty reduction has only weak functional connections to the policy and institutional frameworks for disaster risk reduction. Unless disaster risk considerations are factored into poverty-reducing development, the result may be increased risk, as the collapse of schools in earthquakes so poignantly illustrates. At the same time, the inclusion of disaster risk reduction in PRSPs is often limited to disaster preparedness and response aspects. Therefore, the potential of PRSPs to address the underlying risk drivers is still not fully exploited. Conclusions The imperative for urgent action Current progress under the HFA and in related areas of poverty reduction and climate change adaptation is not leading to a reduction in disaster risk. The Report highlights that risk is continuing to increase, even assuming constant hazard levels, and that any further increase will disproportionately affect poor communities in developing countries. Climate change magnifies the uneven distribution of risk, increasing both disaster risk and poverty outcomes in these communities. Unless this trend is reversed it will be impossible to achieve the HFA and progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be compromised. The evidence provided in the Report underlines the urgency of avoiding dangerous climate change. Greater urgency in efforts to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions and reduce energy consumption are required if a potentially catastrophic increase in disaster risk is to be avoided, the impacts of which will be largely concentrated in developing countries. Action in other policy areas is also required. The countries with the highest relative risk and the lowest resilience to disaster impacts are those with small and vulnerable economies, such as many SIDS and LLDCs. The low resilience of these countries is associated with extreme limitations in their ability to participate in global trade. Efforts are therefore required to coordinate policies on trade and productive sector development in these countries. Unfortunately, the world is committed to significant climate change, even if rapid progress is achieved towards a low-carbon economy. Therefore, disaster prone countries will only be able to avoid further increases in disaster impacts and poverty outcomes by taking decisive action to address the underlying drivers that are responsible for the concentration and expansion of risk. The Report highlights the need to strengthen capacities to address three key drivers: poor urban governance, vulnerable rural livelihoods and ecosystem decline. Weak social protection is a fourth driver, which,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29df2b73-873b-4cca-b02e-927328669d1b": {"__data__": {"id_": "29df2b73-873b-4cca-b02e-927328669d1b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1b1ce1ce68850e213716b06fc1f051118690265fd272322f4d9921e29183ce67"}}, "hash": "1b1ce1ce68850e213716b06fc1f051118690265fd272322f4d9921e29183ce67", "text": "while not examined in depth in the Report, is also important. A failure to address these drivers will result in dramatic increases in disaster risk and associated poverty outcomes. In contrast, if addressing these drivers is given priority, risk can be reduced, human development protected and adaptation to climate change facilitated. Rather than a cost, this should be seen as an investment in building a more secure, stable, sustainable and equitable future. Given the urgency posed by climate change, decisive action needs to be taken now. A policy framework for risk-reducing development It is possible to address the underlying drivers of disaster risk. In all regions of the world, documented experience in upgrading squatter settlements, providing access to land and infrastructure for the urban poor, strengthening rural livelihoods, protecting ecosystems, and using microfinance, microinsurance and index- based insurance to strengthen resilience show that it can be done. The most successful of Risk and poverty in a changing climate Summary and Recommendations 19 these experiences have emerged in the context of innovative partnerships between national and local governments and civil society and are leading to a sustainable reduction in risks. These experiences demonstrate that the underlying risk drivers can be addressed, and that the tools, methods and approaches necessary to do so already exist. However, they must still be integrated into the policy mainstream. Most countries still lack a determined and focused high-level development policy framework that addresses these drivers and is supportive of such innovative approaches. Without such central support, ongoing efforts in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation cannot gain traction. The need to strengthen capacities to develop and implement such a policy framework is particularly urgent in those low- and middle- income countries where hazard exposure is growing most rapidly, where risks are concen- trated, and where the magnifying effects of climate change will be most felt. Risk-reducing development is essential if disaster risk reduction is to be mainstreamed into development and if development is to be adapted to climate change. The adoption of such an overarching policy framework would allow the different plans, programmes and projects in poverty reduction, climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction \u2013 as well as in sustainable development in general \u2013 to become better aligned in order to address the underlying drivers of disaster risk. These plans and programmes include PRSPs, NAPAs, United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks and nationally specific programming instruments. To be relevant and successful such a policy framework must be at the centre of the political agenda, backed by dedicated resources in the national budget, and should have leadership at the highest levels of government. If a policy framework for risk-reducing development is to be actionable a different culture of implementation will be required, one that builds on government\u2013civil society partnerships and cooperation. Such partnerships can dramatically reduce the costs of risk reduction, ensure local acceptance, and help to build social capital, which reduces long-term vulnerability. Effective risk reduction governance In addition to a policy framework that prioritizes risk-reducing development, a set of governance arrangements is needed for disaster risk reduction, poverty reduction and climate change adaptation that is capable of ensuring that risk considerations are factored into all development investments. Improvements to risk reduction governance are critical, in order to provide a vehicle for policy and a systematic approach to planning, financing and monitoring investment in all sectors. In particular, the existing institutional and governance arrangements for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation need to be harmonized, building on existing systems of public administration. The development of a single governance framework for risk reduction would seem to offer opportunities for more effective policy implementation and for avoiding duplication and lack of coordination. The harmonization of international frameworks and requirements for planning and reporting would be supportive of better integration at the country level. The institutional and administrative responsibility for risk reduction has to be vested at the highest possible level in government, in order to have the necessary political authority and resources to influence development policy. If risk reduction can be included explicitly in national development plans and budgets, all parts of government are then able to programme risk reduction actions and investments. Fortunately, many countries are already putting into place innovative mechanisms that enable this mainstreaming and harmonization to occur. These include factoring disaster risk reduction into national development plans and budgets; development of new institutional structures for hazard monitoring and risk assessment that integrate existing scientific and technical institutions; the inclusion of cost\u2013benefit analysis into public investment systems; the involvement of the national audit or controller\u2019s office in supporting implementation, enforcement and", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "399467a8-7be2-4b6e-848c-231f66b760b5": {"__data__": {"id_": "399467a8-7be2-4b6e-848c-231f66b760b5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction \u2013 Risk and poverty in a changing climate", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1078cf086414a4801186e3247ed6abf6c57ff092b45cb9cd76c5a7f6f514c9f8"}, "3": {"node_id": "e3991864-ea86-4f51-a5b3-cf8fae864a50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/2009-global-assessment-report-disaster-risk-reduction-%E2%80%93-risk-and-poverty-changing-climate", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "622a989f0fcb52ba86fa6f67b9156c1557709823fb27a9e6becebf12a790695e"}}, "hash": "a9650fc9883b72eb6f6cfd1bdacbd14fe5c0f7bd89b95ca891c235a1b545ddb9", "text": "accountability in all sectors and at all levels of government; improvements in early warning systems; and the application of innovative mechanisms for risk transfer. 2009 Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 20 Disaster risk reduction is an investment not a cost To seriously address the underlying risk factors on the scale necessary requires major investment. It is difficult to provide an accurate global estimate of this cost but the calculations developed by the Millennium Project serve to give an idea of the magnitude. These costs can be significantly reduced through adopting participatory approaches, but it is clear that several hundred billion dollars are required. This figure is coherent with estimates regarding the cost of climate change adaptation. An increase in the resources available for climate change adaptation will be required, as well as those pledged for the MDGs. In the context of the global economic crisis, investments in infrastructure and employment creation can provide opportunities to address the underlying risk drivers, for example through investments to improve drainage in flood prone areas. Disaster risk reduction is usually conceptualized as an additional cost. In fact one of the principal arguments used to justify a lack of progress in disaster risk reduction is that developing countries have other priorities, such as reducing poverty, and cannot afford the additional costs of disaster risk reduction. The Report puts forward a contrasting view. Investment in disaster risk reduction generally represents a large saving in terms of avoided losses and reconstruction costs and is thus a way of lowering the costs of poverty reduction and of addressing the underlying risk factors. This means that the real cost of addressing the underlying risk drivers is actually lower if disaster risk reduction is included. In conclusion, the key requirements are to help countries strengthen governance arrangements and improve management of investments for addressing the underlying risk factors, and to ensure disaster risk reduction is incorporated into those investments. Without strengthening these arrangements and capacities, even large investments in development may have little tangible effect or be counter-productive. If governance arrangements and capacities for risk reduction can be strengthened, small investments can produce huge benefits. Investing today to strengthen capacities is essential if future generations are to enjoy a safer tomorrow.

The three most recognized and appreciated roles of the Regional Programme and Regional Centres were: provider of technical support to country programmes; knowledge promoter, manager and facilitator, connecting UNDP\u2019s country level experience and organization-wide knowledge in programme planning and implementation; and knowledge leader in advocating, contextualising and applying new ideas in the region. Achieving the MDGs, Advancing the Post-2015 Development Agenda Countries in the region last year engaged in dialogues and took actions to accelerate their MDG achievements. Jointly with UNDP BDP, APRC supported Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia (Java Central), Philippines and Nepal to prepare MDG Action Plans by applying the MDG Acceleration Framework (MAF) methodology. This helped the governments in redirecting MDG acceleration strategies to foster collaboration between ministries to harmonize their programmes and budgets. MDGs Action Plans in Indonesia, which targeted MDG5 achievement on maternal health, and in Cambodia, which focused on its MDG3 achievement, were endorsed by key stakeholders and donor agencies. In Bhutan the findings of the MAF informed the discussions of the National Forum on Employment. In Nepal the government started implementing elements of the MDG Action Plan on sanitation. In response to emerging regional challenges, the 2011/2012 Asia-Pacific Regional MDG Report was launched at a high-level South Asian Forum in India. The Report advocates for accelerated and equitable achievement, particularly of the nutrition and health-related MDG targets. It stimulated high level policy dialogues with inter-ministerial participation, including at an ASEAN multi-sectoral MDG workshop in Myanmar and a series of sub-regional consultations on the Asia-Pacific perspectives for a post-2015 development agenda. To ensure inclusive participation in the Post-2015 development agenda-setting process, UNDP APRC co- organized Parliamentarian and Civil Society Forum on Post-2015 Development Agenda in two sub- regions: Manila (Southeast, East, Northeast, and the Pacific) and Dhaka (South, Southwest, North, and Central Asia). Eighty three members of parliament and 70 civil society representatives from 25 Asia- Pacific countries adopted Declarations recommending the inclusion of democratic governance and human rights principles in the post-2015 framework. The Declarations will be submitted to the High- Level Panel of Eminent Persons on Post-2015 at their meeting in Bali, Indonesia, at the end of March 2013, and will inform the regional and global policy formulation and dialogue. The UN Millennium Campaign, UN Women, UN Population Fund, the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development and the International Parliamentary Union collaborated with UNDP on these Forums. Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Political Participation The inclusiveness of political systems to allow greater gender equality made small but effective gains in Asia in 2012. At the end of 2012, women constituted 18.0 per cent of parliamentarians in Asia, a 0.2 per cent increase from 2011. Recognizing that it will take at least 50 years to reach gender parity in national assemblies if no fast-track institutional reforms are introduced, UNDP took the lead in connecting countries in the region to identify strategies to accelerate women\u2019s political empowerment. A series of sub-regional dialogues in Dhaka, Bangladesh (2011), Manila, Philippines (2011), and Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (2012) galvanized politicians, parliamentarians, and civil society activists to engage in advancing the role of women in politics. APRC developed a policy framework, \u201cGender Equality in Elected Office in Asia-Pacific: Six Actions to Expand Women\u2019s Empowerment\u201d, which highlights six institutional reforms that national authorities could select to develop national action plans for political equality. In recognition that these are national processes, APRC launched the framework in 2012 and invited stakeholders from Mongolia, Thailand, and Viet Nam to apply it in developing their own national action plans. Mongolia and Viet Nam have since started implementation through Parliamentary Steering Committees where durable change is occurring; and with elections in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan and the Maldives in 2013, the roll out of more national action plans would help UNDP\u2019s efforts to reduce political inequality in the region. The number of women elected to Parliament in 2012 elections increased in Timor-Leste and Mongolia by 8.5% and 6% respectively, mostly due to introduction of quotas and changes in the electoral laws.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ba69eb7d-bdf8-42c3-b6df-7ecdb1e52794": {"__data__": {"id_": "ba69eb7d-bdf8-42c3-b6df-7ecdb1e52794", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4bb928c99b5f29d88bc42578f6618635dfadffbe0d95cd5ba57558bad84851da"}, "2": {"node_id": "fc8539ef-68a4-4edc-b9bc-3e83d2dec7fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2dda00f39a4d20e4149b33efc34500cde153859968e52b9413a90f645d108af"}}, "hash": "92ac42ff33e30f6bf964f5f6841855625f77651b3124a962c35c498b038f47d6", "text": "In Papua New Guinea the actual number increase of one woman MP to three, represents a leap forward in terms of attitudes and voting behaviors.

APRC at WORK 15 policy makers from Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Fiji, and Tonga are better able to integrate gender issues in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies and MDG- based national sustainable development strategies. Their improved capacity in this area is a result of their participation in the first regional course on gender responsive economic and policy management, facilitated by APRC. 24 countries took part in two e- discussions on the specific needs of key HIV-affected women and girls and the linkages between HIV and violence against women in the region. These insights and an APRC- led review of these issues, contributed to the call for greater focus and attention to the needs of these groups in ASEAN and SAARC Declarations in 2012. 3 universities in Thailand and the Philippines introduced gender- aware economic course syllabi; Penang state in Malaysia shared its successful gender-responsive budgeting initiative for potential replication in Bhutan. These are some of the results emanating from the APRC \u2013led regional capacity development initiative on gender and macroeconomic issues. Women Building Peace The UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1325 on women, peace and security acknowledged over a decade ago the pivotal role of women in conflict resolution and sustainable peace; UN member states were called upon in 2005 to continue the implementation of the Resolution through development of National Action Plans, while the awareness about translating the international commitment into local agendas for women, peace and security has started gaining momentum only recently. The renewed global focus on women, peace and security and on promoting women as leaders in peace is also reflected in Asia. Nepal and the Philippines, the only two countries in Asia with National Action Plans on UNSCR 1325, are focusing on the implementation of these plans. Indonesia has a final draft National Action Plan, and Afghanistan started a similar process. The N-Peace network, facilitated by APRC and UNDP Country Offices in Afghanistan, Nepal, Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines, connects civil society organizations, women\u2019s organizations and government stakeholders within and across countries to articulate their positions on policy matters, build coalitions to advocate common concerns and foster their skills in conflict prevention, dispute resolution, reconstruction and peace-building. A series of ten national N-Peace advocacy forums helped to increase awareness about the UNSCR 1325 and related national policies in Nepal and Timor-Leste; expanded the role of civil society organizations and women\u2019s organizations in the Philippines and Afghanistan; fostered engagement between civil society and government to discuss policies related to women and peace in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Over 150 women trained as trainers to advocate for peace and security, shared expertise and country experience on policy advocacy and promotion of women in policy making. The Indonesian trainers helped women in Papua to understand the importance of UNSCR 1325 and to work together. The trainers from Nepal and the Philippines plan to advocate for the implementation of their National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 at the local level. In 2012 N-Peace members and national networks nominated 100 women for their contribution to restore and sustain peace in their communities. 55, 000 people supported the social media campaign showcasing the 2012 N-Peace awards winners. Amongst those selected winners is the first male champion of women\u2019s role in peace building. OTHERS about OUR WORK President of the Republic of the Philippines Benigno S.

The Report was launched in 22 countries by political and government leaders.

The Samoan Prime Minister Honorable Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Lupesoliai Malielegaoi, stated that the Report \u201cinformed his Government\u2019s position at the Rio+20 Summit\u201d. In Viet Nam the report provided UNDP with a lens to address the issue of climate change and the topical issue of fossil fuel subsidies in a high level workshop organized with the participation of the National Commission on Climate Change. In Lao PDR it contributed to a joint UNDP-British and Foreign Commonwealth Office-led forum to discuss climate change in the Southeast Asia region. In Pakistan, the Report was presented in conjunction with the launch of the national climate change policy, positioning UNDP\u2019s work on climate change at a strategic level. In Myanmar high level discussions on the Report took place in partnership with the Myanmar Development Resource Institute. It was followed by UNDP convening a forum linking discussions toward the run-up to Rio+20 with development partners in Yangon. In the Maldives the report influenced the preparation of the country\u2019s briefing note on \u201cRio+20 and the Maldives\u201d. The flagship Asia-Pacific Human Development Report (APHDR) is an important regional public good and key advocacy tool for country stakeholders. Since its inception in 2003, APHDR stimulated dialogues within the region, bringing to the fore critical regional issues from a human development perspective. Three reports were produced under the Asia-Pacific Regional Programme (2008-2013): 2008: Tackling Corruption, Transforming Lives: Accelerating Human Development in Asia-Pacific; 2010: Power, Voice and Rights - A Turning Point for Gender Equality for Asia and the Pacific; and 2012: One Planet to Share - Sustaining Human Progress in a Changing Climate. In 2012 an external expert assessment of results of all three reports found that: i)The Asia-Pacific Regional Human Development Reports are widely recognized as distinctive high quality and relevant UNDP regional products that explore human development challenges common to Asia-Pacific; ii) The reports skillfully address complex human development challenges and opportunities common to many if not all countries of such a diverse region; iii) The APHDR team has developed and utilized an excellent participatory model of Reports development, including extensive Asia-Pacific Human Development Network (AP-HDNet) e-discussions and consultations; iv) The APHDRs have positively raised UNDP\u2019s profile at the country or regional level through launches or other advocacy events. Addressing the Challenges of Climate Change Current cost estimates for adapting to climate change are US$50 billion per year for the Asia-Pacific region and for mitigation they are as high as US$15-20 billion in some countries like Indonesia. However, funding from official development assistance (ODA) alone is unlikely to meet the financial demands of developing countries to address climate change adaptation and mitigation. While continuing to seek international climate finance, there is a positive trend in the region, for governments to focus on domestic resources and other ODA flows as a starting point for climate financing and as a foundation for scaling up responses with international assistance. In 2012, five countries - Nepal, Bangladesh, Thailand, Samoa, and Cambodia - completed a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR), which helps countries to review how their own national climate change policy aims are reflected in public expenditures more broadly and how institutions might be adjusted to ensure that financing a response to climate change is delivered in a coherent way across government. The exercise facilitates discussions and engagement of relevant government units on climate change issues in the context of national development planning, budgeting, and expenditures. Through the CPEIR, Nepal, for example, showed the need to channel more funds to local agencies that are better placed to deal with climate challenges, instead of to national authorities.

This methodology is now used by the World Bank and DFID, and applied in Tanzania, Zambia, Honduras, and El Salvador. The reviews led to further innovations including the development of climate related budget codes for tracking climate finance in Nepal, governance reforms to establish government mechanisms for scrutinizing climate expenditures in Thailand, the integration of climate change concerns within local development programming in Bangladesh, and innovative climate financing policies in Cambodia. 127 representatives of ministries of finance, planning and environment from 22 countries from Asia- Pacific, Latin America, Africa and Europe exchanged experiences and lessons to review methodological approaches in implementing CPEIRs and articulating policy and institutional reforms. UNDP APRC facilitated this Governance of Climate Finance workshop jointly with the World Bank, in collaboration with the UK DFID, GIZ, AusAID and USAID. Sustainable Energy for All To support development partners and governments in their commitments to the Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) objectives, APRC launched in January 2012 a flagship publication \u201cTowards an Energy Plus Approach for the Poor: A Review of Good Practices and Lessons Learned from Asia and the Pacific\u201d. The publication contributed to the body of knowledge on expanding access to energy for the poor. It includes an Action Agenda Note and a set of 17 country-case studies from China, Nepal, Fiji Islands, India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Lao PDR, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu and the Philippines. The publication was used in various dialogues and as a programming tool. UNDP support has contributed to 14 governments in the region joining the SE4ALL initiative (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Fiji, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, Samoa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam). Accessing Environment Finance APRC assists Asia-Pacific countries to access financial resources from global environment funds and to combine private, public, grant and loan financing. Financial resources are then used to enhance the capacity of countries to design and implement policies and programmes promoting green, low emission and climate resilient initiatives. UNDP APRC experts and advisors supported 370 projects and interventions valued at more than US$ 480 million in every country in the region. In 2012 APRC based experts played a key role in helping countries from the region secure more than US $170 million in commitments from various global environmental trust funds. APRC at WORK APRC supported awareness raising as well as rapid assessments/gap analyses processes in 5 countries (Bangladesh, Malaysia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam) and 10 country briefs in support of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative. APRC is currently preparing a SE4ALL Regional Assessment based on these reports. UNDP Myanmar incorporated recommendations based on the \u201cEnergy Plus\u201d approach in its scoping study for UNDP programming for Rural Energy and Environmental Conservation 2013- 2015. UNDP India used the \u201cEnergy plus\u201d approach to prepare for GEF submission a project on \u201cScale Up of Access to Clean Energy for Rural Productive and Domestic Uses\u201d. An APRC-produced Public Service Announcement (PSA) on Energy Access, inspired by the flagship report, was aired by CNN International and adapted by the UN Foundation as its own PSA for the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All Global Campaign.

The tsunami warning system for the entire Indian Ocean region, fully functional since 2011, was tested in real life in April 2012 when an 8.7 earthquake struck North Sumatra. The tsunami early warning centers in Indonesia, India, and Australia analyzed the seismic data and disseminated tsunami warning bulletins within minutes leading to large-scale evacuations. The response was a major change from 2004 when none of the countries had any mechanisms in place to issue tsunami warnings and over 230,000 lives were lost. UNDP played a crucial role in establishing and strengthening the tsunami warning system by supporting regional and national technical and policy interventions and institutions to coordinate their response to the tsunami threat.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7fb49c98-7c3a-48bb-9ade-fbd1b80870f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "7fb49c98-7c3a-48bb-9ade-fbd1b80870f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c316e737b34741c069b8c995ab069917a703f1c6d1688109461d864768987546"}, "2": {"node_id": "40190bfc-ec06-4adb-9ccd-9619ce79ef28", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "8613326bfa70c636ff15ff3dbacd627135d6cf8cbe87df64d5226048e72a87f8"}}, "hash": "a219938e90ae5fabdf8c6f405647470a244d6d5f8a223e9ea7e0dca5d00c9e02", "text": "An evaluation in 2012 highlighted UNDP\u2019s significant contributions to the current level of preparedness and resilience of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and other Indian Ocean countries against tsunami and coastal hazards.

APRC at WORK National loss databases are operational in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Iran, Orissa and Tamil Nadu states in India. Cambodia, Myanmar, Vietnam and Lao PDR are establishing databases as a tool to monitor disaster risk and prepare disaster management plans, and as criteria for allocation of funds, based on levels of risks. 75 government officials from Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Timor-Leste were trained and equipped with skills to use disaster loss databases and monitor disaster risks at the sub-national level. 12 government officials each from Cambodia and Timor-Leste better understand the disaster risk assessment process after learning from the experience of Sri Lanka in Risk Assessment and Management for Coastal Hazards. Upholding International Norms and Commitments More than 20 Anti-Corruption Agencies (ACAs) were established in the Asia-Pacific region since the early 1990s. In many countries, these institutions failed to meet people\u2019s expectations, and in particular, failed to investigate grand political corruption. However, Asia also hosts some of the most renowned anti-corruption agencies in the world including that in Singapore, Hong Kong, and Indonesia. UNDP APRC took the lead in promoting the success of ACAs in the region as a model. Based on a series of comparative studies of the institutional arrangements and conditions for their success, new norms to hold ACAs accountable and core principles to safeguard their integrity and independence from outside interference were drafted by UNDP APRC specialists. These were subsequently fine-tuned and adopted by over 30 anticorruption agencies at the International Conference on Principles for ACAs in Jakarta in November 2012. The Conference, convened by the Indonesia\u2019s Corruption Eradication Commission, UNDP and UNODC, became the first international forum to adopt guiding principles for the independence and effectiveness of ACAs. UNDP is now supporting the dissemination of the \u201cJakarta Principles,\u201d which were already used in policy discussions on new legislation in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Somaliland. The Principles will be submitted to the Conference of the States Parties to the UN Convention against Corruption in September 2013 in Panama for further political support by governments around the world. Indigenous peoples (IPs) and ethnic minorities are increasingly gaining recognition as key stakeholders in national and international processes and policies; they are integrally involved in UN REDD+ programmes and related national policies and in the Rio+20 process and climate change-related negotiations. To promote inclusive dialogues on critical issues around the needs and rights of indigenous peoples in the region, UNDP/APRC and OHCHR, under the UN Indigenous People\u2019s Partnership, supported the regional preparatory meeting of the World Council of IPs. The forum adopted the Asia Declaration that identifies key recommendations, which can be used as reference for post-2015 and human rights dialogues. At the country level, APRC organized high-level dialogues in the Philippines and Indonesia on IP issues resulting in positive policy changes. Indonesia has included masyarakat adat in the development of the National REDD+ strategy and drafted related legislative and policy measures. Significant global and regional developments in the human rights-based response to HIV took place in 2012 due in part to on-going advocacy efforts through inter-governmental processes and national commitments. Taking the opportunity of a stronger engagement of governments in the region to address the legal barriers to HIV responses, and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against key affected populations, APRC increased the body of knowledge of HIV related laws and strengthened the capacity of key stakeholders to advocate for legal reform. This result was achieved through the launch and effective dissemination of two key pieces of work on human rights and the law, Sex Work and the Law and Lost in Transition. Both publications received extensive coverage by first tier media outlets including AFP, Xinhua, The Washington Times, and Voice of America, and the medical journal Lancet, the world\u2019s foremost leader in the field of public health. APRC worked with regional bodies, a group of countries and CSOs to disseminate strategic knowledge and advance policies on HIV and the law. The draft AP Regional Programme evaluation, commissioned by the Evaluation Office, concluded that the Regional Programme made significant contributions toward research and awareness-raising on new dimensions and issues on HIV, human rights, and sexual identity and that it led to some important actions at the international and national levels.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "766c7aa6-21e2-4fce-96b5-2d6554483e29": {"__data__": {"id_": "766c7aa6-21e2-4fce-96b5-2d6554483e29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b55c0d9272ff2a2076adc867ed55dc392ba4f354154411bdb01d02628ba50203"}, "2": {"node_id": "91e163b5-ec9c-4cd9-aecc-6299531fe93b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16203b76e5a5545653332d90d6cdbeeb3812aba2404749b2684f850dd6de7c7c"}}, "hash": "1d6354830c8fd6f30cd5a5ab7d7b8362dbcb62349a820f1abbb623f947402946", "text": "\u201cBreaking the Silos\u201d: APRC Teams Working across Thematic Areas APRC\u2019s initiative on Management of Natural Resources for Equity and Sustainability, established following up to the 2011 global conference on Managing Extractive Industries for Human Development, kicked off with an e-discussion on extractive industries, which attracted nearly 400 participants and featured 59 contributions from all over the world over the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "555a5bdb-47a4-4778-9c0b-957bc790f5f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "555a5bdb-47a4-4778-9c0b-957bc790f5f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "de1aecc07aacb8a87691a413733aa0149aae9a2d08659382f11d546febd3087a"}}, "hash": "de1aecc07aacb8a87691a413733aa0149aae9a2d08659382f11d546febd3087a", "text": "course of seven weeks. The cross-thematic approach allowed a strong integration of environment, governance and poverty reduction perspectives on this issue, which informed programming in (amongst other) Mongolia and Timor-Leste. UNDP Country Offices in Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, with technical support from APRC, assisted their governments to promote extractive industries for sustainable human development. International Organizations (e.g. ADB) and think tanks (e.g. Centre for Social Responsibility in Mining, the University of Queensland) approached APRC to explore working together in this subject. An APRC team of governance and HIV and health specialists and UNDP Country Offices supported the capacity of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) in six countries to address sexual orientation and sexual identity (SOGI) human rights issues by facilitating meetings between civil society groups and human rights commissioners and the production of capacity assessment reports in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Philippines and Sri Lanka. As a result of this engagement process and technical support from UNDP, a section on SOGI people was included for the first time in the Bangladesh Universal Periodic Review (UPR) submitted on 9 October 2012. The APRC team of specialists, working across a range of thematic areas, assisted UNDP Maldives Country Office in developing a three year programme for \u2018Strengthening Democratic Governance in Maldives\u2019. Governance and crisis prevention experts helped convert the Transition Programme in Sri Lanka to a peace time Local Governance Programme. Both countries started programmes that are focused on strengthening governance in post conflict scenarios. Poverty and HIV and health specialists jointly with the UNDP Country Offices supported Indonesia and Cambodia to develop their social protection programmes and to include specific provisions for the vulnerable groups and populations. As a result, in partnership with the government of Indonesia the UNDP Country Office initiated a HIV-sensitive social protection project, a first step toward the country\u2019s future engagement in social protection. In Cambodia, the cross-thematic team contributed to the development of a monitoring framework for the National Social Protection Strategy. Highlights of Capacity Development Initiatives Access to affordable medicines has direct linkages to long-term socio- economic impacts. Several countries are now taking steps to protect their rights to affordable medicines, which are increasingly threatened by growing intellectual property regimes. APRC\u2019s work to provide support and build the capacity of UNDP Country Offices on intellectual property rights, TRIPs, and access to affordable medicines resulted in concrete policy advancements. A regional meeting convened by APRC resulted in the organization of the first national consultation on the subject in Myanmar with strong support from the UNDP Country Office. This event generated specific recommendations to the government to help draft the country\u2019s first intellectual property rights law. Indonesia plans to organize the first national consultation on the subject as a result of a UNDP-supported roundtable in the country. Cambodia and the Philippines have also started similar initiatives. It is worth noting that none of these UNDP Country Offices had ever worked on this issue prior to 2012; APRC\u2019s assistance contributed to strengthening their knowledge, skills, and confidence to support the national effort on this particular issue. In 2012 APRC has been helping ministries of environment and natural resources in several countries to design and implement climate change adaptation plans and programmes. A key capacity gap in partner countries is at the local government level while at the same time it is here that the most needs exist in helping to address the challenges of climate change. Capacities were strengthened specifically with regard to accessing and combining climate finance at national level, as well as designing ways to channel those resources to local levels. Specific examples include Lao PDR, Timor-Leste and Cambodia where adaptation funds are being programmed in ways that will use and strengthen existing inter-governmental cash transfer systems. In addition, the APRC team explored relevant experience from across the region on local level climate finance. A case study based on the Andhra Pradesh experiences in the roll out of state-level climate change strategies in India was shared widely through the global outreach site of the Adaptation Learning Mechanism. APRC facilitated South-South Cooperation Exchanges Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Thailand, Lao PDR, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines shared country experiences in making their economies greener and responsive to environment, poverty and climate concerns. Their South- South learning exchanges will continue thanks to their participation in the UNDP/UNEP Poverty and Environment initiative that supports country-led efforts to integrate poverty and environment in development planning. Thailand shared its experience on HIV in the context of the Thai universal health coverage scheme with Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and the Philippines.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) of Bhutan hosted a study tour for the ACCs from Timor-Leste and the Maldives.

A High Level Seminar on Climate Change South-South Cooperation at COP18 in Doha, organized by China with support from UNDP China and APRC, brought together government officials and legislators from Bangladesh, Maldives, Grenada, and Ethiopia. 10 municipal government representatives from 7 countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) produced innovative cross- sector vulnerability assessments and inclusive urban action plans to climate change based on 2012 APHDR analysis. Growing Sustainable Knowledge Communities Regional Communities of Practice and networks continue to be the mainstay of APRC\u2019s knowledge sharing approach. In response to demand from Country Offices and development partners, APRC launched two new communities of practice in 2012. Ten thematic communities of practice connecting nearly 4000 members are facilitated by APRC. The Community of Practice on Climate Finance was established to generate and share knowledge on the design and management of climate funds. An e-discussion on this topic triggered responses from over 250 governmental, academic and civil society experts. The examples of good practices were captured in two products: a comparative paper National Climate Funds: Learning from the experience of Asia-Pacific and a set of seven case studies with lessons from Bhutan, Lao PDR, China, Micronesia, Tuvalu, Thailand, and Cambodia. At a regional clinic, 60 managers of well-established and soon-to be established climate funds learned from each other\u2019s expectations and experiences. Virtual learning platform and twinning arrangement between successful funds and future funds are the community\u2019s next steps. Countries in Asia-Pacific will have more opportunities to access significant volumes of national and international public and private climate finance. This Community of Practice is helping its members to design appropriate institutional and financial mechanisms to receive and utilize the climate finance resources effectively. The Community of Practice on Women\u2019s Political Participation and Leadership in Asia-Pacific was created in response to the pressing concern of women\u2019s chronic under-representation in political institutions across the region. The launch of a policy framework Six Actions to Expand Women\u2019s Empowerment took place in the lead-up to start this important Community of Practice. As a first activity, APRC facilitated an e-discussion on the status and prospects for women in political and decision-making positions in Asia-Pacific. 45 contributions from more than 18 countries from Asia-Pacific and other regions highlighted challenges to women\u2019s political participation and leadership at national and sub- national levels and necessary steps advance women\u2019s engagement in political life. The UN Solution Exchange facilitation service, supported by APRC, assisted in the establishment of the first two communities on Municipal Governance and Development and Sustainable Resource Management in Afghanistan. These communities innovatively use email and mobile phones to ensure increased access for members. At the end of 2012, 20 Solution Exchange communities in six countries (India, Bhutan, Pacific region, Russia, Bangladesh, Afghanistan) connect over 29, 000 members. APRC Services in Support to UNDP Country Offices In 2012, the Asia-Pacific Regional Centre responded to 702 requests for support from all 24 UNDP Country Offices in the region through a combined service time of 4,396 person-days. The total service time has increased year on year by 20 per cent from 3,671 person-days in 2011. Most requests for support were for technical advice - 44 per cent of total service time, followed by support to programming and project formulation - 16 per cent, and policy advice - 13 per cent. China, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Samoa Country Offices increased the number of their requests for support from APRC compared to 2011. The top three requesting Country Offices were Myanmar (61 requests), Indonesia (58) and Bhutan (55), and the least requesting Country Offices were DPRK (4), Iran and Samoa (14 requests each). Only 2 per cent of respondents thought the support received did not create an impact on the Country Office\u2019s work. In 2012, Myanmar was a priority country for the provision of APRC support for the formulation of the new Country Program Document (CPD) and the new level of UNDP engagement in the country.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b173d3b-e32b-4ce2-a950-e46616ca6bb8": {"__data__": {"id_": "1b173d3b-e32b-4ce2-a950-e46616ca6bb8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Asia-Pacific Regional Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b6dbb77811e1bb6988c2e34056c105ac144a84809ebdbefa1aabe070d52e46ee"}, "2": {"node_id": "eb5e2e17-211e-4c63-856d-012130475c62", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/asia-pacific-regional-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "93fb2573ccae4062b337118c8d930ff9b62210acd0344a3003442681b5f3f2f6"}}, "hash": "dcc88994b00a3481c7df51bce6c6aae1eb84bdbdd47345604344b85a57fb670e", "text": "The comprehensive advisory and technical support package consisted of support in all substantive areas/pillars of the new CPD (Democratic Governance, Disaster Risk Reduction, Environment, and Poverty Reduction) and ranged from early diagnostics, scoping, and identification of programming strategies, to dialogue with development partners and subsequent preparation of the programmatic interventions.

The audit covered the activities of the Centre for the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 May 2012. During the period reviewed, the Centre recorded programme and management expenditures totaling $37 million. OAI assessed the Regional Centre as satisfactory, which means \u201cInternal controls, governance and risk management processes were adequately established and functioning well.

APRC, as a focal point on behalf of UNDP (the co-convening agency together with WHO), for the preparation of the common Country Programme Document and One Programme in Bhutan, provided quality assurance support and facilitated tailored trainings as requested by the UN Country Team. The member agencies of the UNDG (A-P) continued developing thematic background papers on emerging issues in the Asia-Pacific region. APRC co-led and shaped the focus and messages of the social protection issue brief, which was published and shared with UN Country Teams in 2012. The recently established UNDG (A-P) thematic working group on urbanization is chaired by UN Habitat and co-chaired by UNDP/APRC. APRC conducted comprehensive Results Based Management, monitoring and evaluation and project management trainings to Maldives, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Thailand Country Offices. Altogether 100 people participated and overall 100 per cent satisfaction rating was received for all four trainings. APRC organized, co-designed and co-facilitated the regional training on the \u2018Practical Monitoring and Data Collection Methods\u2019. 26 participants from 12 Country Offices took part in this training. 2012 Financial Results in a Snapshot The figure and the graph above show the breakdown of expenditures by practice for APRC Bangkok and Suva. The total expenditures for both amount to US $ 19, 896,766. The financial support from our partners to UNDP regional projects and initiatives, implemented by APRC - Bangkok and the Pacific Centre-Suva, amounts to US$ 11,990,599 in 2012; in the period 2008-2012 the 14 regional and sub-regional projects under the Asia-Pacific Regional Programme attracted cost-sharing contributions from development partners totaling US$ 31,532,950. Top donor countries in 2012 were Australia, Sweden, South Korea and US, as well as the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM).

Disclaimer: UNDP has been participating in the Paris Declaration Monitoring Survey as part of the United Nations Country Teams in the countries participating in the survey. While the OECD DAC only uses and pub- lishes aggregated data on United Nations performance, UN DOCO has in 2011 collected disaggregated data per participating agency, on the basis of information provided by UNCT Focal Points in participating countries. Despite the best efforts of the United Nations development system to cross-check and compile the latest datasets as submitted to national coordinators for submission to the OECD DAC, some discrepancies remain between the disaggregated data collected by DOCO and the final OECD DAC dataset on UN performance. ExECuTIVE SuMMARy 2 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness ExEcUtIvE SUMMARy The 2000 Millennium Declaration and the 2002 Monterrey Consensus, along with related commitments, are underpinned by the recognition that a global partnership and the quality and effectiveness of development cooperation are critical to achieving internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The United Nations welcomes efforts and initiatives to enhance the quality of aid and increase its impact, such as Paris Declaration (PD) on Aid Effectiveness. The key principle of the Paris Decla- ration \u2013 national ownership and leadership of a country\u2019s development, including the coordination of all types of external assistance \u2013 has always guided the United Nations system\u2019s operational activities for development. Working on the ground in 176 countries and territories, UNDP maintains the most extensive field-based opera- tional platform in the multilateral system to deliver on the MDGs and other internationally agreed development goals as well as to share development best practices and solutions among countries globally. At programme country level, UNDP plays a dual role, both as a development partner and as manager of the Resident Coordi- nator (RC) system, as mandated by the UN General Assembly. The United Nations participated jointly in the 2006, 2008 and indeed the 2011 PD Surveys, the last of which was carried out in a record 78 countries. Seventy-seven United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) participated in the 2011 PD Survey, 34 of which had already participated in the 2006 Baseline Survey. For each survey, UN agen- cies at country level provided their responses to UNCT focal points who submitted aggregated UN responses to the national survey coordinators and the donor focal point. This was done to enable the OECD to prepare a consolidated UN PD Survey response by aggregating the UNCT reports from each country. In 2011, UNCT focal points have additionally submitted all individual agencies\u2019 responses to the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to enable the disaggregation of global figures by agency.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac4f8e4f-d1c0-4e8e-ab46-95f73bc099ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac4f8e4f-d1c0-4e8e-ab46-95f73bc099ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/implementing-paris-declaration-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Implementing the Paris Declaration in Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/implementing-paris-declaration-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "b194bdd701ccf1fd60bf4e541b4cfc34b8e2d2feecb9d80c21190fd7c5a8f2b6"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab9c22e7-d1ef-45ee-b268-a6217e2427fd", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/implementing-paris-declaration-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "05ceceb7997e620484034413a88ea7ed1f68b4d403a2fe645cd684ff46ef1202"}}, "hash": "b23a5fb27a5fb1b1e5b833807b959952c41be9366b18f94d854de57b4de0c5ae", "text": "fIGURE 1: At A GlANcE \u2013 UNDP\u2019S PERfoRMANcE AGAINSt PARIS DEclARAtIoN INDIcAtoRS AND tARGEtS, 2010 0% Baseline Countries 3: Aligned aid flows 4: Coordinated support 5a: Use of PFM systems 5b: Use of procurement systems 7: Aid predictability 9: Common arrangements 10a: Joint missions 10b: Joint analytic work All Countries 2010 Target 20% 40% 60% 80% Notes: Of the 74 UNDP country offices that participated in the 2011 Survey, and for which disaggregated figures are available, 50 participated in the 2008 Survey and 30 participated in the 2006 Survey (see annex 1).

In 2011, in addition to a complementary UNDG report on implementing the Paris Declaration, UNDP and several other UNDG members have also been preparing individual agency reports, which globally consoli- date the 2010 results reported by agencies at country level. Given that no disaggregated data is available on UNDP performance in 2005 or 2007, there is no baseline on the basis of which UNDP could establish relative targets. While it is therefore not possible to measure progress between 2005 and 2010, the existing disaggre- gated figures on UNDP\u2019s performance nevertheless provide a useful indication of how UNDP is faring in 2010. With the exception of using country systems where further progress is needed, UNDP is faring well overall in reaching the 2010 Paris Declaration targets on effective aid. Slow progress on UNDP\u2019s use of country systems mirrors the slow progress of most donors in increasing the use of country systems. Equally, UNDP\u2019s implementa- tion of a number of Paris Declaration principles, like use of country systems and direct budget support, hinges on the decisions of its Executive Board, particularly those relating to internal rules and procedures, transparency and disclosure policy. On the other hand, UNDP has made great strides toward aligning aid flows with national priorities and improving the predictability of its assistance. While further efforts on harmonizing its support are needed, ongoing improvements to United Nations and UNDP programming and system-wide coherence are apparently already facilitating improvements in this area. Photo Credits: Giacomo Pirozzi/UNPD Burkina INTRODuCTION 4 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness INtRoDUctIoN In the spirit of the United Nations system\u2019s current effort to become more coherent,1 the United Nations Country Teams (UNCTs) have participated jointly in all three PD monitoring surveys. The United Nations Development Group (UNDG) also agreed on an action plan for the implementation of the Paris Declaration in 2005 and con- ducted a joint evaluation of the UNDG contribution to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness in 2008.2 The present paper provides that analysis and offers full transparency and accountability on UNDP\u2019s performance globally. The figures provide a summary overview of UNDP\u2019s performance in 2010 in meeting the targets agreed in Paris in 2005. It illustrates UNDP\u2019s results for each of the eight indicators that measure donor performance (PD indicators 3 to 10) - with the exceptions of indicator 8 on untied aid, which does not apply to UNDP, and indicator 6 on parallel implementation structures, which uses absolute figures and will therefore be discussed in further detail later on. UNDP\u2019s engagement on capacity development and strengthening ownership UNDP\u2019s involvement in the Paris Declaration process is two-pronged: 1) to engage on development coop- eration issues, specifically the quality of aid, within the context of the achievement of the MDGs and other internationally agreed goals important for and related to the overall positions and activities of UNDP and the United Nations; and 2) to support developing countries\u2019 implementation of the aid effectiveness commitments and to facilitate their participation in global fora, such as the OECD DAC Working Party on Aid Effectiveness and the OECD DAC International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding.3 In over 80 countries and territories, UNDP is strongly supporting programme countries to strengthen their capacities to effectively coordinate and evaluate the impact of external development assistance in line with national development plans and priorities.4 Based on the principle that national governments hold primary responsibility for their countries\u2019 development and for coordinating all types of external assistance, UNDP\u2019s support to programme countries is geared towards strengthening their capacities to do so effectively and effi- ciently and to assume ownership and leadership over this process. UNDP\u2019s contribution to human development rests on its cross-cutting development mandate and on its role as an impartial multilateral partner offering universal presence.

INTRODuCTION 5 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness peacekeeping and security sector support, as well as innovative sources of funding and instruments, such as remittances.5 UNDP works closely with security sector actors and peacekeepers in joint programmes in post- conflict situations. UNDP is supporting developing countries to engage more effectively with issues \u2018beyond aid\u2019 not only by put- ting in place appropriate policies and institutions that are specific to their particular development trajectories and national contexts, but also by focusing on internal capacities to implement their development priorities. Indeed, capacity development is at the heart of what UNDP does. UNDP provides specialized support to part- ner countries to build resilient and stable institutions, strengthen country systems and promote the catalytic use of ODA to enable the highest return on development aid across sectors and thematic areas. In this way, UNDP\u2019s national capacity development support enriches and maximizes the impact of all partners\u2019 develop- ment activities at country level. In order to improve coherence within the United Nations system and to improve overall effectiveness of assessment and programming in line with national priorities, UNDP has introduced numerous changes to its programme and operations policies and procedures in the past few years. They include improvements in procurement and human resources processes, as well as streamlined and optimized structures and pro- cesses aimed at removing duplication and aligning responsibilities across units for more effective delivery and responsiveness to partner counties. Fast-track procedures are available to national governments as needed, especially when responding to emergencies and ongoing crises, thereby allowing UNDP to accelerate deliv- ery in challenging circumstances. In addition, an internal programme and project management task force is currently working to overhaul UNDP\u2019s systems, tools and procedures by the end of 2011 to enable a more forward-looking and flexible programme and project management approach at country level. UNDP\u2019s support to the Resident coordinator (Rc) system UNDP chairs the UN Development Group (UNDG) and leads the United Nations at country level through the Resident Coordinator (RC) system. In all countries, the UNDP Resident Representative is also the UN RC and often also the Humanitarian Coordinator and is funded from UNDP\u2019s regular (core) resources. In many countries, especially in post-conflict settings, the UN RC is called upon to assume a lead role in coordination fora between the government and its development partners. Through administering most of the United Nations multi-donor trust funds, UNDP also provides a one-stop service to the donor community for UN system-wide contributions and engagements. These functions have a direct role in driving the effectiveness of the UN system at country level. UNDP is the only agency applying its regular resources to this vital function. UNDP has been a key motor to enable progress in the UN development system\u2019s efforts to achieve greater coherence and effectiveness. This has been most visible through the eight \u2018Delivering as One\u2019 country pilots that were launched by governments, with the UN, in January 2007,6 as well as in several countries that volun- tarily adopted the \u2018Delivering as One\u2019 model at a later stage (referred to as \u2018One UN self-starter\u2019 countries). The mid-term review of UNDP coordination commitments reveals some essential lessons and key results.

UNDP is supporting countries to achieve development gains that require integrated and coordinated responses among many partners. The draft country programmes presented to the Executive Board in 2011 demonstrate how UNDP is leading and participating in integrated United Nations responses to nationally defined priorities. UNDP, as chair of the UNDG, is also leading efforts to revise and roll out the guidelines for developing and imple- menting a United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), the strategic programme framework that describes the collective response of the UN system to national development priorities. UNDP is an observer at the OECD DAC and participates in the Working Party on Aid Effectiveness, where it also represents the UNDG, and is leading the UNDG\u2019s preparations for the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effective- ness. UNDP also co-chairs the OECD DAC International Network on Conflict and Fragility (INCAF) and supports governments in the roll-out of the fragile states principles and survey. UNDP has been an important partner in the shaping of the Paris and Accra outcomes and has consistently brought the voice of developing countries into the debate, including by managing two global multi-donor basket funds that facilitate developing country participation in meetings related to the OECD DAC Working Party on Aid Effectiveness and the International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding. UNDP has also supported the organization of the consultative, national, sub regional and regional processes for developing countries that preceded the Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Accra and continues to do so in the preparations for the High Level Forum in Busan. In several instances, such support has led to the creation of regional development effectiveness platforms, such as the Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness (CDDE) Facility in the Asia-Pacific region and African Platform for Development Effectiveness.7 In the run-up to the 2011 Survey on Monitoring the Paris Declaration, UNDP and the OECD have organized a series of regional workshops that aimed to ensure that key actors involved in the management of the PD moni- toring survey and other related processes \u2013 including the 2011 Fragile States Survey and the UNDP/UN DESA Development Cooperation Forum Survey on Mutual Accountability \u2013 are briefed on the objectives, process and technical aspects of the 2011 surveys.8 Furthermore, UNDP has led the partner country outreach efforts within the voluntary International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI), which was established in 2008 in Accra to improve the quality, timeliness and comparability of aid information available to partner countries, civil society organizations, citizens and other stakeholders. UNDP organized regional consultations in 2009 on IATI with the participation of more than 72 countries and has since facilitated the engagement of partner countries in the development and, as of 2011, implementation of the standard. UNDP is a member of the IATI Secretariat, along with DFID and Development Initiatives Poverty Research, and is planning to implement the aid transparency standard in a phased and cost- effective manner with the publication of an initial dataset in time for HLF 4. 7 With support from UNDP, the African Development Bank, the NEPAD Secretariat and a number of African countries have established the African Platform for Development Effectiveness. The Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness (CDDE) Facility, for which the Asian Development Bank and UNDP\u2019s Asia-Pacific Regional Centre serve as the Secretariat, is a partnership between ADB, the Governments of Japan and the Republic of Korea, and UNDP. The initiative is governed by a Steering Committee that includes partner country government, civil society and parliamentary representatives, as well as donors. 8 The workshops brought together government and donor focal points from partner countries, as well as civil society representatives and several parliamentarians. Besides offering technical training on the PD Survey methodology, the workshops also aimed at strengthening regional communities of practice, providing a platform for exchange of experience and best practices around the Paris Declaration process and collecting partner country views and concerns to take to the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness.

This was done to enable the OECD to prepare a consolidated UN PD Survey response by aggregating the UNCT reports from each country. In 2011, UNCT focal points have addi- tionally submitted all individual agencies\u2019 responses to the UN Development Operations Coordination Office (DOCO) to enable the disaggregation of global figures by agency. The UNDG is preparing one joint UNDG Paris Declaration Survey response, which allows continuity with the earlier years and is consistent with the spirit of the United Nations reform agenda and system-wide coherence. In 2011, in addition to a complementary UNDG report on implementing the Paris Declaration, UNDP and sev- eral other UNDG members are also preparing individual agency reports, which globally consolidate the results reported by agency at country level. The present paper provides that analysis and offers full transparency and accountability on UNDP\u2019s perfor- mance globally. The figure below provides a summary overview of UNDP\u2019s performance in 2010 in meeting the targets agreed in Paris in 2005. It illustrates UNDP\u2019s results for each of the eight indicators that measure donor performance (PD indicators 3 to 10) - with the exceptions of indicator 8 on untied aid, which does not apply to UNDP, and indicator 6 on parallel implementation structures, which uses absolute figures and will therefore be discussed in further detail later on. Given that no disaggregated data is available on UNDP performance in 2005 or 2007, there is no baseline on the basis of which UNDP could establish relative targets. While it is there- fore not possible to measure progress between 2005 and 2010, the existing disaggregated figures on UNDP\u2019s performance nevertheless provide a useful indication of how UNDP is faring in 2010. The following sections provide a more detailed analysis of UNDP\u2019s performance vis-\u00e0-vis all 12 indicators, including the country indica- tors that are not included in the PD survey donor questionnaire. Photo Credits: Riham Mustafa/UNDP GLObAL RESuLTS 8 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness ownership UNDP\u2019s engagement at country level rests on a very inclusive concept of ownership, mandated by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Its programming instruments are guided by the notion that ownership is relevant not only at the strategic level of development planning, but also at each stage of planning, imple- mentation, monitoring and evaluation. All of UNDP\u2019s programming instruments \u2013 from the UNDAF to UNDP\u2019s Country Programme Documents to Country Programme Action Plans to individual project documents and annual work plans \u2013 require the active participation of multiple stakeholders, most importantly national coun- terparts, and are flexible to align with national planning cycles. Regular project board meetings under the leadership of the respective national counterpart are mandatory and require the presence of the principal beneficiary in all major decisions. From this perspective, the PD indicators do not fully capture the key elements of promoting inclusive ownership and leadership for development cooperation. The PD Survey\u2019s indicator 1 on operational development strategies does not evaluate who have been the key partners to support governments in developing such strategies. UNDP is playing a critical role in assist- ing developing countries to expand their options for designing national development plans and policies to advance their human development, strengthen their human and institutional capacities for implementing such plans and policies, and mobilize new and additional sources of development finance, including domestic resource mobilization. 0% Baseline Countries 3: Aligned aid flows 31% 71% 35% 15% 36% 79% 56% 57% 46% 73% 24% 13% 30% 53% 42% 59% 66% 40% 66% 85% 50% 4: Coordinated support 5a: Use of PFM systems 5b: Use of procurement systems 7: Aid predictability 9: Common arrangements 10a: Joint missions 10b: Joint analytic work All Countries 2010 Target 20% 10% 30% 40% 60% 80% 70% 50% fIGURE 2: UNDP\u2019S PERfoRMANcE AGAINSt PARIS DEclARAtIoN INDIcAtoRS AND tARGEtS, 2010 Notes: Of the 74 UNDP country offices that participated in the 2011 Survey, and for which disaggregated figures are available, 50 participated in the 2008 Survey and 30 participated in the 2006 Survey (see Annex 1).

This support is also acknowledged in UNDP\u2019s 2009 Partners Survey, where more than 80 percent of partners globally rated UNDP as a critical partner in effectively contributing to achiev- ing international development goals, including the MDGs.11 Alignment UNDP has been a strong advocate for the use of national systems and transition away from parallel project implementation units (PIUs) towards a more integrated and sustainable approach. With capacity development as its core mandate, UNDP has facilitated the increased use of country systems in many countries, helping to improve indicator 2 on reliable country systems. UNDP has, for example, supported governments in orga- nizing joint diagnostic exercises of their public financial management and procurement systems, such as the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments.12 UNDP has also played a pivotal role in elaborating the Methodology for Assessment of National Procurement Systems, which has emerged from the work of the OECD-DAC Joint Venture on Procurement since 2005 and has been piloted in 22 countries.13 A dedicated team within UNDP is devoted to strengthening the capacity of country systems in procurement, project management, human resource management and financial management. UNDP hosts the United Nations Procurement Capacity Development Centre, a unique web platform designed to strengthen country systems used by national stakeholders and development partners.14 Since the United Nations participates jointly at country level, governments have not systematically reported budget estimates of individual agencies\u2019 aid flows. These figures are necessary to calculate the PD indicator 3 on aligning aid flows with national priorities. Information on disaggregated aid on budget for UNDP has only been made available in 13 countries.15 The resulting average country ratio is 46 percent (see Annex 3 on indicator 3), against a 2010 target of 85 percent. While there is room for improvement for UNDP\u2019s performance, some developing countries have rightly pointed out that PD indicator 3 is flawed as a measure of alignment (see example in Box 1). It is difficult to draw global conclusions from a compilation of quantitative indicators 9 UNDP, Mid-term review of the UNDP strategic plan and annual report for 2010, DP/2011/22. 10 UNDG, MDG Acceleration Framework, February 2011.

The results of the 2010 PD Survey for indicator 4 on coordinated technical cooperation show that 73 percent of UNDP technical cooperation is coordinated (see Annex 3 on indicator 4), surpassing the global 2010 target of 50 percent of technical cooperation being coordinated for capacity development. If measured according to the OECD DAC definitions for indicator 5a on using country public financial man- agement systems, 24 percent of UNDP\u2019s assistance for government sectors used country public financial management systems in 2010 (see Annex 3 on indicator 5a). Figure 3 also shows that there are differences between the use of different components of public financial management systems. While these results reflect the aggregate figures of validated data at country level, they should be interpreted cautiously. Differences across countries may be attributable to different understandings of OECD DAC definitions with regard to public financial management procedures. Bound by UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules approved by its Executive Board, UNDP usually does not disburse directly to the treasury of the country in question and requires financial reporting and auditing on the basis of UNDP\u2019s chart of accounts.16 The only exception is UNDP\u2019s direct sector budget support, which has been approved for piloting by the Executive Board in 2008.17 Prior to this decision, UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules did not allow for financial contributions to direct budget support and pooled funds. The 2008 Executive Board decisions enable UNDP in exceptional circumstances to provide a limited financial contribution to a sector budget support fund if so requested by the programme government. When reviewing proposed changes to the financial regulations and rules, the members of UNDP\u2019s Executive Board have always been very concerned about ensuring acceptable levels of controls, as well as separation of duties. These controls limit UNDP\u2019s ability to fully conform to OECD DAC criteria for using country public financial management systems. 16 See UNDP Financial Regulations and Rules, 1 March 2005 (as per Executive Board decision 2005/1). A comprehensive revision of the UNDP financial regulations was carried out during 2004 (Revision of UNDP financial regulations (DP/2005/3) and related decision (2005/1). 17 In its June 2008 session, the Executive Board endorsed the necessary amendments to the Financial Regulations to enable financial contributions to sector budget support and pooled funds (DP/2008/36 and DP/2008/53). GLObAL RESuLTS 11 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness UNDP also falls short of the 2010 target for indicator 5b on using country procurement systems. While only 13 percent of UNDP\u2019s assistance for government sectors uses country procurement systems (see Annex 3 on indicator 5b), which might seem surprisingly low, UNDP\u2019s rules and regulations do not prevent the use of country procurement systems. Indeed, UNDP\u2019s corporate Guidance and Procedures for National Implementation of UNDP-supported Projects are intended to strengthen national capacities, making government institu- tions, as implementing partners, responsible for the technical and administrative implementation of a development coop- eration project with UNDP.18 Government regulations, rules and procedures therefore apply to project implementation only if they do not contravene the principles of the Financial Regulations and Rules of UNDP. The compliance with the principles of the Financial Regulations and Rules approved by UNDP\u2019s Executive Board is assessed during the evaluation of the implementing partner\u2019s capacity. However, governments often request UNDP\u2019s procurement support services, even when a government institution\u2019s capacity for project implementation, including procurement, is deemed sufficient. Beyond its corporate guidance and procedures for national implementation of UNDP-supported projects, UNDP was instrumental in developing and applying the Harmonized Approach to Cash Transfers (HACT) in coordination with the other UN agencies, which provides standardized approaches to manage the risks of working with national governments with the aim of increasing national implementation of UN projects and to ensure that funds are used as efficiently as possible.19 UNDP has further developed guidelines on how to assess risks and select the programme implementation modality that best suits the risks of working with national gov- ernment partners.20 The guidance clarifies the respective accountabilities of national governments and UNDP, applies a risk-based framework to establish the programme, and provides for assurance activities based upon risk, including independent external audits.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bd634564-dd4d-407d-9955-28e5d243625c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bd634564-dd4d-407d-9955-28e5d243625c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/implementing-paris-declaration-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Implementing the Paris Declaration in Aid Effectiveness", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/implementing-paris-declaration-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "83a2d0d9bc1ef7f90ad8367fe5cb0055cceba0bd8722ae78c54dda221d4eee43"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5430bdc-1717-49f4-80cf-64f47b762df3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/implementing-paris-declaration-aid-effectiveness", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ce3153291a77d9d5becb3fffb8450f0bc8451b1ad02854dcc867da3df6b7e3a3"}}, "hash": "2018fb5fa561413608d3c3d9233a4fe5e0cd2eee008a4e870881d85e40971b45", "text": "By instituting these reforms, UNDP has made its own interventions more efficient and effective while respecting the limitations imposed by conscientious risk management as required by its Executive Board.

While these figures might appear high, the number of parallel PIUs of the United Nations, and UNDP in particular, cannot be compared with that of bilateral donors. UNDP plays a crucial and necessary role in managing donor funds on behalf of governments in situations of conflict and fragility, where bilateral donors frequently solicit UNDP to establish parallel PIUs to reduce fiduciary risk during transition periods. Bilateral partners often have concerns that public financial management in crisis and post-crisis situations does not correspond to their fiduciary requirements.

UNDP\u2019s role as principal recipient to manage grants of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in some high-risk, low-capacity countries is a case in point.21 UNDP\u2019s comprehensive corporate system of accountability provides a robust and transparent frame- work that aligns organizational activities to the delivery of value for money by helping UNDP and implementing partners to be accountable for their activities, to manage risks, and to ensure that adequate controls exist to achieve results.

In over 80 countries, UNDP has been supporting governments to customize and operationalize aid coordination mechanisms. In 37 of 41 African countries, UNDP provides the lead support from development partners to government for the national aid coordination mechanism. In countries like Liberia and Indonesia, UNDP has supported the government in formulating national capacity development strategies that serve as umbrella intervention frameworks for the intervention of development partners. According to the 2010 results of the PD Survey for indicator 9 on the use of common arrangements and procedures, 53 percent of UNDP\u2019s support is programme-based, slightly short of the 66 percent target for coordinated mechanisms for aid delivery. This fairly positive result is due to the coordinated aid delivery in several of its largest country offices, such as Afghanistan and DR Congo, where much of UNDP\u2019s total program- ming resources is spent. The average country ratio for coordinated mechanisms of aid delivery is 30 percent only (see Annex 2 and Annex 3 on indicator 9). Nevertheless, beyond its own performance, UNDP actually facilitates common arrangements and procedures for donors and other stakeholders by setting up multi-donor trust funds or other joint funding arrangements to coordinate support to a national programme or sector.22 The Executive Board decision on UNDP engagement in sector budget support and pooled funding has also improved its internal operating guidelines to further enable it to be a custodian of pooled funding arrange- ments in support of programme-based approaches. UNDP is committed to coordinating joint missions and country analytic work to alleviate the administrative burden of its national counterparts. Much progress has been made to better coordinate analytic work, mis- sions and programming within the United Nations Country Team, as reflected in the revised UNDG guidelines for United Nations Development Assistance Frameworks. With regard to the Paris Declaration indicator 10 on joint missions and country analytic work, the 2010 results show that UNDP has surpassed the 2010 target for joint missions, with 42 percent of its missions coordinated. On joint analytic works, UNDP comes close to reaching the 2010 target, with 59 percent (as against a target of 66 percent) of its analytic work being coordi- nated.

As mentioned earlier, UNDP is a member of IATI\u2019s Steering Committee and leads the Secretariat\u2019s work on partner country outreach.23 As part of its development and implementation, UNDP is organizing regular consultations among partner countries, which serve as fora for peer learning and exchange in the areas of aid information management, transparency, budget alignment and mutual accountability. UNDP has a long-standing commitment to transparency, with UNDP Country Offices publishing financial, pro- curement, programme and project level information on respective websites for more than four years. UNDP has developed and published an Information Disclosure Policy that makes clear its commitment to making information about its programmes and operations available to the public. The organization is also devoting considerable resources to adopting the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) by 2012, which will be a significant step towards further enhancing UNDP\u2019s transparency and accountability. UNDP plans to implement the transparency standard adopted by IATI in a phased and cost-effective approach to provide better information about its development work to partners and the public. The organization is committed to publishing an initial IATI data set in time for the High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan. The organiza- tion has set aside the necessary resources for expanding the scope of information published and improving its timeliness during the period 2012-2013. UNDP has also been a key actor in supporting the establishment and utilization of aid information manage- ment systems in over 40 countries as a means to promote transparency, systematize data collection and use, and aid management by governments and national stakeholders. Such aid information management systems have proven pivotal to improving aid information at country level, including within different branches of the executive; to promoting transparency to non-executive stakeholders in some cases; and to providing a basis for an informed and constructive dialogue among donors and national counterparts. Particularly in post-conflict countries, aid information management systems have been critical tools for increasing the timeliness and availability of information on external flows and supporting the relaunching of national development plan- ning and budgeting (e.g., Iraq, DR Congo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Afghanistan, Pakistan). Some countries (e.g., Rwanda) are using their aid information management systems to track the performance of development partners. With the implementation of the IATI standard by donors and other organizations, partner countries will have better access to information on aid flows and will be better able to supplement it with the relevant local classifications (budget and national development plan). With regard to the PD indicator 7 on predictable aid, disaggregated figures for UNDP on budget aid have been made available in only eleven countries.24 Of those, the average country ratio is 30 percent (see Annex 3 on indicator 7). UNDP has calculated this value using the OECD DAC\u2019s approach: in cases where UNDP disbursed 23 By May 2011, 20 developing countries had endorsed IATI, with the engagement of UNDP at HQ and country level. Pilots were organized in five partner counties (Burkina Faso, Colombia, DR Congo, Malawi and Rwanda) in 2010 to test the common data exchange format developed by IATI, and more implementation tests are planned in 2011 using information provided by the early implementers of the transparency standard. 24 As with indicator 3, partner countries that participated in the PD were asked to provide such information only on the United Nations, not on individual agencies. Countries that provided UNDP-specific information for indicator 7 on a voluntary basis were: Armenia, Botswana, Cambodia, Indonesia, Kenya, Lao PDR, Nepal, Niger, Rwanda, Sudan and Tanzania.

As long as the predictability of voluntary contributions to UNDP is limited, it will remain difficult for UNDP to provide predictable financial figures to its programme countries. The term \u2018tied aid\u2019 refers to aid that donors give with the condition that the sourcing of goods and services of aid-funded activities be purchased from suppliers in the donor country. Hence, the PD indicator 8 on untied aid does not apply to the United Nations with its 193 member states, which has an open procurement policy. Results and mutual accountability Supporting the improvement of results-based development management and mutual accountability mecha- nisms at country level is one of the cornerstones of UNDP\u2019s engagement with developing countries. Since 2006, UNDP has worked to improve mutual accountability mechanisms in numerous countries \u2013 including by supporting developing aid policies and strategies, country-level reviews of aid effectiveness indicators, assess- ments towards these targets, and capacity development for aid information management.26 UNDP\u2019s support to aid information management and the establishment of aid information management systems has enabled governments to hold donors accountable to their financial commitments and to improve transparency of and mutual accountability for development results. UNDP has also been supporting the Development Cooperation Forum of the United Nations Economic and Social Council to focus on mutual accountability within the framework of its regular high-level symposia as well as during the Forum itself.27 UNDP partnered with UN DESA in 2010 and 2011 to conduct a \u2018Review of Progress in International and National Mutual Accountability and Transparency in Development Cooperation\u2019 in over 50 countries. In 2010, the analysis of this evidence formed the basis of the United Nations\u2019 2010 Development Cooperation Report.28 In partnership with Ghana, Tanzania, Ireland, Switzerland and UN DESA, UNDP is using this evidence to inform and strengthen the cluster work of OECD DAC Working Party on Aid Effectiveness\u2019 on ownership and mutual accountability and to provide guidance on international and national mutual account- ability. UNDP also facilitated the organization of two subregional workshops on mutual accountability in Africa in early 2011 and developed a targeted support package in the lead-up to HLF 4 to improve mutual account- ability mechanisms in several pilot countries. Most recently, UNDP facilitated a peer-learning mission from African lusophone countries, Togo and Madagascar to Mozambique to learn from Mozambique\u2019s experience in 25 Voluntary contributions to UNDP\u2019s regular (core) resources reached US$1.01 billion in 2009. Combined earmarked (non-core) contributions to UNDP in 2009 reached US$3.67 billion. Earmarked resources represent an important complement to the regular, non-earmarked resource base of UNDP. However, the ratio of earmarked to non-earmarked regular resources remained imbalanced in 2009. Contributions to UNDP\u2019s resources remain hard to project and the impact of the global economic and financial crisis makes projections harder than ever.

They are a compact between the Government and its donor partners to implement the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action, adapting the principles to the context of Indonesia as a newly emerged middle-income country. At the launch, Indonesia\u2019s Minister of Finance called the Jakarta Commitments the start of a new era of donor relations in Indonesia. The UNDP-facilitated Capacity Development for Development Effectiveness (CDDE) Facility has worked to bring experience from other countries in the region to bear on the implementation of the JC. The Government has been able to establish an aid effectiveness secretariat and a multi-donor programme of support drawing on experiences in Cambodia. It is now implementing a capacity assessment and response exercise based on a methodology piloted in Nepal. Importantly, the CDDE Facility will also provide opportunities for the Government of Indonesia to share lessons and perspectives from its expe- rience of implementing a ground-breaking MIC aid policy, which is already receiving interest from within the region and further afield such as in El Salvador. COuNTRIES AFFECTED by CONFLICT OR FRAGILITy 16 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness coUNtRIES AffEctED by coNflIct oR fRAGIlIty While support to aid effectiveness is important in any kind of context, UNDP plays an essential role in situations of conflict and special development. International support in such complex and rapidly evolving situations is often a high-risk undertaking and fundamentally political. Within the international community, the United Nations plays a critical and significant role in peace-building efforts. At the same time, the United Nations system is only one of several actors working to support post-conflict countries, and the coherence of this broader international effort is key to helping countries to succeed in their efforts to construct a viable peace. Partnerships and coordination among the main regional and international actors are essential. In 2009 and 2010, 87 UNDP Country Offices supported national governments in crisis prevention and post-crisis contexts, ranging from direct technical and financial support to policy leadership and to the coordination of international agencies to ensure effective and timely response to crisis. Within the United Nations family, UNDP works for long-term peace-building and state-building, with a focus on laying the foundations for sustain- able development. UNDP\u2019s support to post-conflict partnerships and coordination efforts is therefore geared towards strengthening the capacities of national stakeholders for aid coordination and management, with a view to improving mutual accountability and towards supporting the establishment of transition compacts between development partners and national stakeholders. Partnership with the World Bank plays a particularly important role. UNDP\u2019s mandate and role to strengthen national capacities and ownership in transition It is challenging to strengthen government capacity for aid coordination and management in post-conflict settings. Legitimate, established and competent state institutions are often lacking. International partners are faced with a double challenge of obtaining adequate information on aid inflows for coordination and infor- mation-sharing purposes, while aiming to strengthen the government\u2019s capacity to manage and coordinate assistance. External partners often need to prioritize immediate results to strengthen confidence and to focus on the donor community\u2019s need for coordination and information sharing, but should not neglect investing the time and energy to build or rebuild government capacity.

UNDP\u2019s support to the Rc system on transition financing As the custodian of the Resident Coordinator system of the United Nations, UNDP also provides support to the Resident Coordinator\u2019s office to play a lead role in mobilizing transition financing, in close coordination with national counterparts. In many instances, UNDP establishes common funding arrangements for donors and other stakeholders to coordinate support to a national programme or sector. Particularly in post-crisis settings, UNDP-administered multi-donor trust funds and other joint funding arrangements have enabled donors to provide large amounts of resources for transition financing, when doubts in the capacity of public financial management systems prevent donors from providing support directly to government. As part of the United Nations\u2019 efforts to enhance United Nations system-wide coherence, UNDP expanded the number and diversity of multi-donor trust funds (MDTFs) it administers. The United Nations MDTF mechanism is a financial instrument with an agreed Administrative Agent (AA) to receive funds from multiple donors and report on their use \u2013 transfer of funds to multiple UN participating organizations. A MDTFs steering committee is normally chaired by the RC and Government, typically including all UN participating organizations, together with government line ministries and donors. Such UNDP-administered MDTFs, UN joint programmes and other joint funding modalities are providing a means for the United Nations, donors and other stakeholders to strengthen national leadership for transition and to harmonize and coordinate support. box 3: UN Multi-Donor trust funds MDTFs provide more flexible, coordinated and predictable funding to support the achievement of nationally owned and determined priorities. By channeling donor contributions through a pooled mechanism, MDTFs aim to facilitate and streamline donor contributions, and align donor reporting in order to reduce transaction costs. By improving coordination among all stakeholders, MDTFs can also provide a forum for policy dialogue and programmatic coordination and harmonization.

Slow progress on UNDP\u2019s use of country systems mirrors the slow progress of most donors in increasing the use of country systems.31 Equally, UNDP\u2019s implemen- tation of a number of Paris Declaration principles, like the use of country systems and direct budget support, hinges on the decisions of its Executive Board, particularly those relating to internal rules and procedures, transparency and disclosure policy. On the other hand, UNDP has made great strides toward aligning aid flows with national priorities and improving the predictability of its assistance. While further efforts on harmonizing its support are needed, ongoing improvements to United Nations and UNDP programming and system-wide coherence are already expected to improve this. UNDP is committed to continuing its two-pronged engagement in the Paris Declaration process: to engage on development cooperation issues with partners and stakeholders globally and regionally and to support developing countries in implementing aid effectiveness commitments and in participating in global develop- ment cooperation fora.

UNDP strongly supports the need for broad political consultations on aid and its effective use for development. To address broad multi-stakeholder dialogue on the quality of aid and policy coherence around development financing, the United Nations ECOSOC has established the United Nations Development Cooperation Forum. At the global level, the UN multi-stakeholder biennial Development Cooperation Forum has played a major role in advancing the debate on aid quantity and quality, policy coherence, mutual accountability and aid transparency. Post Busan, it can be used as the principal global multi-stakeholder forum, where developed and developing countries hold each other to account on international development commitments. This global work would be complemented by the United Nations acting as a coordinator at the country level to support partner country governments in setting up and assuming leadership of policy dialogue and mutual accountability mechanisms on development cooperation. UNDP has a particular role to play as coordinator of the UN system and facilitator on the ground. The PD implementation report highlights the need for UNDP, in partnership with others actors, to strengthen its focus on fostering inclusive national ownership and country-specific donor/government partnership frameworks, based on the \u2018unfinished business\u2019 from the Paris process, mutual accountability and results. This conceptual framework will guide UNDP country activities to build country-level partnerships for development results. 31 Reference to overall 2011 PD Survey results. ANNExES 19 Implementing the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness The United Nations is best placed to bridge the challenges posed by transition from crisis to recovery, from humanitarian action to development and from peace-keeping to peace-building \u2013 activities that can assist countries to move along a sustainable development path. The International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding has created a new forum where donors and conflict-affected states come together to discuss practical ways to deal with this challenge. The five new global Peacebuilding and Statebuilding Objectives, as agreed upon by the International Dialogue, can help to prioritize and demonstrate progress and create the conditions for MDG achievement in countries affected by conflict or fragility. UNDP will seek to prioritize aid in countries affected by conflict and fragility and demonstrate development progress by fostering inclusive political settlements and conflict resolution; establishing and strengthening people\u2019s security; addressing injus- tices and increasing people\u2019s access to justice; generating employment and improve livelihoods; managing revenues; and building capacity for accountable and fair social service delivery.

Many public sector organisations seek capacity (the ability to get things done) but not change (a different way of doing old and new things). The introduction of increased use of appropriate change management strategies and methods in development cooperation will often be resisted due the difficulty of precise definition of their results and the uncertainty of their outcomes. For many development practitioners change and capacity are distinct, but the evidence suggests that they are intertwined. Hence, it is important to understand what aspects of the status quo can be changed so that capacity development can take place. Identifying the boundaries of change management work is important as is identifying the risks and potential mitigation. Moreover, this is necessary in order to manage expectations accordingly. Different actors in change process have different powers and exert different influences. Thus, there is a risk that change model may represent \u2018political fix\u2019 (reflecting the interest of the more powerful players) or a response to donors\u2019 pressure as \u2018external drivers for change\u2019 without a genuine commitment, thus risking failure of the change effort. Change initiatives need to have a powerful guiding coalition and endogenous support, hence the importance of focusing on power relations and dynamics in the institutional landscape, as well as taking a more objective look at the role of donors as either drivers or facilitators of change can not be overemphasized. Change models and processes that aim to change the culture of the organization are difficult to operationalise, because of the inherent difficulty in uncovering the informal systems that guide peoples\u2019 behaviour. Hence, using a mix of insider knowledge and experience, with objective outsider (outside to the organisation undergoing change) expertise and facilitation is essential throughout the process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "97f38e05-bc1c-44dd-8804-4905310813a7": {"__data__": {"id_": "97f38e05-bc1c-44dd-8804-4905310813a7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4d562440cdf39da98117c5ccbb8aaf745acdea166e8d7880a42cef1e0b65030b"}, "2": {"node_id": "5530040d-9145-4ec5-9fbf-580d4473355b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1ac64769fb9e45e5c56f05c04765f3968c54265ca6623f1e3001d7fb4ee033da"}}, "hash": "674bb016cad8a03185c70e69acd56ccf795be9616d5a33d46eb9d3bf5843c851", "text": "Increasing utilization of appropriate change management strategies and methods will require: \u2022 A highly flexible approach to result-based planning, budgeting and management that can capture process results and costing, as demanded by change management. \u2022 Training for development agency personnel in process facilitation, negotiation and other specific change management methods and skills; \u2022 Capacity development in this field requires experts, local and international, who have not only technical expertise but also coaching, management development and mentoring skills, to facilitate rather than direct.

Managing change is itself a term that has at least two meanings. One meaning of \u201cmanaging change\u201d refers to making changes in a planned and managed or systematic fashion. External events may also necessitate organizational change. Hence, the second meaning of managing change - the response to changes over which an organization exercises little or no control (e.g., a rapid rise in the price of oil, devaluation of the national currency, civil unrest, new legislation, and so on). The recognition of the need for timely adjustment to external events has given rise the concept of the \u201clearning organization\u201d, one capable of continuous adaptation to the changing external environment. Finally, change management refers to an area of professional practice and the related body of knowledge that has grown up within and around this subject, mainly as a result of experience in the private sector. There are many models for change management: business schools offer instruction in its theory and practice and consulting firms offer a variety of services to facilitate change. This body of knowledge focuses on change within a single organization. 1 For current purposes, it is very important to set the boundaries of what this paper is addressing: It is assumed that change is imminent \u2013 either as planned change, or imposed, or stimulated in other fashions such as by a crisis; it focuses on organizational change management processes and the lessons learnt and practices analysed in this regard; and once the need and rationale for change has been established, it goes about suggesting good practice from above, to affect change in public sector organizations. The above formulation then consciously excludes a big patch where change often occurs i.e. the cultural or environmental aspects of change. This is deliberate in order to \u2018boundary manage\u2019 the scope of this paper. However, this is not to suggest that these are not recognized. The paper recognises that, for example, the challenge of HIV/AIDS prevention and care is almost completely one of behavioral and socio-cultural change. But for the purpose of manageability in this paper, we tackle these issues only in so far as they invoke concomitant change in formal public sector structures or rules of game such as a change in the manner in which the National AIDS Commission functions. A typology of change Change interventions fall into three main typologies: \u2022 Top-down change management is based on the assumption that if managers plan things properly, change can be executed smoothly. The only obstacle comes from resistance of some employees, hence focus is on changing the culture of an organisation or the \u2018way we do things around here\u2019. \u2022 Transformational change management relies on transformational leaders setting a personal example and challenging people to think \u2018outside the box\u2019 and innovate, while providing a safe environment for doing so. \u2022 Strategic change management is based on a certain recipe and are in contrast with the top-down models in that they aim to introduce a new behaviours at work, allowing people to witness the benefit for the organisation and, thus, based on the evidence, internalise the change in their \u2018ways of working\u2019. Each of these approaches can be effective, depending on the situation although it is generally accepted that the first category is often the category that fails the most. All approaches highlight the importance of leadership, communications and involving people in the change process. Thus, the key challenge for organisations is to match the model to the context. 1 For the sake of consistency of approach, the paper will henceforth use the term \u201corganisation\u201d for both institutions and organisations, as defined in the change management literature. 6 Change Management and Development Cooperation The business of development is about change. One meaning of \u201cmanaging change\u201d therefore refers to making changes in a planned and managed or systematic fashion. This is the definition that strikes a chord with development practitioners. Change also happens in response to external stimuli. These stimuli may be of a foreseen nature (e.g. the need for a one-UN approach as underpinning change in the UN) or unforeseen (e.g. the Asian tsunami forced the Maldives Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Department of External Resources to drop their differences and join hands in planning the recovery phase, irrespective of who assumed charge of expanded ODA receipts, management and disbursement). Development practitioners have adapted some change management methods under the banners of organizational development and institutional reform. \u201cChange management\u201d is commonly the name of a", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "738577b6-7157-40c8-86b7-2431ccd1adba": {"__data__": {"id_": "738577b6-7157-40c8-86b7-2431ccd1adba", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c0dbf8a0470e05cd4ac3493a8731816fb648967303af26318348d4dc3ddc9057"}}, "hash": "c0dbf8a0470e05cd4ac3493a8731816fb648967303af26318348d4dc3ddc9057", "text": "chapter in a handbook on organizational development. The content consists of a grab bag of \u201ctools\u201d for managing organizational change. This usage of change management is quite similar to the usage in the private sector. To the extent that development activities also focus on an individual organization, the private sector approaches may be relevant and may be applied after taking into account the differences between firms and public sector organizations. However, as referred earlier, the \u201cchanges\u201d promoted by development assistance may focus not only on an individual organization or a group of related organizations, but also on the larger development environment. For example, a development intervention may seek to mitigate cultural constraints that inhibit delivery of health services to people infected with HIV and AIDS; to change the legal and policy framework to address corruption in the public sector; to promote gender equity in the work place; or to ensure that elections are fair. In such cases, social, economic, political or cultural change may be the long-term goal. While various organizational actors may be involved in these changes, these interventions will also focus on concerned stakeholder and beneficiary groups. Here the relevant knowledge and experience comes not only from organizational development but also from socio- economic research findings and development experience in the areas of social change, communications, community development, agricultural extension, participatory approaches and social mobilization and other related disciplines. UNDP\u2019s systematic work in capacity diagnostics, is increasingly revealing these gaps in relation to affecting organizational and wider change. But UNDP is by no means alone in arriving at these conclusions. The World Bank (2000) reports two primary findings from evaluations of their programmes. First, their findings support the view that the quality of institutions is a key determinant of development impact. Secondly, despite the first finding, their evaluation reports consistently conclude that many Bank interventions do not adequately address institutional concerns, suggesting that the \u2018mismatch between the requirements of successful institutional reform and traditional ways of going about the aid business\u20192 UNDP\u2019s work under the aegis of capacity development has assumed the following cycle \u2013 assess capacity to diagnose assets and capacity needs; suggest strategies to meet those needs; cost and implement those strategies; and demonstrate impact through measuring change in capacity. While locating and operationalising this CD framework in the context of national development strategies, it has been found that many critical public sector agencies/institutions are in need of change if they are to meet their expected contributions towards nationally agreed goals, such as achieving the MDGs. And this refers to both their \u2018soft\u2019 systems (such as motivating staffing) as well as in their \u2018hard\u2019 systems (such as upgrading accounting and monitoring systems). 2 \u201cLiterature Review on Institutional Reform and Change Management\u201d, UNDP/BDP/CDG, July 2006, p.10. 7 Section II. Organisational Change - What have we learnt so far? From a review of change management processes in countries, the paper distills some lessons from practice. Annex 2 speaks in more detail to some of the breakdowns of change management efforts that one must be aware of as one proceeds. Change management in development is not understood The issue of organizational and institutional change is accorded relatively light treatment in practical development situations. There is little grasp of the issue and not even the language to articulate organizational change issues. Conversely, insufficient understanding of the development context, in particular, the constraints embedded in bureaucratic systems, organizational culture and the structure of human interactions can be a stumbling block to change management processes. The civil service of Afghanistan needs a rationalization of its incentive structure. It currently has seven different salary scales depending on who the salaries are meant for (returning exiles; expatriates; lateral recruits from Universities) and who is paying the bill (for instance, specific donors support salary supplementation schemes in select ministries)3. It needs to harness the motivations of exile Afghans wishing to return and contribute to the building of their nation, and balance that with that with longer term salary reform. This is a highly complex and highly political process. Therefore, defining a clear (and better yet, inspiring) vision for the change initiative in the relevant public sector organization, and how it impacts the larger development goals of the country is a necessary place to start. Change management is unguided Institutional/organizational change is hard to conceptualize for public sector organizations and harder to apply. Codification of empirical knowledge to guide the operational manager becomes a huge boon to this process. Organisational leaders tasked with managing change are engaged in \u2018a great venture of exploration, risk, discovery, and change, without any comprehensive maps for guidance\u2019 (Senge,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6c614f9-8a01-4f8e-8e83-5021ec79e30f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6c614f9-8a01-4f8e-8e83-5021ec79e30f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "dd007737b84266b55652c3f87d228d333db17980cd830a1ad53ecfa98a539321"}}, "hash": "dd007737b84266b55652c3f87d228d333db17980cd830a1ad53ecfa98a539321", "text": "1999). A mapping of change management process steps, and ensuring it is consulted on, widely disseminated and agreed to, is key to its relevance and effectiveness. Beyond a mapping of steps, guiding the process step-by-step is critical to its success, with internal champions playing the primary role and facilitated by process facilitators as required. One of the most intractable challenges that UNDP face is that of finding experts, be they national or international, that have skills in mentoring and facilitation. While consultants who can produce technical \u201cdeliverables\u201d are required, there is also a need for those development practitioners and consultants with skills in the areas of process facilitation for coaching, leadership development, management development and change management training. This is an area of capacity development expertise, and can be teamed with the needed sector or theme-specific technical expertise. In Timor Leste, UNDP\u2019s support to capacity development in the civil service is actively building in a system of measuring performance of both technical experts and counterparts that goes beyond the assessment of hard deliverables and focuses on skills of mentorship, transference of capacity and facilitation of change. Change management results are unpredictable Change management exercises are highly unpredictable in terms of what they achieve. Experts agree that most change projects fail. Pascale (1999) suggests this is the case for 80% of change programmes. Management experts' opinions converge on several causes that can derail change efforts. What we do know is that change management shifts roles and capacities of different actors, which in turn shifts the existing bases of power. Building in risk assessments and accounting for such initial instability, while managing its boundaries through managing peoples expectations and concerns, is a necessary part of organisational change strategy. 3 See, Capacity Development in Action Series: The Afghanistan Case Study: Capacity Development Group/BDP; 2006 8 Putting in place clear and consistent messages regarding the change process, regular and open stakeholder consultations, airing of grievances, and putting in place feedback and learning mechanisms to enable adaptation during the course of the change process have been essential to those more effective change management processes. Change Management is not supported Failure to motivate or convince leadership and middle management of the need for change often leads to the unraveling of a change process, and certainly does not enable the sustainability of even early results. A key result could be one that requires a cross-departmental response that needs the buy-in of all. The Planning Commission of Bhutan, for example, needs a unified M&E framework and reporting format aimed to facilitate results outcomes for all its divisions \u2013 strategic planning, statistical data bases, monitoring etc. It needs to move out of the currently prevailing myriad of M&E frameworks \u2013 one for each division. The need here to focus on facilitating teams and constituencies for introducing such a system change within the organisation. The early identification, and addressing of, the sources of resistance to change (in other words, facing up to the reality that change produces winners and losers), is a must-do action. Doing so also involves addressing the values, norms and cultural aspects of stakeholders that are relevant to the change effort, both inside and outside the organization. Bringing in the organisations clients, where possible, to be a part of the process is useful in this regard. Change Management results cannot be sustained It is often difficult for leaders and managers to persevere and maintain focus on the change initiative. Where this is seen to be working, a focused effort to nurture the change environment and reward incremental successes is evident. As shown above, the summary distilling of lessons and addressing the gaps in Change Management, show how this contributes to capacity development, and when amiss can detract from organisational capacities essential for public sector development. From the lens of the capacity development practitioner, the missing link in the above situations is often the lack of adequate understanding and know-how of managing change in organizations. Investments in capacity development \u2013 in training, coaching, mentoring, leadership development, incentives, client responsiveness and so on \u2013 are essentially founded on weak ground unless these are accompanied by organizational change of the kind discussed here. Developing leadership skills, clarifying roles and getting stakeholders on board are all necessary for successful change interventions. However, paying attention to soft aspects of organisation, such as culture, is also indeed as these factors are often paramount determinants of the real direction and pace of change.

A framework is proposed, from a wide-ranging trawl of the state of the art in change management from the private sector and allied literature from the public sector like in Public Administration Reform (PAR), combined with the empirical experience of UNDP in supporting change management, often in challenging development or post crisis conditions. Successful change management strategies attempt to improve planning processes so that results will be defined that are acceptable to stakeholders, are achievable and sustainable. They attempt to 4 For more information on change management tools, please see Annex 2. 9 improve implementation processes in order to strengthen local leadership and ownership of results among all stakeholders. Drawing on these principles, a four stage change management process is being increasingly used by UNDP\u2019s work in this field. Change, irrespective of what causes it (internal entropy/external stimulus), how it is undertaken (planned or imposed) and what combination of techniques is used (hard system change or soft system change), is about two broad processes: a) managing the environment of change; and, b) executing the change itself. Managing the environment of change subsumes two main areas: A. Creating the momentum for change including making the case, visioning, empowerment and voicing activities; by definition, this is step for the leadership to principally act upon. B. Analysis of the change context including diagnosing issues of who wins, who loses, social, cultural, legal and policy issues; data collection and analysis; and operations research on problems. Executing the change process: here an enabling role is foreseen again in two areas: C. Facilitation of change including building change coalitions and harnessing champions, process consultation, decision-making methods, consensus building, and brainstorming, all informed by factual information and analysis. D. Communications about change, including public meetings, various other forms of two-way communications, and information dissemination. Figure 1.

A. Creating the momentum for change: Some methods analysed in application, for motivating change include: a.1) Advocacy activities - Change management activities may attempt to influence the development agenda by providing direct support for advocacy activities on globally or nationally agreed positions, such as, human rights, gender equity or HIV/AIDS prevention. Advocacy activities are also common at the sectoral level in motivational campaigns for, inter alia, family planning, the use of mosquito nets, staying in school, and getting children vaccinated. In the organizational context, this would include sharing the rationale for change openly and transparently with key stakeholders, mainly employees. Addressing Gender-Based Violence: Many NGOs have launched programs to promote changes in attitude and practices related to gender norms and violence against women, both within the work place as well as in communities. The few that have been carefully evaluated suggest that such advocacy campaigns, using organisational or community-level approaches, can be effective in changing violence-related attitudes and behaviors. \u201cEdutainment\u201d \u2013 using radio and television to promote changes in attitudes and behaviors \u2013 has worked well for other issues and is now being tried for violence prevention5. a.2) Visioning - This activity enables stakeholders to review fundamental questions in order to generate a vision for the future. Visioning is \u201ca strategic planning process, there are four fundamental questions: \u2018Where are you now? Where are you going? Where do you want to be?\u2019 and \u2018How are you going to get there?\u20196 Visioning seeks to create consensus and commitment among all stakeholders to a vision for the future. Defining a vision and having a broad consensus on goals and values to guide organisational change is an essential step in systems change. It is critical to building support for change among stakeholders and within the organisation itself. Such visioning can precede a change management exercise. These can even be the alignment of longer term vision and values \u2013 a key component of coalescing guiding coalitions for change.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "346394e0-e058-45bc-93ca-f64a25674d24": {"__data__": {"id_": "346394e0-e058-45bc-93ca-f64a25674d24", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "914701e0730e2ae55f4eb1efd7025aa370a2223c831663b26c84743ab0ab3998"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9abc017-3bdf-4aae-b351-d6f91d23f1ba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d020de87b442888ce23d2967cf77e92ad5f472cf399ec6dd2ee8253f66f33bad"}}, "hash": "0ab7bab8f20f880a02bff0e76cf3567f19be48d5daf4c1948a352d3156f55e40", "text": "Higher Education in Tanzania: Following the decision to embark upon a process of self-renewal and reform, the university undertook two tasks to lay a firm foundation for the programme's implementation, namely: gathering", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a1400151-2ffd-418e-8297-c7c39fc11707": {"__data__": {"id_": "a1400151-2ffd-418e-8297-c7c39fc11707", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "21f42ea400d6cf4c6e2038d7df654378b3e4bace060c10cd5a033df9b1f1e3a7"}}, "hash": "21f42ea400d6cf4c6e2038d7df654378b3e4bace060c10cd5a033df9b1f1e3a7", "text": "data on the university in order to give the community a broad awareness of its strengths and weaknesses; and drafting a corporate strategic plan to guide the reform process. After intensive debates, discussions and consultations, the University Council approved the Corporate Strategic Plan in August 1994. The document, which touches on all aspects of the institution, covers the basic concepts, aspirations, goals, objectives and philosophy underlying the envisaged reform process. Its five sub-themes are: Mission, objectives and functioning; Corporate set-up (ownership, autonomy, governance and administrative structures); Inputs (management styles, policies, planning, finance, backup services, personnel and student welfare); Outputs (principles underpinning academic activities such as undergraduate and postgraduate studies, research and consultancy). Although the strategic plan was not prepared by planning professionals, it accurately captured the vision, sentiments and wishes of a broad spectrum of people concerned about the future of the institution7. a.3) Empowerment and Voice - They seek to strengthen the capacity of stakeholder organizations that represent or advocate for groups that may be discriminated against or are otherwise 5 Addressing Gender-Based Violence in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Empowerment and voicing activities enable these groups to make their views known and mobilize their support for a change agenda. The Peru Poverty Dialogue: Following a poverty assessment in 1997 which suggested that duplication and lack of synergy among development actors were likely to hamper further gains in poverty reduction, the World Bank suggested the establishment of an inclusive forum for plural debate and action. In 1998, with the agreement of other donors and the government, the National Poverty Dialogue was established. The objective: to share experiences and information and promote better use of poverty reduction resources in the country. After three sets of decentralized, theme-specific poverty dialogues during 1998-2001, the National Poverty Dialogue is an institutionalized plural space. A diverse set of stakeholders - Government, civil society, private sector - came together to share experience around three themes: (i) techniques for monitoring and evaluation, (ii) access, quality and coverage of basic services, and (iii) employment and income generation. As a result, information has begun to flow more regularly among actors and some specific collaborative acts have been undertaken, creating an environment that encourages open debate. Under the transition government, the true fruits of the Poverty Dialogue finally became apparent. The government, recognizing the need to institutionalize plural debate and create country ownership around development strategies, issued a presidential decree, firmly establishing the forum. In addition, the government asked the Dialogue to design and implement the establishment local coordinating bodies (mesas de concertaci\u00f3n) to plan and monitor of all public funds allocated for poverty reduction. Today, the mesas have become an important element of the various accountability and transparency mechanisms used in Peru which aim to give citizens more influence in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of public policy as well as ensuring that institutions and officials are held accountable. These transparency and accountability mechanisms provide the opportunity to promote a new level of accountability and scrutiny as well as promoting \u201cvoice\u201d in public policy processes8. B. Analysis of the change context: Popularly used analytical methods that can support change efforts and contribute to decision-making include: b.1) Stakeholder Analysis and setting the baseline - The purpose of stakeholder analysis is to identify stakeholders in a given development intervention; to analyze their knowledge, attitudes and practices in regard to the underlying issues, and to classify them in terms of their functional roles. The pivotal aspect here is to assess which stakeholders are likely to be net gainers and which net losers. For the losers to not act as dampeners on change, it is important to take this opportunity to find areas where win-wins for all can be demonstrated \u2013 often in an inter-temporal sense9. A SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) could be an alternative approach to direct stakeholder analysis. A clear understanding of the positions of various stakeholders is essential for project planning and implementation. b.2) Operations Research - Problem-oriented analyses are commonly necessary to support decision- making or to gather additional factual information about, for example, the status and needs of beneficiary groups, the potential impact of proposed changes, or the actual impact of changes as they are implemented. Ministry of Health, Malaysia: In 2004, the Ministry of Health in Malaysia carried out an evaluation to support a 5- year planning exercise.

This example illustrates how the evaluation data influenced decision-making. The trend for both in-patients and out-patients was still slightly upward in absolute numbers. The initial conclusion was that since the total numbers were still going up, the demand for public health service was still increasing. However, the analysis then factored in population growth to get utilization per capita. These results showed that, in relative terms, the trends were downward. In other words, due to better health or increasing prosperity, the demand for public health services was actually declining on a per capita basis. Decision-makers got the message and decided to significantly curtail what had been an annual programme of building new hospitals and health centers10. 8 Empowering the Poor: Engaging Civil Society in World Bank Operations En Breve, World Bank November 2002 9 See for instance, Shekhar Singh in UNDP Development Policy Journal, Volume 2, 2000; a hypothetical case of loggers, conservationists and the community is posited for net gainers and net losers analysis. 10 James Herm, ACTS Inc., in correspondence with the author 12 C. Facilitation of change: Methods studied for guiding change processes include: c.1) Process Consultation11 - This is the engaging of individuals to facilitate change processes. A process consultant enables \u201clearning by doing\u201d and thereby facilitates organizational learning in contrast to the normal practice in consulting, the production of \u201cdeliverables\u201d. Learning, including making mistakes, nurtures the stakeholders\u2019 sense of ownership in the changes and the change process12. Process consultants seek to build trusting relationships with their clients, constituencies for change and consensus on the direction of change. They start with whatever problem the organization is addressing at the time in order to gain experience and build trust. They identify, endorse and promote leadership in the various stakeholder organizations that will \u201cown\u201d as well as lead the change process. Such ownership is essential for sustainability. Change that is locally owned is sustainable; change that has been prescribed by outsiders usually isn\u2019t. Process consultants allow the change process to move at its own pace on the basis of the stakeholders\u2019 readiness for change rather than arbitrary plans and schedules. Nevertheless, process consultants can structure the change process by focusing on decision-making. This entails sequencing activities so as to logically lead to decisions; ensuring open processes to maximize the flow of new ideas and engender commitment from stakeholders, and empowerment of leaders to exercise their powers. Karachi Water Board: A Swedish consulting firm was contracted under a World Bank project to assist the Karachi Water Board to plan and implement management and organizational change. They took a linear consultation approach for about 18 months and then realized they were getting nowhere. They discovered that all real decisions were made informally, not through the formal structures and procedures. Therefore, the consultants gave up on working through the formal system. Instead, their interventions were built around having tea with the right people and building personal relationships. Over time, and when they were asked, they began to slip in small suggestions for change. In the end, the consultants didn\u2019t achieve the project\u2019s objectives, but they did make some change \u2013 with an indirect, informal approach built on the strength of the human relationships they had established13. c.2) Consensus-building exercises - As options for change emerge, there is a need to build consensus so that decisions can be taken and the change process can move forward. Consensus building activities build constituencies for change to ensure momentum for change is not dissipated in in-fighting among stakeholders about details. These activities can also overcome resistance to change and entail opportunities to discuss or ascertain real v/s apparent agendas. c.3) Leadership is the key component of successful change. Leaders are in a position to bring passion and conviction for change and increase organisational performance through strategic thought, building partnerships and facilitating changes in organisational culture. Public agencies also need political champions who provide long-term support on the public policy agenda and guide reform. The Asia Young Leaders for Governance: This programme is an initiative aimed at creating a critical mass of young change makers in the region who work in government or whose work supports good governance. By reaching ever-increasing numbers of young leaders in pivotal organisations, the programme aims to create the momentum for change in favour of good governance in a range of important organisations in each country. Typical alumni of the programme include Members of Parliament, civil servants, human rights lawyers, Election Commission staffers, Mayors, journalists and NGO activists.

In the context of wide (diverse) stakeholder participation, brainstorming can surface ideas for discussion across the spectrum of opinion on various issues and possible (creative) solutions. Agricultural Research and Extension in Latin America: The Latin America and Caribbean region has been undergoing an evolutionary process in its agricultural research and extension systems in recent years. This transformation of agricultural innovation systems has been explained metaphorically as following the nature of an \u201cintelligent living organism\u201d that must learn and adapt to changes in its environment in order to be successful. What was once a linear process, driven by a top-down action plan where research and advisory services were dominated by government agencies, is slowly being transformed into a network of diverse stakeholders influencing the process of agricultural innovation. Traditionally, the unidirectional process of research and extension has been initiated by an agricultural agenda defined by the central government, for which the national agricultural research institutes were tasked with identifying strategies to address these priorities. The research was then implemented and finally its results disseminated to the farmers for adoption. The current incarnation of agricultural innovation systems have been typified by the engagement of a wider set of actors, including universities, farmers, input suppliers and other private sector interests, who offer their unique insights to feed the process of innovation in a practical and demand-driven manner. As such, the concept of \u201cinnovation\u201d extends beyond formal research and development to more effectively incorporate learning through experience, which has proven more circular in nature, with the intention of more directly contributing to improved rural livelihoods14. D. Communications about change. Methods and tools commonly used include: d.1) Multi-media communications activities - Factual information and stakeholder positions should be communicated widely to all concerned parties. Stakeholders have a right to know the facts and to be assured that the change process is proceeding in a transparent manner. Communications activities could include, for example, information dissemination through mass media, such as newspapers, radio, television and the Internet and informational presentations for interested groups. d.2) Interactive communications and public outreach \u2013 This includes surveys, report cards, TV and radio discussions - provide officials with the opportunity for presentation possible solutions, for sharing of information and for dialogue with stakeholders. Other two-way media or activities \u2013 focus group discussions, hotlines, Internet chat rooms, web-sites \u2013 can be used for obtaining ideas and feedback from stakeholders. d.3) Measuring and celebrating progress - Much of the change management process has uncertain outcomes; hence monitoring their impact presents a challenge. Strengthening organisational performance and focusing on process indicators of change can ensure celebrating early wins, create learning and ensure continuous support for change. It is important to recognise that both short-term \u201cwins\u201d and longer-term reform are important. Capacity development initiatives must reinforce progress and allow for corrections where needed which makes the measuring and reporting on progress important. The designing of a results-based framework in this regard is important. In the programming cycle, it is possible to measure change by assessing the same capacity over periodic intervals e.g. measuring the financial management capacity of an organisation over time and comparing scores. Measuring progress, seeking feedback, and continuing to adjust and improve are all important for following through on change programmes. Strengthening performance management systems of public sector agencies contributes to enhancing capacity for sustaining change. But all measurement should not be self-measurement. For public sector organisations to be accountable, change must be measured by users, clients or stakeholders. 14 Institutional Reform in Agricultural Research and Extension in Latin America and the Caribbean, En Breve, World Bank, May 2006 14 In 1994, the citizens of some areas of Bangalore, India rated their service providers on report cards. In 1999, the same exercise was carried out and improvements and failures were recorded and discussed in the media. Much had changed between the two report cards. The most important change was that the service providers and clients had evolved a culture of discussion and dialogue for jointly exploring the challenges relating to service delivery in Bangalore.

So we come full circle, to where we began with lessons learnt\u2026.. 1. Change is political In many UNDP programme counties in the world, the boundaries of pushing change and reform are set by what is acceptable at the political level. In many countries for example, human rights and rights based programming has to be couched in language like \u2018inclusive governance\u2019. Understanding the context of change is therefore of utmost importance. Organisational change should begin with an assessment of the change landscape and the organisation\u2019s position in it. Assessments should consider, inter alia, the organisation\u2019s current capacity, performance, leadership, systems, services and stakeholders and the interplay of these in the wider institutional context. DFID, a strong advocate of the \u2018Drivers of Change\u2019 approach, conducted an analysis of the context in Bangladesh for identifying key drivers of change. The following list of nine potential drivers of change is the result \u2013 the media, civil society (including NGOs, community organisations, business associations, independent research and advocacy centres and professional associations), Bangladesh\u2019s development partners, reform-minded public servants and the Bangladeshi Diaspora. A major implication of this line of argument is that technical competencies for reform often need to be matched by awareness of what is acceptable in the local context, sensitivities and knowledge of what should be reasonable expectation in a given context. UNDP Country Office local staff often play this role vis-\u00e0-vis policy advisors, technical assistants or external consultants. They act as a sounding board for the feasibility of ideas, constructs and others proposals. The Laos GPAR (governance and public administration reform) programme, a successful model of context sensitive innovation, is one of UNDP\u2019s oft-cited success stories. The process of managing change must include frequent and innovative attempts at building consensus, demonstrating benefits, dialoguing and communicating. 2. Change is normative Change efforts are significantly normative in nature. Positive change is driven by coalitions of aligning interests, soft systems like motivation, ethics and pride and fundamental transformational issues starting with individual transformation in attitudes, values and behaviour. There is significant literature covering most of these areas. UNDP\u2019s Leadership for Transformation initiative on HIV/AIDS drew on the work of Ken Wilbur and others to demonstrate that change occurs primarily in the individual realm. ECDPM\u2019s recently concluded work linking capacity, change and performance suggests, inter alia, that often the task of leaders is to provide a \u2018protected operating space\u2019 in which change, innovation and capacity development can happen. Applying a systems thinking filter to managing change would suggest that the best that a UNDP manager/advisor/practitioner can do is to anticipate, as accurately as possible, the virtuous (or reinforcing) loops that change processes set off and offset the vicious (or dampening) loops. The amazing impact of micro-credit interventions on women\u2019s empowerment in Bangladesh is a perfect example of an unanticipated spin off that sets off a virtuous cycle of benefits. Cultural and value issues often dictate change outcomes. It is striking to see that Afghanistan has attracted back the large number of exiles that have committed themselves to making a change in the country. In other words, the ability to engineer and construct change through shop 15 floor processes, while valid, still remains somewhat limited in its reach and most change occurs more in the realm of behaviour, ethics, values, soft-systems incentives and so on. 3. Coalitions of aligning interests is a pre-condition for change Creating a critical mass that agree on a roadmap for change is key. As argued elsewhere in this paper, change happens when \u2018guiding coalitions\u2019 or a critical mass of champions coalesce around the felt need for change. These may be associations of convenience or of bona fide conviction. Be that as it were, the necessity of these coalitions remains an undeniable fact of change management. In 1991, when the economy of India faced a sudden unanticipated shock through the rise on oil prices and the drying up of repatriation from Gulf-based workers of Indian origin owing to the first Iraq war, the possibility loomed large of the country defaulting on her loans for the first time ever. This stimulus created an amazing coalition for change \u2013 ranging across the political spectrum \u2013 and ushered in fundamental reforms in the Indian economy which laid the foundations for the high growth rates that the country is seeing now. The creation of a change coalition must be accompanied by an agreed roadmap for change. In other words, co-creating a plan to achieve the shared vision or the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86be456c-f177-4886-8bea-19b84df7d05a": {"__data__": {"id_": "86be456c-f177-4886-8bea-19b84df7d05a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2c346c59406525be7969d6b599a6fbbc9dd25a3cc85d6067c0ba20e42e61b3d1"}}, "hash": "2c346c59406525be7969d6b599a6fbbc9dd25a3cc85d6067c0ba20e42e61b3d1", "text": "common goals for changing the organisation is essential for successful change. In combination, these serve to create the alignment of interests for change. Development of a coalition for supporting institutional reform, particularly when facing adversity or opposition, requires an understanding of the logic and concerns underpinning different stakeholders' positions. Managing opposition to change often requires a combination of incentives and facilitating processes that enable entrenched interests to see their own benefits within a milieu. Incentives can sometimes be of a financial nature but are most often non-monetary. Financial incentives carry with them the associated risks that organizations will buy the substance but not the vision of change. Non- monetary incentives, such as creating opportunities to learn, developing merit-based systems that reward performance and enabling a creative working environment are often more powerful. Adequate and appropriate incentives could bring about significant change in attitudes and increase overall organisational performance. The issue of incentives in public sector organisations can get somewhat fuzzy because they can, and often do, struggle with defining and measuring their targets, which contributes to change efforts becoming elusive. There is therefore an important rationale for strengthening local capacities for visioning, planning and results definition. 4. Embedding change messages in social and organizational culture Prescribed change is likely to be resisted the most. It is therefore important to evolve language and methodology for change that is consistent with norms and values more generally but also with the culture of the organization [which tend to be interconnected categories]. The consultants working on the reform of the Karachi Water Board found that conversations entailing sitting informally with employees and joining them for cups of tea was a more effective platform for discussing and affecting change. Change coalitions and roadmaps are beset by challenges of organisational culture. It can take a while for staff to come to terms with changes in the culture of their work place \u2013 \u2018the way we do things around here\u2019. The organisational culture in many developing countries is based on hierarchy, command, and duty and patronage, with little incentive for staff to be creative and innovative. Capacity development for change, therefore, needs to pay attention to aspects of organizational culture as indeed these factors are often decisive determinants of the real direction and pace of change. Over time, organisations must build a deeper understanding, update strategy, and become better at managing change. Hence, organisations need to conceptualise organisational change as a relatively normal phenomena and, as a continuous process, not something to approach with trepidation. Helping organisations to manage their knowledge more effectively and change into learning 16 organisations will enhance their understanding of change and increase their capacity to internalise change quickly, thus enabling adoption of continuous change process. 5. Communicate, communicate, communicate around change Change must be communicated at all stages. In the conception stage, communications for inclusion ensure that stakeholders buy in and are less likely to become potential resisters of the change process. Communication also helps to dispel uncertainties and mitigate the potential threat it poses to those that see themselves as likely to be impacted by the change. This also implies that all stakeholders must be afforded the opportunity to input into the design of change \u2013 or at least, as much as is practically feasible. The other aspect of communications is also a key one. Once change processes have been undertaken, a process of sharing, communicating (even advocacy) around its outcome and implications with all stakeholder groups is important. UNDP and UN country team staff have a key role to play in communicating change practices, building consensus and coalitions for change, and then enabling the change through process facilitation, negotiation, conflict management, analytical skills, advisory skills and specific change management methods, is clearly a critical input. In many countries, where the UN that has the credibility and trust of counterparts to be able to suggest transformational change and work with the government to affect such on a day to day basis, UNDP and UNCTs need to ensure the mix of skills in this field, to enable them to facilitate such change management processes. 17 ANNEXES Annex 1: Case Studies Case Study #1: A Training and Motivation Strategy for Family Planning in Thailand Though the family planning program of Meechai Viravaida\u2019s Population and Development Association in Thailand has been widely publicized, it was the Royal Thai Government\u2019s National Family Planning Programme (NFPP) that in fact was largely responsible for the rapid fertility reduction that occurred in Thailand in the 1970s and 80s.

With funding from UNFPA, the UNDP regional project worked with the Ministry of Health to implement a project titled, \u201cFamily Planning Communication Development and Integrated Campaigns\u201d. The immediate objectives of the project were to build up the personnel resources of the Family Health Division (FHD) of the Ministry for training and motivational activities and to provide support for all FHD communications activities in support of the NFPP. In other words, capacity building and communication support. While this project sounds like a straightforward technical assistance and direct support project, its origins and the manner in which it was implemented are the interesting bits. First, the preparation of the project had a long gestation period, during which time, the UNDP regional project advisors used process consultation. The first request for assistance was to review only a programmed instruction manual for in-service self-learning within the FHD. The existing draft of the manual wasn\u2019t satisfactory. The starting point was therefore a real client problem. The advisors worked slowly with the FHD following a \u201clearning by doing\u201d approach that gradually led to an overall review of the entire training effort and eventually to involvement with the mass communications component of the NFPP. By helping the FHD deal with a practical problem in a manner that enabled self-learning, the UNDP advisors built up a relationship of trust that led to the development of the large scale training and communications project. The early stages of project recognized the need for stakeholder analysis as essential for the preparation of workable training and motivation strategies. The advisors worked with the FHD to identify 18 stakeholder groups in three large categories: 1) high level policy-makers and programme managers who had to be motivated to approve and support programme activities; 2) health personnel; and 3) the rural population, the target beneficiaries of the programme. Operations research on knowledge, attitudes and practices of these groups enabled the project team to create effective training and communications strategies that would take stakeholders views and sensitivities into account. This relationship between the UNDP advisors and the Ministry of Health kept evolving and expanding for several years. After eight years, the UNDP advisors were able to move into basic organizational development issues at the Ministry using a senor organizational consultant to address fundamental issues of organizational structure and decision-making. Despite the confidence that had been built up over the years, there was still resistance to organizational change to be overcome. To sum up, the change management dimensions illustrated by this project include: the use of process consultation to gradually build trust and enable national leadership to lead the project; the establishment of a long-term relationship, essential for capacity development; extensive research on stakeholders and beneficiaries to enable development of effective training and communication strategies; the recognition of the need to win support of policy makers and managers; and an evolution from small client-identified problems to major organizational development issues. 18 Case Study #2: The Training and Visiting System for Agricultural Extension During the 1970s and 80s, the World Bank established a model for agricultural extension called the Training and Visiting system (T&V) in several countries. The model was derived from an approach used on agricultural kibbutzim in Israel. What is interesting about the model is that is almost entirely content-based with a distinct lack of change management strategy. The T&V model was ineffective and as such provides an example of the consequences of the failure to apply change management strategies. The T&V model was attractive for its simplicity. Agricultural extension field workers with be trained every two weeks during growing seasons. The training topics would correspond to the current stages of crop growth. For example, at planting time the training would cover recommended planting practices. After training the extension agents would follow a regular itinerary of village visits. At each village they would meet with farmer groups and convey their fresh knowledge of recommended practices. Two weeks later, the agent would return with a new set of timely recommended practices. T&V required Ministries of Agriculture to hire large new armies of extension works, preferably energetic young agricultural college graduates. The World Bank provided loans to fund the new recruitment and support salaries for a few years, after which time the economic value of the incremental production would supposedly clearly offset the financial cost to the government of the new field workers. In retrospect, the T&V system relied on some breath-taking assumptions. Foremost among these was the assumption that information was the critical missing input that was keeping subsistence farmers down. Second came the assumption that government researchers", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2e82bb7e-81e7-4e5d-a841-36c780ca73c9": {"__data__": {"id_": "2e82bb7e-81e7-4e5d-a841-36c780ca73c9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7e3bc0933f7a74593083d2f13800f82ec92c00dbb795f499ef5265ff7655f3b6"}}, "hash": "7e3bc0933f7a74593083d2f13800f82ec92c00dbb795f499ef5265ff7655f3b6", "text": "had appropriate technical information ready for transmission to farmers. And third was the assumption that farmers would respond to the advice of young graduates, many of whom had never actually farmed. Basic stakeholder and operations research would have revealed that all of these assumptions were untenable. As any beginning rural sociologist knows, subsistence farmers are quite rational and many inter- related variables affect their agricultural decision-making15. Modern technical information brings with it untested, therefore risky, practices and may require unaffordable inputs, such as fertilizer. In addition, technical recommendations may require more of his time and he may decide his time is better spent at non-agricultural employment or leisure. Review of the second assumption exposes an inconvenient reality: that much agricultural research in developing countries is too far removed from farm conditions to be readily applied. Thus, the T&V content was of dubious value. Finally, in most developing country cultures, juniors do not advise seniors. Despite their educational attainments, young graduates are not in a position to advise their elders nor does their book learning necessarily impress real farmers. The lack of field research also resulted in extension workers arriving in villages during the day to \u201cdeliver their messages\u201d while all the farmers were out in their field working. Only be imposition of their status as government officials could the extension workers assemble the farmers. To sum up, lack of basic stakeholder analysis and field research led to the wholesale adoption of an inappropriate technical solution for agricultural development.

The overall T&V model derived from conditions on Israeli kibbutzim whose members were highly motivated to increase production. This model is almost military in its regimentation. In other words, in the absence of any process consultation among researchers, fieldwork and farmers, there were no feedback and therefore no opportunities to adapt service delivery to the needs of beneficiaries. 20 Annex 2: Facilitating Change: Tools and practical guidance for practitioners This is a listing of some potential tools that may be useful in affecting change management. By definition, managing change involves the coming together of different aspects of capacity development work \u2013 diagnostics, leadership development, organisational development and so on. The below is an eclectic references of these tools. UNDP\u2019s Capacity Assessment Practice Note explains the basics of capacity assessments-concepts, entry points, and methodological issues. The Note includes a review of selected organisational assessment tools and develops a default UNDP framework and tool to assess the enabling environment/national level capacity. Change forecasting- Tool developed by DFID that helps identification of interventions that promote change, assists in the measurement of performance and in the assessment of particular sectors where reform may take place. Open Systems Model- This model is recommended for a diagnosis of the strategic/institutional environment, and organisational problems. 7-S technique- This technique describes 7 key interdependent organisational variables that need to be taken into account in organisational design. It facilitates understanding of both strategy and structure, as well as management style, systems, procedures, skills and values in the organisation. SWOT analysis- This is a tool for assessing and communicating the current position of an organisation or a particular change option in terms of its internal Strengths and Weakness and the external Opportunities and Threats it faces. Problem Tree Analyses- this analyses helps to illustrate the linkages between a set of complex issues which contribute to an institutional problem and identify the underlying causes. Soft System Methodology (SSM)- SSM focuses on facilitating better understanding of issues or problems among actors. The value of SSM is in enabling creation of more ideas and opportunities for change that contribute to achieving \u2018accommodations\u2019 between different actors with their differing interests and values (Checkland & Scholes, 1990). Balanced Scorecard- This tool was originally developed to expand the ways in which organisations measure beyond the financial dimension and it has become an effective tool for encouraging alignment and developing cultural change. The Balanced Scorecard approach insists that management track four different types of measures: Financial measures, Customer measures, Internal Business (Process) measures, and Innovation and Learning measures. Using the Balanced Scorecard approach, and organisation identifies corporate objectives within each of the four categories, then aligns the management hierarchy by assigning each manager his or her own scorecard with more specific", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c1eddbe-2247-4dd8-a1eb-d195d12f972d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c1eddbe-2247-4dd8-a1eb-d195d12f972d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "cd2e24fe0206178c4032ad1b6c2e7c145ecac6321beda8d3d9648ed65df7689d"}}, "hash": "cd2e24fe0206178c4032ad1b6c2e7c145ecac6321beda8d3d9648ed65df7689d", "text": "objectives in each of the four categories. Properly used, the system focuses every manager on a balanced set of performance measures (Kaplan & Norton, 1992). Content, context and process model- Helps identify factors important for shaping organisations\u2019 performance and provides diagnostic checklists which can be used to assess the likely reception of a particular intervention in a specific locale. Five Why\u2019s- Tool that helps get to the root of the problem and helps managers resist the temptation to deal with symptoms rather than causes. Stakeholder management- This is a technique to identify the individuals or groups who will be affected by the changes or have the ability to impact on the change process. It also helps develop a strategy to manage these stakeholders. 21 Process consultation- This form of management consultation aims at initiating and sustaining process of change and continuous learning for systemic improvement. Process consultation suspends power and hierarchy, thus providing space for change. Moreover, it places the responsibility for change upon the members of the organisation, hence securing their ownership for the best change proposals (UNDP, 2003) Future search methodology- This approach brings together stakeholders to explore past, present and future; identify shared values and commit to actions plans. Future search brings stakeholders together as peers working on tasks of mutual concern (UNDP, 2003) Total Quality management (TQM) \u2013 process that aims to establish organised continuous improvement activities by involving everyone in an organisation in an integrated effort toward improving performance at every level. The focus of TQM is on processes of work rather than on the workers themselves. Through a process of data collection, analysis, hypothesis formation, and hypothesis testing, changes to processes can be devised and introduced steadily to improve quality in the long term. Business process re-engineering (BPR)- technique for radical change in organisations. The main concepts that underpin BPR include the following: direction comes from top management, radical change of process, organisations should be organised around key processes rather than specialist functions, narrow specialists should be replaced by multi-skilled workers working in self-managed teams. Benchmarking- system or methodology that identifies specific (best) practices and processes leading to high performance and excellent results. The process endeavours to understand how these practices and processes work and adapt and apply them in the organisation. The purpose and benefit of benchmarking is continuous organisation improvement and strengthening of driving forces for success, thus giving organization a competitive edge. The European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) Excellence Model- This model provides a framework for assessing the aspects of performance which make an organisation successful. The framework is non-prescriptive and can be used as a tool for Self-Assessment, as a way to Benchmark with other organizations, as a guide to identify areas for Improvement, as the basis for a common Vocabulary and a way of thinking or as a Structure for the organisation's management system. Knowledge Management: Enhancing learning requires involving all stakeholders in the change process from the planning stage, through monitoring change process, measuring results and codify lessons learned. Establishes learning and knowledge sharing networks, data bases and e- discussions. Develops partnerships through communities of practice and knowledge networks (such as, for example, UNDP Capacity2015 Information and Learning Network) facilitates access to information, expertise and good practices. The Learning Organisations- The concept of the Learning Organisation is increasingly popular as organisations attempt to develop structures and systems that nurture innovation. There is growing consensus about the features that characterise the Learning Organisation, which imply changes in structure, information systems, human resources practices, organisational culture and leadership. 22 Annex 3: Failure of Change Efforts \u2013 What to Look out For Experts' opinions converge on several causes that can derail change efforts. A brief summary from development and management literature on why change fails, is below. Failing to understand the context of change Primary findings from evaluations of World Bank programmes suggest that the quality of institutions is a key determinant of development impact and that, despite this finding, many World Bank interventions do not adequately address institutional concerns, suggesting that there is a \u2018mismatch between the requirements of successful institutional reform and traditional ways of going about the aid business\u2019 (World Bank, 2002). All change efforts, thus, eventually run into constraints embedded in the management systems or culture of the organisation and fail to reach their potential (Senge, 1996). The context in which organisations are embedded shape the conditions for their change and development (DANIDA, 2005). Failing to fully understand different factors that support or impede change, such as power differentials and incentive systems, can result in developing change intervention which inadvertently undermines ownership of change", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "21a5a144-f5cc-4fb3-a404-9a83e4378bbf": {"__data__": {"id_": "21a5a144-f5cc-4fb3-a404-9a83e4378bbf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "283be12f77dae652dcc014422a5a744ac9aa5bd377df5cc6dfb4dca553a58b0a"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e803d16-6242-4255-a2fe-bc7179a5dfbb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "79883dc1ee809704ce64439fdf488f113e30953865267ddef955db887c0f7f21"}}, "hash": "27db257802b1fd6f38dd565f7a9a8e2511b016a661b5c948751ee5d409bdef54", "text": "process by creating \u2018vicious cycle of disempowerment\u2019 and \u2018vicious circle of demotivation\u2019 (Theisohn & Courtnadge, 2005). Recent thinking on development emphasises the complex and unpredictable \u2013 emergent - nature of change. Consideration of the emergent nature of change highlights the need for organisations to understand and be able to work within complex systems, to nurture flexibility, adaptability and innovation. Increasing people\u2019s ability to understand the consequences of their actions, and to adapt and change the way they work is recognised as an \u2018essential requirement for enabling organisations to respond to the new and often unpredictable challenges that face them in a complex aid environment\u2019 (Britton, 2005). Moreover, changing organisations also means changing the way people in those organisations work. Hence, deep organisational change requires a change in people. \u2018Redrawing the lines and boxes in your organisational chart without addressing the way people within the organisation interact may be like rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic\u2019 (senge, 1996). Therefore, change initiatives must be planned paying attention to the impact they will have on each individual. Failure to make a compelling case for change To succeed, institutional reform efforts must be supported by public officials. However, officials may resist new systems if they challenge existing incentive structures or require officials to change their behavior (World Bank, 2005). Failing to create a sense of urgency and win over hearts and minds will reduce impact of change programmes (Kotter, 1998). Moreover, a critical mass at each level of the organisation must be convinced of the need to change. Argyris (1998) argues that the demise of many modern change efforts is inherent in their design. He points out that change programmes often put out mixed messages. For example, a programme theoretically designed to empower the staff is often based on top management's vision and strategy, leaving the staff little scope for creating some part of the programme they might identify with and commit to. Success of organisational change depends equally on the soundness of the change approach as on the implementation, respect for different points of view and the degree of support from influential organisation members. 23 Failure to create a vision to help direct the change effort Clear vision directing the change is essential for change effort to succeed. \u2018Whenever you cannot describe the vision driving a change initiative in five minutes or less and get a reaction that signifies both understanding and interest, you are in for trouble\u2019 (Kotter, 1998). Moreover, the acceptance of the change in public sector organisations is likely to be increased when the change is tied to a noble mission which points out how the change would help the organisation improve the welfare of its clients, contribute to society, and boost employee job satisfaction (Ingstrup & Crookall, 1998). However, regardless of the level of acceptance, change initiatives will lose credibility if managers do not \u2018live the change vision\u2019 or if they are \u2018talking, but not walking\u2019 (Kotter, 1998). Failure to recognise obstacles to change In the public sector organisations, there is a tendency to continually apply old remedies to new problems and situations, while failing to address the \u2018perennial problems frequently alluded to by organisational members such as ineffective communication and risk aversion\u2019 (McHugh & Bennett 1999). Kotter (1998) likewise argues that employees, even though they embrace the new vision, feel disempowered by obstacles in their paths that management knows about, but doesn\u2019t remove. Uncertainty about the process of change contributes to its failure (Argyris, 1998). One of the reasons for this is managers' unwillingness to face and air potentially difficult and discordant views. Moreover, every change initiative will have winners and losers, the prospect of which may create a high degree of resentment, which in turn reduces motivation for change (Amabile, 1998). Prospect of changes in the way people work causes anxiety which, in turn, causes resistance. Hence, Marsh (2001) claims that \u2018only people who instigate change enjoy it; others have to suffer it\u2019. Ingstrup & Crookall (1998) suggest not enough attention is paid to \u2018the stifling effect of bureaucracy\u2019. In spite of their commitment to the mission, people in public sector organisations get impatient with procedures that are counterproductive to the rules. Likewise, Henry et al (2002) suggest that finding a balance between freedom and structure will enable a creative climate and, thus, facilitate the intended change process.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0e803d16-6242-4255-a2fe-bc7179a5dfbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "0e803d16-6242-4255-a2fe-bc7179a5dfbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "283be12f77dae652dcc014422a5a744ac9aa5bd377df5cc6dfb4dca553a58b0a"}, "2": {"node_id": "21a5a144-f5cc-4fb3-a404-9a83e4378bbf", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "27db257802b1fd6f38dd565f7a9a8e2511b016a661b5c948751ee5d409bdef54"}}, "hash": "79883dc1ee809704ce64439fdf488f113e30953865267ddef955db887c0f7f21", "text": "Failure to persevere and maintain focus on change Some staff can feel anxiety during the early stages of a change effort while the leaders are still enthusiastic about change and, without focusing on operational needs the leaders risk \u2018performance dip\u2019 (Ingstrup and Crookall, 1998).

It is \u2018the hard work in between\u2019 that demands the attention during the change (ibid.). Change is messy and Kanter warns that everything looks like failure in the \u2018miserable middle\u2019 of change, with people inclined to give up. Hence, failure to plan for \u2018performance dips\u2019 and maintain commitment through the change effort is likely to result in failure. Neglecting the dynamics of personal and organisational transition These dynamics of transition, according to Bridges & Michell (2000), determine the outcome of any change effort and neglecting them can cause changes to fall short. They also suggest that change initiatives fail to address the leader's need to coach others through the transition process. People must go through three separate processes, all of them upsetting: (1) saying goodbye (to the old ways that they possibly liked or were familiar with), (2) shifting into neutral, and (3) moving forward. There is a natural tendency to hang back and see how others handle the new beginning. Moreover, Kotter (1998) suggests that employees\u2019 resilience needs to be fostered by providing safe environments for risk taking, rewarding large and small successes, and celebrating victories. 24 Not having a guiding coalition Major changes are difficult to accomplish, hence a powerful force is required to sustain the process (Kotter, 1998). Not having a guiding coalition, hence means there may be lack of energy to drive the process to its completion. Managers often underestimate the difficulty and effort that change initiatives demand, thus failing to budget enough management time and resources (ibid.). Moreover, Senge (1996) points out that the precondition for building a team for leading the change is that people perceive themselves as needing one another, however \u2018a lot of senior executives don't perceive this with respect to the other members of the top team\u2019, hence many managers attempt to go it alone instead of being \u2018collaborative leaders\u2019 (Linden, 2003). Not addressing the \"soft\" aspects of change It is relatively less challenging to change organisational structures and to create new forms, however it is much more difficult to change the values, meanings and world-views through which people operate and which inform their practice. But, unless this cultural change occurs at the same time, the intended change will not come about. Successful organisational change requires taking culture seriously. Assets that cannot be controlled by rule are most critical to success. Argyris (1998) points out that people often have an espoused theory- what they tell the world is the way things work and how they behave. Many of the public sector organisations espouse the \u2018way things are done around here\u2019 theory. However, as Argyris notes, many of us in fact act differently from our espoused beliefs, we act on our \u2018theories in use\u2019. People's ideas, their commitment to high standards of competence, and their connections of trust with partners are what set apart great organisations (Kanter, 1999). Whilst these requirements can be enhanced by leaders, they cannot be mandated. Mintzberg (1989) warns that one of the major difficulties with public sector organisations will be in trying to implement profound cultural change when an important element of the surrounding culture will be unchanged, such as if senior managers condemn mistakes and losses and don\u2019t praise risks that are taken thus creating an asymmetrical reward system. Not having assessment and measurement systems in place Public sector organisations today fail to learn from change. Philosopher Santayana (1905) wrote that \u2018those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u2019. Information, best practices and lessons learned are of little value, unless they lead to new and more productive actions, hence Senge (2003) suggests that success depends on the application of best practices. Kotter (1998) argues that assessment and measurement systems need to be adjusted to track the success of change initiatives, otherwise it becomes impossible to register the build-up of momentum and celebrate early victories. However, he also warns against declaring victory too soon, and neglecting to anchor changes firmly in the organisational culture, which may lead to regress of effort. Many public service organisations place a great deal of emphasis on denying error, rather than detecting and correcting it. According to Senge (1998) the litmus test for measuring openness in an organisation is simple: How fast does bad news travel upward? In most organisations good news travels upward faster than the speed of light, but the failure is denied even before the word is uttered. He suggests that staff involved in the change process should understand that the process of change is", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8cd7020e-5840-4e0b-82db-bddea0d1dcb7": {"__data__": {"id_": "8cd7020e-5840-4e0b-82db-bddea0d1dcb7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Institutional Reform and Change Management", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "16d3ed6c5fa8681cd233699546a99c1f067ab3bac7a3f884b1c8102cae94a7e8"}, "3": {"node_id": "7ecc4c9e-5f60-4b5c-a5c5-fc38ad462eba", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/institutional-reform-and-change-management", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "07942e62ac673494789950e7e5df87999ffa9458536075207f6079dc5a0fcad1"}}, "hash": "630aedb28e87f20ac08449b1e231d888f91cf695b3e88a1ef521ae6b25870a30", "text": "a process of failure. By its nature, change is a continual learning process. Hence, the organisation must encourage experimenting, assessment, reflecting on the mission, identifying results and then experimenting some more (Henry, 2001) Chris Argyris (1991) lays out a basic problem of learning in organisations. He notes that most people in organisations are quite smart, but that to succeed, they've learned to find correct answers and 25 cover up incorrect ones. This undermines the inquiry skills essential to successful change and leadership because these skills revolve around how to \"uncover\" what isn't working in ways that do not invoke defensiveness. 26 Annex 4: Bibliography Ackerman, L.

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. This paper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the Micronesian Conservation Trust (MCT), which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as a case study1. The MCT is selected to provide an interesting case for countries in Asia-Pacific because of the following characteristics: 1. The structure of the MCT (the legal status of the MCT as a non-profit organization). The existing structure of the MCT allows for strong multi-stakeholders engagement with a Board of Trustees consisting of high-profiled and well-qualified people from Micronesian jurisdictions in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) as well as international members from outside the region. 2. The evolution of MCT. The most significant development in the growth and success of MCT has been its expansion beyond FSM to include in its programs the whole Micronesian Region by including the countries of Palau and the Marshall Islands as well as the United States territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The scale of the MCT operations currently covers a total sea area of 6.7 million km2, representing more than 20% of the Pacific Island region and 5% of the largest ocean in the world. 3. The capacity to raise funds and manage different types of funds. The MCT\u2019s assets have been growing significantly over time. In 2004, the fund began with only US$ 50,000 of contribution from an anonymous donor. Currently, in 2012 the MCT\u2019s operating budget totals US$ 2.8 million, with a granting portfolio of US$ 1.8 million. The MCT currently manages several endowment funds and sinking funds. The MCT also provides financial services for other donors or funders to channel grants for intended beneficiaries through its intermediary granting. This report provides the summary of the overall design of the MCT and a short description about the process of the establishment and the management of the MCT. A brief analysis of the lessons-learned from the establishment and management of the MCT are then presented. The case study analysis involved: literature review to set the scope of the study and in-depth interviews with the Executive Director of the MCT.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39c40a20-2d92-446d-bf14-dcc8e4f98c19": {"__data__": {"id_": "39c40a20-2d92-446d-bf14-dcc8e4f98c19", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-micronesian-conservation-trust", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-micronesian-conservation-trust", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "469767981bd62961b35a1e811836e2da3ed014cd28e590c3ea55eb53305f434a"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c951550-629f-4537-98ca-3e85c64dad8f", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-micronesian-conservation-trust", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c2eb2b40d36588524ee77eae93318a9b5162483fc35aa662f3806e85ff0f3608"}}, "hash": "2b3d20e8b7b881d4474fa6f9df9e03c54c311e4d64a40265021c96350e283477", "text": "1 National funds selected for the case study analysis are: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, China CMD Fund, Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund, Thailand Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, Lao Environmental Protection Fund, Micronesian Conservation Trust and Tuvalu Trust Fund 4 Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust The design of the MCT at a Glance The role of the MCT in financing conservation in Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) MCT is the region\u2019s only conservation trust fund, and is one of the key regional, international, and US Federal agencies and organizations, that together form the Regional Support Team (RST)2.

The Micronesia Challenge Initiative is a high-level commitment made by the Chief Executives of each of the five Micronesian jurisdictions (Republic of Palau, FSM, Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam) to effectively conserve at least 30% of near-shore marine and 20% of the terrestrial resources across Micronesia by 20203. In its role as the financial mechanism of the Micronesia Challenge Initiative, MCT assists the MC jurisdictions raise, invest, disburse and manage the Micronesia Challenge Endowment Fund, as well as other sinking funds towards MC\u2019s ongoing activities. The legal status The MCT aims to manage and provide funds for the accomplishment of its mission: \u201cto support biodiversity conservation and related sustainable development for the people of Micronesia by providing long term sustained funding.\u201d The MCT was granted as a Non-Profit Corporation Charter by the President of the Federated States of Micronesia in November 2002. Subsequently, the MCT obtained its registration as nonprofit corporation in the Federated States of Micronesia, through a Registry Certificate issued by the Federated States of Micronesia Registrar of Corporations, based on its corresponding Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The MCT adheres to policies and standards set out in its Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws and Operations Manual as duly adopted and approved under the laws of the Federated States of Micronesia. The model: different types of funds The MCT currently manages two different types of funds: a set of endowment funds and advised sinking funds, which are both used to support the annual operation and direct grantmaking program. Currently, the MCT provides grants (known as a direct grant making program) that are funded through a variety of sinking funds and will eventually be financed by sustainable revenue provided by MCT\u2019s Endowment Fund. Each of these funds is discussed below. 2 Key partners of the RST include: The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Conservation International (CI), the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP), RARE International, Palau International Coral Reef Center (PICRC), Global Island Partnership (GLISPA), Pacific Marine Resources Institute (PMRI), Locally Managed Marine Area (LMMA) Network, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS), the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA), the US Forest Service (USFS), the US Department of Interior, Office of Insular Affairs (OIA), and the local conservation NGOs in each island. 3 Remengseau T.

For this purpose, the MCT creates a new Advised Sinking Fund, which is an account managed in the MCT\u2019s accounting system for a specific granting purpose. The purpose of the MCT\u2019s sinking fund is to support MCT\u2019s grantmaking and operations over a predetermined timeframe. The use of the fund should be in compliance with an Intermediary/regranting agreement between the Board of Trustees of MCT and the donor. In contrast to the endowment fund, all sinking fund capital is used (for payments to cover project, administrative and other costs). The use of the sinking fund is determined by the MCT\u2019s proposal to respective donors and agreed in the contracts/agreements with the donors. The amount allocated for operations and for direct grantmaking is also determined by the contracts/agreements between MCT and the donors. The MCT has never received a donation and/or grant without agreed terms of the use of the fund. In the last four years the MCT management fee is an average of less than 20 percent. For example, in 2011, the MCT\u2019s management fee was at 16 percent with the remaining amount is spent for providing grants to its implementing partners (Table 1). Over the past five years, MCT has managed several \u2018advised funds\u2019 and re-granted resources to relevant conservation community projects. These include funds from donors such as: the German Ministry of Environment, US Department of Interior, US NOAA, the Non- State Actors Funds from the European Union\u2019s Economic Development Fund (EDF9) to the FSM, alongside funds from other foreign governments and private foundations. Finally, the MCT also received and secured Climate Change Adaptation funds from German ICI, Australian Government and other private donors to begin putting a climate lens on protected areas management plans, as well as support for on the ground adaptation activities. 6 Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust Table 1.

There is also an ex- officio (non-voting) Board member from The Nature Conservancy, who is a major donor to the Micronesia Challenge Endowment Fund. It is a self-selecting Board and members are selected based on their expertise, contributions and commitment to Micronesia\u2019s (sustainable) development. Each Board Member must be nominated based on their contributions to science, conservation, sustainable development and their overall commitment to the Micronesia Sub-region. Each term is for three years and individual Board Members have the possibility of serving an additional three-year term if nominated and re- confirmed by the existing Board.

The term of service of Investment Committee members is three years with the potential to renew the position to only a second term. The MCT currently implements two grant-making programs: direct grant-making program and intermediary grant-making program. The direct grant-making program is currently funded through a variety of sinking funds and will eventually be financed by sustainable revenue provided by MCT\u2019s Endowment Fund. The two different grants provided under the direct grant-making program are4: \uf0b7 Project grants to a specific program or initiative undertaken by an individual organization or a group of organizations. MCT awards grants to government and nongovernmental organizations for projects related to the protection and management of targeted marine and terrestrial areas. These projects include direct management activities, e.g. monitoring and evaluation work, support of alternative economic activities to replace unsustainable practices, and related public awareness strategies to inform and gain support from community members. \uf0b7 Capacity Building Grants to increase the capacity of organizations. MCT\u2019s conservation outcomes are also achieved through its capacity building programs. These include two peer learning networks (Micronesians in Island Conservation and Pacific Islands Managed and Protected Areas Community) coordinated by MCT and designed to strengthen leadership, increase knowledge, experience and skills, and catalyze regional collaborations. MCT capacity building also includes grants for technical assistance and training to grantee organizations to strengthen their ability to successfully achieve conservation goals. With the intermediary grant-making program, the MCT also serves as an intermediary to other foundations and donors who need assistance in their grant-making to the Micronesia Region. The MCT provides assistance through the re-granting of their funds to appropriate conservation organizations and projects that share MCT\u2019s mission of conservation and climate adaptation in Micronesia. For project selection, the MCT issues a call for proposals approved by the board. Once project proposals are received, the management staff will assess them to ensure all the criteria and requested information and supporting documents are met by project proponents. Direct grant-making projects that meet all the requirements are provided to the Technical Project Review Committee for their reviews and comments. Their comments are compiled and shared to the Board of Trustees to help the board make final approval and/or disapproval of projects. In some cases, the board will allow the project proponent to improve their project proposal for further consideration. With intermediary grant-making projects, the MCT works with donors and the grantees to determine the specific terms of contracts and activities. Once the projects are approved, the Executive staff carries out a due diligence exercise to make sure the project proponent can manage the project funds with prudence. The MCT looks at their accounting systems and internal controls, as well as their project management capabilities. The organizations\u2019 audit reports are sometime required depending on the level of funding provided. Fiduciary standards The MCT follows the Generally Accepted Auditing Principles maintained by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, widely followed and recognized in the United States. The MCT also commissions independent financial audits. In lieu of an official audit committee, MCT outlines in detail the fiduciary responsibilities of the Board of Directors in the Bylaws. For its accounting work, MCT has among its staff a Finance Officer who prepares all the financial reports, such as the Financial 4 Micronesia Conservation Trust Annual Report of the Micronesia Conservation Trust (Pohnpei, Micronesia Conservation Trust, 2008); Micronesia Conservation Trust Annual Report of the Micronesia Conservation Trust (Pohnpei, Micronesia Conservation Trust, 2010) 8 Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust Statements previously indicated, and maintains MCT\u2019s Chart of Accounts, which lists each account that the accounting system tracks.

These systems allow MCT to conduct its accounting processes in accordance with high level accounting standards in order to efficiently and transparently track both restricted and non-restricted donations and grants, and performing the functional classification of expenses and income. The establishment of the MCT The political and legal process The establishment of the MCT was initiated during the first meeting of the group that was to become the MCT steering committee. The meeting, held in Chuuk State in 2001, was attended by seventeen people representing various organizations and conservation-related interests from FSM\u2019s four states. The meeting was to decide whether there was sufficient interest in establishing a Conservation Trust Fund (CTF) in FSM, and if so to determine the next steps and how to overcome any identified challenges. The major outcome of the Chuuk meeting was unanimous support for a CTF in FSM and the group constituted itself as a steering committee mandated to achieve that purpose5. The establishment of the MCT was initiated around the same time with the negotiations for the renewal of The Compact of Free Association between FSM and the United States of America (the Compact). The \u2018environment\u2019 was considered as an additional sector for the renegotiated Compact both alleviated much concern regarding future environmental protection in FSM. This was crucial in terms of generating sufficient interest among the relevant stakeholders in coming together to discuss establishing a CTF such as the MCT. The strategy and the hope among environment stakeholders at that time was that the FSM National Government would agree to allocate a portion of the environment sector Compact funds towards a CTF. However, ultimately that strategy proved fruitless in that the FSM Government decided not to include a CTF in their package of requests, leaving MCT in a difficult position6. In early 2004, the MCT could only raise less than US $100,000. At the July 2004 Board meeting it was reported to the Board of Trustees that MCT had sufficient funds to operate only until October of that year7. At that time the necessary shift in strategy was decided. \u2018MCT needed to demonstrate what a CTF is; how this mechanism actually works on the ground. We decided to forget the Compact idea and focus on implementing a small pilot grant program to showcase the usefulness of MCT to stakeholders in FSM and to external donors\u20198. In its early phase of operation the reluctance of the FSM National Government to provide anything other than verbal support for MCT was clearly an inhibiting factor. The efforts to establish the MCT took about 3 years since stakeholder consultations and expert scoping analysis started early in 2000 until the end of 2002 when it got chartered and registered before the FSM Government\u2019s agencies.

MCT\u2019s regionalization greatly assisted the emergence of the most important development in Micronesian conservation policy and governance, namely the Micronesia Challenge. The five Micronesian jurisdictions re-affirmed their commitment to the Micronesia Challenge at the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity and have since put in place measures to oversee its implementation11. As previously discussed, the MCT was then appointed as the financing mechanism of the Micronesia Challenge. The MCT further signed a series of memoranda of understanding with the governments and administrations of the region\u2019s to ensure cooperation in developing guidelines and procedures for managing and disbursing the substantial Micronesia Challenge Endowment Fund. Under the agreements, the MCT will assist each country in developing country program strategies consistent with the broader regional strategy, including targets, milestones and measures to be achieved. Additionally, the agreements call on the MCT to work closely with the jurisdictions to develop sustainable financing plans and a business plan for the Micronesia Challenge. These agreements greatly assist in institutionalizing the Micronesia Challenge and providing detailed plans of action by which its goals shall be met12.

One other example that expresses MCT\u2019s extensive capability to build capacity of external partners and grantees on financial management and budgeting skills is the training workshop on how to use the accounting software QuickBooks Premiere Nonprofit, offered by MCT\u2019s Financial Officer. This training course provided guidance on how to use the software and also offers simpler systems for grantee partners without the need for highly sophisticated accounting system. By offering this course, MCT has established a capacity building platform around its accounting services that enhances the organizational capacity as well as the grantee partners\u2019. The monitoring and evaluation system Project monitoring activities are conducted by the Conservation Program Staff. The Conservation Program Manager assigns projects for monitoring to one of the two grants officers or retains responsibility for certain projects as appropriate. The assigned staff then assumes responsibility for the finalization of contract documents, workplans and reporting schedules and requirements in conjunction with the MCT Conservation Program Manager. The MCT staff then maintains regular contact with the project staff, issuing reminders of reports due, handling concerns, making referrals for technical assistance and advice as needed and others. The Conservation Program Staff also conducts regular site visits to monitor the progress of MCT funded projects. These occur at least quarterly, and sometimes as needed between regularly scheduled visits.

For projects/grants over $10,000, the grantee needs to submit r\u00e9sum\u00e9s for the project coordinator/manager and other relevant staff, a history of prior grants from other funders and an annual report or other documents describing the organization\u2019s activities and accomplishments for the last two years are also required. The Finance Officer and the DED review the financial documents, while the Conservation Program Manager and Capacity-Building Program Manager provide input as to the proponent\u2019s technical and organizational capacity to carry out the project. MCT does not apply formal risk assessments because of the small size and closely-knit nature of the Micronesia conservation field. However, the MCT management team and other staff are aware of potential risks to project implementation, especially with regard to organizational and staff technical capacity, work-loads and commitments. Partner agencies and NGOs are aware of and share with MCT potential risks when community organizations are involved and assist with abating these threats. When it is determined that the project proponent (these are usually the community groups) does not have the capacity to manage the funds prudently MCT will request a fiscal sponsor (this role is usually carried out by a more established NGO for a fee). In addition, the MCT Regional Grants Technical Committee assesses project proposals for feasibility and also considers potential risks to the successful implementation of the proposed projects. This committee also is available for advice and guidance if and when a project encounters difficulties or challenges during project implementation and has served in the past to assist with the re-focusing of project activities and/or the scope of activities in order to achieve the desired project results. Lessons-learned Stakeholder engagement and political enabling condition Strong stakeholder engagement creates a basis for good governance during the establishment and the implementation of the MCT. During the setting up of the MCT, the planning and consultation process was conducted in a coordinated manner. \uf0b7 First, the planning and consultation process addressed the challenge of interstate competition over the MCT. This issue was addressed by establishing the MCT Board representation upon what was termed an \u201ceco-regional basis\u201d. Representation on the initial MCT Board would provide equity throughout the country by regarding the FSM not as divided between four States, but as \u2018high-islands\u2019 and \u2018low-islands\u2019 (atolls) each with different ecological and social issues and priorities13. \uf0b7 Second, the consultation and planning for MCT was undertaken at the same time as the FSM\u2019s National Biodiversity Strategy Action Plan (NBSAP) process. Many stakeholder consultation and planning meetings were conducted for the purpose of NBSAP preparation and these served as fora in which the nascent MCT could be introduced and described to key individuals and organizations concerned with biodiversity conservation in FSM. The FSM NBSAP identifies the MCT as the primary funding mechanism for many of its activities. Coordination between the development of the MCT along with the principle biodiversity 13 Ibid., pg. 16 12 Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust plans at State and National level ensured a detailed awareness in relation to environmental and conservation issues in FSM among a broad set of stakeholders14. The existing structure of the MCT as a non-profit organization allows for multi-stakeholder engagement. The members of the Board of the Trustee represent a selection of people from civil society conservation organizations.

A disadvantage to this structure may be that due to the self-selecting Board structure, some government leaders may have reservations about the lack of control they may have over the MCT. Fund Raising Capacity Instead of commencing operations with a large guaranteed funding source, the MCT had to operate from very limited resources. The MCT was forced, through circumstances not of its own choosing, to develop an incremental approach to fundraising has produced unforeseen benefits and strengths for the organization; those of a \u201cbottom up\u201d approach. Being forced to build upon small successes over time to generate what are now substantial financial resources created within those closely associated with MCT a significant sense of ownership and empowerment in a multiple set of stakeholders in FSM15. The success factors of the MCT in generating substantial financial resources include: \uf0b7 Maintaining trust \u2013 starting with limited resources required the MCT to prove their ability to manage, disburse and monitor funds carefully. Building this track record required the MCT to be a solid and fully operational organization to expand its area of focus. The MCT has built a strong support team to help evaluate its progress and to provide guidance as well as to suggest adaptive management when necessary. International donors considering giving support to the MCT appreciate that it is managed in light of requirements of the MCT\u2019s donors for transparency and accountability for the spending of all funds provided, and the MCT\u2019s developing track record of success is enhancing donor confidence in its operations and in the projects supported by it. \uf0b7 Serving as a funding mediator \u2013 the MCT developed a capacity to perform what could be described as \u2018funding mediator\u2019 roles. This occurs as MCT is highly cognizant of the economic, cultural, political and ecological landscape in Micronesia and is thus well-placed to decide which initiatives and organizations warrant funding, to efficiently monitor projects and to provide guidance and mentoring to local grantees16. \uf0b7 Building on its comparative advantage \u2013 the MCT will only take on an effort if it will add value to it. 14 Ibid. 15 Ibid., pg. 20 16 Ibid., pg. 24 13 Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust The advantage of a subregional fund in the Pacific The advantage of operating the fund at a subregional level is the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of having such an entity. Specifically, the Pacific region is one of the most complicated regions because the countries and islands are spread out and logistically difficult for transportation. The Pacific Region is also complex due to the high diversity in culture, resource management and tenure systems. The MCT serving as a subregional financing mechanism for Micronesia makes sense based on the long history of working together. The cultures, long tenure and resource management issues are also quite similar which puts MCT in a good position to address these issues in a culturally sensitive manner. This type of fund can also be suggested for the case of a climate fund or for the Adaptation Fund in the Pacific although assessment considering country specific characteristics is crucial. 14 Case Study Report: Micronesian Conservation Trust Authors: Jorge Gastelumendi, Silvia Irawan, Lisa Schindler, William Kostka, Kevin Petrini, Alex Heikens Cover Photo: Lien Heikens Disclaimer: The views expressed in this publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent those of the United Nations, including UNDP, or its member states.

To provide a technical input to the knowledge sharing, UNDP commissioned seven case studies on existing national funds in the fields of environment, conservation, energy, climate change and development. This paper reports the lessons learned extracted from the establishment and management of the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF), which is one of seven national funds across the Asia-Pacific region selected as a case study.1 This report first summarizes the design of the TTF and provides a short description about the establishment and the management of the TTF. The lessons-learned from the establishment and management of the TTF are then presented. The case study analysis involved: literature review to set the scope of the study and in-depth interviews with relevant stakeholders, including the Fund Manager and Staff from the TTF. Prior to finalization, the report has been reviewed by the TTF team and the UNDP Pacific Centre. The design of the TTF at a glance The legal status The establishment of the TTF was marked by the signing of an international agreement between The Tuvalu Government and potential donors. The donors involved at the establishment stage were UK, Australia and New Zealand only. Japan and Korea came in the following year but have since not really increased their contributions into the fund. in Suva on 16 June 1987. The purpose of the Fund (as stated in the International Agreement) is to contribute to the long-term financial viability of Tuvalu by providing an additional source of revenue for recurrent expenses of the Government of Tuvalu. The TTF therefore aims to: \u2022 Assist the Government to achieve greater financial authority in the management of its recurrent budget; \u2022 Enable the Government to maintain and if possible improve existing levels of social infrastructure and services; \u2022 Enhance the capacity of the Government to receive and effectively utilize external capital development and technical assistance; \u2022 Enable the Government to meet long-term maintenance and operating costs of social and economic infrastructure and services; and \u2022 Assist the Government to develop the economy of Tuvalu. The fund\u2019s model The TTF has demonstrated that the Trust Fund concept for support to a national budget can have very positive benefits for a small state that lacks the resources and capacity to develop the economy by itself. The TTF contributes around 20 per cent budget revenues, particularly during the diminishing budgetary aid (absolute and percent revenue). The initial value of the Fund was A$27.1 million contributed by: 1 National funds selected for the case study analysis are: Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation, China CMD Fund, Cambodia Climate Change Alliance Trust Fund, Thailand Energy Conservation Promotion Fund, Lao Environmental Protection Fund, Micronesian Conservation Trust and Tuvalu Trust Fund: http://www.snap-undp.org/elibrary/default.aspx 4 Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund \u2022 Tuvalu A$1.6 million \u2022 Australia A$8.0 million \u2022 New Zealand A$8.3 million \u2022 United Kingdom A$8.5 million \u2022 Japan A$0.7 million \u2022 South Korea A$31,000 Since establishment there have been additional contributions of A$38.6 million: \u2022 Tuvalu A$28.2 million \u2022 Australia A$6.4 million \u2022 New Zealand A$3.2 million \u2022 South Korea A$37,821 In recent years the objectives set by the Board for the fund managers has been to provide a real annual return of 4.5 per cent on the capital.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35bda4b7-f94d-4d81-86c9-6329c5e443fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "35bda4b7-f94d-4d81-86c9-6329c5e443fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-tuvalu-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-tuvalu-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "06a7c6cf9ff71df2b4e7105f1ae2fafbc0f632cf3ff869f0b6aac41bc2dca365"}, "2": {"node_id": "b07fbf23-efd3-44c7-b95c-9bbdd5c4072e", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-tuvalu-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "ff62371f4beed5d174795a6730b018ec652927b77a2ce413b1d1491171f75a6b"}}, "hash": "514b5e04f2153456f4bd06b740be64970d2982e88d0266f814ef3b6a1dec562b", "text": "It has grown from its small A$27.1 million (initial contributions from its establishment) in 1987 to a comfortable A$127 million (Maintained Value as at March 2012).2 The TTF has an innovative \u201cbinary trust fund structure.\u201d The binary structure consists of an endowment fund and a revolving fund.

By agreement, the value of the \u2018A Account\u2019 must be maintained in real terms (including calculations for inflation and administrative expenses). Only during years when the \u2018A Account\u2019s\u2019 Market Value exceeds the Maintained Value does the Government of Tuvalu receive Trust Fund incomes. When market value exceeds maintained value, the difference is referred to as the \u2018automatic distribution\u201d. This difference is paid into the Second Fund. The Second Fund was established to smooth out trust fund contributions to the recurrent budget and to therefore improve the predictability and consistency of transfers. This revolving \u201cbuffer account\u201d, known as account \u201cB\u201d and later \u201cConsolidated Investment Fund\u201d (CIF) receives funds from the returns or \u201cdisbursements\u201d of \u2018A Account\u2019 and belongs exclusively to the Government of Tuvalu. The \u2018B Account\u2019 holds income distributions from the \u2018A Account\u2019 until funds are needed to be used for the national budget. It therefore serves as a buffer against the volatility of the \u2018A Account\u2019 returns, i.e., during years when there are no returns or low returns. The desired balance to be kept in the \u2018B Account\u2019 is four years projection of no income from the \u2018A Account\u2019. The B Account should keep around 16 per cent of the maintained value with recurrent budget allocations, or around 4 per cent of maintained value annually. This would then give four years of consistent or \u201csmoothed out\u201d contributions to Government revenues. This buffer is designed to provide insurance against revenue shocks inherent in economic cycles. The end of the fiscal year 2010/2011, marked the fourth consecutive year when no distribution could be made to the budget because the Market Value of the fund at AU$115.1 million was less than the real market value of AU$127.5 million; however, because of the CIF account, the government was able to draw almost AU$16 million to support budget over the four year period.3 2 This is calculated to be A$122,946,337.00 Market Value as at 31 March 2012 based on the TTFAC Final Report of May 2012. 3 TTF (2011) Tuvalu Trust Fund and Falekaupule Trust Fund, Opportunities to Contribute to an Innovative Funding Modality for Tuvalu\u2019s National and Community Development 5 Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund The trust fund model has also provided a conduit through which development partners have been able to provide budget support by making contributions to the CIF which development partners are then drawn-down into the budget over a multi-year period. In a similar manner the main trust fund account has enabled development partners to make additional contributions to the capital of the fund. Figure 1 The model of the Tuvalu Trust Fund In 2007, expenditure including Secretariat charges, bank charges, audit fees and the Management fee amounted to 0.8 percent of the net assets of the Fund. In the period since the Fund began to 30 June 2007, $65.7 million has been made available to the Government which allocated it as follows:4 \u2022 Recurrent Budget expenditure $24.1 million \u2022 Re-invested in the TTF $29.2 million \u2022 Held as a buffer in the B Account $12.4 million Central to the operation of the fund is the requirement that the capital of the fund be maintained in real terms for inflation. Only in very exceptional circumstances would the capital of the fund be considered to be drawn down by the Government of Tuvalu. In the 20 years that the Fund has been operating this has never happened. At the end of each financial year on 30 September, the Advisory Committee calculates the maintained value of the fund based on the Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Following a review of its regional programme in the Pacific, the UK withdrew from the Board in 2004. There is provision for further directors to join the Board and represent any new contributing donors. Japan, Korea ADB and EU have observer status to date. The Board meets twice every year. Professional Fund Managers, two Australian based firms, manage the fund on a day-to-day basis guided by a set of objectives and guidelines established by the Board in accordance with the Articles of the Agreement. At inception the Fund was invested wholly with one \u201cbalanced\u201d Fund Manager. In 1993 the Fund was divided equally among two balanced Fund managers due to diversification considerations. In 2002, coinciding with the appointment of a new Fund Monitor, the Fund undertook a major restructuring by engaging with \u201cspecialist\u201d Fund Managers. Performance of each firm is evaluated independently and comparatively. Professional consultant actuaries evaluate the investment performance of the fund managers based on comparison with other fund managers and provide quarterly reports to the Board of Directors. Currently, monitoring of fund is carried out by Towers Watson (consultant actuaries) that regularly reviews the investment performance of the fund managers and report to the Board on a three monthly basis. In 2005, by a resolution of the Board, an Investment Committee was established to review in detail the reports of the Fund Monitor and make recommendations to the Board on practical steps to be taken. Furthermore, an annual audit is also performed by a professional firm, which is currently Ernst and Young. An Advisory Committee regularly evaluates and monitors the impact of the Fund on Tuvalu and provides economic reports to the Government and the Board. The committee meets bi-annually in Tuvalu for about 10 days. It reviews the Government\u2019s budget and provides advice on macro and micro economic issues. Members of the Advisory Committee consist of one member each representing Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and Tuvalu. The Secretariat provides ongoing administrative support to the Board of Directors and is based in Funafuti. This role was played by the Secretary of Finance up until 2004 when a fulltime officer was recruited by the Board. Lee Faiva Moresi (TTF Secretary) and Salai Boreham (TTF Assistant Secretary) make up the Secretariat. 7 Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund Figure 2 Tuvalu trust Fund Governance Structure The establishment of the TTF When Tuvalu achieved independence in 1978 the Government finances were difficult and continued to deteriorate. Unlike Kiribati, Tuvalu did not inherit any financial reserves from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. In 1982, a preliminary approach was made to the United Kingdom to provide a \u201conce and for all\u201d payment in lieu of continuing direct budget support. This was turned down. A similar approach was made to Australia and New Zealand for \u201cone\u2011off\u201d assistance to reduce the overdraft (estimated at $1.5 million in 1981). This request was also declined and the Government was faced with the prospect of managing the emerging economy on ever reducing finances. By 1984, the Government of Tuvalu had developed the concept of a \u201cReserve Fund\u201d, to which Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom might contribute and from which revenues would be used for recurrent expenditure. In January 1985, Tuvalu presented a preliminary paper seeking comments on the concept now described a \u201cspecial budget fund\u201d. This was followed by a further paper, which was discussed with potential donors in Suva in May 1985 that outlined a proposal for a \u201cSpecial Budget\u201d or \u201cTrust Fund\u201d. 8 Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund In October 1985, Tuvalu provided a more comprehensive submission for the proposed \u201cTuvalu Trust Fund\u201d and this was discussed with various possible donor Governments. Tuvalu\u2019s then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance visited Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to press the case for the establishment of the Fund. At the meeting with the Prime Minister of New Zealand it was announced that New Zealand had agreed in principle to support the Fund, and would set aside NZ$500,000 in its 1986-87 development assistance budget to be held in reserve pending establishment of the Fund. New Zealand also indicated that it was to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ae0a83e-8b1c-48dc-9a4f-b1f9c594e37c": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ae0a83e-8b1c-48dc-9a4f-b1f9c594e37c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-tuvalu-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "National Climate Fund Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/national-climate-fund-case-study-report-tuvalu-trust-fund", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bdb7b0807caf19e4b1bb718ef47557327bb3b70e62e16e7be39a7ac009b80789"}}, "hash": "bdb7b0807caf19e4b1bb718ef47557327bb3b70e62e16e7be39a7ac009b80789", "text": "consider providing a further NZ$7,500,000 towards the Fund should other donors (particularly Australia and the United Kingdom) be prepared also to contribute. This was a turning point in the consideration of the proposed Trust Fund. During 1986, New Zealand and the United Kingdom with the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) began to refine the proposal further \u2013 identifying with greater precision the necessary size of the Fund along with the potential legal and other requirements. Australia also undertook its own investigations of possible other alternatives for meeting Tuvalu\u2019s budget difficulties. By mid-1986 regular meetings were being held between Tuvalu Government officials and potential donors with the need to develop a legally binding international agreement. As by now Australia had agreed to support the Fund, having set aside funding within its 1986\u201187 bilateral allocation to Tuvalu, it was important that the negotiations be concluded by June 1987. The agreement establishing the Fund was signed in Suva on 16 June 1987. Lessons learned The Tuvalu has managed to demonstrate comfortably that a Trust Fund set up can have significant positive impacts on national budget and the economy. The TTF has provided Tuvalu with a level of financial security by providing an additional source of government revenue that underpins the Budget and so the whole economy. Although the Fund is not specifically tied to line expenditure items, it is fair to say that real per capita income (on average) and physical infrastructure of Tuvalu have been substantially improved partly due to the Fund\u2019s revenues. Several important lessons from the case of the TFF are: - The model of the TTF - Sequencing the two funds works because it draws on the comparative advantages of both types of funds. The endowment fund is useful for long-term planning and can earn investment income (capital appreciation and dividends); while the revolving fund provides more flexibility when a distribution from the main trust fund is paid. In this respect the two funds can both assist in stabilizing the long-term financial situation of the government as well as addressing short-term budget needs. The challenge of the short-term needs has created much discussion around the size of the CIF, as it balances the objectives of maximizing the drawdowns into the Budget while at the same time maintaining a smooth flow of revenue for the Budget over time. The comparative disadvantages such as more capital upfront and potential to incur investment losses for the trust fund and disruption of resource flows for the revolving fund, balance each other to realize a sustainable funding mechanism for Tuvalu. - Prudent financial management - An important success factor with the TTF has been the prudent approach shown by the government in its financial affairs. This is demonstrated by a discipline to produce balanced or surplus budgets year on year. In its 2007 National Budget, the Government has introduced a TTF Budget Stabilization item in its Multi Year Budget Framework, which is pitched at 4 per cent of the TTF\u2019s maintained value at 30th September of the previous year. This is a major development in the Government\u2019s fiscal management strategies, which to some extent controls the level of drawdowns from the CIF in any given year to a much more sustainable level. The present government is also committed to building the CIF\u2019s capital to reach its Target Minimum Balance (the equivalent of 16 per cent of the TTF\u2019s maintained value) within the next four years. This will ensure the CIF has sufficient capital to provide the sustainable level of buffer to the annual Budget for a period of up to four years. - Strong ownership and relationship with partners - Although there is strict oversight of the TTF, with multiple checks and balances, Tuvalu has a sense of ownership that makes them want to see the fund grow. (In fact, government was criticized by some 9 Case Study Report: Tuvalu Trust Fund for putting off current consumption and reinvesting too much into the fund). Tuvalu is always chair of the board-- important symbolically. Secretariat based in Funafuti with a Tuvaluan in charge of Secretariat responsibilities. Furthermore, appointment of good professional people to the Board and the Advisory Committee who have multiple year terms with staggered completion dates. There is an informal consultative process before people are appointed.

The Centre\u2019s work focuses on four key thematic areas where we believe we can work with partners to make an important contribution to the region: crisis prevention and recovery; democratic governance; MDG achievement and poverty reduction, including work on HIV and AIDS, environment, energy and climate change; and financial inclusion. As a tight knit team, the Centre has been able to demonstrate the capacity to work across thematic areas; draw differing skills together to provide the best policy advice; and build a range of partnerships with Governments, regional organisations, UN agencies, non-government organisations (NGOs) and the private sector. The Centre\u2019s connections to the global UNDP community has allowed Pacific Island decision-makers to benefit from the experience of others while also providing a catalyst for sharing Pacific knowledge more broadly. Work towards women\u2019s empowerment and gender equality underpins much of the activity in the Pacific Centre. Gender is mainstreamed across each of the thematic areas.

Garry Wiseman UNDP Pacific Centre Manager Overview of Issues in the Pacific Region Human Development Trends and MDGs Achievement in the Pacific Most of Pacific countries remain off track or are progressing slowly towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This is particularly the case for the first Goal on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and the third Goal on promoting gender equality and empowerment of women. Only Niue and Tokelau are on track to achieve MDG 1. While extreme poverty and hunger is low in the Pacific, poverty, in terms of the proportion of the population below the basic needs poverty line, has risen in several countries, mainly due to the economic crisis. In Cook Islands, the proportion of the population living under the national basic-needs poverty line has remained the same during the period 2006 to 2008, while in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) the number has increased during the period 1990 to 2002 and remained the same during the period 2002 to 2009. The proportion of people living under the basic needs poverty line declined in Fiji and Vanuatu during the period 2006 to 2010, while in Samoa the proportion increased from 21% in 2003 to 26% in 2008. Currently it is averaging around 23% in Kiribati, Solomon Islands and Tonga, 35% in Fiji (down from 39% in 2005), 26% in Samoa, 29% PNG and Cook Islands, 12.7% in Vanuatu (down from 13% in 2006) and 18% in Tuvalu. Meanwhile, inequality and human poverty are rising rapidly even in countries where there has been a relatively significant reduction in basic needs poverty over the last 10 years (e.g. Fiji). Economic growth is unbalanced, unstable and exclusive. Frequent and sharp growth fluctuations and macroeconomic shocks disrupt efforts to achieve MDGs and reverse progress achieved during periods of relatively high and stable growth. Geographic disparities are manifest in high income inequality and human poverty and slow progress towards the achievement of MDGs in outer islands and remote areas.

Literacy rates are among the highest in developing countries, above 90%. Net enrolment ratios are off track in Solomon Islands and PNG for primary education. Net enrolment ratios drop significantly for secondary and higher education in nearly all PICs. Geographic disparities within countries are quite high as delivering basic services, including education, to rural areas and remote outer islands is a major challenge in all PICs. While some of the indicators demonstrate good progress on the quantitative front, the quality of education is a major concern in PICs. 4 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 5 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 1 This averages uses the 2006 pre-coup figures for Fiji Islands. 2 United Nations, Department of Economics and Social Affairs (2012), Population Data Tables.

Unemployment among women is typically higher in rural and remote areas for nearly all Pacific countries. The average number of seats in Parliament held by women, based on latest reports for all PICs is merely 5.8 percent.1 Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and FSM have no women in Parliament. Violence against women is a major concern. Cook Islands is currently in the process of drafting of a new Family Law Bill that will help ensure national commitment to gender equality and the full implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Young people make up a significant portion of Pacific Island populations (more than half of the total Pacific population is under the age of 25 and approximately one in five people or one third of the adult working population are youth using the UN definition of youth as being anyone between the ages of 15 to 24 years2).

In terms of health, the biggest challenge in the Pacific is the capacity to deliver basic services, particularly to outer islands. Weak health systems and health information systems are common across the PICs as well as low coverage of family planning and ante-natal care in the larger archipelagos (PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). This impacts both the delivery of appropriate services and the tracking of progress. Although HIV prevalence remains low outside PNG, the rates of Sexual Transmitted Infections (STI) are very high. Social conservatism, unfavourable laws and policies, combined with the low status of women create an unfavourable milieu for HIV and STI prevention. Malaria is endemic in PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu (which represent the vast majority of the population of Pacific Islands). While Solomon Islands and Vanuatu have made significant progress in reducing the burden of malaria, underpinned by widespread use of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) thanks to strong support by development partners, malaria in PNG remains a cause for concern. Six countries (FSM, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, PNG, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu) are identified as having a high burden of tuberculosis (TB). However, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Solomon Islands are on track to reverse the incidence of TB. Drug-resistant TB in the Marshall Islands and FSM are making it more difficult for these countries to combat TB. For PNG, as with malaria, TB remains a major public health problem, especially given the relatively high prevalence of HIV (generalised epidemic). In addition to capacity issues and geographical remoteness progress on MDGs 4, 5 and 6 are closely related to multidimensional determinants of health such as poverty, food insecurity and the low status of women in some societies. Economic Trends in the Pacific Region Economic growth rates have been generally low both in middle-income countries and the five Least Developed Countries (LDCs), and do not appear to have resulted in significant reductions in poverty, inequality and vulnerability. Across the Pacific region, average annual growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has increased in the period 2004 to 2007, driven mainly by GDP growth in PNG, Timor-Leste, and Vanuatu. However, the growth rate of real GDP was negative in more than half of the Pacific countries in 2009 and in 2010 moved into positive territory in all the countries except Tonga.

After sharp hikes in 2007, 2008 and 2009 as result of the global food and energy crisis, inflation has stabilised in most Pacific countries, converging back to its pre-crisis levels. The weak domestic demand contributed to lowering the inflationary pressure in 2011 and 2012 as well as projected inflation rates for 2013. Current growth trends, coupled with the strict and over-cautious monetary policy, should maintain inflation rates around the long-term trend, which is relatively low.

UNDP estimates that around 6.5 million people, representing 80% of low income people living in urban, peri-urban and predominately remote villages and islands scattered across an ocean covering one third of the world\u2019s surface, do not have access to formal and informal financial services. As a consequence, a majority of people who are excluded are not able to achieve their full economic potential and are denied the opportunities to attain a productive and dignified living. Challenging geography, poor infrastructure, persistent poverty, low financial competency levels and subsistence livelihoods have all contributed to a lack of financial inclusion in the region. In addition, conventional financial service providers (banks, insurance companies, etc.) lack information required to make sound business cases for serving the relatively small markets of Pacific countries, even though previously inaccessible populations are increasingly reachable through new technology and improving infrastructure. It is widely acknowledged that traditional social safety nets are breaking down and that government and private sector pension programmes are insufficient to fill the gap. Unexpected financial expenditures related to deaths, health emergencies, floods and crop failures significantly threaten households across the Pacific. At such times, inability to manage budgets effectively reduces household resilience, resulting in increased poverty. Moreover, cultural and social requirements \u2014 in particular those associated with funerals \u2014 can cost Pacific Island households thousands of dollars resulting in significant financial pressures. For higher income households, insurance products have alleviated some of these financial pressures; however, such services are basically unavailable to the vast majority of the population. Figure 2: Real GDP projections in 2012 and 2013 Trends in the financial and telecommunications sectors offer hope and opportunity for increasing financial inclusion in the region. The major commercial banks have all begun moving to the low-income and rural markets, with all three introducing \u201cno maintenance fee\u201d bank accounts that are proving quite popular. In PNG, the Bank of South Pacific Limited (BSP) has over 250,000 registered e-banking users and is providing electronic services to its customers through ATMs, mobile point-of-sale units, mobile phone banking and a subsidiary, BSP Rural. Westpac has launched its \u201cIn-store\u201d banking model which utilises bank agents and EFTPOS machines to offer bank accounts and bill pay to formerly unbanked areas of Fiji, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tonga. Further, banks are either introducing or enhancing their mobile phone-based banking services across the region. In competition with banks and mobile transfer operators, mobile network operators now offer their clients access to mobile wallets in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu and access to domestic and international remittance services at low cost in Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. Political Developments in the Pacific Governance in Pacific made notable progress in some areas, but suffered setbacks in others in 2012. During the year, national elections were held in PNG, Vanuatu and Palau. PNG\u2019s elections ended a period of instability described as a destabilising constitutional crisis which began in August 2011 with the no-confidence motion in the Government of the day. In early 2012, there continued to be disagreement over national leadership, but this was finally resolved with the June 2012 elections which resulted in", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1bcbb496-b910-47da-a823-a6c0391d8331": {"__data__": {"id_": "1bcbb496-b910-47da-a823-a6c0391d8331", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f7dd6ed5459e08662defd1c4edaa13251cfea0811e86daadc77a0a7b0830095"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b5270e6-7e55-4252-be74-3ce9db4e220c", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41096ad45158b548aedbaad06c0228334b9d6f69968337afef31eba19fd63f7e"}}, "hash": "afea7e0359575955ff5f1c145e7ad61d292536e4cdbbb317fffdb836f4fef64d", "text": "Prime Minister Peter O\u2019Neill winning support from an overwhelming 94 of the nation\u2019s 111 Members of Parliament (MPs). The Prime Minister was supported by political rival Honourable Michael Somare, as well as support from two former Prime Ministers, Honourable Paias Wingti and Honourable Julius Chan. Prime Minister O\u2019Neill clarified two broad priorities: to increase the proportion of citizens who participate in and benefit from the resource economy; and to upgrade PNG\u2019s national infrastructure and increase productivity. Vanuatu held general elections in October 2012, with the new Parliament electing Honourable Sato Kilman as Prime Minister in November 2012. Within weeks of presiding over a coalition of 13 political parties, there were already suggestions of a no confidence vote being run against Prime Minister Kilman. A number of election appeals are before the Supreme Court (including one lodged to challenge the eligibility of the Prime Minister to contest the elections), and the death of an MP within weeks of election has necessitated a by- election for the seat of Tanna. No women were elected into Parliament, leaving Vanuatu with no female MPs in the national legislature. Palau also held national elections in November 2012. Incumbent President Johnson Toribiong lost his re-election bid, with former President Tommy Remengesau Junior regaining the Presidency. Encouragingly, the number of female Members of the Congress increased from two to three, with an additional female Senator elected to the Upper House. Women\u2019s representation in the political, social and economic leadership continues to pose a challenge. FSM, Nauru and Vanuatu currently have no female MPs, while Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu only have one female MP in the legislature. Encouragingly however, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, PNG and Samoa all have female members of Cabinet. In PNG, although the push for reserved seats for women failed at the last legislative hurdle, nonetheless three women were elected in the June 2012 elections, the most women ever to sit in the PNG Parliament at the same time. Honourable Julie Soso, elected into a provincial seat, is also only the second female Governor ever in PNG. In Samoa, the Government took the initiative to promote women\u2019s political participation by tabling legislation to introduce a 5% minimum quota for women in the national legislature. The Bill is still currently under discussion but has strong support from the Prime Minister. Encouragingly, at the 43rd Pacific Islands Leaders Forum in October 2012, the Australian Government launched a new AU$320 million Pacific Gender Initiative, which focuses on the promotion of women\u2019s political participation, as well as women\u2019s economic empowerment and tackling violence against women. 8 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 9 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 In Fiji, the military government continues to be in place. However, in mid-2012, the Government initiated a process of constitutional reform, with the creation of a five-member Constitutional Commission, comprising two international experts (Professor Yash Ghai and Professor Christina Murray) and three local representatives (Peni Moore, Satendra Nand and Taufa Vakatele). Over 7000 submissions were received by the Constitutional Commission over the course of six months of public consultations. A draft Constitution was submitted to the President in late December by the Constitutional Commission. On 10 January 2013, Government announced that the new draft Constitution prepared by the Commission was to be amended by a Government legal team before it is submitted to the Constituent Assembly. In Solomon Islands, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) confirmed in 2012 that they will be gradually stepping back in a number of areas to enable Solomon Islanders to take the lead in shaping their country\u2019s future. It is envisaged for example that from mid-2013, RAMSI will concentrate on continuing to build the capacity of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force and development assistance will move from RAMSI to bilateral and other programmes. Discussions have also begun on the proposed withdrawal of the mission\u2019s military component sometime after 1 July 2013. All Pacific Islands countries have now gone through the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, with all Pacific governments making commitments to advance human rights at the national level. In 2012, this manifested itself in the additional ratification of human rights treaties by three PICs (Nauru ratified the Convention Against Torture and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; FSM ratified the Optional Protocol to the CRC; and Samoa ratified the Convention for the Protection from Enforced Disappearances).", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b5270e6-7e55-4252-be74-3ce9db4e220c": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b5270e6-7e55-4252-be74-3ce9db4e220c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7f7dd6ed5459e08662defd1c4edaa13251cfea0811e86daadc77a0a7b0830095"}, "2": {"node_id": "1bcbb496-b910-47da-a823-a6c0391d8331", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "afea7e0359575955ff5f1c145e7ad61d292536e4cdbbb317fffdb836f4fef64d"}}, "hash": "41096ad45158b548aedbaad06c0228334b9d6f69968337afef31eba19fd63f7e", "text": "Invitations were also extended to special procedures mandate holders by four PICs - the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women visited PNG and Solomon Islands; the Special Rapporteur on Toxic Waste visited the Marshall Islands; and the Special", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "09137b81-8a14-44af-ad50-3bbec9db1d98": {"__data__": {"id_": "09137b81-8a14-44af-ad50-3bbec9db1d98", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "41f5cd5a2d52869a916a467352d2a7290c414f36e8238d9d1cedb97925e04d3c"}}, "hash": "41f5cd5a2d52869a916a467352d2a7290c414f36e8238d9d1cedb97925e04d3c", "text": "Rapporteur on Water and Sanitation visited Kiribati and Tuvalu. In addition, in 2012 Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu all actively explored options to establish some form of national human rights mechanism. While corruption continues to plague the Pacific, a number of positive steps were also taken by PICs to more systematically address corruption and promote accountability. FSM, Nauru and Solomon Islands ratified the UN Convention against Corruption, bringing the total number of ratification to nine Pacific Island countries. The PNG Government ramped up its efforts to investigate corruption through an Operation Taskforce Sweep, and is understood to have commenced drafting of key pieces of anti-corruption legislation in support of the PNG National Anti-Corruption Strategy which was launched in 2011 and re-endorsed by the Government following the 2012 national elections. It is understood that both PNG and Solomon Islands are also exploring options for establishing Independent Commissions Against Corruption, while Vanuatu continues to work on legislation to strengthen the powers of the Ombudsman. In 2012, Tonga also launched the region\u2019s first-ever Freedom of Information Policy, to improve transparency and accountability in government, and Kiribati and Vanuatu initiated efforts to follow suit. 2012 witnessed another year of close collaboration by the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) members (Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu). Apart from being a platform to foster better trade amongst MSG members and also trading with Australia and New Zealand, MSG has made progress in providing the opportunity for political dialogue for Fiji with other PICTs given the removal of Fiji from the Pacific Leaders Forum. In 2012, a new Pacific Island Development Forum led by Fiji held a special regional meeting to discuss issues of importance to the region, prior to the 43rd Pacific Islands Forum. Energy, Climate Change and Environment Development in the Pacific The Large Oceans Island States \u2013 the Pacific Challenge was the theme for the 2012 43rd Pacific Island Forum Leaders meeting held in the Cook Islands. This theme aimed to strike a balance between sustaining the development of marine resources with the interests of preservation and conservation. The Pacific leaders noted the need to develop a Pacific position on the post-2015 development agenda. They also acknowledged the range of efforts undertaken to support improved Pacific Islands\u2019 access to, and management of, climate change financing. In relation to the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development Conference (UNCSD), Rio+20, \u201cLeaders welcomed the important outcomes of Rio+20 for the Pacific, including reaffirmation of the special case for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), an emphasis on oceans, and the decision to develop Sustainable Development Goals.\u201d Over the past few years there have been numerous climate change initiatives at the regional and national levels in the Pacific for both adaptation and mitigation. However, it is recognised that new and additional resources will be needed to secure the development gains in the face of climate change. There is a strong call for on-the- ground initiatives and a move from talk to action on climate change. With the advent of numerous climate funds, the Pacific wants to ensure that funding is flexible and ideally channeled through national systems. The Pacific and a number of individual countries are playing major roles in key international mechanisms: Nauru in its current role as Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States; Samoa as the Pacific Small Island Developing States representative on the Green Climate Fund Board; and Fiji as the Pacific Small Island Developing States representative on the Adaptation Fund Board and as the incoming Alternate Council member on the Global Environmental Facility Council. During 2012, the United National Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from Durban to Doha has resulted in movement toward a \u201cprotocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force\u201d, the development of institutional arrangements to compensate developing countries for loss and damage caused by slow onset events, addressing the issue of mid and long-term finance, an agreement on National Adaptation Plan (NAP) and the operationalisation of the Green Climate Fund. Whereas this is by no means an exhaustive list of issues relevant to the Pacific, it shows the dynamic international back-drop within which the region\u2019s work on climate change is situated. Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All) is a global initiative led by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to achieve universal energy access, improve energy efficiency, and increase the use of renewable energy. It was launched to coincide with the designation by the UN General Assembly for 2012 as the International Year of Sustainable Energy for All. In the Pacific, Fiji and Samoa have joined this initiative. 10 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fae0ad3b-373b-46d3-81bb-5048ceaf10f9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fae0ad3b-373b-46d3-81bb-5048ceaf10f9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "1e7a087348a4e50dd833bcb098a000d43aa97b6538e313e095c9d541cb586fe6"}}, "hash": "1e7a087348a4e50dd833bcb098a000d43aa97b6538e313e095c9d541cb586fe6", "text": "11 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 Pacific Centre Management, Partnerships and Resources Regional Programme All UNDP activities are implemented within the framework of the UNDP Strategic Plan 2008-2013. The UNDP Strategic Plan was approved in 2007 by the UNDP Executive Board, a steering and oversight body consisting of 36 UN member countries who serve on a rotating basis. Initially covering the period 2008 to 2011, the Plan was subsequently extended until 2013. The Asia-Pacific Regional Programme 2008-2011 was derived from the UNDP Strategic Plan and was also extended until 2013 to maintain this alignment. The Regional Programme guides the work of the Pacific Centre, and the Asia Pacific Regional Centre in Bangkok. For the Pacific, the programme has also been guided by the initial priorities of the Pacific Plan and subsequent decisions of Pacific Island Leaders as well as the lessons learned from previous UNDP regional programmes. In support of the Regional Programme Document, the Centre is implementing four major Pacific regional projects \u2013 Governance in the Pacific, Crisis Prevention and Recovery, and MDGs Achievement and Poverty Reduction and Financial Inclusion. The Pacific project documents, which run from 2008-13, all went through a consultative process with a number of stakeholders within the Pacific region \u2013 governments, NGOs, donors and other UN agencies \u2013 before being approved by governments in the region and the UNDP Directorate for the Asia Pacific region in December 2007. Governance Arrangements The Pacific Centre is part of the regional architecture of Asia Pacific, with the Manager of the Centre reporting directly to the Deputy Regional Director, who is based at the Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific in New York. The Centre\u2019s work is reviewed annually by a Management Committee that is chaired by the Deputy Regional Director and includes the three Pacific Resident Representatives and a senior representative from the Bureau for Development Policy. Guidance on the work plan for the Centre is also provided by a Projects Steering Committee that includes country and regional organisation representatives. In December 2012, the Projects Steering Committee met in Suva and the meeting was chaired by the Deputy Regional Director and attended by representatives of all the countries the Centre works in. Resources allocated in the annual work plan for the Centre is based on this performance review process and in response to emerging priorities as determined by Pacific Island Forum Leaders. Careful attention is paid to ensure that the Centre\u2019s work is targeted, complements country-based initiatives that are managed by the UNDP Country Offices and reflects the comparative advantage of UNDP. The Pacific Centre also participates in the Board of the UNDP Joint Operations Centre (JOC) which was established in April 2011. JOC operates as a service centre hub, providing operational services to the UNDP Fiji Multi-Country Office, Pacific Centre, Solomon Islands Sub Office and other UN agencies. Our Partnerships During 2012, the Pacific Centre maintained a focus on strengthening partnerships with regional and national stakeholders. In this context, the region\u2019s intergovernmental organisations are key Centre partners, including PIFS, SPC and the University of the South Pacific (USP). The Centre also partners with Pacific parliaments, national Reserve/Central Banks, private sector organisations, NGOs, UN agencies and other donors. Our Country Office Services The Pacific Centre provides on request policy advisory; technical backstopping for programme design and implementation; and knowledge management support to UNDP Country Offices in the Pacific, namely the Samoa Multi-Country Office, Fiji Multi-Country Office and PNG Country Office, as well as to PIC governments, intergovernmental agencies and civil society organisations. In 2012, support to UNDP (Multi-)Country Offices for ongoing programmes and projects was complemented by technical support for the development of a new UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF), which comes into place from 2013. The Pacific Centre provided technical inputs to Common Country Assessments for the 14 countries covered by the Samoa and Fiji Multi-Country Offices, as well as providing quality assurance for the final draft UNDAF. As a follow-up to the Pacific UNDAF process, a first ever sub-regional programme document covering UNDP assistance to the 14 countries from the Samoa and Fiji Multi-Country Offices and the Centre has recently been approved by the UNDP Executive Board. This document covers the period 2013-2017. During 2012, the Integrated Communications and Knowledge Management (iComms) team continued its efforts to capture stories and knowledge that showcase the role of UNDP throughout the Pacific and PNG. Notably, the iComms team provided media and communications support to the debates organised to gather Pacific youth voices for the Post-2015 Development Agenda, as well as to the inaugural Trade Pasifika, that gathered some 55 Pacific entrepreneurs to showcase their", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "18ac9d7c-9b21-48a4-ae76-ec2343261e57": {"__data__": {"id_": "18ac9d7c-9b21-48a4-ae76-ec2343261e57", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6912c204643d096d9aa8aeb2c35d260f3ce4c9b7ab18c4fa0db73f5a6cd34505"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3e46d1e-daba-4fd9-9326-47cd18428c90", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bca5af0eadc127ce5cc054b5f3471c7472a756d41a6847ee5bf456ab983d8f28"}}, "hash": "259bc036c325076a7f2f19f1a9b59e6d850a11ec38f327017ec17970a6b81ccb", "text": "products and services. The Pacific Solution Exchange Climate Change and Development Community, which operates from within the iComms team, held its first annual forum in September 2012. With more than 1300 members from across the Pacific and globally, the community discussed a broad range of issues including non-communicable diseases and climate change, the role of traditional knowledge, information and communications technology (ICTs) and development, to name a few. Resource Mobilisation UNDP resources of US$1.67 million provided a sound foundation in 2012 for the Centre\u2019s resource mobilisation efforts. The Centre continued to enjoy the support of Australia under long-term cost sharing agreements that were signed at the beginning of the current programme cycle and which will be coming to an end in 2013. AusAID, as development partner provided programme resources that allow the Centre flexibility in the allocation of funding to implement the agreed work plan. In 2012, AusAID provided US$4.3 million for \u201ccore\u201d support to the Centre. In addition to the \u201ccore\u201d support, AusAID also provided a further US$3.2 million for specific activities that included ongoing funding under the multi-year support initiative for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (CRP) with resources for 2012 of US$2,553,875 and US$766,660 for the Governance initiatives.

This compares with a regional core allocation of US$9.5 million for the period 2008-2012 which means a resource mobilisation ratio of close to 1:4 for the Centre. A breakdown of the US$43.5 million by development partners is shown below, with Australia and New Zealand combined 62% of the total with other UNDP and UN funding at 34% and other donors making up the balance. Staff Movement In 2012, the Pacific Centre bid farewell to a number of staff members. The Pacific Financial Inclusion Advisor and Project Manager, Tillman Bruett left the Centre to join UNCDF in Brussels. The Pacific Regional Governance Advisor and Project Manager, Ernesto Bautista joined UNDP in Laos. The Governance Institutions and Accountability Specialist, Charmaine Rodrigues was promoted to a position with UNDP\u2019s Bureau of Crisis Prevention and Recovery in New York. Two Conflict Prevention Specialists also left the Centre: Thomas Shanahan and Cameron Noble. Portia Domonatani and Keleni Bolatagici departed the Pacific Centre. The Centre welcomed Reuben Summerlin as the Pacific Financial Inclusion Advisor and Project Manager. Moortaza Jiwanji resumed his work as Disaster Risk Management Specialist, after a year away on secondment in the UN Resident Coordinator\u2019s Office in Indonesia. Adelle Khan, Akisi Tamani, Fane Cinavilakeba, Samita Singh and Leba Tuilawalawa joined the Pacific Centre as programme support staff. A number of students from American, European and Pacific universities were attached to the Pacific Centre during the year as interns. For 2013 and beyond, the Centre has already secured agreements with AusAID for \u201ccore\u201d funding of US$6 million and \u201cnon-core\u201d funding of US$16 million covering the period 2013 to 2015 for Governance and Crisis Prevention and Recovery programmes.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3e46d1e-daba-4fd9-9326-47cd18428c90": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3e46d1e-daba-4fd9-9326-47cd18428c90", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "6912c204643d096d9aa8aeb2c35d260f3ce4c9b7ab18c4fa0db73f5a6cd34505"}, "2": {"node_id": "18ac9d7c-9b21-48a4-ae76-ec2343261e57", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "259bc036c325076a7f2f19f1a9b59e6d850a11ec38f327017ec17970a6b81ccb"}}, "hash": "bca5af0eadc127ce5cc054b5f3471c7472a756d41a6847ee5bf456ab983d8f28", "text": "Resource Moblisation 2008-2012 AusAID $17,876,089 41% NZAID $2,952,399 7% EU $1,322,468 3% AusAID Other $6,220,888 14% Other Donar $543,072 1% UN Other $5,019,924 12% UNDP TRAC $9,534,283 22% Key Achievements of the Pacific Centre Practice Areas Overall Pacific Centre Programme Delivery The total budget in 2012 was US$9,421,742 made up of the regional core funding, UNDP Bureau of Crisis Prevention and Recovery, UNDP Bureau of Development Policy as well as a third party cost sharing funding from the Government of Australia.

CPAD has been very successful in opening up space and helping sustain conversations about peace and development in the region while supporting civil society organisations to engage more effectively in peacebuilding. Now in its third year, the project is making inroads towards advancing the theory and practice of Pacific approaches to dialogue. At CPAD\u2019s most recent workshop held in Honiara, Solomon Islands, country representatives identified common roles in effective dialogue in the Pacific, as well as began to define key terminology relevant to peacebuilding in the region. A compendium of case studies of dialogue processes in the Pacific region is currently under development. National follow-up initiatives included activities in Fiji and Tonga. In Fiji, the CPAD project provided facilitation services for the strategic planning initiatives of several peacebuilding NGOs in determining strategic direction for Fiji\u2019s transition to democracy. Skills training were also provided to the Fiji Government in mediation and negotiation skills for governmental agencies working on land and mining/extractive industry-related issues. Trainings were also provided to religious leaders from around the Pacific on conflict analysis, trauma healing and conflict resolution skills through the Pacific Theological College. The training led to the addition of 40 new religious peacebuilders to the cadre of Pacific peacebuilders. In Tonga, support was provided to the CPAD Tonga participants - now organised into a National Peace and Unity Committee to design, convene and facilitate a National Consultation on Peace, Unity and Development in the Kingdom of Tonga to identify key issues of importance to advancing peace in Tonga and build cross-sectoral collaboration on these key initiatives. The Committee helped bring the recently reorganised Ministry of Internal Affairs on as the government\u2019s focal point for peace-related issues and to strengthen civil society-government collaboration on peacebuilding and unity endeavors. Towards a New Definition of Security in the Pacific There has been a significant shift in the concept of security among Pacific Island countries from a state-centred approach to a people-centred or human security approach since 2006, supported by the UNDP Pacific Centre in partnership with PIFS. This shift recently culminated in the official welcoming by Pacific Islands Forum Leaders in their 2012 Communique of the Pacific Human Security Framework, which was jointly developed by the Pacific Centre and PIFS. The Framework provides a common foundation and strategic guidance for improving the understanding, planning and implementation of human security approaches in stand-alone and broader peace, security and development initiatives in the unique Pacific context. It also aims to strengthen cooperation on human security and is supportive of and complementary to the Pacific Plan. The process of transition to a human security approach was done over two stages. From 2006 to 2008, UNDP and PIFS at the request of the Forum Regional Security Committee (FRSC) undertook consultations in partnership with civil society and academia, carried out case studies in FSM, Kiribati, Samoa and Vanuatu, and conducted research to establish a theoretical foundation for the Framework including identifying human security threats, existing capacities to respond to those threats, and approaches to strengthen human security. In 2008, the FRSC welcomed the theoretical work and requested that UNDP and PIFS shift their focus from theory to practical application. Between 2008 and 2012, UNDP and PIFS implemented a wide range of projects based on the theoretical foundation including tackling sexual and gender-based violence, women\u2019s involvement in peace and security, dialogues with civil society on security issues, capacity building of FRSC officials in conflict prevention, youth involvement in crime and violence, security sector governance, and land management. The experiences and results of project implementation on these types of issues informed the development of the Framework. The period 2012 to 2015 will see the Framework being utilised as a guide for security and development interventions by Pacific Island countries and PIFS. In 2015, the FRSC will review the Framework. However, what is unmistakable is that the focus of security in the region has definitively shifted from a state-centred approach to a human-centred approach which will support better development outcomes for all. Security Sector Governance \u2013 Regional Intervention Leading to National Adoption Since 2008, the Pacific Centre has been working with the target countries of Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu to strengthen governance of the security sector.

The NSP is strategically aligned with the PNG Vision 2050 Pillar Four - Security and International Relations, the PNG Development Strategic Plan 2010\u20132030 and the Medium Term Development Plan 2011\u20132015. As a result of strong momentum in 2012, the policy is being developed under the leadership of the Office of Security Coordination and Assessment within the Department of Prime Minister and National Executive Council. Through nationwide consultations, the policy seeks to respond to a range of security challenges and provides a comprehensive framework to address these in a coherent manner. It prescribes how the Government of PNG will provide security for the state and its people. It further ensures a collective understanding of security needs, threats and challenges, national priorities, and the role of different actors to enhance coordination, identify capacities and resources needed to deal with security threats, improve oversight and accountability and provide a sound basis for any subsequent institutional reforms. The policy also provides the overarching framework for the realignment of the Defence White Paper, the Foreign Policy and other enabling policies related to security service delivery. The Pacific Centre continues to provide support to the reform of the security sector in PNG through the provision of technical and financial assistance. Women, Peace and Security In December 2010, the Pacific Centre supported the establishment of a Pacific Regional Working Group (RWG) on Women, Peace and Security. The RWG is co-chaired by UNDP (Papua New Guinea Resident Coordinator), SPC and FemLINKPACIFIC, with secretarial support provided by the Pacific Centre\u2019s CPR Team. The Working Group was responsible for drafting the first ever Regional Action Plan for Women Peace and Security. The Plan, approved by the FRSC and acknowledged by Pacific Leaders, will guide the implementation of women\u2019s empowerment and engagement in conflict prevention and human security initiatives across the Pacific Region over the next three years. The Working Group, which brought together member states, the UN and civil society, was a pioneering collaborative initiative of a broad spectrum of stakeholders. The Pacific Regional Action Plan officially launched on 18 October 2012, provides a broad framework to assist Pacific Governments to develop relevant national programme and strategies on women, peace and security. It is critical to strengthen and sustain regional and domestic efforts by women\u2019s civil society networks working on peace and security issues. 16 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 17 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 Preventing Gender-based Violence (GBV) in Post-Conflict Situations In 2011, the Pacific Centre and UN Partners for Prevention (UNP4P) initiated an action research on gender- based violence (GBV) and masculinity in post-conflict Bougainville. The aim of the research was to provide a baseline on men and boys attitudes, a numerical and statistical representation of the nature and scope of GBV, identifying the association between individual and societal factors causing this violence and use this data as design of an evidence-based prevention intervention. The qualitative data collection component was completed in 2011 and the quantitative data collection by the end of 2012. This research will provide insights into why men engage in violence against women and will be used for preventive programming in Bougainville. The findings of the research will be discussed with the Government in March 2013. South-South Cooperation with the Caribbean to Improve Disaster and Climate Risk Management The South-South Cooperation between Pacific and Caribbean SIDS on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management (South-South) project facilitates an exchange of knowledge and experiences between individuals and organisations in Pacific Island countries, and Caribbean small island states. In 2012, a five- member Pacific delegation participated at the Comprehensive Disaster Management (CDM) regional meeting in Jamaica and presented on catastrophe risk financing. 2012 also saw the completion of eight-month training for mid-level climate observer technicians from PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu at the Caribbean Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) in Barbados and a two-month secondment at the Caribbean Metrology Office and to relevant CIMH departments for hands-on-work experiences. Other highlights also include the field visit by Caribbean experts from coastal management and hydrology fields to view innovative approaches to water resources management and sanitation in climate change adaptation undertaken by an atoll country the Pacific (Kiribati). The field visits have resulted into two spin off projects for on-the-ground South-South technical cooperation in Kiribati and submitted for the GEF Small Grants Programme as \u201cstrategic projects\u201d seeking triple funding.

Rural Women Bringing Peace in Papua New Guinea Education, commitment, sacrifice and full participation in the daily life of her community is the recipe for Lilly Be\u2019Soer\u2019s success as a leader. Lilly recently brought about a peace agreement in a Papua New Guinea Highlands community which had been in conflict for the past four years, and in which four previous attempts to bring peace had been unsuccessful. Lilly gave up her paid employment five years ago and returned to her village to work with women struggling to support themselves and their families. Working through the non-government organisation, Voice for Change, she came across many women who, like herself, had been displaced from their traditional lands. \u201cVoice for Change is supporting women who have been displaced from the community. Many of these women did not have food, could not send their children to school and had no land on which to grow food or bury the dead,\u201d said Lilly. Lilly Be\u2019Soer shares her story of bringing peace into a Papua New Guinea community fragmented by conflict. 18 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 19 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 Last year, Voice for Change received a small grant under UNDP\u2019s Strengthening Capacities for Peace and Development (CPAD) project to support their work in mediating a peace agreement to end the conflict between the clans and pave the way for the return of the displaced clan to their ancestral lands. A total of 500 people had been displaced as result of the conflict. Lilly said that in the past three years, various actors had made four attempts to resolve the conflict and while all were started they all failed. \u201cVoice for Change led the fifth reconciliation attempt. What we did was to have intensive consultations with the clans, the elders, the women and the men. These went on for six months. In one of our initial consultations we had presentations made by the displaced women to the policemen. As the presentations progressed and the women spoke about how they or their daughters were abused and how they could not pay for their children\u2019s education or get their sick children treated in hospitals, the faces of the men changed and they said that they had to do something to resolve the conflict.\u201d Lilly described the challenges she faced in the reconciliation process, the length and complexity of the consultations as well as how traditional leadership structures and processes had to be respected to pave the way for the peace agreement. \u201cNow, we are just starting the return of the displaced clan,\u201d she said. In addition to her work in the community, Lilly is also the General Secretary of the Highlands Regional Human Rights Defenders Network as well as a member of the newly established regional network of Women Human Rights Defenders. Lilly is now a single mother of six children having left a polygamous marriage. In 2010 Lilly was awarded a Pacific Human Rights Defenders Award. Key Highlights: Democratic Governance Supporting UNCAC Ratification and Implementation The Pacific Centre continued providing support to Pacific governments and civil society and encouraging countries to work towards ratification of United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). To date, nine Pacific Island countries have ratified UNCAC, namely PNG (2007), Fiji (2008), Palau (2009), Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Marshall Islands (2011). In 2012, FSM, Nauru, and Solomon Islands ratified the treaty. The progress made throughout the region is the product of almost five years of continued advocacy by UNDP and its partners in the region. UNCAC ratification is merely a first step in tackling corruption and UNDP has initiated in-country work to implement the Convention. In Tonga, the Centre partnered with the Commonwealth Pacific Governance Facility (CPGF) to support the Tongan Government in the development of a Freedom of Information (FoI) Policy and a phased implementation plan. This initiative directly supports Tonga in implementing Article 10 of UNCAC. The Centre further supported the setting up of an FoI Unit within the Tonga Ministry of Information and Communication that would be tasked with the coordination of the FoI Policy and act as a focal point for freedom of information requests from the public.

UNDP worked with national stakeholders under the guidance of the National Freedom of Information Committee to assist with the development of a draft FoI policy paper, a draft Freedom of Information Bill, and a draft implementation plan. The Bill is scheduled for submission to Parliament in 2013. To mark Anti-Corruption Day on 9 December, the Centre provided small grants to governments and civil society organisations across the Pacific to help raise awareness of the need to address corruption. Partners, supported by UNDP, highlighted the impact of corruption on communities and ordinary citizens and outlined ways in which citizens and organisations can take a stand against corrupt behaviour. Transparency Vanuatu organised debates involving school children and youth groups, and panel discussions on the impact of corruption on women and on using culture as a tool against corruption. The Tonga Broadcasting Commission aired radio and television awareness programmes in the lead-up to Anti-Corruption Day. Similar awareness-raising media programmes were also broadcasted in Kiribati, Marshall Islands and Palau. In the Solomon Islands, Transparency Solomon Islands held a peaceful march against corruption through Honiara town, followed by awareness raising activities. Strengthening Civil Society Capacity to Promote Accountability In addition to and complementing support and assistance provided to governments, the Pacific Centre continued its efforts to strengthen civil society organisations in the region. The publication of the civil society capacity assessment for the first time provides a comprehensive overview of key capacity constraints civil society organisations face in the Pacific and outlines the way forward for an evidence-based capacity-building approach for civil society actors. The capacity assessment was divided into three separate publications: A Capacity Assessment of CSOs in the Pacific; A Country Assessment of CSO in the Pacific: Six Country Profiles; and A Capacity Development Plan for CSOs in the Pacific. A two-day training workshop on social accountability was provided to the Samoa Umbrella for NGOs (SUNGO) in May 2012. Support for a SUNGO-led proposal to produce a nation-wide citizen report card on the MDG achievements is underway. The Fiji Ecumenical Centre for Research, Education and Advocacy (ECREA) used the citizen report card tool to assess access to key services in three informal settlements in Fiji. The Centre provided technical assistance in analysing the findings resulting from the research tool and in integrating a rights-based approach. 20 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 21 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 A two-day workshop on anti-corruption was organised for 14 Pacific journalists during the 2012 Media Summit of the Pacific Islands News Association. The workshop focused on Freedom of Information as a key mechanism to expose and curb corruption and provided participants with examples from the Pacific and beyond on how journalists have strategically used investigative techniques as well as Freedom of Information legislation to report on corruption. The workshop enhanced South-South learning opportunities by providing a platform for Pacific journalists to share their expertise and skills. The workshop further provided participants with a deeper understanding on the link between human rights and corruption. A one-day training on rights-based approaches to development was provided to Fiji-based CSOs in partnership with the European Union Delegation. The training demonstrated concrete ways of enhancing rights-based approaches for ongoing project initiatives from participants and received enthusiastic feedback. Advancing Women\u2019s Role in the Pacific Progress towards gender equality and in particular women\u2019s participation in national decision-making processes in PICs remains a major challenge. Pacific Island countries have the lowest number of female parliamentarians in the world. FSM, Nauru and Vanuatu have no women in Parliament. As of December 2012, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Tuvalu, had each only one female parliamentarian. The marginalisation of women in political decision-making persists despite continued advocacy work with policy- makers on temporary special measures to promote women\u2019s representation in political decision making. No Pacific Island country to date has enacted legislation that reserves a defined number of seats for women. The Pacific Centre continued its advocacy on women\u2019s political participation and direct support to women candidates in 2012. It assisted the Office of the Department of Women and the UN office in PNG and organised a Practice Parliament for Women in April 2012. The Practice Parliament supported women candidates for the 2012 National Parliament elections by building their skills on Parliamentary procedures and rules, and by showcasing their potential to a broader audience. Three women were elected at the June 2012 elections, one of whom, Honourable Loujaya Toni, was a participant in the Practice Parliament. Margaret Loko, a participant and a candidate for a seat in the National Capital District, gave the following positive feedback", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d44c0e39-c0e4-4126-83b3-b10a03dfc6bc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d44c0e39-c0e4-4126-83b3-b10a03dfc6bc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "40b2a7f2754ae6a51647aa93df2d12872215e68b3996af1721705a7027bd714f"}}, "hash": "40b2a7f2754ae6a51647aa93df2d12872215e68b3996af1721705a7027bd714f", "text": "about the Practice Parliament \u201cThe Practice Parliament was a real eye opener for the women who participated and we learnt the finer details about parliamentary procedures of law making that we can put to good use once we are elected into Parliament. I felt like an MP in action today!\u201d Further in support of gender equality in political participation, the Centre launched the Pacific Women in Politics website (www.pacwip.org) as a knowledge-sharing portal for statistics, activities, news, publications, and partners that work to promote women in politics in the Pacific region. The website also acts as a platform to showcase the work of women in political decision-making positions. It is envisaged that the website will be further developed to support the specific needs of women candidates at national and sub-national levels, both in terms of campaigning support, as well as campaign fundraising. Recognising that discrimination against women in the Pacific can only be effectively addressed through the reform and implementation of existing laws to create an enabling environment for gender equality, the Centre provided further technical assistance to the Cook Islands Government in revising the draft Family Law Bill. With the support of UNDP\u2019s Bureau of Development Policy, more targeted technical advice on legislative reform was also provided to Kiribati, Tonga and Tuvalu which are engaged in undertaking legislative reform with the assistance of SPC\u2019s Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team (RRRT). In addition, the Centre has continued its innovative work of enhancing the implementation of legislation addressing gender-based violence through costing exercises. Building on the first costing exercise for the Cook Islands Government in 2011, the Marshall Islands Government requested the Centre\u2019s assistance in costing the implementation of the recently adopted Domestic Violence Prevention and Protection Act in 2012. The costing exercise which assessed costs for the law\u2019s implementation across all relevant Ministries over a three-year period was subsequently used by the Government for its annual budget allocation process. The Government succeeded in securing allocations from the national budget for the law\u2019s implementation. Enhancing Human Rights in the Pacific The Pacific Centre in addition to its continued support to advance women\u2019s rights in the region, has stepped up its support to governments and civil society in furthering human rights, in particular, in economic and social rights, which are closely related to MDGs. With regards to CSOs, the Centre conducted three two-day trainings that aimed at building the capacity of CSOs in documenting human rights situations and advocating for change at the national level. Two of the trainings (in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) focused on economic and social rights and were provided to a total of 45 participants. The third training focused on the rights of sexual minorities, which links closely to the Centre\u2019s work on HIV/AIDS, and was provided to 13 NGO participants from across the Pacific region. All trainings received very positive feedback from participants. As a result of these trainings and additional technical and financial support provided by the Centre, two human rights research and advocacy projects are underway and three additional proposals are currently under consideration. In the Solomon Islands, the NGO I Lukim Sustainability Solomon Islands (ISSI) is carrying out research on labour rights in small and medium size enterprises in Honiara. In Vanuatu, Transparency Vanuatu is documenting whether the Government\u2019s provision of school fee grants \u2013 aimed at abolishing primary level school fees \u2013 is reaching the parents and in turn leading to an increase in primary education enrolment. Based on the findings from this research, the Centre will provide further technical assistance to CSOs to analyse the data, and to design and implement advocacy strategies that are informed by the evidence gathered through the research. In addition to support provided to CSOs, the Centre in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, piloted a human rights impact assessment of trade agreement in Vanuatu. This pilot initiative was carried out following a research period on the inter-linkages between trade and human rights in the Pacific region and the publication of the UN guiding principles on human rights impact assessments of trade and investment agreements. The research undertaken to date showed the inter-linkages between trade and human rights and the considerable impact trade (including because of Pacific Island countries\u2019 reliance on imports) can have on people\u2019s enjoyment of their rights. The Centre finalized the desk-based human rights impact assessment of Vanuatu\u2019s World Trade Organization (WTO) accession package in 2012 with the aim of providing the Government with evidence-based information on how to mitigate predicted negative impact of the trade agreement as well as maximise potential benefits.

In addition, Pacific Island countries generally have had limited engagement with international human rights mechanisms and very few civil society organisations are undertaking human rights monitoring and advocacy. There are several reasons for this limited engagement. Often, Pacific Island countries with small administrations feel overburdened with the obligations that come with the ratification of human rights treaties. For example, countries need to submit regular detailed reports on what they have done to implement a human rights treaty. These reports require gathering of extensive evidence and data across ministries, which may not be easily accessible in these countries. Pacific Islanders have also voiced concerns that human rights are a foreign concept that undermines Pacific cultures and in particular it\u2019s strong community values. The Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation, published jointly by UNDP Pacific Centre and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, addresses such fears and gives a platform to Pacific Islanders on how human rights can be reconciled with the Pacific\u2019s distinct cultures. In the words of the former Fiji Vice-President Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi: \u201cCulture and human rights both concern rights. Human rights are understood to be the rights that are innate and inherent to each of us as individuals. Customary, traditional and cultural rights relate to our social mores as a distinct people of community. They include the ownership of the land and natural resources, folklore, traditional knowledge and social systems. Both these species of rights belong to us by virtue of who and what we are. It follows that we will need to balance them with each other, if we wish to derive benefit from both.\u201d The limited engagement of Pacific Island countries with human rights mechanisms started changing in recent years during which Pacific Island countries ratified additional human rights treaties, invited several UN Special Rapporteurs to investigate human rights issues and sought active engagement with human rights mechanisms. This has created a momentum for progress on human rights implementation in the region. The Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation can act in this context as an invaluable tool to further build on that progress. Pacific Island countries tend to face similar challenges when it comes to implementing human rights treaties and are therefore also more susceptible to adopting similar solutions. That is the approach taken by the Handbook, which is full of illustrative examples from across the Pacific that showcase what countries can do to implement human rights treaties at the national level. For example, it highlights legislative reform efforts that have been undertaken to address gender-based violence or discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; it shows examples of countries that have reached out to civil society to implement recommendations coming out of UN human rights mechanisms; and it gives examples of countries that have adopted action plans, gathered systematic data, set up coordination mechanisms, or have allocated budgetary resources for the implementation of human rights. In short, it\u2019s a tool full of illustrative examples of what Pacific Islands can do to further human rights and where they can receive assistance. At the launch of the Handbook in the lead-up to the 2012 International Human Rights Day, UNDP Deputy Assistant Administrator Nicholas Rosellini remarked: \u201cThe Handbook includes examples of concrete initiatives Pacific Island countries have undertaken to implement human rights treaties. And as such can help countries learn from each other and provide the introduction to potential South-South cooperation where countries interested can propose technical exchanges to learn first-hand how others have followed through after ratification.\u201d Besides these concrete examples, the Handbook also provides in-depth and easily accessible information about the main UN human rights mechanisms, ways of engaging with them, as well as a human rights glossary that explains the most common human rights terms. It is a comprehensive and accessible resource for any Pacific Island stakeholder committed to further human rights. The Handbook can be accessed from the Pacific Centre website.

Comprehensive policy analysis, the production and dissemination of vital statistics for MDGs and UNDAF indicators for monitoring purposes, provide Pacific Island governments with a range of policy options and ensure that sectoral and provincial policies and plans reflect national development priorities and MDGs acceleration. In 2012, stakeholders in Samoa and Vanuatu were trained on policy formulation and planning, including gender issues and macroeconomics. UNDP supported the preparation of the 2011 and 2012 Regional MDGs Tracking Reports through participating in the technical and editorial working groups as well as providing substantial inputs. UNDP joined PIFS, SPC and AusAID in an effort to update SPC regional MDGs database and ensure the consistency and accuracy of up-to-date data across UNDP, Council of Regional Organisations of the Pacific (CROP) agencies and other regional organisations. UNDP produced the Vanuatu 2012 Poverty Report. The Report utilises the wealth of information provided by the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey to analyse poverty, vulnerability and income distribution trends. The report monitors the progress in achieving MDG 1 targets during the period from 2006 to 2010 through comparative analysis of the 2006 and 2010 HIES. Developing Inclusive Growth and Trade Policy Options In an effort to help countries address the challenges of development, the Pacific Centre in 2012 developed policy to enhance inclusive growth and formulation of a trade, commerce and manufacturing sector plan for Samoa to guide the country\u2019s next National Development Strategy (2013-2023). The Centre also provided technical assistance to the formulation of Samoa\u2019s first Foreign Trade, Commerce and Manufacturing Centre Plan (2012-2016). The exercise aimed to provide the Government of Samoa with a range of policy options to enhance inclusive growth and accelerate progress towards the achievement of the MDGs while strengthening the focus on the private sector, with more emphasis on youth and women entrepreneurs. The Plan also enhances the linkages between the manufacturing and trade sectors, and the primary production sectors (e.g. agriculture, fishery and forestry), to increase income generating opportunities and sustainable livelihoods for the rural population and strike a balance between subsistence and commercial primary production. UNDP also provided crucial technical and financial support in the preparation and implementation of Vanuatu\u2019s first Industrial Policy and Roadmap to improve the contribution of the manufacturing sector to development. This Policy marks a shift in the Government\u2019s policies to support the private sector, from general incentives and tax holidays to more targeted and selective support, particularly to women and youth, that is tied to performance and enhancing access to finance, technology, mentoring and marketing. Vanuatu\u2019s new industrial policy includes a Roadmap aimed to boost the contribution of the manufacturing sector and reduce the country\u2019s chronic trade deficit by building on their natural comparative advantage and traditional knowledge to produce high value-added products for niche markets. In the context of implementing the industrial policy, UNDP established a system for monitoring the business environment and the cost of doing business in Vanuatu. Support to Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO) In 2012, UNDP continued its partnership and institutional capacity building with the Pacific Islands Private Sector Organisation (PIPSO). Technical advice and support to PIPSO included jointly organising three sub regional workshops on engaging the private sector to accelerate the MDGs in the Pacific. One of these was the Melanesian Workshop (for Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu) which focused on supporting women in business in the value chain and inclusive market development and strengthening Pacific women in business associations. The Centre\u2019s initial technical and institutional support to PIPSO has resulted in donors providing programming and core funding support to PIPSO each year.

This pilot initiative in Rakiraki, Fiji focused on providing legal, socio-economic and financial empowerment and development opportunities to women market vendors in the informal economy. The project also supported the development of social protection mechanisms and strengthening of the capacity of local governments and town councils to respond better to the needs of the women vendors. After successful implementation and favourable evaluation the Centre plans to roll out this initiative in the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in 2013. Promoting Public Private Partnerships in the Pacific A Regional Private Public Partnerships Roundtable was organised jointly by the Pacific Centre and the Asia Pacific Regional Centre in Bangkok, Thailand in partnership with the Commonwealth Local Government Forum, PIPSO and the AusAID Pacific Leadership Programme. Pacific Island countries including Fiji, Kiribati, Palau, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu participated at the Roundtable and was attended by more than 90 private sector representatives, national and local government officials, development partners and members of the civil society from around the Pacific. It examined how to develop partnerships between the public and private sectors that can lead to economic growth on a local level. Experiences from the Caribbean, Bangladesh, Nepal, New Zealand and Philippines, were shared at the meeting. The Roundtable\u2019s key focus was on the importance of pro-poor PPPs in accelerating the MDGs through improved economic and social services delivery for local economic development. HIV, Health and Development Despite HIV and AIDS not being widespread in Pacific Island countries, stigma and discrimination is hampering an effective response to it and puts people living with HIV at risk of human rights violations. In 2012, a priority of the Pacific Centre was to address the legal barriers to an effective HIV response in the Pacific. A technical assistance project was developed in close collaboration with the UNDP Samoa Multi Country Office to help the Cook Islands Government draft a human rights-based HIV Bill. Support was also provided for national HIV/ AIDS policy development in Fiji, PNG and Vanuatu. A Transformational Leadership Development training course, with 65 Church leaders and major theological schools in Fiji and Tonga was also held to reduce the stigma and discrimination in HIV/AIDS. The Centre partnered with the UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the South Pacific Association of Theological Schools (SPATS). At the sessions participants discussed subjects like the scientific basics of HIV and AIDS, analysed the disease and its implications, heard the testimonies of and interacted with people living with HIV and learned tools to assist them in raising the awareness of their church members. The Pacific Centre also collaborated with WHO and SPC for joint work on inter-sectoral approaches to non- communicable disease (NCD) epidemics. 26 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 27 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 Climate Change, Energy and Environment In 2012, the Pacific Centre provided support for the development of national climate change policies and better access to climate finance in the Cook Islands, Nauru, PNG and Samoa. It also increased its focus and commitment to renewable energy in the Cook Islands, Fiji, Palau and Tokelau. The publication, Green Transformation in the Energy Sector and the Energy Sector Review for the SPC Independent External Review were also completed. Samoa has joined Cambodia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Thailand in launching a Climate Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (CPEIR). A team from the Pacific Centre, UNDP Samoa Multi-Country Office and the Overseas Development Institute met with representatives from the Government of Samoa to initiate the assessment of current policy priorities and strategies as they relate to climate change and the extent to which these strategies and policies are coherent with national development, poverty reduction and economic growth strategies. The study reviewed institutional arrangements for promoting an integration of climate change policy priorities into budgeting and expenditure management, including within and across key ministries, local governments and stakeholders, and reviewed the integration of climate change objectives within the budgeting process. The CPEIR provided the Government of Samoa with detailed analysis and recommendations for accessing and managing climate finance. There is growing consensus that if developing countries \u201cdirectly access\u201d climate financing, this will result in more effective financial delivery, and promote greater country ownership of climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.

The UNDP has also provided technical assistance with the design of the SIDS DOCK Initiative leading to a US$2 million Pacific component. The initiative, among member countries of the Alliance of Small Island States (ASIS), aims to provide Small Island Developing States (SIDS) with a mechanism to assist them transform their national energy sectors into a catalyst for sustainable economic development and help generate financial resources to address adaptation to climate change. Cash and Confidence for Women Market Vendors Kamla and Seravina are part of a group of women market vendors in the small rural town of Rakiraki in Fiji who are now doing business differently. Kamla has started adding value to products for sale and increased her income. Seravina has used newly acquired financial management skills to provide her daughter with tertiary education and has mobilised other women market vendors to form a savings group. Both were part of a capacity building programme targeting women market vendors to strengthen their economic security and rights. A UN research compiled the socio-economic profile of market vendors in Fiji, showing that about 80 percent of market vendors in the western part of Fiji are women, with average weekly incomes ranging from US$71-141. Approximately 60 percent of market vendors grow their own produce for sale and mainly sell vegetables, root crops and fruits. The vendors work 10-hour days, six days a week. Vendor incomes in Fiji fluctuate quite a bit depending on several factors like the supply and quality of produce. Seravina has paid for her daughter\u2019s secondary school education with her earnings from the market 28 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 29 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 The Strengthening Women\u2019s Economic Security and Rights: Capacity Building Programme for Women Market Vendors benefited 300 women and is facilitated by UNDP in partnership with the Rakiraki Town Council and the local Market Vendors Association. The Project had a multi- pronged approach \u2013 improving the Town Council\u2019s income generation and management capacity, working with women market vendors to improve their business skills and strengthening the governance of the market vendors association. Improving the governance of the Association was important for ensuring the views of women are heard and presented as priorities to the Council and more women are involved in leading and managing the Association. Women market vendors attended a nine-week training programme starting in March, 2012. The training, conveniently structured into one and half hour long sessions to fit around their schedules was delivered in the English and vernacular languages. It covered areas such as business skills, budgeting, savings and women\u2019s rights. \u201cI have only attended school up to Class 5. This training was a great help to me as I did not know anything about running a business or financial management before,\u201d said 56-year-old Seravina, speaking in the iTaukei language. Seravina lives in a small village, an hour\u2019s drive from the Rakiraki market. She pays US$5 one way to reach the market where she sells root crops and bananas. \u201cThrough the training, I have been able to manage my income and pay US$1600 for my daughter\u2019s tertiary education. I am very proud of this!\u201d Seravina is also a key mobiliser of a local women market vendor\u2019s savings group. \u201cThe members of the savings group were all part of the training. I have created this group so that women can save money on a regular basis through the business skills we learnt.\u201d A bonus for Seravina from the training is her new found confidence, demonstrated by the ease with which she addresses public meetings and mobilises women market venders. Fifty-three-year-old Kamla supports her two children and retired husband from her earnings at the market. She admits that she has seen an increase in her earnings since she has started presenting vegetables differently. She is now able to save between US$5-10 per week. \u201cBefore the training, when I sold jackfruit, I would sell it in pieces. One large jackfruit could give me four pieces. Now, I prepare the jackfruit differently. I cut the larger piece into smaller pieces, ready for cooking. I have seen that this has increased my sales,\u201d said Kamla.

The flesh of the freshly cut vegetable is sticky and requires special attention and time for preparation before cooking. Kamla buys fruits and vegetables for sale and also uses produce from her backyard garden. Speaking about what had changed at the market since the start of the programme, she is quick to point out that the market is cleaner and has provided additional space for vendors like her who used to sell outside the market building, under the old mango tree. She also adds that the market now provides clean lavatory facilities, managed by a janitor which is welcome change from the situation before. Seini Raiko, the Special Administrator of the Rakiraki Town Council, is pleased with the changes being brought about through the programme. \u201cThe Rakiraki Town Council has seen an increase in its income. This is because market vendors are no longer lagging behind on their payment. The women market vendors are also enthusiastic about their businesses. The presentation of their stalls and their customer interaction has changed. Many have started saving and all have shown more commitment to being involved in the running of the local market vendors association,\u201d said Ms Raiko. The success of the project in Rakiraki has generated much interest in other town councils in Fiji. UNDP will replicate this project in two other rural markets in Fiji.

The partnership yielded significant advancement for financial inclusion in the region. Five central banks participated in a PFIP-funded review of the trust deed arrangements for e-money issuers, which resulted in recommendations for improvement that PIWG members will address in 2013. In June 2012, PFIP, AFI and the Asian Development Bank hosted a Microinsurance Regulators Workshop to introduce best practices for inclusive insurance regulation. Regulators from seven countries, including six PIWG members, attended. Six central banks then drafted and approved national microinsurance action plans; implementation will be coordinated through PIWG to optimise synergies and learning between the countries. In June, PIWG members undertook a knowledge exchange visit to Malaysia to learn about financial inclusion data collection systems. The ultimate aim is to determine what is needed in order to replicate similar systems by members. Finally, at AFI Global Policy Forum, the central banks of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu pledged commitment to the Maya Declaration on Financial Inclusion. PFIP served as technical advisor to the PIWG and will continue to do so in 2013. At the country level, the Reserve Bank of Vanuatu was supported to design and host a National Financial Inclusion Strategy Workshop, bringing together national and international stakeholders from the public and private sectors to discuss financial inclusion in Vanuatu. The workshop resulted in the development of a National Financial Inclusion Strategy, as well as a National Financial Inclusion Task Force (NFIT), and PFIP was asked to be a member. PFIP continued to be an active member of both the Fiji and Solomon Islands NFITs. Scalable and Replicable Project Highlights In 2012, work was undertaken with a wide range of partners in both private and public sectors to advance and expand microfinance and microinsurance coverage. Low-fee bank accounts, coupled with innovative agent- banking channels were introduced in Fiji, PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu which allowed the partners to reach 247,412 previously unbanked clients. PFIP assisted an international insurance company to launch the first community-based microinsurance scheme in the Pacific in Fiji by teaming up with community- and religious- based organisations to offer funeral coverage for as low as FJ$14 per year. PFIP partners introduced the world\u2019s first biometric ID system for international money transfers in Tonga, and launched Near Field Communication (NFC) systems to the Pacific, allowing customers to make purchases easier from their mobile wallets.

Comprehensive financial competency survey reports were published for Fiji and Samoa, which served as the basis for stakeholder workshops that yielded national strategies and action plans to improve financial capacity in both countries. Work is underway for similar reports and workshops in PNG and Solomon Islands. The pilot for Fiji\u2019s financial education project was successfully completed. As it is rolled out in 2013, in all 910 primary and secondary schools in the country, 197,000 students will be exposed to personal money management and investment within schools on an annual basis. To complement this work, PFIP facilitated the introduction of the Cha-Ching Programme, an innovative financial edu-tainment TV programme developed following the global financial crisis, to Fiji through brokering an agreement between Prudential Asia and Fiji TV. Knowledge Gathering and Knowledge Sharing An active learning agenda was maintained in 2012. Five participants (three central bank staff and one Micro Finance Institution manager) were supported to attend the Boulder Institute of Microfinance training held in Turin, Italy. Three focus notes were published on various aspects of microinsurance, three blogs on mobile money were published on respected industry websites and a number of key training activities were sponsored for regulators and financial service providers. Intensive research projects focusing on microinsurance (Fiji and PNG) and financial competency (Fiji, PNG, Samoa and Solomon Islands) were conducted, with results released. Further a financial diaries project has begun in PNG which will provide detailed insights into the financial activities of low-income households over a 40-week period. PFIP continues its role as an information clearinghouse for all things financial inclusion in the Pacific region. Financial Inclusion and Gender in the Pacific The Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme (PFIP) includes specific gender targets which must be met by both the Project and its private sector partners. The financial competency study focused on assessing the competency of women by soliciting information independently of men within low income households in rural Fiji. It highlighted that women are more competent in household financial management like budgeting and manage the household finances better. However, they have less awareness, information and access to financial tools and products. In September 2012, a National Strategy Workshop was led by the Reserve Bank of Fiji to share the findings of the study where an important policy outcome was achieved. It was decided that educating and training women on financial tools and products will form a critical component of the National Financial Inclusion strategy of Fiji and targeted financial literacy programmes that will be delivered to enable women to get access to financial products and tools. Similar financial competency studies have been carried out in PNG, Samoa and Solomon Islands. PFIP is currently working with the central bank in each country to share the findings and initiate appropriate policy responses through national workshops by bringing together both private and public sector stakeholders. Women are a major target of financial inclusion programme 32 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 33 UNDP Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012 In the areas of research, PFIP focuses on understanding both the competencies and the long term financial behaviour of women. To this end, PFIP launched the first of its kind initiative in the Pacific called the Financial Diaries project which seeks to understand the financial behaviour of 264 low income households including women and men across three provinces in PNG \u2013 Central, Eastern Highlands and West New Britain. This research captures how women and men respond differently and cope with unexpected events and differ in their engagement with a range of formal and informal financial products and transactions over a long-term period of 40 weeks. An important outcome of the research will be to lay the foundation for designing appropriate products targeted at women and men and to help the central bank initiate appropriate policy responses to enable private sector players to deliver products to the segment. Similar research was carried out in the Solomon Islands for a shorter period in three markets to understand women market vendors\u2019 entire range of financial interactions including income and expenditure and their impact on savings and their needs, awareness and preference for financial services. In providing training opportunities, PFIP has taken care to address gender equality, from training 50 women market vendors in Rakiraki about microinsurance in Fiji, to a regulatory workshop on insurance where 45 percent of the participants were women from central banks across seven countries, to training 300 women on microinsurance at microfinance", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b61f886-ae64-4df1-8906-d5577cb5eb37": {"__data__": {"id_": "6b61f886-ae64-4df1-8906-d5577cb5eb37", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Centre Annual Report 2012", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f9fe11897b10b9e0ded2e4a6f01824fbe994c388372d71cf17b781d6e133db12"}, "3": {"node_id": "4843ca7a-de5e-4785-be79-68bbf79ad7f6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-centre-annual-report-2012", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71b6c9ff55c798fa13039d49056860c0aff0b5344ac8d97db2e19406ad02747c"}}, "hash": "65748462d8dbdc9ef343995bb4f22a6165248fbafe1ea78a5a5322884ba80106", "text": "expos across different provinces in Fiji.

All human rights conventions (or treaties) which emerged subsequently have their origins in the UDHR. And as members of the United Nations, all States have committed to uphold the provisions of the Universal Declaration. Human rights standards represent principles and values that relate to the everyday lives of Pacific Islanders and are central for the region\u2019s development, peace, and security. They empower and enable all people, and in particular the less advantaged and marginalised, to enjoy meaningful and dignified lives as equals with everyone else. Pacific Island Countries have repeatedly committed themselves to the implementation of human rights. In the 2004 Auckland Declaration, which laid the foundation for the Pacific Plan, Pacific Islands Forum Leaders adopted the following vision: Leaders believe the Pacific region can, should and will be a region of peace, harmony, security and economic prosperity, so that all of its people can lead free and worthwhile lives.

We seek a Pacific region that is respected for the quality of its governance, the sustainable management of its resources, the full observance of democratic values and for its defence and promotion of human rights. 1 Almost all Pacific Island Countries have now ratified at least one of the nine core international human rights treaties, which contain legally binding norms. The region\u2019s overall level of human rights treaty ratification, however, remains low. There is no question that Pacific Island States, like all countries, face a series of challenges in implementing human rights treaties. Gaps in technical knowledge, geographic size and isolation, a wide range of budgetary and planning demands, and limited financial and human resources are among common challenges the region faces. This handbook aims at addressing both the practical as well as the political challenges that continue to exist. It aims to be a tool for overcoming these challenges for Government officials, policy-makers, civil society actors, traditional leaders, communities, members of Parliament, judges, as well as individuals and groups who promote human rights. It provides practical examples of how Governments, civil society, Parliamentarians and others have helped to realize human rights and how all stakeholders can contribute to the furthering of human rights in the Pacific. The handbook also discusses the challenges of realizing human rights in the context of cultural values and resource constraints. The region shows compelling and encouraging examples of successful initiatives that have advanced human rights standards and principles. This handbook lists several of these success stories with a view to enhancing knowledge-sharing within and among Pacific Island Countries. These examples also highlight how the implementation of human rights treaties contributes to achieving sustainable development and a dignified existence for all Pacific Islanders: women and men, girls and boys. The handbook is structured into four main chapters. The first chapter discusses the meaning and origins of human rights, the main sources of human rights law and the main international mechanisms to advance human rights. The second chapter then goes into a discussion of the importance of human rights in the Pacific and addresses the links between human rights and culture, development, good governance, and peace and security. The third chapter includes a detailed discussion of human Introduction rights treaty ratification, reporting, and implementation. The fourth and last chapter provides suggestions for civil society organizations, members of Parliament, and National Human Rights Institutions to advance the human rights norms enshrined in treaties. Moving human rights forward and making them a reality for the people in the Pacific requires a commitment across Government, Parliament, and civil society. This handbook aims to contribute towards the advancement of human rights in the Pacific by outlining concrete steps each of the stakeholders can take, and by discussing some of the most pressing human rights challenges for the region. The handbook was developed by UNDP Pacific Centre, with the cooperation of OHCHR Pacific and with support from UNDP\u2019s Global Human Rights Strengthening Programme. It is intended to be a dynamic tool and the UNDP Pacific Centre welcomes feedback on it.

Article 1, Universal Declaration of Human Rights Human rights can be defined as the basic standards without which people cannot live in dignity as human beings. Human rights are the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace. Human rights are often expressed and guaranteed by law, for example in the form of treaties. These legal guarantees protect individuals and groups against unlawful interference with their freedoms and dignity. Human rights law lays down obligations on States to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals within a country\u2019s borders. In other words, human rights regulate the conduct of States towards its citizens and towards other persons living in a State\u2019s territory or under a State\u2019s jurisdiction. Many international human rights standards, in particular civil and political rights and freedoms, have been incorporated into countries\u2019 constitutions and laws, including in the Pacific.2 Human rights have a number of distinct characteristics, which differentiate them from other rights provided for by national legislation. In particular: \u2022\ufffd Human\ufffdrights\ufffdare\ufffduniversal whatever our nationality, place of residence, sex, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, language, or other status, and regardless of our country\u2019s political, legal, economic, or cultural systems.

Every person is born with and has human rights and those rights cannot be taken away, except in very specific situations and following due process. For example, the right to liberty may be restricted if a person is found guilty of a crime by a court of law. \u2022\ufffd All\ufffdhuman\ufffdrights\ufffdare\ufffdindivisible and interdependent, whether they are civil and political rights, such as the right to life, equality before the law and freedom of expression; economic, social and cultural rights, such as the right to work, and to social security and education, or collective rights, such as the rights to development and self-determination. There is no hierarchy among human rights. All human rights are equally important; the improvement of one right facilitates advancement of the others and the deprivation of one right adversely affects the others. For example, it is meaningless to talk about the right to take part in one\u2019s country\u2019s public affairs for a person who goes hungry; a child is equally unable to realize the right to education if he or she is not at the same time protected from violence. \u2022\ufffd Non-discrimination is a cross-cutting principle in international human rights law and is present in all the major human rights documents. Non-discrimination applies to everyone in relation to all human rights and freedoms and it prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, race, descent, religion, language, political or other opinion, colour, nationality, social origin, property, disability, age, marital status, birth or other status.4 State Obligations Human rights law entails obligations on States. Specifically, States have the obligation under international law to respect, to protect and to fulfil human rights. The obligation to respect means that States must not interfere with the enjoyment of human rights. For example, in order to respect the right to education (article 28, Convention on the Rights of the Child) States should not adopt legislation that bars certain children from education; the obligation to respect the right to and adequate standard of living (article 11, International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights) obliges States not to forcibly evict people; States are also obliged not to arbitrarily limit freedom of expression (article 19, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) or the right of peaceful assembly (article 21, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). The obligation to protect means States are to protect individuals and groups against interference from third parties with the enjoyment of their rights. The obligation to protect the right to education, for example, obliges States to ban corporal punishment in schools as a form of discipline, as it interferes with the child\u2019s dignity and enjoyment of education; What are Human Rights? CHAPTER 1 \u2013 WHAT ARE HUMAN RIGHTS? PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 7 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 6 or it obliges States to work with parents to make sure children are able to attend school. The obligation to protect also means States are obliged to hold to account individuals or private entities that violate another person\u2019s rights (article 8, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), for example, by bringing to justice an employer who exploits another person through forced labour. The obligation to fulfil means that States must take positive action to facilitate and provide for the enjoyment of that right through the adoption of laws, policies, action plans etc. The obligation to fulfil the right to education (article 28, Convention on the Rights of the Child), for example, obliges States to take appropriate legislative, administrative, social or other measures to prevent school drop-outs and ensure that children in remote communities have access to education. With regard to protection from torture and ill-treatment (article 7, International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; article 2, Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment), the obligation to fulfil obliges States to set up mechanisms to prevent torture and ill-treatment and hold perpetrators accountable, such as through the adoption of codes of conduct for prison guards, or by setting up independent bodies mandated to prevent and investigate incidents of alleged ill-treatment by State officials. Not all rights are absolute, and States may lawfully curtail rights, for example, by imprisoning a person convicted of a crime. States may also limit the enjoyment of rights on the basis of national security, public order, public morals, or public health. But such limitations must be justified, legitimate and proportionate to the stated reasons. During times of public emergencies, States may lawfully derogate from (or suspend) granting rights, such as the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a4d1d342-b0a7-4e9d-9ad8-d913e5e84276": {"__data__": {"id_": "a4d1d342-b0a7-4e9d-9ad8-d913e5e84276", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "3699e9516665c4c734b641626e62c01e44b6a948674e0ad0158f22b1f942c7d4"}}, "hash": "3699e9516665c4c734b641626e62c01e44b6a948674e0ad0158f22b1f942c7d4", "text": "movement, or freedom of expression. But such derogations must follow lawful procedures and be strictly necessary and proportionate to the severity of the crisis. Some rights are non-derogable and must never be suspended, including the prohibition on torture, prohibition of slavery, and rights essential for basic human survival.5 Individual Responsibilities At the individual level, while we are all entitled to our human rights, we as individuals or groups have responsibilities with regard to the rights granted to us. As individuals or civil society actors, we play an important role in safeguarding and promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms and in contributing to the promotion of these values. We also have duties towards the community, in which the development of our personality is possible. And we have the duty to respect the human rights of others and may not harm others in the pursuit of our own human rights. We also have a duty to exercise our rights responsibly and not contrary to their purposes. For example, we may not use our freedom of speech to incite hatred against persons belonging to a different group.6 The Origins of Human Rights and the Development of Human Rights Treaties and Mechanisms On 10 December 1948, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), a milestone agreement in the history of human rights. The UDHR was drafted in the United Nations by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world. It represents \u2018a common standard of achievement for all peoples and nations\u2019.7 The UDHR is the first formal acknowledgement and agreement by the international community in all its diversity that all human beings are to enjoy civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. The foundation for the UDHR was laid with the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945. The Charter defines the purpose of the United Nations to maintain international peace and security; to develop friendly relations among nations based on respect of equal rights and self-determination of peoples; and to achieve international cooperation \u201cin promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion\u201d. 8 All States who are members of the United Nations are to live up to the principles and standards laid out in the UDHR. Over time, the UDHR has become widely accepted as containing the human rights framework that all States should realize. While the UDHR represented the first formal agreement on human rights and was catalysed by the horrors inflicted upon humankind during World War II, the origins of human rights go back much further. In fact, the modern concept of human rights has been evolving throughout human history. In particular, the idea that individuals or groups are to enjoy rights and freedoms goes back thousands of years. Steps towards today\u2019s human rights standards were first codified by the ancient cultures of today\u2019s Middle East, in ancient Greece, and during the so-called Age of Enlightenment in medieval Europe. The world\u2019s main religions provided another important source of values that contributed to shaping today\u2019s human rights norms. Customs and cultures across the world, including in the Pacific, mirror the values enshrined in today\u2019s human rights norms. For example, the culture of \u2018Kerekere\u2019 in Fiji is a form of a community-based social security system that aims to ensure that everyone has the basic resources for a dignified life, such as food, shelter, and clothing. A person\u2019s request for such assistance may not be refused by the community, which makes it distinct from begging and gives it the status of an entitlement, in line with a human rights based approach Similarly, \u2018Bubuti\u2019 in Kiribati is a social security system that obliges better-off members of the community to share with those in need. It is founded on the concept that everyone is equal and socially obliged to provide assistance to those in need. \u2018Bubuti\u2019 is initiated by the receiver, which is in line with the notion of an entitlement (or right) of those in need. The \u2018Bubuti\u2019 system is subject to stringent protocol, only done in cases of extreme need, and premised on the notion of self-sufficiency and reciprocity.9 And, finally, the Palaun culture includes the tradition of hosting sea drifters who come ashore in Palau, which can be seen as a forerunner of provisions in today\u2019s Refugees Convention. Also, with regard to accountability, a human rights principle, historic examples of accountability can be found in traditional governance structures in the Pacific. Scholars have found, for example, that the chiefly structure of pre-colonial Fiji was based", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "437ce9af-7d6b-4e9f-a927-88a9441f2f8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "437ce9af-7d6b-4e9f-a927-88a9441f2f8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "f8de29fa361ede611bfa3996d22e12487ff344c808cb29c54a6a9d95e93bc5fe"}}, "hash": "f8de29fa361ede611bfa3996d22e12487ff344c808cb29c54a6a9d95e93bc5fe", "text": "on several principles that are today recognized as \u201cgood governance\u201d principles. These include, in particular, accountability of the chief to the community, a chief\u2019s readiness to help and serve others, and a role to protect those around him from ill-treatment.10 The UDHR has provided the foundation for the adoption of legally binding international human rights treaties. The first two of these treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights were both adopted by the General Assembly in 1966. Together with the UDHR, they form what is known as the International Bill of Rights. A total of nine core human rights treaties adopted since 1966 have now given legal form to human rights values and have developed the body of international human rights norms. Many of these core human rights treaties have been complemented by optional protocols (see the next section). By ratifying or acceding to human rights treaties States assume the legal obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the norms enshrined in these treaties. Human Rights Treaties and Optional Protocols The following tables provide an overview of the content of the nine core international human rights treaties and optional protocols, including their year of adoption by the UN General Assembly (which marks the year the international community agreed on and adopted the content of a treaty) as well as their year of entering into force (which marks the year the necessary number of States ratified a treaty and the treaty as a result came into force). Optional protocols to treaties may either provide for procedures (such as a complaints or communication procedure for individuals who allege that a right under the treaty had been violated) or they address a substantive area related to the treaty (death penalty; children in armed conflict etc.). Optional protocols to human rights treaties are treaties in their own right, and are open to signature, accession or ratification by countries who are party to the main treaty. The tables are followed by a brief summary of the content of each of the core treaties and a description of a human rights issue in the Pacific that is relevant to the treaty.

Two optional protocols to the ICCPR allow States to accept additional obligations. The first protocol establishes a communications procedure and the second requires States to abolish the death penalty The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) The Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, like the ICCPR, develops the corresponding rights in the UDHR and specifies steps for their full realization. Two notable differences with the ICCPR are the principle of progressive realization in the ICESCR as well as the obligation on States to seek international assistance for the realization of the Covenant. The ICESCR acknowledges the constraints States face in fulfilling their obligations under the Covenant because of their limited resources and varying stages of development. The Covenant therefore allows States flexibility to implement the Covenant\u2019s provisions in line with their available resources. At the same time, it requires States to take immediate steps towards their realization, to make sure that provisions are implemented in a non-discriminatory manner, and to guarantee minimum essential levels of each right, such as food, primary health care, and basic shelter. The rights contained in the ICESCR include the right to health, to education, to work and the right to an adequate standard of living. Examples of cultural rights contained in the ICESCR include the right to take part in cultural life and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific programs. An optional protocol that provides for individual complaints supplements the Covenant and has been opened for signature in 2008. Realization of these rights within the context of rapid urbanization, pressures on the traditional economy, and increased exposure to international trade is at the core of development challenges in the Pacific region. The Right to Life Sorcery and witchcraft allegations, predominantly against women, remain common in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea and have led to displacement and brutal killings of persons accused of sorcery. Even though comprehensive data on the extent of killings and displacement does not exist, it has been reported that those who face witchcraft allegations are frequently vulnerable individuals who lack protection. The number of women victims is higher and reportedly increasing. There is a perception that accusations of sorcery are used as a disguise for premeditated murder or to take over land or possessions of those accused. Responses by police to protect individuals at threat of being seriously harmed or killed have been found inadequate, partly because of lack of resources and limited presence, but also because of widespread perception that attacks or killings are justified and a community matter. Sorcery related killings may amount to a violation of the right to life and may constitute a form of gender based violence. The Government of Papua New Guinea, as part of its review under the Universal Periodic Review, committed itself to review the law on sorcery and sorcery-related killings, to strengthen the enforcement of relevant legislation, and to investigate, prosecute, and punish perpetrators of such crimes.12 ICCPR, Article 6, section 1 1. Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 11 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 10 The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) CEDAW was developed in recognition of on-going and persistent discrimination against women and girls. By ratifying the convention, States accept the obligation to pursue the elimination of discrimination against women by all appropriate means. CEDAW lays out a framework to comprehensively address women\u2019s rights in the civil, political, economic, social, and cultural spheres. It spells out specific measures to address persistent discrimination against women in areas such as political decision-making, marriage and the family, and employment. CEDAW is one of the most widely-ratified human rights treaties in the Pacific. At the same time, discrimination against women remains pervasive across the region \u2013 manifesting itself, for example, in extremely low political participation and a very high prevalence of violence against women. The Right to Adequate Housing 45% of the population of Port Moresby lives in informal settlements.

In addition, the assessment mission found that residents lack basic services such as water, electricity, and garbage collection, which leads to poor hygiene and health, in particular among children. Many residents of informal settlements have moved from the countryside to urban areas in search of employment, education, and health care. Others are compelled to live in informal settlements because their wage is insufficient to pay for the city\u2019s high rents. Despite the continued growth of settlements, Papua New Guinea does not have a national housing policy, laws to protect tenants against forced evictions, or rent-control laws.13 ICESCR, article 2 1. Each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and co-operation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures. 2. The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to guarantee that the rights enunciated in the present Covenant will be exercised without discrimination of any kind as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. 3. Developing countries, with due regard to human rights and their national economy, may determine to what extent they would guarantee the economic rights recognized in the present Covenant to non-nationals. ICESCR, article 11, section 1 1. The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions. The States Parties will take appropriate steps to ensure the realization of this right, recognizing to this effect the essential importance of international co-operation based on free consent. The International Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) The International Convention on the Rights of the Child recognises the child as a distinct individual with corresponding rights. At the same time, the Convention upholds the rights and responsibilities of families and communities in the protection and upbringing of children. The International Convention on the Rights of the Child is the only human rights convention that has been ratified by all Pacific Island Countries. The convention is supplemented by two optional protocols, addressing the prohibition of children\u2019s involvement in armed conflict, and prohibiting the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography. A third optional protocol that allows for a complaints procedure was adopted by the General Assembly at the end of 2011 and is currently open for signature. Protection from Gender-Based Violence A 2010 country-wide study on the prevalence of violence against women and girls in Kiribati found that 68% of women who ever had a partner had experienced at least one act of physical or sexual violence, or both, by an intimate partner. Around half of the women who have experienced physical or sexual partner violence reported being injured at least once. They reported suffering from abrasions and bruises; sprains and dislocations; cuts, punctures, and bites; fractures and broken bones; and eardrum and eye injuries. Furthermore, 23% of women who had ever been pregnant reported being physically abused during pregnancy, and that group was significantly more likely to experience miscarriage or have a baby die.14 Only 14% of women who had experienced partner violence reported it to the police. This finding, which is supported by qualitative research, indicated that women possibly felt that the police can offer them little protection.15 The study and its findings resulted in the Government of Kiribati preparing an action plan to address violence against women and children, commissioning legislative reform to introduce a domestic violence law, and in the personal commitment and involvement of the country\u2019s President in ending violence against women.16 CEDAW, article 1 For the purposes of the present Convention, the term \u201cdiscrimination against women\u201d shall mean any distinction, exclusion or restriction made on the basis of sex which has the effect or purpose of impairing or nullifying the recognition, enjoyment or exercise by women, irrespective of their marital status, on a basis of equality of men and women, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural, civil or any other field.17 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 13 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 12 The International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) The International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) defines racial discrimination as acts that negate", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ca8ea84e-d53c-4ef5-bf1f-06516d7eb029": {"__data__": {"id_": "ca8ea84e-d53c-4ef5-bf1f-06516d7eb029", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "c25ce0e1de8f86a297e72755cbd8182649379255c6c9eb058b057ebb8cb7fdd6"}}, "hash": "c25ce0e1de8f86a297e72755cbd8182649379255c6c9eb058b057ebb8cb7fdd6", "text": "rights by virtue of a person\u2019s race, color, descent, or national or ethnic origin. It sets out specific obligations on States to combat racial discrimination, for example through legislative reform; adoption of policies; by refraining from acts of racial discrimination; and by refraining from encouraging a person or organization that practices racial discrimination. Racial discrimination can take various forms such as racial prejudice, which is the assumption that someone is inferior because of their race. In the Pacific, ethnicity has been a contributing factor in conflicts and riots. For example, businesses owned by minorities or migrant workers have been deliberately destroyed and violence has targeted members of ethnic minority groups. ICERD provides a basis for Governments in the Pacific to amend and improve laws, policies, and practices that fuel racial discrimination. The International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) The International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which came into force in May 2008, marks a shift in attitudes and approaches towards persons with disabilities as it underscores their independence and autonomy. It provides for recognition of people with disabilities as human beings who enjoy the same human rights as everyone else, and stresses their role as full and active members of society, rather than as \u201cobjects\u201d of charity or medical treatment. The convention addresses political and civil rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights of persons with disabilities, with a focus on non-discrimination, participation in public life, and access to services, facilities, and information, all of which help ensure their full enjoyment of rights and participation in society. The convention is supplemented by an optional protocol that allows for individuals to submit complaints to the Treaty Body overseeing the convention\u2019s implementation. Birth Registration In Vanuatu, only about 40 % of the population had their births registered and registration forms are often not filled out, or are lost on their way to the capital. To respond to this problem, Vanuatu\u2019s civil status office introduced a system to register births and deaths by using mobile phone text messages. Health workers in Epi and Santo are being given mobile phones to send birth and death data in text messages to the civil status office. Safeguards have been introduced to eliminate the possibility of double registrations. This approach is also being initiated in the Solomon Islands where registration of births is the lowest in the Pacific. The Government anticipates reaching 80% of the population living away from Honiara in remote provincial communities with the eventual use of the mobile phone registration. Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child require the immediate registration of the birth of a new-born child. Registration is crucial for an individual\u2019s life, because it determines identity and citizenship and may also regulate access to other human rights such as education or health care. CRC, article 7 1. The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents. 2. States Parties shall ensure the implementation of these rights in accordance with their national law and their obligations under the relevant international instruments in this field, in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless. ICCPR, article 24 1. Every child shall have, without any discrimination as to race, colour, sex, language, religion, national or social origin, property or birth, the rights to such measures of protection as are required by his status as a minor, on the part of his family, society and the State. 2. Every child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have a name. 3. Every child has the right to acquire a nationality. Protection from Racial Discrimination Rioters in the Solomon Islands in early 2006, protesting against the new Prime Minister, destroyed and looted about 90% of the Chinese-owned business district of Honiara, leading to the displacement of more than 1,000 people, mainly ethnic Chinese. The Solomon Islands Governor General officially apologised to the displaced community. The 2006 riots in the Solomon Islands was not the first time that violence had been directed at ethnic Chinese in the Pacific. Later the same year, during violent protests in the capital of Tonga, rioters targeted and looted shops owned by Chinese business people leading to hundreds of Chinese being homeless. Violence targeting Chinese in Tonga has been reported to be part of a wider resentment at their role in the retail sector.18 ICERD, article", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e524d14b-b559-4025-a1d2-1a8149cdc72d": {"__data__": {"id_": "e524d14b-b559-4025-a1d2-1a8149cdc72d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "4231fe432196bc65ad2a81636a4491a28c9c7dde2bbdf4298bf4bce04afb731e"}}, "hash": "4231fe432196bc65ad2a81636a4491a28c9c7dde2bbdf4298bf4bce04afb731e", "text": "1, section 1 1.

PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 15 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 14 The International Convention against All Forms of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) The International Convention against All Forms of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) includes the right to be protected against torture and other forms of ill-treatment. The convention sets out a framework for the prevention and punishment of such acts and makes clear that there is an absolute ban on such practices. Despite this absolute ban and incorporation of international standards into national legislation in the Pacific, torture continues to occur, including in the Pacific. The convention is supplemented by an optional protocol that sets up a prevention mechanism by allowing international and national bodies regular visits to places of detention. The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of their Families (ICRMW) The Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families seeks to protect the rights of all migrant workers and their families during the migration cycle, from preparation for departure up to a person\u2019s return. The convention reinforces the notion that migrants are not only workers, but human beings with rights. It does not create new rights for migrants but aims to guarantee equality of treatment, such as equal working conditions for migrants and nationals in a country, as well as protection from exploitation. International migration has become an intrinsic feature of global mobility, including in the Pacific. Pacific Island Countries are both sending and receiving countries for labour migrants and there has been a long tradition of migration from and to the Pacific. Pacific Islanders have migrated regionally and beyond for better living standards, including under specific labour migration schemes, and migrants have travelled to Pacific Island Countries for gainful employment. To date, Palau has signed the convention, but none of the Pacific Island Countries have ratified the convention despite its relevance for the region.22 Disabled Women\u2019s Rights to Equality A census on women with disabilities in Samoa identified that the majority of these women (83%) lived in rural areas and that their disability was primarily caused by non-communicable diseases, ageing, and birth defects. 80% of women with disabilities never married. With regards to education, the census identified that 52% of women who were disabled from birth or became disabled during their first five years have not attended school or only attended for a maximum of three years. Male children of the same category fared better with 42% either not attending school or attending only for up to three years. The survey also revealed discrimination at the level of local decision-making. Only 9% of women with disabilities reported they were involved in village systems. The majority therefore was not involved in decision-making on village development programs that could potentially provide them with improved access to services.19 Samoa has taken action to realize the", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "55bc8363-6cbc-44c9-a22c-ab4d137bdde9": {"__data__": {"id_": "55bc8363-6cbc-44c9-a22c-ab4d137bdde9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d988aeefa96460a1f45ce80247177197d221ce82c3f35a4e46a8b6960b4a4cc6"}}, "hash": "d988aeefa96460a1f45ce80247177197d221ce82c3f35a4e46a8b6960b4a4cc6", "text": "rights of persons with disabilities. In 2011, the Government pledged to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; it prepared and started implementation of a National Policy for Persons with Disabilities; it set up a disability taskforce, and a focal point unit for persons with disabilities within the Ministry of Women, Community, and Social Development. Staff from that unit underwent training on mainstreaming disability and gender into the national development plan and on preparing Samoa\u2019s implementation of the CRPD following the country\u2019s accession.20 CRPD, article 5 - Equality and non-discrimination 1. States Parties recognize that all persons are equal before and under the law and are entitled without any discrimination to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law. 2. States parties shall prohibit all discrimination on the basis of disability and guarantee to persons with disabilities equal and effective legal protection against discrimination on all grounds. 3. In order to promote equality and eliminate discrimination, States parties shall take all appropriate steps to ensure that reasonable accommodation is provided. 4. Specific measures which are necessary to accelerate or achieve de facto equality of persons with disabilities shall not be considered discrimination under the terms of the present Convention. CRPD, article 6 \u2013 Women with disabilities 1. States Parties recognize that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple discriminations, and in this regard shall take measures to ensure the full and equal enjoyment by them of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. 2. States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the full development, advancement and empowerment of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms set out in the present Convention. Protection from Torture and Ill-Treatment Vanuatu has faced repeated crises in its criminal justice system over the past 15 years, which included mass arrests, reports of widespread ill-treatment of detainees by police, mass prison breaks, lack of civilian control over security forces, and deaths in custody from alleged acts of torture. Government, civil servants and representatives of the justice sector have acknowledged that the practice of torture and ill-treatment has been widespread and needs to be addressed as part of a reform process of the justice sector, on which the country has since embarked. As part of that reform process, Vanuatu became the first country in the Pacific to ratify the UN Convention against Torture in June 2011. 21 CAT, article 1, section 1 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term \u201ctorture\u201d means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 17 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 16 Protection from Exploitation and Forced Labour Several instances have been reported in which migrant workers in the Pacific have faced exploitation. With regard to Australia, for example, it has been noted that migrant workers from Pacific Islands were among those who have been subjected to forced labour, confiscation of travel documents, threats, or debt bondage. Palau, which has a migrant worker population of one-third of the country\u2019s population, has been reported as a destination country for forced labour where some migrant workers have been coerced into exploitative working conditions.23 The Government of Palau\u2019s national report to the UPR acknowledges that migrant workers have been exposed to working excessive hours without pay, threats of physical or financial harm, confiscation of travel documents and the withholding of salary payments, as tools of coercion. The Government reported that it was formulating a plan to address these violations, including through cooperation with foreign embassies.24 ICRMW, art. 11 1.

CPED, articles 1-5 article 1 1. No one shall be subjected to enforced disappearance. 2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance. article 2 For the purposes of this Convention, \u201cenforced disappearance\u201d is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law. article 3 Each State Party shall take appropriate measures to investigate acts defined in article 2 committed by persons or groups of persons acting without the authorization, support or acquiescence of the State and to bring those responsible to justice. article 4 Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under its criminal law. article 5 The widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CPED) The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was adopted in 2006 to combat the grave human rights violation of State-enforced disappearances. It was drafted in response to the recognition that international law did not provide for the prevention of such crimes, or for effective remedies and reparation for victims. Disappearances differ from abduction in that an enforced disappearance has political motives, no demands are issued and the offenders act on behalf of the State or with its backing. CPED obliges States parties to prevent such crimes and to hold any person involved in an enforced disappearance criminally responsible. It recognises the families\u2019 rights to know the truth about the fate of a disappeared person and to obtain reparations. It also requires States to institute stringent safeguards for people deprived of their liberty; to search for the disappeared person and, if they have died, to locate and return the remains. CPED is the most recent human rights convention to have come into force and so far has not been ratified by any of the Pacific Island Countries. Palau has signed the convention. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 19 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 18 Pacific Ratification of Human Rights Treaties Every Pacific Island Country has now ratified at least one of the nine core international human rights treaties.

By signing a treaty, while not yet legally bound by the treaty\u2019s provisions, a State commits itself not to undermine the spirit of the treaty. Upon ratification, accession or succession (depending on the legal set-up of each country) the country then becomes legally bound by the treaty\u2019s provisions.25 The Treaty Bodies A Government that ratifies or accedes to a human rights treaty agrees to the legally binding nature of the treaty\u2019s provisions and to its implementation at the national level.26 The implementation of treaties as well as of optional protocols by States who are parties is monitored by a Committee of Experts set up under the treaty. These Committees of Experts, which are elected by States, are called Treaty Bodies or Committees. Treaty Bodies are mandated to seek information and monitor implementation of the conventions at the national level. They also provide guidance, assistance and encouragement to Governments in following through with the implementation of a convention\u2019s provisions. Currently, nine Treaty Bodies, one under each treaty, oversee the implementation of the core human rights treaties. Through ratification or accession a State commits itself to periodically report on its implementation of the rights contained in a human rights treaty. Each treaty specifies when and how regularly a State party has to submit such a report. Typically, a first report is expected within 1 or 2 years after ratification, and thereafter every 4 to 5 years or upon request by the Treaty Body. The following table provides an overview of the Treaty Bodies set up under each of the human rights conventions and the reporting cycles under each treaty: TREATY BODY FOLLOWING RATIFICATION, FIRST REPORT DUE WITIN PERIODIC REPORTS DUE EVERY Human Rights Committee (oversees ICCPR) 1 year 4 years Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (oversees ICESCR) 2 years 5 years Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (oversees ICERD) 1 year 2 years Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (oversees CEDAW) 1 year 4 years Committee against Torture (oversees CAT) 1 year 4 years Committee on the Rights of the Child (oversees CRC) 2 years 5 years Committee on Migrant Workers (oversees ICRMW) 1 year 5 years Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (oversees CRPD) 2 years 4 years Committee on Enforced Disappearances (oversees CPED) 2 years -- 27 In addition to the above nine Treaty Bodies, the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture has been set up under the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture. The Subcommittee is an operational body that aims to prevent torture and ill-treatment by visiting places of detention and by providing advisory services to Governments. Treaty Bodies are mandated to receive and consider reports submitted by State parties and civil society, and they also issue guidelines to assist States with the elaboration of their reports. Treaty Bodies furthermore issue general comments that provide authoritative interpretation of a given provision of a human rights treaty, and they organize discussions on themes related to the treaties. Some Treaty Bodies may consider complaints or communications from individuals, provided the State has ratified the relevant optional protocol. Some Treaty Bodies may also conduct inquiries.

The mechanisms under the UN Charter apply to all UN member States irrespective of whether they have ratified human rights treaties. The Human Rights Council (HRC) The Human Rights Council is an inter-governmental body made up of 47 States with meetings held in Geneva. It was set up in 2006 and replaced the Commission on Human Rights. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) serves as the HRC\u2019s secretariat. The Human Rights Council\u2019s main mandate is to address situations of human rights violations all over the world; to promote universal respect for the protection of human rights; and to promote coordination and mainstreaming of human rights within the United Nations system. It is further mandated to contribute to the prevention of human rights violations through dialogue and cooperation, and to respond promptly to human rights emergencies. Last but not least, the Human Rights Council is in charge of the Universal Periodic Review, of a system of Special Procedures and of a complaints procedure (discussed in more detail in the following sections). The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) The Universal Periodic Review is a new mechanism established with the creation of the Human Rights Council. As its name says, it is a universal mechanism, meaning that the human rights record of every UN Member State, without exception, will be reviewed by Council members every four to five years, and irrespective of whether a State has ratified or reported on human rights treaties. The review is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its aim is to improve the human rights situation in all countries and to address human rights violations wherever they occur. The UPR is an inter-governmental process and provides all UN member States with an opportunity to review their human rights record, and to make commitments on how to improve people\u2019s enjoyment of human rights in their country, based on the recommendations made by other UN Member States. SCHEDULE FOR UPCOMING UPR REVIEW OF PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES 2013 2014 2015 2016 Tuvalu Fiji Kiribati Palau Tonga Vanuatu Marshall Islands Papua New Guinea Federated States of Micronesia Samoa Nauru Solomon Islands The following table provides the tentative schedule for the upcoming reviews of Pacific Island Countries under the UPR over the next four years.29 To review the human rights record of a particular State, the Human Rights Council relies on three sources of information: the national State report; a report containing information from the United Nations (compiled by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights); and a report summarizing information submitted by other stakeholders, such as civil society organizations and National Human Rights Institutions. The review further consists of a three-hour dialogue between the State under review and the member and observer States of the Human Rights Council. That dialogue is broadcast live on the internet, and the webcasts are archived for later viewing.30 This allows any person of a given country to watch and hear their Government\u2019s account of the human rights situation, the questions asked by other States, and the Government\u2019s commitments towards improving the situation.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "361cbe64-f3d1-499f-a24a-19e215b45742": {"__data__": {"id_": "361cbe64-f3d1-499f-a24a-19e215b45742", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "e0e854641aec96417ac9e243f76bb51a5e362d4d79130d0ddd8d2307192d0472"}, "2": {"node_id": "445cd69c-45a7-4d84-b8ae-b310268319d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2fe3f6a71127e575fd9fc5415247e5328fcaa9ccd7f30daf021a6de2b98b9e0b"}}, "hash": "f41f71f5ba05bdcafdafaa233ecbfa462506ca20cd09f3d1c5a0d82a35b2cbd5", "text": "At the end of each review, an outcome document is adopted with recommendations for the State under review to better implement its human rights obligations.31 The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) Process A.

The UPR review is led by member States as opposed to independent human rights experts that review a State under the treaty reporting process.

States who face difficulties to fund delegates for the UPR session can apply for financial support as well as training to prepare for the review process.32 To date, all Pacific Island Countries have been reviewed once under the UPR. The following list provides a glimpse of some of the pledges Pacific Island Countries have made under the UPR: \u2022\ufffd Fiji: The Fiji delegation expressed a commitment to hold democratic elections by September 2014 and stated that the Public Emergency Regulation would be lifted following the promulgation of the Fiji Media Decree. The Fiji Government lifted the Public Emergency Regulations in January 2012 and started preparations for the holding of elections scheduled for 2014.33 \u2022\ufffd Vanuatu: The Vanuatu delegation committed to setting up a National Human Rights Institution and to issuing a standing invitation to Special Procedures to visit the country (see the following section for a discussion about Special Procedures). Following the review, the Vanuatu Government has undertaken concrete steps to set up a National Human Rights Institution.34 \u2022\ufffd Palau: the Palau Government delegation reaffirmed during its UPR review its commitment to establish a National Human Rights Institution and to issue a standing invitation to all Special Procedures. It also committed itself to decriminalize same sex relationships between consenting adults and to remove discriminatory provisions against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender persons. It further committed to signing all core international human rights treaties and to consider ratification of these treaties. Palau signed on to eight human rights treaties in September 2011.35 \u2022\ufffd Nauru: The Government of Nauru committed itself to ratifying CEDAW and ICCPR and its two optional protocols and said it was actively considering the signing of the Refugees Convention during its UPR review. It also committed itself to decriminalize same sex relationships between consenting adults. The country did ratify CEDAW and the Refugees Convention in mid-2011.36 \u2022\ufffd Federated States of Micronesia (FSM): As an outcome of the UPR review, FSM committed itself to ratify the optional protocols to the CRC. It also accepted the recommendation to include sexual orientation and gender identity as prohibited grounds for discrimination in law. Resolved to act on recommendations to pass comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation, FSM created a Task Force and began the accession process to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children.37 It also ratified the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography in April 2012.38 \u2022\ufffd Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI): Following the UPR review, the RMI Government committed itself to implement all recommendations relating to violence against women and to adopt domestic laws and policies. It delivered on its commitment with the adoption of the country\u2019s domestic violence prevention and protection act in October 2011.39 All countries will have to report on the implementation of their commitments after some four and half years.40 The recurring reporting cycle allows for a gradual improvement of the human rights situation and for delivery on commitments made in international fora. Special Procedures Special Procedures is the name given to mechanisms established under the Human Rights Council that address either specific country situations or thematic issues globally. Special Procedures are either individuals or working groups of usually five members (one from each region). Persons who hold a Special Procedures mandate (they are called \u201cSpecial Rapporteur\u201d, \u201cSpecial Representative\u201d, \u201cIndependent Expert\u201d, or \u201cWorking Group\u201d) examine, monitor, advise and publicly report on the human rights situations in a specific country (country mandate), or on a specific issue (thematic mandate) in any country. Special Procedures mandate holders may respond to individual complaints, conduct studies, provide advice at the country level, and engage in the promotion of a given human rights issue. The mandates of the Special Procedures are established and defined through resolutions passed by the Human Rights Council. Mandate-holders are independent and serve in their expert capacity. They do not receive salaries or any other financial compensation for their work. Their independence is crucial for the impartial exercise of their mandate. As of October 2012, there are 36 thematic and 12 country mandates. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights services these mechanisms with personnel, policy, research, and logistical support. The mandates of Special Procedures keep evolving and some of the recent Special Procedures established under the Human Rights Council include the appointment of a Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery (2007), an Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ebe57b02-c2c9-40ca-9ef8-c1e4318740a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ebe57b02-c2c9-40ca-9ef8-c1e4318740a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "af208e69ee3221031a6ac514e52c7622ed0d45480b710132d3c42aacb45af8c4"}}, "hash": "af208e69ee3221031a6ac514e52c7622ed0d45480b710132d3c42aacb45af8c4", "text": "access to safe drinking water and sanitation (2008), an Independent Expert in the field of cultural rights (2009), A Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association (2010) and a Working Group on the issue of discrimination against women in law and in practice (2010). The creation of new mandates contributes to the setting of new human rights standards since Special Procedures often take the lead in bringing attention to emerging human rights issues and identifying relevant standards. Most Special Procedures receive information on allegations of human rights violations from a variety of sources. When they receive complaints they may send urgent appeals or letters to the responsible Government requesting explanations or redress for a human rights violation. Any person can contact Special Procedures in relation to an alleged human rights violation in his or her country, irrespective of whether a country has ratified a human rights convention. It is also not necessary to exhaust domestic mechanisms (such as using the national court system) before contacting Special Procedures. Chapter four of this handbook discusses the submission of complaints to Special Procedures in more detail. In 2010, Special Procedures mandate-holders sent a total of 604 communications to Governments in 110 countries. Mandate holders, that is, individuals appointed to a Special Procedures mandate, also carry out fact-finding visits to countries to investigate the human rights situation at the national level. They typically send a letter to the Government requesting to visit the country, and if the Government agrees, an invitation to visit is issued. Some countries have issued \u201cstanding invitations\u201d to Special Procedures, which means that they are prepared to receive a visit from any Special Procedures mandate holder. In the Pacific, Vanuatu, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Palau and Papua New Guinea have all issued standing invitations to Special Procedures. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 25 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 24 Visits by Special Procedures to Pacific Island Countries UN Special Rapporteur on Toxic Waste 41 The Special Rapporteur\u2019s visit to the Marshall Islands in March 2012 focused on the impact of the United States nuclear testing between 1946 and 1958 on people\u2019s enjoyment of their human rights. In a press statement that concluded the visit, the Special Rapporteur found that the population remained negatively affected by the nuclear testing legacy through long-term health effects and continued displacement resulting in a loss of their indigenous way of life. The Special Rapporteur urged both the United States and the Marshall Islands Government to find effective redress for the affected population. The Special Rapporteur concluded his statement by saying: \u201cHuman rights are not meant to be a set of legal principles and rules on paper alone. They are a necessary requirement in an evolving reality. We must all continuously strive to meet this requirement to live with dignity and respect for ourselves and our future generations.\u201d42 UN Independent Expert on Foreign Debt 43 The Independent Expert visited the Solomon Islands and Australia in 2011 to investigate the impacts of the Solomon Islands\u2019 foreign debt burden and terms of trade in light of the global financial crisis. The Expert determined there was a critical need for a medium-term strategy to reduce aid dependency in order to realise human rights and ensure \u2018self-sustaining economic growth.\u2019 The Expert further recommended that a human- rights based approach be part of the foundation of Solomon Islands Government policies and aid programs. Further, Solomon Islands Government and aid agencies were urged to align objectives whereby the Government can take ownership of and account for the provision of public services and aid delivery. The Independent Expert also emphasised that aid should not be made contingent on policy reform or market protection.44 UN Special Rapporteur on Torture 45 The UN Special Rapporteur reported after his visit to Papua New Guinea in 2010 that he found a general atmosphere of violence and neglect in places of detention. He further documented isolated cases of torture as well as cases of police beatings upon arrest that may amount to torture. The Special Rapporteur noted that impunity for torture and ill-treatment was fuelled by the absence of a complaint mechanism, and a lack of independent investigations, monitoring, and other safeguards. He further noted the high prevalence of gender- based violence and women\u2019s vulnerability to sexual abuse in detention. The Special Rapporteur made a number of recommendations to the Government, which included issuing an unambiguous declaration at the highest level that torture and ill-treatment would not be tolerated; the ratification of the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol; the revision of domestic legislation to include", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template":

Two working groups screen and examine the complaints they receive. Following that screening, the working groups bring those that reliably document gross and consistent patterns of human rights violations to the attention of the Human Rights Council.

Why Implement Human Rights Treaties The Benefits of Implementing Human Rights Treaties I signed on behalf of the Republic of Palau all of the international conventions on human rights. As an ardent advocate of human rights and freedoms I signed these conventions because I believe that all human rights and freedoms are indispensable elements to true happiness. [\u2026] Ratification of these basic tenets of democratically recognized rights and freedom is, however, not enough. Governments must also adopt laws and policies implementing, enforcing and strengthening these human rights and freedoms. H.E. Johnson Toribiong, President, Republic of Palau.48 CEDAW enables the full and complete development of a country through maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields. Hon. Marcus Stephen, former President of Nauru.49 Human rights are essentially about people\u2019s dignity, their daily lives, their struggles, their sense of justice and injustice, their responsibility and care for others, and their well-being and prosperity. Human rights are about education, food, work, health, social security, about equal treatment, the expression of one\u2019s thoughts, the exchange and organization with others and \u2013 more generally \u2013 about the ability to find a remedy if one\u2019s rights are violated. Human rights are also about creating equitable societies and whether the poorest, the most discriminated against, and the most marginalized are able to lift themselves out of poverty and contribute to and shape the communities and societies to which they belong. In short, human rights are about development and about enabling every individual to use his or her potential to the fullest. Without a legal framework to protect these principles and guide development, there is a heightened risk of deprivation, social exclusion and marginalisation which, ultimately, could lead to an increase in discrimination and possibly even conflict. Human rights treaties provide a framework for Pacific societies to develop justly, equitably and prosperously. A just and efficient legal system, for example, which guarantees the rights without discrimination of any kind, such as by race, sex, language, religion, political or other status, is a prerequisite for economic growth. While development programs often focus on growth and macro-indicators, a human rights lens brings the advantage of focusing on the poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable members of societies to ensure the full participation of all people on an equal footing in the enjoyment of development. Pacific Islands Forum Leaders have adopted the vision of a peaceful, prosperous Pacific region where cultures and beliefs are upheld, resources managed in a sustainable manner, diversity is valued, and where democratic values and human rights are respected, for the benefit of all Pacific Islanders. They have further committed themselves to ratify and implement international human rights conventions, including under the UPR.50 As a result of these commitments, Vanuatu acceded to CAT in mid-2011, Nauru ratified the CEDAW convention in 2011 and CRPD in 2012, Palau signed up to eight core human rights treaties in September 2011, and the Federated States of Micronesia acceded to the Optional Protocol to the CRC on the sale of children, child prostitution, and child pornography in 2012. Last but not least, Pacific Island Forum countries have committed themselves to achieving the eight Millennium Goals, which are closely linked with human rights obligations (this is discussed further below). Despite these commitments and although several Pacific Island Countries have signed on or acceded to several treaties in 2011 and 2012 alone, the Pacific remains the region with the lowest number of ratified human rights treaties worldwide.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbda45ee-4859-484f-8fe7-55b50ef39c72": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbda45ee-4859-484f-8fe7-55b50ef39c72", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "bd90c4f11425c4974fe0f1d3f6ce3cbcc579c942173d8a1cc09a96c928b4fe5b"}, "2": {"node_id": "05871d21-867b-4538-bd64-3371da89b609", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "d39273a31afb30cf75ad5aa10b851c12a63f31ed52348408714d15bfd35392eb"}}, "hash": "092736dfc78f8940f0651feb3f0f60d59e19db294a62c0594d6b98bd050098cc", "text": "There are several reasons for this.

Last but not least, resistance has also been built on the perception that human rights clash with Pacific cultures (this will be explored further in this chapter). PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 31 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 30 Most of these challenges can be overcome with the assistance of the international community, regional bodies, and civil society organizations. This chapter will discuss the benefits of human rights treaty ratification and implementation for Pacific Island Countries and will illustrate how human rights treaties can play a central role as a guiding framework for achieving sustainable development, stability, and peace in the region. The Added Value of Human Rights Treaty Ratification and Implementation By ratifying human rights treaties, a country demonstrates its commitment to respect the human rights of its population and to be part of and support the values of the international community. The non-ratification of human rights treaties does not mean that there are wide-spread human rights violations in a country. Equally, in countries that have ratified all human rights conventions, challenges for people\u2019s enjoyment of their rights still remain. Nevertheless, human rights treaty ratification and implementation is widely seen as a key indicator of a country\u2019s willingness and commitment to uphold human rights and fundamental freedoms. Treaty ratification and subsequent implementation therefore assist the State in facilitating foreign policy achievements, enhances its credibility, and creates more opportunities for partnerships, including technical and financial support for human rights implementation. Limited availability of resources to implement human rights standards is often raised. There is no doubt that the implementation of human rights instruments requires resources. Resources are needed to train law enforcement officials, to initiate legislative amendments, to fulfil treaty reporting requirements, to gather statistics and data, and more broadly, for services in sectors such as health and education. But these costs are rarely additional costs that arise solely from human rights treaty implementation. Rather, they already arise due to existing legal requirements and because of national development plans and policies. Most Pacific Island Countries have a number of human rights enshrined in their own constitutions, including as separate bills of rights, which primarily reflect civil and political rights standards.51 The ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the Convention against Torture, therefore, would not necessarily lead to numerous new laws or policies that require new resources for implementation. The prohibition of torture, for example, already exists in ten countries that are members of the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat and judicial decisions from the region have upheld this prohibition.52 In addition, several countries have operationalized such legal provisions with the adoption of codes of conduct for law enforcement and prison officers.53 The ratification and implementation of these treaties would underscore a country\u2019s commitment and credibility towards the realization of these rights, including vis-\u00e0-vis the international community, and it would provide States with an opportunity to have their implementation reviewed and guided by independent experts. Sectoral reform processes, including in the justice and security sectors sector are underway in many Pacific Island Countries. These reform processes are opportunities to give effect to human rights standards at the country level. Incorporating human rights into these efforts bring the added benefit of aligning the on-going reform process with the human rights framework. Human rights in that context serve as a useful tool that guides and assists States in undertaking reforms and in giving effect to commitments and legal obligations. Similarly, with regard to economic, social, and cultural rights, Pacific Island Countries are engaged in numerous reform efforts to accelerate equitable development across the region. In most instances, these efforts are aimed at meeting targets set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which are aligned with human rights. Wealth is not a precondition for the implementation of basic human rights. Rather, human rights are the foundation on which Pacific societies will develop justly, equally and prosperously. Adopting economic, social, and cultural rights in law through treaty ratification, therefore, may not necessarily create new financial burdens, take away resources in short supply, or lead to a complete revision of existing plans or policies. Rather, adopting these rights as legal standards will provide a framework for guiding these efforts and bring the additional value of ensuring that development efforts address underlying root causes of poverty and deprivation, focus on the most vulnerable and marginalized, and provide for a remedy in cases of violation. Taking a human rights lens to development efforts makes sure that those are reached who tend to be left out by progress.

The Cost of Non-Implementation The resource burden of implementing human rights treaties should be seen in relation to the costs generated by human rights violations and lack of human rights protection. Studies have shown that there are direct social and economic costs associated with the non-implementation of human rights. These often go beyond the individual victim of a human rights violation and negatively impact on society and the country as a whole. The costs resulting from violence against women, for example, are both of direct and indirect nature and borne by society as a whole. The public sector bears the costs to provide survivors of violence with health-care services, such as surgery, x-rays, dental costs and doctors\u2019 fees. It also pays the salaries of community and welfare workers. And in addition, employers will be affected by losses resulting from a survivor\u2019s absence from work and decreased productivity resulting from violence.54 Costs are also generated by police who spend time investigating crimes of violence against women and costs from legal proceedings also are borne by the public. According to the University of the South Pacific, domestic violence in Fiji cost the country FJD$498 million in 2011.55 Studies from many countries provide sufficient evidence that the direct and indirect costs of violence against women and children are so significant that they negatively impact on a country\u2019s development. It has also been demonstrated that these costs far outweigh the costs of implementing rights-based initiatives such as prevention and protection programs and providing support services for victims.56 The Cost of Child Abuse and the Cost of Establishing a Child Protection System UNICEF commissioned a study to assess the economic impact of child abuse on Vanuatu\u2019s economy. The study calculated the costs of child abuse on the basis of an average estimated prevalence of 18-36%. In other words, the study is based on the estimate that 18-36% of all children in Vanuatu have been subject to abuse. In numbers, these are between 22,453 and 45,331 children who have experienced physical abuse (17%-48%), sexual abuse (15%-21%), and emotional abuse (21%-38%).57 The study took into account both direct (such as medical treatment) and indirect costs such as lifelong chronic health costs as well as productivity loss resulting from abuse. Overall, the study concluded that the annual cost of child abuse in Vanuatu amounted to 0.5% to 0.75% of the country\u2019s GDP, the equivalent of 293.8 million to 425.4 million Vatu every year (approximately US$ 3.1 million to US$ 4.5 million). The study contrasted the costs generated by child abuse with the costs of establishing a comprehensive child protection system. It concluded that the total cost to establish a child protection system would amount to about US$1.7 million.58 Another example of costs generated by the non-respect of human rights are abusive and unaccountable law enforcement agents. In addition to violations that individual victims experience as a result of abusive police conduct, if such conduct is common and not held accountable, it leads to public mistrust of law enforcement officials. With the loss of trust in police, for example, citizens are reluctant to cooperate, to report, or to prevent crime, which leads to an overall degradation of security and stability, and has potential knock-on effects on tourism, foreign investments, and on certain sectors of the economy, such as real estate markets. Such negative effects therefore go beyond the individual victim and can have an impact on the country and its economy as a whole.

The marginalization of youth, manifesting itself in high youth unemployment, and suicide rates in the Pacific has been mentioned in that context for example.59 These are only few examples of the costs generated by the non-implementation of human rights.

The Link between Human Rights and Development In September 2000, 189 world leaders, including those from Pacific Island Countries, committed themselves to reducing extreme poverty, achieving sustainable human development, and fully respecting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In an effort to translate these commitments into action, the international community signed up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) - a set of eight time-bound, quantifiable goals to be realized by 2015. While many countries in the Asia and Pacific region have made substantial progress towards achieving the MDGs over the past 3 years, others are still lagging behind and are struggling to achieve these goals. These include several countries in the Pacific where progress towards achievement of the MDGs has been uneven. To date, approximately nine Pacific Island Countries are off-track or slightly off-track when it comes to achieving at least half of the MDGs. In other words, unless a renewed effort is made, these countries are unlikely to reach the targets.60 Human Rights and MDGs have much in common. They share guiding principles such as participation, national ownership, empowerment, and they include reporting processes through which Governments can be held accountable. More fundamentally, they share the ultimate objective of promoting the human dignity of all people. The Pacific Plan\u2019s objectives are consistent with achieving the MDGs. The table below highlights the close link between human rights, MDGs, and the Pacific Plan\u2019s strategic objectives.61 MDGS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND THE PACIFIC PLAN MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS KEY RELATED HUMAN RIGHTS STANDARDS PACIFIC PLAN STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES Goal 1 Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 25(1); ICESCR article 11, CRPD article 28.

This initiative is supported by international donors and UNICEF Poverty is often a manifestation of exclusion, marginalization and discrimination and should not just be seen as a lack of resources. Bringing about equitable development therefore requires addressing these underlying causes of poverty and considering the poor as people with rights (rights-holders) and not just as individuals in need. Human rights bring the important added value of allowing for a focus on those who are subject to exclusion, on the obligations States have towards these groups, and thus allow for systematic responses in addressing poverty. Human rights represent legally binding obligations for Governments and therefore add an important element of accountability, as opposed to the MDGs, which are political commitments. Implementing human rights provides victims of human rights violations with a remedy for violations and an enforceable mechanism to hold States accountable. As such, they provide legal protections for people, including for the most vulnerable, and they empower and allow them to take action against marginalization and poverty. Ratifying and implementing human rights treaties therefore is essential for Pacific countries to achieve MDGs and sustainable and equitable development. The Link between Human Rights and Culture 62 Custom and human rights both concern rights. Human rights are understood to be the rights that are innate and inherent to each of us as individuals. Customary, traditional and cultural rights relate to our social mores as a distinct people of community. They include the ownership of the land and natural resources, folklore, traditional knowledge and social systems. Both these species of rights belong to us by virtue of who and what we are. It follows that we will need to balance them with each other, if we wish to derive benefit from both. Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, former Vice-President of Fiji In discussions about treaty ratification in the Pacific, human rights are sometimes viewed as a foreign concept with little relation to the realities in Pacific Island Countries, or worse, as a new concept that disregards or poses a threat to local tradition and culture. Discussions have also brought to the forefront resistance against the universal nature of human rights and arguments have been voiced that there are irreconcilable differences between Pacific cultural practices and human rights. Among others, these differences include freedom of expression for young people, which is seen as threatening traditional authority; the principle of equality between men and women; the notion of children as rights- holders; and more generally, the emphasis on the rights of individuals, which is seen as contrary to communal values and the important role of communities in the Pacific.63 Despite arguments pointing out differences between Pacific Island societies and some human rights principles and standards, there are important shared values and commonalities. In every society, irrespective of its culture and customary practices, people have a notion of respect for the dignity of other persons, and of justice and injustice within their community. Most also realize when State authorities are acting unjustly and have shown resolve in resisting abuse of power and injustice. And most, if not all, deeply care about their children\u2019s education, the wellbeing of their families and communities, their access to healthcare, and their ability to live in security, all of which are at the core of human rights.

They can thus serve as tools to reconcile cultural norms with fundamental human rights values. While human rights are universal in nature, their implementation can be done in different ways and there is no one-size-fits-all solution for their realization in a given society or context. Human rights norms therefore still provide space for customary values and traditions to continue to shape Pacific societies and identities in a distinct way. Cultures and traditional practices themselves are not static. Cultures evolve and have always evolved with new generations, adapting to changing times and circumstances, new influences and perspectives. Pacific societies, for example, have embraced Christianity in recent times, which have greatly shaped customary practices. The interpretation of culture and traditions in a community, furthermore, is not exclusive to one particular group, and different members of the same cultural community may interpret cultural values differently from one another, as the following examples show. The Convention for the Rights of the Child is much debated and [generates] very heated discussions in our country. I feel that at the start we should first of all look at the content of this convention, look at exactly what this convention says. Rather than looking at the convention and the content of the convention the debate is immediately thrust upon these words: \u2018Rights of the Child\u2019. And then we say \u2018a Samoan child does not have the right to do this or to do that\u2019. Whereas the convention itself speaks of rights that our children do have: the right to shelter, the right to education, the right to participate in a religion of choice. 64 Afioga Maiava Visekota Peteru, Solicitor, Samoa Customary values common among Pacific Island cultures include individual dignity and respect for others; values relating to sharing; love and caring for others; hospitality; reciprocity; and community decision-making. Distribution of wealth remains an important value in Pacific societies as are the contributions of everyone to the community and the entitlement of every community member to benefit, even if in reality some may benefit more than others. 65 The human rights that correspond to these customary values may be worded differently, but essentially they share the same aspirations. In human rights terms, these values correspond to the \u201cinherent dignity\u2026 of all members of the human family\u201d, and to equal rights and equal outcomes. Human rights therefore can lead to a social order in which customary values are more likely to be realized. 66 Human rights are sometimes portrayed as giving undue importance to individual rights, which is seen as being irreconcilable with cultural practices in the Pacific where the individual\u2019s duty to contribute to the community is often seen as central. Human rights law stresses not only rights but also the duties of individuals, very similar to custom. One person\u2019s right entails responsibilities towards other persons and the relationship between the individual and society therefore encompasses both rights and duties. And as outlined in chapter one of this handbook, rights entail duties and responsibilities and the rights of individuals may be lawfully curtailed to protect others.67 Even though a human right may be framed as the right of an individual, the pursuit of justice by a single person in many cases benefits an entire community. For example, an individual\u2019s fight for the revocation of a law that discriminates against members of his or her group is not an individual matter only but will benefit his or her group as a whole. An individual seeking to exercise a right therefore can act in the interest of an entire group or community. Changing Cultures in a Changing World For the people of Pacific Island Countries, the value of community structures in shaping identities and values remains strong and vibrant. At the same time, for a large percentage of the population, the challenges of living in a world in transition are increasing. Their identity is being shaped by the competing forces of culture, hierarchy, and tradition, and the growing influences of modernization, globalisation, and consumer culture. The Pacific region rightly boasts a rich cultural diversity and distinct practices that shape people\u2019s identities. At the same time, Pacific Island Countries are going through and bear the brunt of rapid economic transformation accelerated by globalization. These changes manifest themselves in the Pacific in rapid urbanization, internal and international migration, as well as environmental degradation and climate change. All of these factors will continue to change the ways in which communities and societies function. These factors will influence people\u2019s value systems, their way of organizing themselves, their customary practices, and the social safety nets for the most vulnerable.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0184ab3c-8746-4a20-8bb7-6d9e22ea47e8": {"__data__": {"id_": "0184ab3c-8746-4a20-8bb7-6d9e22ea47e8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "528dec2335cacbf699b71882e15db9bd579c21149401d7d4c191418689426888"}}, "hash": "528dec2335cacbf699b71882e15db9bd579c21149401d7d4c191418689426888", "text": "With a modern economy taking root in many places in the Pacific, and individual wealth being acquired on the basis of skills and accomplishments that are removed from the village and communal lands, customary practices, including the practice of individuals contributing to and sharing with the community are likely to undergo change. The risk for individuals to miss out on the social safety nets that traditionally could be relied upon might increase as a result. Human rights conventions can provide a valuable framework and act as a vehicle to steer development to provide safety nets for the most vulnerable, to enable dialogue, and to reconcile customary practices with human rights principles for the benefit of all members of society. Culture and Women\u2019s Rights In 2005, the traditional Malvatumauri (House of Chiefs) in Vanuatu, supported by church leaders, tried to pass a new custom law, a dress code restricting the right of ni-Vanuatu women to wear trousers, shorts, pants, or jeans, foreseeing fines and the killing of a pig as punishment for those who fail to abide by the law. The Vanuatu Women\u2019s Centre successfully challenged the code with a media campaign on the grounds that it was unconstitutional and against women\u2019s right to equality. 68 Twenty male advocates from Tonga completed training on women\u2019s rights by the Tonga Women and Children\u2019s Crisis Centre (WCCC) and the Fiji Women\u2019s Crisis Centre in 2010. The workshop sensitized participants about gender equality, the contributions by women to their families and communities, and the unacceptability of violence against women. It provided participants with skills to effectively advocate for gender equality and the elimination of violence against women. One of the participants was quoted as follows in a newspaper article about the workshop: \u201cMost of the duties that women do are not natural, they are a product of our culture. Men can clean the house, cook the food. The reality is we are using our culture to oppress women. Our job as male advocates is to make it clear that women can do everything men can do.\u201d It is widely acknowledged that Pacific communities continue to place high value on indigenous customs and traditions for guiding their daily lives. Traditional leaders derive their legitimacy, and therefore their authority, from their culture\u2019s customs. They command respect from their communities and can use this respect to mobilise communities around human rights issues such as HIV/AIDS, education, gender equality, matters affecting social welfare and other development issues. They can positively use their position of authority to bring about shifts in attitudes around the challenges their communities face, such as domestic violence (as the following example shows) or youth aspirations, by striking a healthy balance between tradition and modernity. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 39 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 38 Even though many cultural values in the Pacific embody human rights principles, as outlined in the introduction of this handbook, some practices in the Pacific are harmful or may reflect stereotypes that run counter to human rights and discriminate against or harm members of society, such as women, children or youth. In these instances, clarification on the acceptable limits of cultural practices and the harm they cause to individuals is necessary for the protection of a person\u2019s fundamental rights and dignity. Some of the Samoan practices need to be adapted to satisfy the requirements of the [Universal] Declaration of Human Rights. But I think most importantly that throughout the process of trying to adapt there\u2019s negotiation - negotiating the two sets of values wherever and whenever they contradict each other. Samoan custom and practices of course emerged and evolved in the context of our situation, and our immediate surroundings, and our resources at the time. And the Declaration of Human Rights is a document that grew out of certain circumstances in the history of the world. [\u2026] And if there is any negative practice of Samoan custom that does not cater for the best interests of human beings then we can look positively at the articles of the [Universal] Declaration of Human Rights and benefit from it because these people already had the experiences [\u2026]; although outside Samoa, Samoa can benefit from those examples in a positive way. [\u2026] A lot of things in our Samoan custom and culture are aimed at the wellbeing of the human being, of the Samoans, there\u2019s a lot of fairness in there. But no system is perfect, no-one is perfect - when we come to those things then we negotiate and adapt and move on.71 Lau Dr. Asofou So\u2019o, Director, Institute of Samoan Studies, National University", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f007d3b4-2558-4c5e-bfd4-56ec9ea7481e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f007d3b4-2558-4c5e-bfd4-56ec9ea7481e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "9d9ae74c66945420ec646cb47f97a53f832cc9f982c9b929f403a3636f64c4dd"}}, "hash": "9d9ae74c66945420ec646cb47f97a53f832cc9f982c9b929f403a3636f64c4dd", "text": "of Samoa. Many Pacific Island constitutions recognize customary law, which in some instances may give rise to tensions with human rights principles. Recognizing these potential tensions, Pacific Island Governments have affirmed the universal nature of human rights and committed themselves to protect and promote all human rights and fundamental freedoms regardless of their countries\u2019 cultural systems.72 In addition to the position taken by Pacific Island Governments, courts in the Pacific have also made decisions which bear upon the relationship between custom and human rights in a number of instances where the two appeared to be irreconcilable. Below are several examples of court decisions from the Pacific that demonstrate how judges in national courts have confirmed the existence or importance of customary practices while at the same time clarifying and reconciling the relationship between customary practices and human rights.73 Community Leaders Fight Against Child Abuse UNICEF Pacific has applied local advocacy strategies as a means to enhance child protection in Pacific Island Countries. It appointed child protection advocates and through meetings and workshops enhanced the understanding of child protection among community leaders and faith-based organizations. In addition, social welfare officers assisted leaders in identifying risks for children and in formulating appropriate responses. As a result of the community work and leaders\u2019 engagements, several villages in Fiji have banned corporal punishment of children in homes and communities. The chosen approach respected community protocols and decision-making processes and used tradition as an asset to realize human rights and improve children\u2019s safety and well-being. In addition to traditional leaders, many faith-based organizations participate in the promotion of human rights and endorse the notion of equality of dignity for all members of the community. They recognize the relevance of human rights messages in their daily work with families and communities. The right to education, the right to health, the right to marriage and family life, protection from violence, non-discrimination, and solidarity are values that are central to the communities and families faith-based organizations closely interact with. These human rights values resonate within the faith system itself. The experience of several UN agencies shows that the majority of faith-based representatives are receptive to human rights principles and interested in applying human rights based approaches in their community work. Church groups in the Pacific have taken vocal positions and have used the language of human rights to advocate on behalf of their communities.69 And as mentioned in the introduction section of this handbook, the early foundations of today\u2019s human rights are found in the world\u2019s major religions, including Christianity. Cultural Practices Contrary to Human Rights Principles Customary values should be seen as distinct from customary practices. In the Pacific as elsewhere, customary practices have changed over time and may in certain instances now be at odds with the underlying values. One case in point is the diminished status accorded to women in today\u2019s societies in the Pacific and the widespread prevalence of violence against women, which stands in contrast to the customary value of respect for every individual and the status historically accorded to women in the Pacific.70 Customary values are part of a community\u2019s underlying beliefs about what is good and right. Customary practices in contrast are habits performed to give effect to these values. Customary practices change over time (as evidenced by the arrival of Christianity and colonization), whereas customary values are more constant and express ideals or aspirations, but they are not necessarily lived up to in everyday life. That can mean that customary practices may differ significantly from one community to the next while the underlying customary value may be very similar. It also means that it is possible to initiate community dialogue to identify practices that are harmful and unhealthy so that they can be altered or abandoned without challenging the underlying customary values and weakening custom. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 41 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 40 Human Rights Protect Culture Last but not least, several human rights instruments uphold and protect cultural practices and their survival. By providing a framework for oversight of State action and use of State power and influence, human rights can be a forceful tool to protect individuals and communities with regards to their cultural rights. Both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights protect the right of everyone to participate in the cultural lives of their communities.

In addition, the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms indigenous peoples\u2019 contribution to the diversity of civilization and recognizes the urgent need to respect and promote indigenous knowledge, cultures and traditional practices, and it reaffirms the right of indigenous people to maintain and strengthen their distinct cultural institutions. The Link between Human Rights and Good Governance Good governance ensures that political, social and economic priorities are based on broad consensus in society, that the voices of all, including of marginalized and vulnerable groups, are heard in decision-making about the allocation of resources, and that those mandated to make decisions on behalf of others remain accountable. Good governance can be described as the exercise of authority through political and institutional processes that are transparent, accountable, and encourage public participation. Good governance has become a central part of the international development agenda and is seen as key for reform of the public sector. As defined by the UN, it contains the following characteristics.79 GOOD GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES Participation: All men and women should have a voice in decision-making, either directly or through legitimate intermediate institutions that represent their interests. Such broad participation is built on freedom of speech, as well as capacities to participate constructively. Rule of Law: Legal frameworks should be fair and enforced impartially, particularly laws protecting human rights. Transparency is built on the free flow of information. Processes, institutions and information are directly accessible to those concerned, and enough information is provided to understand and monitor these institutions and processes. Responsiveness: Good governance requires that institutions and processes aim to serve the needs of the people within a reasonable timeframe. Consensus oriented: Good governance mediates differing interests to reach a broad consensus on what is in the best interests of the group and, where possible, on policies and procedures. Equity and inclusiveness: A society\u2019s well-being depends on ensuring that all its members feel that they have a stake in it and do not feel excluded from the mainstream of society. This requires that all groups, but particularly the most vulnerable, have opportunities to improve or maintain their well-being. Effectiveness and efficiency: Processes and institutions produce results that meet the needs of society while making the best use of resources at their disposal. The concept of efficiency in the context of good governance also covers the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment. Accountability: Decision-makers in Government, the private sector and civil society organizations are accountable to the public, as well as to institutional stakeholders. Who is accountable to whom varies depending on whether decisions or actions taken are internal or external to an organization or institution. In general an organization or an institution is accountable to those who will be affected by its decisions or actions. Accountability cannot be enforced without transparency and the rule of law. Strategic vision: Leaders and the public have a broad and long-term perspective on good governance and human development, along with a sense of what is needed for such development. There is also an understanding of the historical, cultural and social complexities in which that perspective is grounded. In Loumia v. Director of Public Prosecution in the Solomon Islands, the defendant justified the killing of three persons on the grounds that according to Kwaio custom, the defendant had a legal duty to kill the victims as a revenge for the killing of a relative. Even though the Solomon Islands constitution recognizes customary law, the Court of Appeal held that the custom that called for the killing of a person was inconsistent with the right to life provision in the Constitution and therefore not part of Solomon Islands law.74 In Lafaialii & Others v Attorney General & Others, the Samoa Supreme Court examined the constitutional right of freedom of religion in light of customary exclusion practices at the village level. The Supreme Court held that the actions by the Village Council prohibiting a bible class, dismantling the building where classes were held, and banishing four of the families attending bible classes from the village, were unconstitutional and in violation of religious freedom. The Court noted the contributions of the Village Council towards peace and harmony within the village but determined it did not have the authority to banish the families because of their religious belief, and called on the Council to show tolerance and respect for other religious beliefs. The Court reasoned that societies were not at a standstill and for them to survive required adaptation to changing circumstances, as well as tolerance towards legitimate situations and ideas that arise from time to", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f3fedfb6-2fad-405a-8bf1-6ca18b7eec41": {"__data__": {"id_": "f3fedfb6-2fad-405a-8bf1-6ca18b7eec41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "19afc99b836d3b48c52aa4a0b970242d8a0d50f3f260761fa8b76cc072300850"}}, "hash": "19afc99b836d3b48c52aa4a0b970242d8a0d50f3f260761fa8b76cc072300850", "text": "time. The Court also noted that religious persecution has resulted in misery and suffering.75 This case informed Teonea v Pule o Kaupule of Nanumaga in the Tuvalu Court of Appeal in which the court considered the right to freedom of religion and the right of customary authority to preserve Tuvaluan Culture. The case went to court following the decision of Nanumaga Island assembly of elders (Falekaupule) to ban the Brethren church from seeking converts. The banning followed an earlier resolution in which the elders decided not to allow any new faith to establish itself on the island in order to strengthen \u201csocial structure, traditions, peace and order.\u201d The court decision held that restrictions on rights for the purpose of preserving tradition needed to be reasonably justifiable and proportionate to the purpose. Curtailing religious freedom in this case was not a reasonably justifiable way to preserve culture since there are less restrictive means for achieving the purpose of cultural preservation. When arguing legitimate purpose for curtailing rights, the less extreme measures for preserving culture should be pursued.76 In the decision Yongo Mondo, a Papua New Guinea woman had been held in a corrective institution and served an 84 week sentence by the village court for failing to pay compensatory bride price after leaving her husband. The National Court held that even though the village court had the authority to order imprisonment, the woman\u2019s detention was unlawful and inconsistent with the Papua New Guinea Constitution which provides that no one shall be deprived of liberty except under certain conditions. Failure to pay bride price is not one of the exceptions.77 In The State v. Kule the defendant pleaded that the handing over of his daughter to the relatives of the person he killed unlawfully should be considered as a mitigating factor. The Papua New Guinea National Court, however, considered the practice of handing over a child as similar to slavery, contrary to the welfare of the child, and prohibited by the country\u2019s constitution, despite the fact that such practice was common.78 Resistance towards the concept of equality among men and women, freedom of religion, and the consideration of children as individual rights-holders can sometimes be attributed to misunderstandings, including the notion that human rights have nothing in common with traditional values. In other instances, resistance can be attributed to those who invoke cultural traditions to defend positions of power and who benefit from prevailing power structures and limited accountability. Governments, civil society actors, and community members have important roles in promoting better understanding of human rights and the law among the population. Doing so will encourage greater awareness about human rights as well as increased participation in political, social, and development processes that affect them. With a better understanding of the meaning and values of human rights, as well as their commonalities with cultural values, a culture of human rights that is not perceived as a threat to tradition is able take root. This will allow societies and culture to adapt to changing times and to thrive for the benefit of all members of society. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 43 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 42 Civil Society Demands Participation and Consultation on Vanuatu\u2019s WTO Accession In the lead up to Vanuatu\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), civil society organizations, the Churches, local communities, and business representatives formed a coalition and launched a vocal campaign demanding full information, consultation, and a meaningful dialogue with the Government over the country\u2019s WTO accession. As in their view their demands were not being answered by the Government the coalition decided to put additional pressure with a planned peaceful rally against the Government\u2019s decision to join the WTO. The Government banned the rally on the grounds of security, and arguing that it was unacceptable to demonstrate against an elected Government that decided for the country to join the WTO. Civil society organizations in response maintained that free speech was more important than free trade.81 The Link between Human Rights, Peace, and Security Without respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, the attainment of sustainable peace remains illusory. National security and stability cannot be achieved without respect for individual security in the form of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. There are many instances in which oppression has led to gross violations of human rights, resulting in conflicts, displacement, refugee movements, and human suffering. Achieving political stability and peace remains a challenge in several Pacific Island Countries that experience repeated power struggles within Governments, which are often linked to economic benefits.

For example, in cases where underlying patterns of discrimination or violence against minority groups are not dealt with, the risk of renewed conflict remains. Conflicts cannot be prevented or stability maintained in a place with serious human rights violations. Power struggles and conflicts in the Pacific have had impacts on the realisation of human rights including economic and social rights. Discrimination and lack of opportunities for minority ethnic groups in several Pacific Island Countries have manifested themselves in direct expressions of violence resulting in the closing down of small businesses or industries in the Pacific, which further exacerbated the denial of rights. The absence of accessible and effective complaints and redress mechanisms for human rights violations further have contributed to people resorting to violence. A human rights lens allows also for a stronger emphasis on the rights of groups that are marginalized and discriminated against, and it provides a framework for addressing the underlying or root causes of inequalities and tensions. The principle of non-discrimination and equality in human rights law in particular enables one to strive for more equitable societies. The advancement of human rights, including through treaty implementation, therefore, provides an important framework to eliminate patterns of discrimination and to achieve equality and stability in the Pacific. The protection of human rights and the securing of peace is sometimes seen to be at odds with each other. In contexts where powerful figures who have committed human rights abuses are in a position to significantly alter or end a conflict, the prospect of reaching a peace agreement expediently can be diametrically opposed to the principles of accountability. In the interest of securing peace and ending violence, dealing with human rights abuses committed during the conflict is sometimes undermined through amnesty provisions for those responsible, in the interest of putting the past behind. Even though the context and timing of dealing with past abuses is critical and there is no general rule on when the context and timing is right, the ignoring of abuses for the expediency of reaching a peace agreement risks generally undermining respect for human rights and the sustainability of peace.82 Implementing human rights treaties introduces mechanisms of accountability, transparency, participation and responsiveness, which all contribute to the realization of good governance. Hence, good governance and human rights are mutually reinforcing. For example, reporting to human rights Treaty Bodies requires States to publicly explain their efforts and achievements in implementing a treaty. And that includes, as explained in the first chapter, an account of how rights are respected, protected, and fulfilled. These reports are public and subject to scrutiny not only by the international expert body (Treaty Body) but also by civil society organizations and the larger population. In preparation of reports, civil society and members of the community can engage with Governments, submit additional information to the Government, or they may choose to submit alternative information to the Treaty Body (a procedure discussed in more detail in chapter four of this handbook). After a State\u2019s review by the Treaty Body, civil society and other stakeholders can contribute to Government accountability by disseminating the outcome of the State\u2018s review, and by advocating and cooperating with the Government in the full implementation of all human rights provisions. States parties\u2019 actions thus become open to scrutiny both by their population and by the international community with the ultimate aim of encouraging and assisting the State to implement fully its obligations under human rights conventions. Human rights treaty reporting and implementation therefore positively contribute to a State\u2019s transparency and accountability record, as well as the State\u2019s compliance with human rights more broadly. In the Pacific, awareness about human rights and what these rights mean for individuals has resulted in more questioning of authority and more participation in decision-making both within communities and at the national level. A culture of human rights encourages people to question authorities, and to take steps to eliminate patterns of inappropriate conduct whether it is the abuse of public office, the misuse of traditional authority, the lack of consultation and information, or the introduction of barriers that inappropriately limit access to public services. With people more readily seeking answers from their leaders and elected officials, a culture of human rights can gradually take root.

The Attorney General initiated proceedings in the High Court against the Members of Parliaments, and the matter had been referred to the Parliamentary House Committee. In October 2009, the High Court found that Members of the Parliamentary Entitlement Commission had acted beyond their powers and quashed the allowances. It its judgement the court noted: \u201cIn view of the blatant errors committed in the decision making process, which would have been sufficient alone, but noting also the public furore over these Regulations, the only proper thing to do in the circumstances is to order that they be quashed with immediate effect.\u201d80 A vibrant human rights culture makes Governments more responsive for the public good. This also means that Governments are more likely to ensure that a country\u2019s resources (which are to benefit its people), are utilised properly, in a sustainable manner, and for the benefit of the community. This requires an empowered and alert citizenry that is ready and willing to hold those in authority to account and it also requires the protection and respect for key human rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom of assembly. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 45 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 44 CHAPTER 3 \u2013 HOW TO IMPLEMENT HUMAN RIGHTS TREATIES? How to Implement Human Rights Treaties? How Can Pacific Island Countries Implement Human Rights Treaties? Signing a Human Rights Treaty When a Pacific Island Country decides to ratify a treaty, the first formal step is to sign it. Signing a treaty indicates an intention and commitment to ratify. Conventions are typically signed first by a member of the Executive, for example the President, Prime Minister or a Foreign Minister. The time lapse between signature and ratification gives the State an opportunity to consider how in practical and concrete terms it will implement the rights in the treaty for its people. That time lapse could include a preliminary analysis of the national legislation and current practice in relation to a treaty, which would enhance understanding of the areas that will require action. This time lapse also allows for national decision making and consultation processes to take place, including, where required, subsequent ratification by Parliament or passing of enabling legislation. A State that signs a human rights convention is not legally bound by its provisions. However, a signature creates an obligation on a country to refrain in good faith from acts that would defeat the purpose of the convention. Once the treaty is ratified it becomes legally binding on the State. Accession or Ratification The difference between ratification and accession is procedural, not substantive, and both have the same effect: States become legally bound by the treaty\u2019s provisions. Ratification follows signature as the second step of a two-step procedure \u2013 accession combines the two steps in one. The initial decision to ratify a human rights treaty is typically made by Cabinet which can then task a particular Ministry or department with the ratification process. In some Pacific Island Countries, the Parliament needs to endorse treaty ratification.83 In others, the Executive \u2013 the Government in power - can ratify international agreements. Generally, it is advisable that ratification is preceded by consultations across Government departments, with Parliament, civil society, and the public. Full consultation prior to ratification encourages public support and better understandings of the obligations generated through ratification. Pacific Island Countries that intend to ratify a human rights treaty can ask for assistance from regional and international organizations. UN agencies in the Pacific (including the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); UNDP, UNICEF, and UN Women) can provide technical assistance to Pacific Island Countries. In addition, the Regional Rights Resource Team with SPC (SPC RRRT) provides trainings for Government and civil society on human rights treaties. It is also possible to invite Treaty Body expert members for technical assistance missions to a country that is taking steps towards ratification of a particular treaty. Reservations and Declarations States that ratify a human rights treaty may put reservations on one or several provisions of a given treaty. By doing so, States signal that they are generally willing to implement a treaty, but reserve the right not to be legally bound by one or several provisions on which", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b147ce04-4699-4815-b210-4b21eb651a60": {"__data__": {"id_": "b147ce04-4699-4815-b210-4b21eb651a60", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "2100d8a82743e65ad2857c99f840f0f151ec4f1719e38b8408b545994d18c925"}}, "hash": "2100d8a82743e65ad2857c99f840f0f151ec4f1719e38b8408b545994d18c925", "text": "reservations have been made. A reservation therefore is a formal declaration that the State considers itself not bound by one or several articles of the treaty. States are always encouraged to ratify treaties without reservations. In some cases, however, a reservation may enable a State to participate in an international treaty in which it would otherwise be unable or unwilling to do so. It is perhaps of higher interest to have States ratify with a reservation (and work towards removing it) than not at all. Sometimes a State will lodge a reservation because it feels that the implementation of that particular article requires additional time or consultation. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 47 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 46 States are bound by limitations when it comes to making reservations. Reservations that are \u201cincompatible with the object and purpose of that treaty\u201d are not allowed.84 Other States can also object to a reservation and the Treaty Body itself will also consider any reservations made by States. States may withdraw reservations any time. Withdrawals must be formulated in writing, and signed by the Head of State, Head of Government, Minister of Foreign Affairs, or the person having powers for such purposes. Treaty Bodies consistently urge States to review existing reservations and to take steps to remove them. States may also submit declarations when ratifying or acceding to a treaty. These declarations reflect a State\u2019s interpretation of a particular provision in a treaty. Declarations do not modify the legal effects of a treaty but seek to clarify the State\u2019s understanding of certain provisions. Cook Islands Reservation (and subsequent withdrawal) on CEDAW On 30 July 2007, following its first review by the CEDAW Committee, the Government of Cook Islands notified the Secretary-General of its decision to withdraw the reservations made upon accession to the convention. The reservation read as follows: \u201cThe Government of the Cook Islands reserves the right not to apply the provisions of Article 11 (2) (b). The Government of the Cook Islands reserves the right not to apply the provisions of the convention in so far as they are inconsistent with policies relating to recruitment into or service in: (a) The armed forces which reflect either directly or indirectly the fact that members of such forces are required to serve on armed forces aircraft or vessels and in situations involving armed combat; or (b) The law enforcement forces which reflect either directly or indirectly the fact that members of such forces are required to serve in situations involving violence or threat of violence. The Government of the Cook Islands reserves the right not to apply Article 2 (f) and Article 5 (a) to the extent that the customs governing the inheritance of certain Cook Islands chiefly titles may be inconsistent with those provisions.\u201d A Guide to Translate CEDAW into Law in the Pacific UNDP Pacific Centre and UNIFEM published in 2007: \u201cTranslating CEDAW into Law: CEDAW Legislative Compliance in Nine Pacific Island Countries\u201d. The publication contains an analysis of domestic legislative compliance with the CEDAW Convention in nine Pacific Island Countries. To assess compliance, 113 legislative indicators were developed, which provide an overview of required legal reform at the country level. The review sets out a road map for legislative reform in each of the Pacific Island Countries to facilitate the implementation of CEDAW and has been widely used by Governments and non-governmental organizations to advance legislative reform in the area of women\u2019s rights. Implementing Human Rights Treaties As detailed in chapter one of this handbook in the section that defines human rights, States parties to human rights treaties are bound by a three-fold obligation to respect, protect and fulfil human rights provisions contained in a treaty. After ratification, a State is legally bound by the treaty\u2019s provisions and must take measures to implement the treaty. Implementation means taking actions to realize treaty provisions such as through the adoption of policies, laws, regulations, or the allocation of resources. This therefore includes legislative and administrative measures, as well as judicial implementation. A typical process to implement a treaty is to review and analyse existing laws, policies, and practices that impact on the enjoyment of relevant rights, and to then develop necessary actions that will give full effect to treaty provisions. Legislative Implementation One of the first implementation steps that States parties should consider taking is a review of their Constitution and national laws to assess if, and to what degree, a country\u2019s laws comply with a human rights treaty.

Legislative compliance with human rights treaties is best achieved when the State adopts an on-going and systemic approach to the implementation of required reforms. Legal reform will not automatically ensure that all rights contained in a treaty are fully enjoyed by all persons. Nevertheless, ensuring that the national legislative framework complies with human rights standards is central in achieving this goal. Without the necessary laws in place, the chances to fully realize human rights are slim because people lack legal protection for their rights and are therefore unable to seek redress for violations of their rights. Legislative reform is necessary to achieve de jure compliance with a treaty. De jure compliance means that the laws of a country comply with the provisions of a particular treaty. De jure compliance is different from de facto compliance. De facto compliance is achieved when the rights of a treaty are being enjoyed in reality, in addition to a compliant legal framework. Laws and regulations are in themselves not sufficient to guarantee the exercise of human rights and States therefore are advised to consistently monitor the implementation of laws and the extent to which rights are being enjoyed by the people and to take corrective action, if necessary. Monitoring and documentation of people\u2019s enjoyment of rights by civil society and National Human Rights Institutions are crucial to identify gaps in treaty implementation. Such activity can help guide the State in addressing critical gaps including through additional legislative amendments, where warranted. PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 49 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 48 Examples of Pacific Court Rulings with Explicit Reference to Human Rights Treaty Provisions Civil and Political Rights In Fangupo v Rex, the Tonga Court of Appeal in 2010 pronounced its views on whether the sentence of whipping was lawful in Tonga. Although the Court was not tasked to make a ruling on the legality of whipping, it made the observation that whipping and flogging constituted cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment. It referred to the UN Convention against Torture as well as case-law from the European Court of Human Rights, the UN Human Rights Committee and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The Court of Appeal further observed that the prohibition against torture was part of customary international law from which States cannot derogate, and whether Tonga had ratified the Convention against Torture therefore made no difference. 90 In State v Boila, the Fiji High Court in a 2004 issued a ruling that had to consider the danger two criminal suspects posed to the public and their right not to be held in inhuman and degrading conditions while awaiting their trial. In its judgement the court referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and political Rights, the Convention against Torture and case law by the European Court of Human Rights. It concluded that the right of every person in Fiji to be treated with dignity is an inalienable right and that inhuman and degrading conditions could not be justified by the lack of resources.91 Examples of Pacific Court Rulings with Explicit Reference to Human Rights Treaty Provisions Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights In PAFCO Employees Union v Pacific Fishing Company Ltd., the Fiji High Court enforced in 2002 an Arbitration Tribunal decision that the dismissal of 57 employees was unlawful and that the workers had to be re-employed. In its decision, the High Court referred to the Constitutional right of workers to organize and bargain collectively, and the guarantee for redress if any rights are violated. The court further referred to article 8 (on trade unions) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights in its ruling.96 In Kambu v Lus, the National Court of Papua New Guinea considered the case of 946 West Papuan refugees who faced eviction from their settlement by a private land owner. Referring to both the Refugee Convention and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights\u2019 provisions on housing, the court held that the request for eviction would not be granted as long as the Government failed to provide an alternative place for them to settle.97 In Noel v Toto the Vanuatu Supreme Court in 1995 referred to the non-discrimination provision in the Constitution as well as Vanuatu\u2019s ratification of CEDAW to enforce women\u2019s economic rights. The court held that custom used as the basis of ownership of land is subject to the constitutional provision on non-discrimination.

The relationship between international and national law in a given country is governed by its Constitution. The Constitutions of Fiji, Tuvalu, and Papua New Guinea allow courts to refer to human rights conventions as guidance in their decision- making, even if the country has not ratified the convention.85 The Samoa Supreme Court ruled in Wagner v. Radke that human rights conventions can guide judicial decision-making even if Samoa is not a party to a particular treaty.86 Where countries have ratified human rights treaties, the courts are bound to make rulings that are consistent with the treaty provisions.87 The Supreme Court of Vanuatu, for example, referred directly to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Molu v. Molu, 88 stating that \u201c\u2026Vanuatu is bound by virtue of its ratification in 1992.\u201d The following table provides additional case law (or jurisprudence) from Pacific courts in which judges referred to human rights law in their decision-making.89 The overwhelming number of Constitutions in the Pacific guarantee only civil and political rights.92 One exception is the 1997 Constitution of Fiji, which contains a very limited number of provisions on economic, social, and cultural rights.93 The absence of economic, social, and cultural rights provisions in Pacific Island Countries\u2019 constitutions reflect the historic context in which these Constitutions have been drafted and specifically the colonial domination prior to the drafting process. The sections on rights and freedoms in Pacific Island Countries\u2019 constitutions were primarily modelled on former colonial powers\u2019 laws which lacked provisions on economic, social, and cultural rights.94 Although the question of whether economic, social, and cultural rights are or should be justiciable (enforceable in court) remains a subject of debate, many Constitutions globally incorporate economic, social, and cultural rights provisions and courts around the world have upheld and enforced the binding nature of these rights.95 Among them are courts in the Pacific as these examples show: PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 51 PACIFIC HANDBOOK ON HUMAN RIGHTS TREATY IMPLEMENTATION 50 Administrative Implementation Measures Establishing an Intra-Governmental Body Implementing human rights treaties at the national level requires a concerted and coordinated effort. In some countries, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs takes the lead in treaty implementation with the support of human rights focal points in all relevant line Ministries. In others, it might be more appropriate for a particular line Ministry to take the lead, especially if the content of that treaty matches with the work of that Ministry. While recognizing that most Pacific Island Countries face the challenge of limited resources and staff, one way of ensuring coordination and effectiveness is by setting up an inter-ministerial body to coordinate human rights treaty implementation efforts, including the submission of reports. Such a body would ensure that treaty implementation remains an on-going process and is not only on the agenda the year a country has to submit a report. To speed up work and decision-making on a particular issue, task forces or sub-committees with smaller memberships and delegated authority can be set up under the body. Intra-Governmental Treaty Implementation Mechanisms in the Pacific Papua New Guinea established a Human Rights Forum in 2011 as a permanent mechanism that monitors and takes action on human rights implementation at the national level, including through treaty reporting. The Forum\u2019s objectives are to take stock of human rights developments, challenges, and propose a way forward; to determine strategic priorities to advance human rights; to mainstream human rights in all programmes and projects; and to strengthen Government accountability for human rights implementation. The Forum\u2019s membership is broad and includes representatives from the Executive (line Ministries including Justice, Foreign Affairs and Trade, Community Development, Police), the Correctional Service, Defence Forces, the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Prime-Minister\u2019s Office; representatives from National Institutions (Ombudsman and Law Reform Commission); as well as civil society organizations, human rights defenders, and UN agencies and donors. The Forum may set up task forces or working groups on specific human rights issues. The Forum meets on a quarterly basis and is chaired by the Secretary of the Justice Department and the Attorney General, with the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights acting as a co-chair.", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8bc582f5-9b36-494e-ba01-8dfa6821e20c": {"__data__": {"id_": "8bc582f5-9b36-494e-ba01-8dfa6821e20c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "71188c8aa995fa44bcbf0ac954dab2d153590a8c6029ac2cb7c71c0efb20a2ab"}, "2": {"node_id": "233668e2-fb9c-47b0-bad4-2981c63d41a5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "096e9a766f59ae0f78f195e596bc6dd59a46fa14482f3c2a95db2edab99bb0d3"}}, "hash": "f3d3231cf1742c73b62b5e5b19743d6518cad0c608543fc138144f1bf7a8f568", "text": "The Republic of the Marshall Islands\u2019 Resource Development Committee is mandated to implement the CRC and CEDAW Conventions (the two human rights conventions ratified by the Marshall Islands) through legislative reform, by establishing relevant mechanisms,", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "765a62e4-3c9a-4989-8418-ed016ea692b0": {"__data__": {"id_": "765a62e4-3c9a-4989-8418-ed016ea692b0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "Pacific Handbook on Human Rights Treaty Implementation", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"Title_URL": "https://www.undp.org/asia-pacific/publications/pacific-handbook-human-rights-treaty-implementation", "Author": "United Nations Development Programme", "Publisher": "United Nations Development Programme", "Type": "Report"}, "hash": "7a09500669bf28a757a6a77925e86a22eaac6979d0b3557f28128fac2de7836d"}}, "hash": "7a09500669bf28a757a6a77925e86a22eaac6979d0b3557f28128fac2de7836d", "text": "through advice to Cabinet, and by mainstreaming the rights of women and children into sectoral strategies. The Committee is further tasked to ensure the timely submission of State reports on human rights treaties and to advocate for sufficient human and financial resources for the implementation of international human rights conventions. It is chaired by the country\u2019s Chief Secretary and comprises members at the Director or Secretary level from across Government including all relevant line Ministries, the Attorney General, the Police Commissioner, and the Public Defender. The Committee further includes several representatives from civil society organizations and church groups. The Resource Development Committee has been instrumental in organizing consultations ahead of the Marshall Islands\u2019 review under the Universal Periodic Review. 99 Another option for Pacific Island Countries would be to strengthen existing and functioning intra-governmental bodies by expanding their mandate and adding treaty reporting and implementation, including reporting, to their list of on-going duties. Much of the information required for human rights treaty reporting is similar to that required for MDGs progress reports, the Universal Period Review, and reporting under ILO Conventions. An inter-ministerial body could reasonably be tasked to take on all of these reporting obligations. Having the same body in charge of all human rights-related reporting and implementation processes streamlines the tasks, ensures coordination, and avoids duplication. Ministries and departments that should be involved in an inter-ministerial mechanism on human rights treaty implementation are: foreign affairs, justice, and other relevant line Ministries; planning, finance, the Attorney General\u2019s and the Statistics Offices. In addition, membership should go beyond the executive branch of Government and also include Members of Parliament and civil society. The exact nature of membership and cooperation with non-governmental stakeholders is to be decided at the national level. A permanent body facilitates a continuous exchange of relevant information within the Government, and between Government and civil society. Irrespective of the model Pacific Island Countries may choose, there should be support, political clout and endorsement for such a mechanism from senior Government officials in order to ensure commitment, and the allocation of staff from all relevant ministries. One way of ensuring this political clout could be that the inter-ministerial body is chaired by a senior official. Gathering Data and Information The lack of reliable information and statistics on human rights is a real challenge in many Pacific Island Countries. Relevant data may be limited, outdated, or sometimes non-existent. Civil society has limited capacity in undertaking documentation and monitoring work in most Pacific Island Countries, and National Statistical Offices and line Ministries tend to be under-resourced. In addition, large percentages of the population live in remote areas where little data collection takes place. Data required for human rights reporting needs to be sufficiently disaggregated to reflect the situation of various groups within a country. Without such information, it is hard to determine and monitor progress with regard to national developments and human rights treaty implementation. Formulating human rights policies and reporting to human rights Treaty Bodies becomes more difficult in such circumstances. No single department or Ministry tends to be able to gather all relevant information and data to reflect the extent to which a human rights treaty has been implemented. This constraint underscores the importance of establishing an inter- ministerial mechanism to ensur
